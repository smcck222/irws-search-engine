FT  17 JUL 93 / Laying down their lives for the UN: Dominic Lawson says the
idea of international armies is fundamentally flawed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCCASIONALLY in cricket, and even more occasionally in soccer, a team is put
into the field under the title 'Rest of the World.' Usually such a team
plays a national side. On paper the national side does not stand a chance.
In practice the Rest of the World tends to lose.
It is necessary to witness such matches to understand the reason for this
triumph of the underdog. Then you will see the Rest of the World batsmen
giving up their wickets without the grim struggle that such players would
normally offer. And the Rest of the World bowlers seem unprepared to deliver
their most hostile bouncers.
The point is, they are not playing for their own country, while their
opponents are. The pride and motivation of patriotism is lacking in the one
side, but is galvanising the other.
It is this phenomenon which is dogging the United Nations' various efforts
to enforce the peace in different parts of the world. Indeed, it points to a
weakness in the very idea of a UN military force in sustained combat. As
reports in Wednesday's Financial Times made clear, a number of national
units within the UN force in Somalia are refusing to obey the orders of UN
commanders to take part in attacks on General Aideed's militia. The
Italians, in particular, who were the colonial power in the region, have
virtually downed arms.
It ill suits a man sitting at a word processor in London to accuse Italian
soldiers of cowardice, particularly when such soldiers are confronted with a
vicious guerrilla force which only a month ago killed and then dismembered
24 of the Pakistani contingent in the UN force. But I am sure that when the
Italian army of the 1930s enforced Italian rule over Somalia, they would not
have shirked such a challenge.
The Italian soldier will, if necessary, risk his life for his country. But
does the same Italian soldier want to risk his life for the UN, that
amorphous mess of squabbling diplomats and politicians too inept to hold
high office in their own countries?
The same thought has dogged the member states of the UN as they attempt to
impose a civilised solution on the war in Bosnia. Despite a number of
attempts, notably by the Americans, to introduce the idea of a multinational
force to enforce a peace in the Balkans, nothing has been done.
The field marshals and generals of the European armies have told the
politicians that they cannot expect their troops to risk massive casualties
in pursuit of an objective so remote and incomprehensible.
Moslems will fight to the death to save their land from Serbian ethnic
cleansers. It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect British squaddies to
fight with the same passion on such a battlefield, heroic as such men have
been in their much more limited role of ensuring the delivery of food
and medicine to the besieged Moslems.
A number of people, who might loosely be described as Euro-gullibles, have
argued that the failure of European policy in Bosnia is to be blamed on the
absence of a fully integrated European military strategy. They are the same
people who are enthusiastic about the provisions in the Maastricht Treaty
for a common European defence policy and, ultimately, for a standing
European army.
But it seems to me that such a force, even if it could be achieved
politically, would in practice fall victim to exactly the problems now
confronting the UN in Somalia. Would an Italian contingent of a European
army in Bosnia be
any more willing to take on General Mladic's Serbian
regulars than it has been to take on General Aideed's Somali irregulars?
The Italians are among the most enthusiastic proponents of the European
ideal, but they are not lemmings. And what of our British troops, with their
unparalleled tradition of national defence? Would they find 'Delors and EC'
a rallying cry as stirring as 'Queen and country'?
It is true that the UN has enjoyed some military successes in the Middle
East recently, and has thus reduced Saddam Hussein to a problem of what the
military call containable proportions. But these were essentially US
actions; they succeeded because that great country perceived its own vital
interests to be threatened, and had - has  - the forces to defend them.
During the first world war, Wilfred Owen described Dulce et decorum est pro
patria mori as 'the old lie.' Perhaps; but how much less sweet it is to die
for the general assembly of the UN.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Private View: Why Labour's loyal baron is in revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Edmonds is a trade union baron who counts himself a moderniser. But
this week the general secretary of the GMB was beginning to look like the
biggest obstacle to the modernisation of the Labour Party.
The word 'modernisation' begs the question. Yet Edmonds is in a curious
position. After a year-long review of the trade unions' role in the party,
he finds himself at odds with John Smith, the Labour leader (and a
GMB-sponsored MP). For the head of a moderate union which has traditionally
provided block-vote ballast for pragmatic party leadership, he is taking an
unusually aggressive, unnaturally left-wing, line.
His deputy, Tom Burlison, is party treasurer and a member of the
constitutional review committee which on Wednesday gave tacit assent to a
plan for reform. The same day Edmonds was harangued by Labour MPs for his
intransigence.
The reforms go before the party's national executive on Monday and to the
party conference in the autumn. The GMB is happy to see affiliated unions'
monolithic voting power at party conferences reduced. It is happy to see
their vote exercised in a way that more distinctly reflects the wishes of
individual members who have paid the union's political levy to support
Labour. It will not, however, accept the abolition of the block vote in
local selection of parliamentary candidates, on the grounds that would
disenfranchise levy-payers.
So much for the arithmetic. But wasn't this dispute really about something
much deeper? I asked Edmonds.
'Many people suspect it's about a much bigger issue. The reason why there's
been such a strong reaction against the proposals from constitituency
parties is the suspicion that the gurus, the party strategists, are trying
to distance the party from the trade unions.'
The unwritten script of the modernisers says Labour's affiiliated unions are
an electoral liability and the party must disengage.
'There is just no evidence for that,' he said. 'According to recent polls,
unions are more popular than they have been for a generation. And the idea
of blaming them for the last election defeat is bizarre. We kept so far out
of the limelight during the last election that the Scarlet Pimpernel would
have been proud of us.'
But if you aren't a liability, why do you keep a low profile?
'Because we are asked to do so by that element, the spin-doctors if you
like, who think we're an electoral liability.'
Then why did you give in to the spin-doctors?
'Because we were prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt. It was a
wrong decision, actually.'
Edmonds maintains that the union bogey is no longer even good propaganda for
the Conservatives. Their attempts to scare the voters had failed last time,
he said, and people were increasingly worried about job security and rights
at work. It was the modernisers who were out of date, not the GMB.
As trade union leaders have always done, Edmonds blamed the media for what
he called their obsessive interest in the constitutional dispute.
Perhaps that is because a lot of people think it is time, after four
election defeats, for the unions and Labour to divorce - that they would
live more happily in separate houses.
'I don't think that's an important political issue in Britain. Where would
you rank that on the scale alongside unemployment, the security of pensions,
law and order? Number 150?'
So why did John Smith raise the issue of the relationship?
'Because he was encouraged to believe that the constituency party members
were strong for a particular sort of reform, and he was wrongly advised.
Maybe also he believed this was not as important for the trade unions as it
actually is.'
But if at election time you can't come out and declare yourselves, wouldn't
you be better off unconstrained by this constitutional connection?
'Well, that's one avenue we can go down. The avenue I want us to go down is
to be much less apologetic about our policies, about our political position,
to be much more forthright about the economy, employment issues. The way
people are treated in this country is terrible compared with our European
neighbours.'
The irony is that in 1989 Edmonds'union proposed just the kind of whittling
away of the block vote that is being discussed. He said: 'What we would like
to do is scale down our power in the party and therefore free ourselves to
express our own, trade union views, without perhaps so much political
pressure.'
But if you can have influence without a dominant position, can't you have
influence with no constitutional position at all?
'We could opt for what I would call a pork-barrel relationship, which is
what the American unions have with the Democrats - or with Republicans in
the case of the Teamsters. We don't want a relationship where you are sort
of buying a policy off the candidates you support. We want to be part of a
political tradition: that's our history, that's the instinct of our people.'
The union has looked at party-union ties in Sweden, Denmark and Germany as
well as the US. 'What we found is that in many of these countries where
there is allegedly a divorce, the relationships are in practice, at the
personal level, rather closer. But you still have to grapple with the same
problems.'
Edmonds would not concede that lower union membership and the decline of big
manufacturing enterprises made the connection an anachronism. There were
areas of unorganised labour but also members in new areas of employment. A
constitutional relationship might not be essential, he admitted, yet he
defended it, saying that without it unions could not restore their 'legal
normality' nor ensure that UK workers enjoyed the same rights as others.
His vehemence on the subject of MP selection may have led the GMB general
secretary into a tactical trap. If the unions and constituencies defeat the
reform in the autumn - as Edmonds is confident they will - John Smith will
appear the powerless prisoner of reactionary trade union barons. The reform
package would look like mere tinkering. Yet this is the opposite of what
Edmonds says he wants.
'We have been arguing for a whole series of changes to modernise
policymaking - not just to diminish, but diminish very markedly the power of
union executives and the so-called power of union general secretaries. So it
is individual trade union members who are moving forward into a proper place
in the Labour party and it is people like me who should be moving back.'
Some see in Edmonds' stance a deeper game. His union of 800,000-plus members
is discussing a merger with the 1m-plus Transport and General Workers Union.
If successful, it would create one of the biggest unions in the western
world. Edmonds' defence of the democratic rights of the humble levy-payer
could be designed to appeal to the more left-wing TGWU executive whose boss
he undoubtedly would like to become. When I asked if reform had been stymied
by the merger prospect, he said: 'I wouldn't accept that at all.'
Edmonds is undoubtedly a strategist, an articulate union boss with the rare
distinction of an Oxford University degree but with a manner which  - not
just due to his height and girth - some of his peers find condescending. I
suggested he was afraid he would become a much smaller figure in the
political landscape if the Labour link were broken
He flushed. 'That's nonsense. If that was the only matter of concern it
would take us only five minutes.'
But you are a trade union baron, I said.
'The picture has no reality. Everything I have said to you is about how to
increase opportunities for trade union members to play their part . . . You
are using the sort of stereotype that the Daily Mail and Daily Express are
keen to promote. I reflect, as far as I am able, the views of GMB members
and they want to be involved in the Labour Party.'
He launched into another denunciation of the press for being interested, not
in the constitutional issue but in the row surrounding it. Perhaps, I said,
that is because politicians and trade union leaders - politicians of another
sort - are themselves more interested in these debates than in the humdrum
business of working life.
'That's not right. Anyone reading the papers over the last few months would
assume I do nothing else but get involved in the Labour Party. Even during
this period under 10 per cent of my time is spent on party affairs.
Everything I have been saying about the reform programme is intended to make
John Edmonds politically less important - and that's the way it should be.'
Is there a danger that this will become another of those issues to damage
Labour's reputation with the voters?
'There is an enormous danger that if it continues for any length of time it
will be very damaging to the party, inside the party and with the public. It
beams out the impression that the party is divided - and divided on an issue
which the general public don't feel very strongly about at all.'
I suggested the contest would inevitably be seen as one between modernisers
and trade union barons clinging to constitutional power.
'That perception is entirely incorrect.'
That is how it will come across.
'Not if you do your job properly,' he said.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Light a torch of chaos in Christchurch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE IS a tip for the media pundits as they hurtle down the motorway to the
Christchurch by-election, which promises to drive another stake into John
Major's heart: the number to concentrate on in Christchurch is not 23,015,
the size of the Conservative majority at last year's general election, but
36,627, the number of wooden-tops in the constituency who voted Tory in
1992.
It is such a large figure that it fills me with awe - so much awe that I
raised the matter with Miss Lee, my executive assistant, a woman of
Yorkshire origins and a flog-'em-and-hang-'em Thatcherite. Miss Lee was
looking marvellous: hair expensively twirled, hemline heroically buoyant,
new shoes and nails in the latest carnivore colours.
I said: Did you know, Miss Lee, that the number of wooden-tops in
Christchurch who voted Tory at the 1992 election was 36,627? No wonder the
country is tottering if as many people as that, in just one constituency,
voted for a party that they knew to be exhausted by all those years in
office, and by the stress and indignity of sacking Margaret Thatcher. But
here's a funny thing: you never meet anyone who admits to voting Tory. They
keep exceedingly quiet, which is not, I suppose, surprising.
Miss Lee glared. I could see she was in a hurry. She was beautifying herself
so as to attend a gathering of the Blue Fuse Club. They meet in a winebar
near Chelsea barracks where she and her cronies discuss fund-raising and
fashion, and pick up young soldiers.
Miss Lee said: I haven't got time for your musings. What happens at
elections is a matter for individual conscience. That is how we do things.
But you refuse to be satisfied. Because you're half balmy you would
introduce referendums, tear down our institutions and sack the poor Queen,
or at any rate circumscribe her. Why not abolish elections, do everything by
lottery?
I thought: Not a bad idea.
So I pulled out a copy of The Dice Man, a novel by Luke Rhinehart from the
early 1970s in which the protagonist, a bored psychiatrist, decides to let
fate and chance - a throw of the dice - govern his life. His aim, he
explains, is to discover freedom, exhilaration, joy, excitement. He becomes
the Dice Man.
The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that a throw of the
dice would be a far superior method for resolving the Christchurch
by-election than placing our trust in the hands of the wooden-tops.
So I hunted for a dice. I decided that if the 1 came up, the Tories would
retain Christchurch; the 2 or the 5 would mean that Labour had won and the
3, 4 or 6, the Liberal Democrats. I ignored the minor parties. I threw the
dice. Up came the 6: victory for the Liberal Democrats. Victory at a stroke
 -no costly campaign, no monster raving loonies, no pundits or pollsters
boring us rigid. Above all, no wooden-tops blundering into the polling
stations, sightless, in their thousands.
At the start of his book, Rhinehart quotes Chuang-Tzu: 'The torch of chaos
and doubt - this is what the sage steers by.' And he quotes Nietzsche: 'I am
Zarathustra the godless: I still cook every chance in my pot.'
As the novel develops, the protagonist describes his two guiding principles:
'First, never include an option I might be unwilling to fulfil; second,
always begin to fulfil the option without . . . quibble. The secret of the
successful dicelife is to be a puppet on the strings of the die.'
Naturally, someone has to decide what the numbers on the dice stand for,
what options they represent. In the case of the Christchurch by-election it
was I who decided that the Liberal Democrats should have three chances out
of six and the Tories only one. But the result, you will agree, was
considerably agreeable. I seem to have a gift for it. I ought to be the Dice
Man.
The morning after Miss Lee's attendance at the meeting of the Blue Fuse
Club, she was subdued and wan. There were circles under her eyes.
I said: Things are looking up, Miss Lee. The Liberal Democrats have won
Christchurch. John Major has retired. Portillo leads the Tories. John Birt
has been axed - literally, as it happens. Interest rates are zero. Diana
will be queen. And Italy has invaded Serbia. Isn't life exciting?

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Judith in two guises - David Murry on new opera at the
Almeida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BESIDES this year's Almeida Opera commissions from Kevin Volans and Julian
Grant, the Almeida has mounted the British premieres of two shorter pieces
by David Lang and Ian McQueen. The same Septuagint tale inspired both Lang's
Judith and Holofernes and McQueen's Line of Terror, staged here with expert
imagination by Christopher Leith and Matthew Richardson respectively (last
performances: 4 pm this Saturday). The one, a mime-drama with orchestral
accompaniment, makes a tolerable curtain-raiser to the other, which is a
mini-opera of real resource and conviction.
For reasons of his own (he blames television), the American composer Lang
has chosen to detach his Judith from anything like communal struggle or
personal sacrifice. Instead, it becomes 'a story of a woman trapped in a
recurring nightmare of loneliness and violence, who begins and ends in
solitude, who uses sex to kill a man who finds her attractive and profits
little from it. In other words, it is a quite different story.' Well, yes.
The eternal-return bit is enacted in slow motion, at start and finish, by a
silent Judith and three other gauze-clad undead. In the middle they
manipulate Judith and Holofernes puppets, Bunraku-style, through the
seduction and assassination. It all looks rather stylish. Lang's
accompanying ensemble toys with just a few notes, each of them repeated to
distraction on the spot, but there is explosive punctuation to screw the
tension up - vicious drum-thwacks at first, then sharp orchestral barks, and
a long dissonant screech at murder-time.
Not long ago, the premiere of McQueen's latest opera Fortunato in Sweden was
admired on this page by Paul Driver. Line of Terror, an earlier piece, shows
the Scottish composer with a confident grasp of how to make an opera work.
The story is plainly told, but artfully broken up by commentary from the
eight-strong Israelite chorus, fearful, threatened and threatening (a fine
team of dramatic voices here). The theme is neither horror nor a mythic
past, but the morality of terrorism.
All three principals - Judith, the tyrant and an Ammonite leader whom he has
brutalised and half killed - get strong, professionally shaped set-pieces
that carry the drama forward. Richard Halton makes Holofernes a towering
brute with a coarsely amiable side, and as the Ammonite victim Andrew Watts
projects his counter-tenor with surprising force and poignancy. The role of
Judith is meaty and wide-ranging,a gift to an intelligent soprano like
Virginia Kerr, who gives her the full-throated anguish of a Strauss heroine.
At her soaring climaxes, the music tips toward Broadway show-style (a bit
opportunist, perhaps). Elsewhere it is deliberately tougher ' not
overwhelmingly original, but with telling variety and sharp instrumental
effects. This score offers the conductor Martyn Brabbins far more scope than
Lang's does, and he and the Almeida Ensemble take full advantage of it. We
look forward keenly to McQueen's next works for the stage; he is not yet 40.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: The West End is alive with the sound of music -
Malcolm Rutherford concludes that advance publicity built on previous
reputation seems to be the key to success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE London theatre, this was the week of the musical and it looks like
being the summer of the musical as well. If you look through the list of
West End theatres, musicals of one kind or another now occupy, or about to
occupy, more than half. In terms of seating capacity the figure is higher
because musicals go for the larger places.
The arrivals this week were Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard at
the Adelphi and a revival of Grease at the Dominion; the sad news was the
imminent closure of City of Angels at the Prince of Wales.
I have been trying, without much headway, to work out what makes a musical a
success in box-office terms. One explanation is clearly advance publicity,
built on previous reputation. The publicity for Sunset Boulevard was
enormous. Even after the first night more space was devoted to the
celebrities attending and the party that followed than to the piece itself.
The reviews (including mine) were muted because although there is much to
enjoy, notably Ms Patti LuPone's performance as Norma Desmond, the show is
uneven and not a patch on Lloyd Webber's best work, such as Evita. But the
reviews did not matter since the publicity had ensured that sufficient seats
were sold in advance to make for a long run.
That was the mistake of City of Angels. It had no London track record to
draw on and the advance bookings were small. It was assumed that it would
sell on merit and word of mouth, but it didn't. With hindsight, Angels may
have had another fatal flaw. It is a newish kind of muscial in that it
combines wit and a good script with the songs. Although it harks back to the
past and the private detective world of Philip Marlowe, it is a past more
familiar to Americans than to the British.
No such criticism can apply to Sunset Boulevard which, while it comes from a
similar Hollywood background, is straightforward, romantic, sentimental
stuff. Nor could it possibly apply to Grease, which is about as straight and
uncomplicated as you can get, despite a possible teenage pregnancy.
Grease was nostalgic when it was written - in the late 1960s about the late
1950s. It is even more of a throwback now that it has returned to the stage
retaining some of the songs that it picked up in the intervening movie. One
admires the zest and professionalism of the playing, but it is a remarkably
conservative piece where the adolescents have no interests beyond dating and
rock and roll. It does not remotely stand up to Buddy, which has been
running for years at the Victoria Palace and has the virtue of a strong
story.
Nevertheless, Grease is a great success. It is not only the the teenagers in
the audience who jump up and down to the music; it is the people who were
teenagers when the piece was written. As Jim Jacobs, the co-author, writes
in the programme, Grease is 'a celebration, a party of the best kind'. A
good-ish party is what it remains, but it is a celebration of the past, and
perhaps that it part of the current recipe for a successful musical. Even
Sunset Boulevard depends heavily on a movie made more than 40 years ago. The
mixture is one of familiarity and one art from drawing incestuously from
another.
As a footnote, I went on Thursday to the final of the Vivian Ellis Prize at
the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. This is a national competition to
encourage young writers for the musical stage. There is no shortage of
entrants. Practically every one of the finalists, however, was looking
backwards. Far and away the best contribution (I thought) was from a piece
called Otto by Alaric Barrie and Chalky Horsfall. It is about an American
football team and based on Othello. Yet the official prize went to
Boorskale, written by Paul Tomkinson around three elderly, disabled sisters
living in a bungalow in Derbyshire. Possibly there really is a search for
something new in unlikely places.

THE HISTORY of La Bayadere in the West is odd. It is one of Petipa's most
fascinating works, typical of his mature creativity - it dates from 1877 -
in its combination of exotic theme and spectacular effects, and testimony to
the vivid dramatic excuses he sought for his dance sequences. It has
survived in Petersburg despite revolution and ideological nit-picking. In
the West, while some of the old Mariinsky ballets percolated into the
repertory, no company could find the forces to mount such an undertaking.
It was during the first Kirov season in London in 1961, when the Shades
scene was part of a gala evening, that the importance of this choreographic
marvel was made clear. Nureyev's subsequent Shades staging for the Royal
Ballet was proof that the West might honourably emulate Russia. A BBCTV
transmission of the Kirov production in 1973 was significant; a decade later
Makarova revived the full-length ballet for American Ballet Theatre (and
very astutely reconstructed the last act that Leningrad had dropped 'for
lack of proper forces' after the Revolution.) This staging she was later to
mount for the Royal Ballet, and in Milan, Stockholm and Rio. Rudolf
Nureyev's last gift to the Paris Opera was a Bayadere which reproduced the
Kirov version. La Bayadere had become part of Western ballet's traditions.
But the Kirov could not tour it. One of the joys of seeing ballet in
Petersburg was the magnificence of the Bayadere scenery - dating from the
turn of the century, and too fragile to travel - as frame for Kirov classic
manner and mimetic dignity. Now the company has had the old scenery copied -
impeccably - and can show the West this ancestral treasure. It looked fine
on a first London outing on Thursday night. The Coliseum stage is somewhat
small for its grandiose scale, and the lighting was less than subtle, but
the painted sets are magnificent, and, making greatest sense of Petipa's
artifices, there are the Kirov artists.
The version is slightly edited - where was the Danse Manu, and some
variations in the Grand Pas? - but it is the authentic Bayadere, and demands
to be seen. La Bayadere is a ballet most serious in its dramatic
underpinning - sacred love in conflict with profane passion - and vastly
challenging for soloists and principals. The confrontation between Nikiya
and Gamzatti which ends the first act is as emotionally challenging as
anything in the old repertory. The division of dance interest - the
passionate Gamzatti given the bravura Grand Pas; the 'holy' Nikiya rewarded
with the Shades scene - reveals Petipa's astute sense of theatre. Solor is a
numbskull, but a tormented one, and the part rewards bold playing - as
Mukhamedov, Bocca and Manuel Legris have variously shown us. The technical
demands of the Grand Pas and the Shades sequence are among the greatest in
19th century ballet, and Petipa's dramatic skill can be seen in the
hallucinatory entry of the Shades as in the spacious exposition of
narrative. Minkus' score - given in the wise version preserved at the
Mariinsky - is no mean support for the drama, as the eloquent orchestral
playing proved.
But Bayadere demands potent central interpretations. Olga Chenchikova was
the Gamzatti of the this first performance, and opulently right. Her dancing
is magnificent in scale and assurance, commanding space in step and outline,
womanly rather than girlish - and how welcome for this fact. She provides a
physical force, a psychic intensity, that make the character fascinating in
temperament as in dance. Konstantin Zaklinsky was a Solor credible at every
moment, competent in his few dance passages, but notable for the stylistic
intelligence with which he illuminated conventional dramatics. We believed
in him.
I could not, though, believe in Yulia Makhalina as Nikiya. She is a
beautiful young woman, her silhouette long, sophisticated, her technique
forcefully brilliant. Alas, she plays Nikiya on the terms of her own
self-absorbtion. The role does not exist save as a display-piece for
extravagant prowess. The temple-dancer looks like a visiting star; the Shade
is concerned only with technical dazzle. Those spiritual qualities with
which Makarova and Asylmuratova have imbued the role - the dance as
declaration of holiest feeling, and gaining in luminosity thereby - are
foreign to Makhalina's reading. It is lit by technical fireworks rather than
the sacred fire of the first scene.
The three Shades soloists displayed Kirov classicism at its most satisfying.
I have already praised Larissa Lezhnina and Irina Sitnikova this season.
Their companion, Irina Shapchits, is no less admirable. In the third
variation she produced ravishing dancing: exquisite in control, pure in form
as in manner. I have never seen the solo better done.
The Kirov season continues at the Coliseum until July 31

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: The National smartens up - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF YOU run a hard presed arts organisation and come across anyone called
Sackler - grab them. The American Sackler brothers, beneficiaries of a drugs
fortune, are a posse of white knights as far as the UK's leading art
galleries are concerned.
It was the late Arthur, and Jill, Sackler who gave the Royal Academy its
smart new galleries. On Tuesday a new Mesopotamia gallery was unveiled at
the British Museum, thanks to Raymond and Beverly Sackler; and yesterday the
National Gallery announced that Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler were giving
well over Pounds 1m to renovate one of the grandest, if tattiest rooms, in
the Gallery. At the moment it houses 18th Italian art, but in deference to
Theresa, who is English, when the new Sackler Room is unveiled it will be
home to British art.
The National Gallery also revealed that an anonymous friend was giving
almost Pounds 1m to restore another gallery. This means that it has raised
over Pounds 13m in the last five years to smarten up its original Wilkins
building. Now the hunt is on for money to improve the modern northern
extension.
Unlike many arts organisations the National Gallery seems in good heart: but
it must run very hard to stand still. In 1993-94 its government grant is
Pounds 16.5m, but it expects to spend over Pounds 25m. Just five years ago
the government covered virtually all its costs, but now that the Gallery has
Trustee status it must bridge a growing gap in its finances from its own
efforts. It means that the chairman of the Trustees, Nicholas Baring, and
director Neil MacGregor, are constantly tapping the shoulders of potential
benefactors.
The main problem is the disappearance of a specific purchasing grant from
the government. The Gallery finds it difficult to raise money for
acquisitions, especially as it it still paying Lord Cholmondeley Pounds 2.5m
a year for the Holbein 'Lady with a Squirrel' which it acquired in 1992. Its
annual report shows only three very minor purchases last year, but important
paintings sold at auction to foreign buyers included works by Daumier, Goya
and Ribera.
The Japan Festival of 1991 must be the only major festival in the UK since
the Great Exhibition of 1851 to end up with a surplus. Most of its Pounds
20m funding came from pre-recession Japan and the UK organisers were
continually amazed at the sums that belatedly landed in their laps.
But it is not being squandered. Each year the Japan Festival Fund will give
prizes with an annual value of around Pounds 30,000 to British cultural
ventures which continue to demythologize Japan to the British. The first
batch was distributed this week with the injunction from the chairman of the
judges, Sir Kit McMahon, that there were no restrictions on how the money
was spent. 'You can even speculate against the Yen with it.'
The biggest winner was the Lyric Hammersmith for its season of Japanese
plays. The judges could hardly have picked an arts institution more in need
of Pounds 15,000. The Lyric is believed to be on the Arts Council's list of
ten clients set to lose their grant - which in the Lyric's case accounts for
Pounds 300,000, or roughly a third of its income.
Although the Council remains adamant that some clients will be discarded, it
is back-tracking slightly. There will be another review, and if the
government comes up with more money for the arts in the November budget,
four of the ten might be saved.
The Council is not optimistic about reversing the proposed Pounds 5m cut in
its grant, the first actual reduction in its budget since 1979. Yet, at one
level a lower grant helps the Arts Council. It gives it someone to blame as
it pushes ahead with its desire to redistribute Pounds 1.4m from drama to
contemporary dance and the visual arts. But it cannot escape opprobrium. If
theatres like Plymouth, Oldham and Watford are on the hit list substantially
populated areas will be deprived of professional drama, for it is unlikely
that these theatres can maintain a reasonable programme without a subsidy
that accounts for over 30 per cent of their income.
Such an eventuality is expressly against the Council's charter to bring the
arts to every part of the UK. This whole saga still has a few twists in it,
but the Council has committed so much energy to its new policy of being on
the 'cutting edge' of the arts that some sacrificial victims seem
inevitable.
Stephen Daldry, now in sole charge at the Royal Court, announced this week
that he was in favour of direct action to restore the cuts in the drama
budget threatened by the Arts Council. He was ready to lead a commando raid
on the Council, although what would be achieved, apart from a plot line for
a Royal Court play, is uncertain.
His reign at the Court seems set to combine controversy with a hard headed
financial stewardship. There is likely to be an outcry over a November
production, MSM, the first verbal work by choreographer Lloyd Newson of DV8,
the dance company. It looks at the issue of cottaging, sexual contacts in
male toilets.
On the other hand the Royal Court should have another profitable transfer
when David Mamet's Oleanna moves to the West End. The Royal Court has done
well out of developing links with the US. It has found a rich friend in the
Audrey Skirball-Kenis Foundation, which has promised it Dollars 100,000 a
year for three years to bring new American works to London and send Royal
Court writers to Los Angeles.
Daldry pinpointed the crisis in contemporary British drama. In the past
there was a loyal audience for the Court's new plays which guaranteed it a
fair audience of 45 per cent of capacity. No play at the Court has played to
this level of capacity for three years. It either presents hits, or total
misses.
More news from the Lyric Hammersmith. Its new artistic director is to be
Neil Bartlett, who coincidentally has written a new work, a musical, for the
Royal Court, Night After Night, which opens in late November. It seems quite
the fashion for artistic directors to spend their time in rival theatres:
Daldry has no current plans to direct at the Court but is working at the
National Theatre.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Classic in different ways - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Melvyn Bragg is away on his summer break, Monday mornings will begin
with Live Wires in his place - a pleasant talk-to-guests show presented by
Emma Freud and Richard Coles and produced by Cathie Mahoney. They began by
telling how they would find news from the provincial papers that we would
not have had so well covered by the national dailies, but they kicked off
with a Belfast paper on July 12, hardly a characteristic source. Still, they
both sound pleasant enough.
I hated Sue Townsend's The Queen and I the last time it was broadcast, and I
hated it again this week in Book at Bedtime. Disapprove of the Royal Family
if you must, but do not make fun of them when they have no real chance to
answer back. Perhaps I am in a minority over this; anyway, the people that
enjoy laughing at the Queen can now get the jokes on cassette from the BBC
Radio Collection, and welcome.
Radio 3 continues its classical series with an extract from The Golden Ass
by Lucius Apuleius, dramatised by Peter Mackie. In spite of Richard
Griffiths as the transmuted Lucius, it made me laugh less than I expected.
The jokes are described, rather than actually made. We will see how we get
on with next week's tale, which goes well on the page.
Classic in quite a different way are Frank Richards's stories about the boys
at Greyfriars. Radio 2 on Tuesday calls them The Billy Bunter Stories, but
when I read them Bunter was not much more memorable among the fellows in the
Remove than, say, Hurree Jamset Ram Singh. They were just there for contrast
with such normal schoolboys as Harry Wharton and Co. Bunter, unpredictably,
was the hero this week; he saved a little girl from being run over by a
train, and sensibly hoped for a reward (of coconuts) from her father. Having
established that Bunter is for laughs, surely the other Greyfriars boys (Tim
Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie) should sound more like the
chaps at a decent public school?
When I read the title Terry Nutkins' Nature on Radio 5 I reckoned we were in
the Beatrix Potter country; but no, Terry Nutkins is a real nature-lover,
and his new series from BBC Education sounds fine. The first programme, on
Wednesday, dealt first with Liz Dorer, 'the birdwoman of Boxmoor', who
devotes herself to the rescue of swans, though other birds may apply. What
we heard about injured swans was ghastly; thankfully, lead weights on
fishing-lines are now proscribed, for a swan has only to swallow seven of
them to die of blood-poisoning. Then on to the Durham puma (so called), the
big feral cat seen by a local police-sergeant over seven years - and as far
away as Carlisle by hopeful believers. Next week we get badgers and seal
pups, and there is a great variety to come - ideal radio for young people.
I meant to listen to Cajun Routes on Radio 2 on Thursday, as the word Cajun
meant little to me. Well, I learned how to pronounce it and where Cajun
music originated (in the once-French part of Louisiana) and who performed
it; but the music seemed to me so uninteresting I reckoned I could live
without it.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Flanders comes to Cambridge - Patricia Morison enjoys
an illuminating collection of late medieval art at the Fitzwilliam museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not tremendously likely, but imagine a day when conservators exercise
complete control over the shape of art exhibitions world wide. Imagine, too,
that the conservators then decreed that historic artifacts should lead
virtually risk-free lives at home.
No more grandiose government-sponsored shows of the like of last year's
Hispania-Austria, which procured hundreds of exceptionally precious
15th-century artifacts from museums in Europe and America, and freighted
them first to Toledo and then to Innsbruck. What kind of art exhibitions
might we then see?
An exhibition of 15th-century Flemish art which has just opened at the
Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge suggests what might be achieved if ever the
age of the jet-setting art-treasure ends. Splendours of Flanders; Late
Medieval Art in Cambridge Collections brings together some 70 exhibits -
panel-paintings, drawings, one well-preserved tapestry, sculpture, coins, an
iron-bound safe on wheels, printed books and illuminated manuscripts.
Unsurprisingly, the largest share of objects belongs to the Fitzwilliam's
own collection, where they can be seen (so long as you arrive on the right
day; the downstairs, with its medieval treasures in the Rothschild Gallery,
is closed in the afternoons.) A significant number of exhibits belong to
colleges and the University Library, and are not readily on view.
Not many Cantabrigians normally manage to inspect Sidney Sussex College's
iron-bound chest. It was brought back in 1607 from a synod in Flanders by a
Master who, like his 20th-century successors, seems to have been concerned
to step up college security. The massive chest had a complex locking
mechanism of three keys which required to be operated in sequence by the
junior bursar, the senior bursar, and the Master himself.
Queen's College has lent the exhibit which is the 'discovery' of the
exhibition; three panels showing scenes from the life of Christ, which would
have been the wings for a large altarpiece. Remarkably, it seems that the
panels may have been in England since before the Reformation.
The show's curators give this rare survival to the Master of the View of
Saint Gudule, a Brussels artist with a fondness for lively scenes and male
figures with features like pug-dogs. In Queen's chapel, the panels can be
viewed only from the front, whereas in the exhibition the saints on the
reverse are also visible.
Among the Fitzwilliam's own Flemish paintings, the most famous is Joos Van
Cleve's Virgin and Child, a lovely image of a baby who seems just that
instant to have fallen asleep on his mother's breast, to her huge
satisfaction. Another more modest Virgin and Child is thought to be by the
Joos's son, Cornelis Van Cleve. 'Daft Cleve' was one of the Flemish artists
who in the far less favourable conditions of the mid-16th century, decided
instead to try his luck in England where (for reasons unknown) he went mad.
Manuscripts and books are unquestionably the strength of the 'Splendours of
Flanders'. Among single leaves detached from illuminated manuscripts are
several by the famous master, Simon Bening. One of his full-page
illuminations of The Annunciation shows in the margin a charming scene of
the Virgin apparently going for a stroll in the countryside, followed by an
angel, presumably carrying her workbox, not her lunchbox.
The Lord of Enghien we see in a full-page illumination in his personal Book
of Hours, kneeling before St Hubert, the patron of hunters. Someone else
paid handsomely for a Bruges manuscript with a fine set of the traditional
Labours of the Month, enlivening the calendar of feastdays and saints' days.
We can only see the book open at September, harvesting grapes, but
photographs of the other months also show scenes of sophisticated urban life
 -driving about in carriages and in May, courting one's mistress with a band
of minstrels.
What I particularly liked about this exhibition is its clear explanation of
the role of medieval religious books, particularly Books of Hours. These
were virtually mass-produced in towns like Bruges, Tournai, or Valenciennes.
Many were exported to England with the addition of English saints, such as
St Thomas Becket. In the Low Countries, ruled for a century by Burgundian
dukes with the keenest appreciation of fine books, it was an essential mark
of social status to own an attractive book of prayers.
The richer the client, the more miniatures and illuminated capitals he or
she could afford, not to mention 'personalised' books in which they and
their name-saints appeared. The skills of even a thoroughly dull painter did
not come cheap. In a fascinating and highly readable book published earlier
this year, Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work, (Yale; Pounds
35; 210pp.) Jonathan Alexander points out that in 1463, the celebrated
artist, Simon Marmion, earned enough from illustrating just one manuscript
to have the thatch on his house replaced with tiles.
By no means all the books are religious. The humanist outlook of the
Renaissance is represented by a group of manuscripts which do not come from
Cambridge. They are four superb illuminated manuscripts of classical texts
borrowed from the library established in the 18th century by Thomas Coke of
Holkham Hall in Norfolk. No doubt the famous agriculturalist particularly
enjoyed the page in the Virgil Collected Works which illustrates farmers'
tasks, everything from coppicing to luring a swarm of bees.
The fully illustrated catalogue of the exhibition is well worth having, not
least for an excellent historical introduction narrating how the Dukes of
Burgundy pieced together their great inheritance in the Low Countries, broke
with France, and created a Burgundian 'nation'. (A comparison between the
sexual appetites of Philip the Good and President Kennedy is
thought-provoking.)
Catalogue and exhibition are sponsored by the bank Gemeentekrediet (Credit
Communal) and the Flemish government, which has named the show Cultural
Ambassador for Flanders. Is this the first time that a foreign sponsor has
been willing to pay up for a show which will only be seen in a foreign
country? The Fitzwilliam made clear that the works of art were not going to
go to the Flemings. So the sponsor agreed that is the Flemings who must go
to Cambridge - after all, it is only a short hop to Stanstead. Is this,
then, to be the nature of arts sponsorship in the 21st century?

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Bream at 60
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THURSDAY was Julian Bream's 60th birthday. The celebrated guitarist chose to
spend the evening at the Wigmore Hall, in company with members of the Nash
Ensemble - and, it hardly needs saying, a packed house of enthusiasts -
displaying a few of the modes and styles of guitar-playing that have caused
him to remain so much and so long admired.
Birthday concerts, anniversary concerts and other forms of event-devising by
means of calendar-marking can sometimes seem a rather artificial, stultified
method of drawing attention to the art or artist in question. In the case of
someone like Bream, however, the stratagem can be useful as a stock-taking
opportunity; certainly, this birthday concert served the purpose well.
The reason is that it showed Bream to be still a peerless guitar technician,
unrivalled in his ability to make the instrument speak in tones of the most
'personal', most finely shaded and varied eloquence. (Since on Thursday it
was unpleasantly hot and humid in the hall, fingerings seemed prey to
moments of slip and slide - but never so seriously as to compromise
virtuosity.) It also showed him to be a player still wonderfully responsive
to the personalities and characteristics of others, capable of entering into
chamber music with sympathy and ready spontaneity.
The opening Haydn work - an adaptation for guitar and string trio of the E
major String Quartet, Op. 2 no. 2 - afforded choice examples of those
ensemble-partaking gifts and qualities. The slow movement, a kind of aria
sung over delicately patterned accompaniment, was particularly full of free,
fresh, delight-arousing lyrical nuances.
In Toward the Sea (1981), Toru Takemitsu's three-movement duet for guitar
and alto flute (Philippa Davies), the raptly intimate character of the
duetting made fair amends for the work's wispy, repetitious substance and
limited atmospheric range. A solo sonata for guitar (1933) by the
little-known Spaniard Antonio Jose, unremarkable in invention, gave Bream's
sophisticated rhythmic sense its head.
The concert did not attempt to represent every facet of so multifarious a
musician: Bream the lutenist, Bream the inspirer of important contemporary
composition, Bream the sensitive partner of the singing voice were on this
occasion missing. On their own the Nash played Roussel's harp, flute and
string-trio Serenade (a beautifully taut account) and the Ravel Introduction
and Allegro. It was altogether a civilised, well-varied programme; but it
left me ungratefully wanting even more of the birthday celebrant.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: South Bank 'Meltdown'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG THE composers who have established themselves in British music in the
last two decades none has been so widely praised as George Benjamin. Ever
since his orchestral Ringed by the Flat Horizon was performed while he was a
still student in 1980 Benjamin, born in 1960, has been consistently hailed
as the greatest natural talent to emerge in British music since Britten;
both his composition teachers, Olivier Messiaen and Alexander Goehr, had
been fulsome in their recognition of his gifts.
The works that have followed over the last decade have amply confirmed that
promise, even though there have been rather fewer of them than many admirers
would have liked. Meanwhile Benjamin has found himself drawn ever farther
into the performing side of new music. He was a pianist (and a thrilling,
explosive one) before ever he became a composer and has continued to relish
the occasional opportunity to perform; conducting (his own music first and
then other people's) has been a natural extension. And latterly he has
become a festival animateur; 'Meltdown' the South Bank's celebration of
contemporary music which gets underway in the Queen Elizabeth Hall tomorrow
has been planned and programmed by Benjamin, who will also make appearances
as both conductor and pianist.
He has taken charge of similar festivals before, in Paris and Los Angeles,
mixing a few of his own works with music by composers with whom he feels a
special affinity. The South Bank initiative (the prototype of what is
planned as an annual event) spreads its net wider, bringing in dance events
and film. There will be a ballet danced to Boulez's Le Marteau sans matre;
the NFT is presenting a season of Japanese films with soundtrack scores by
Toru Takemitsu; three Chaplin shorts will be shown with scores written for
them by Benedict Mason, while Benjamin himself will improvise a piano
accompaniment to a Japanese silent film.
Benjamin promotes and explains it all with huge, natural enthusiasm, even
though he turns out to be a slightly reluctant impresario, caught between
his instinctive desire to be left alone to compose, and the necessity as he
sees it to do what he can to make new music available and accessible to the
widest possible audience. His 'Meltdown' programmes look to have got the
balance between just about right, mixing late 20th-century masterpieces by
Boulez and Ligeti with works by younger composers that appeal to Benjamin,
such as the Frenchman Tristan Murail and the quirky French-Canadian Denys
Bouliane, whose music would rarely have been heard in Britain but for
Benjmain's continued advocacy.
For London there is the bonus of a brand new Benjamin work - Sudden Time,
which the composer will conduct with the London Philharmonic on Wednesday,
alongside pieces by Goehr and Messiaen. It promises to be Benjamin's most
substantial score since the wonderfully imaginative and lucid Antara he
wrote for IRCAM in Paris six years ago.
The premiere seems almost as much a pleasant surprise to Benjamin as it is
to all his admirers. When the festival was first planned, he did not
envisage having anything new ready in time. But a short piece written to a
commission from Jerusalem last autumn provided the key to a new way of
working, and the orchestral score rapidly began to fall into place.
Characteristically, it is not entirely new; it begins with the substance of
a short orchestral piece Cascade that Benjamin wrote for the LPO a couple of
years ago, but the seamless continuation into a 15-minute study for a very
large orchestra is absolutely fresh.
The idea of a 'work-in-progress', a torso to which a composer returns to
expand and refine an initial idea is characteristic of music in the late
20th-century; Pierre Boulez in particular has turned that whole approach
into an art form in itself. Benjamin may reject the serial aesthetic that
led Boulez into such a creative impasse, but there is no doubt that he
shares the post-war avant garde's concern with organisation and precision.
His approach may be different but he celebrates the right of music to be
challenging, rigorous, intellectually satisfying.
In part that accounts for the elaborate care with which he composes, but
Benjamin freely admits that he has had to reassess his approach since Ringed
by the Flat Horizon, realising in the mid 1980s that his music was becoming
too exclusively grounded in its harmonic thinking and needed a linear
element to take his work forward. Harmony had always been intrinsic to his
music thinking and the struggle to redefine his parameters was a protracted
process, accounting in part for the low productivity of the 1980s.
Now in Sudden Time Benjamin feels he may have lit upon a new path; he is
cautious of being too bullish about it, but nevertheless suggest that he may
have found a technique to sustain his music into the future. The optimism is
natural, hard to gainsay; Benjamin's belief in the continued health of
contemporary music is unbreakable, and events like 'Meltdown' give him just
the right platform to present that faith in the most attractive package.

DAUGHTERS OF DECADENCE: WOMEN WRITERS OF THE FIN DE SIECLE edited by Elaine
Showalter Virago Pounds 6.99, 326 pages
THE NEW WOMAN: WOMEN'S VOICES 1880-1919 edited by Juliet Gardner Collins &amp;
Brown Pounds 6.99, 318 pages
FROM CARMEN to Salome, from Rossetti's Persephone to Pater's Mona Lisa, how
sexist we are in our love of the great heroines of the late 19th century. So
powerful was the image of the femme fatale, the woman aestheticised by men
as a dangerous sex object, that women artists seemed unable to answer back.
'My dear boy,' says Oscar Wilde in Dorian Gray, 'no woman is a genius. Women
are the decorative sex. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no
sense of art.' In an earlier generation - the Brontes, George Eliot - women
dominated the Victorian novel; why had they no successors in the fin de
siecle?
Here are two books which fill in the gaps. Daughters of Decadence is a
collection of short stories which illuminates for the first time the Naughty
Nineties from a female perspective. While Wilde, Whistler and the aesthetes
swooned over dandies and green carnations, women writers were battling out
their own answers to Victorian repression. Here, for instance, is Charlotte
Mew's chillingly brilliant A White Night, a feminist counterpart to Heart of
Darkness, where a girl on her honeymoon sees a woman ritually buried alive
in a Spanish convent, at the heart of whiteness. In a horrid denouement to
her dissection of idealised purity, Mew later killed herself by drinking
disinfectant; her White Night also recalls the French nuit blanche, a
sleepless night or twilight zone of consciousness where fantasies and fears
are enacted.
Written after A Doll's House but before Freud and The Interpretation of
Dreams, such stories still flow off the page breathless with self-discovery
and excitement at finding in dream and hallucination metaphors for
liberation. An Egyptian Cigarette is Kate Chopin's opium dream of seduction
by a sheikh; in Theodora Victoria Cross plays out androgynous eroticism in a
game of oriental dressing up. Individually, these are curiosities; together
they compel as testimony to the growing awareness of sexual possibilities.
Elaine Showalter's excellent introduction suggests these writers were
experimenters who paved the way for the feminist modernism of Virginia
Woolf. Some of the best stories are savage assaults on the old guard: two,
Lady Tal and Miss Grief, tell of gifted female novelists destroyed by a
patronising hack modelled on Henry James. He never forgave their authors the
'treachery to private relations'. In another, Ada Leverson, who wrote a
parody of Salome at dinner ('Is that mayonnaise? It is the mayonnaise of
salmon, pink as a branch of coral . . . the pink roses that bloom in the
garden of the queen of Arabia are not so pink'), mocks the sexual cruelty of
a narcissist based on Wilde.
Refreshing, powerful, different from anything by male writers: these stories
make a rich, coherent anthology. The New Woman, which explores the
socio-historical background of such fiction through letters, diaries,
memoirs, is a sort of prosaic cousin. There are highlights here too -
Beatrice Webb on the 'stupendous sacrifice of marriage' to Sidney; Marie
Stopes on why 'nice' people expect women to have no sex drive - but much is
of academic interest only.
Juliet Gardner's theme is the dawn of new opportunities for women at work,
in education, in and out of marriage, and her division of material into
these sections throws up parallels and contradictions, differences between
then and now. The material has been well researched, but little in the
analysis is new, and the scissors and paste approach is maddening when it
gives only titbits from correspondents like Woolf and Dora Carrington,
interspersed with a great deal that is turgid and dated.
Anthologies of women's writing are a growth area, and both these books will
appeal to devotees. But the problem with reviving women's writing at all
costs is that the mediocre and best-forgotten is carried along with the real
and worthwhile discoveries, with the risk that women's work is further
marginalised rather than brought into the mainstream. This is where The New
Woman falls down, while Daughters of Decadence is a model, offering
literature of originality, quality and a cultural interest which extends
beyond the gender of its authors.

THE HONOURABLE BEAST by John Dexter Nick Hern Books Pounds 25, 340 pages
'IF YOU don't shut up, Arnold, I'll direct this play as you wrote it' - a
celebrated admonition from John Dexter to his long-time collaborator Arnold
Wesker gives a fair indication of both his candour and lack of tact.
Dexter was one of the sacred monsters of post-war theatre and advance word
in thespian circles was that publication of his memoirs would cause as much
consternation on the South Bank as Alan Clark's had at Westminster . . .
this is unlikely to be the case.
Indeed, apart from the same unrepeatable epithet applied to Rudolph Nureyev
and Anthony Hopkins (the latter of whom is described as not only ambitious,
cowardly and self-deceiving but a sexual failure), a lack of respect for the
intellect of Eddie Kulukundis and the manners of Alan J Lerner, and the
obligatory venom spat at Peter Hall, 'His Majesty Hall' 'Lord Vestibule', by
ancient members of the Olivier regime, the book is notably short of
vituperation. He is a positive Pollyanna compared to his old friend, John
Osborne.
And yet, if it is an also-ran in the gossip stakes, there's little of
substance to compensate. In spite of the teasing title - a posthumous
biography - it amounts to an ad hoc collection of notes, diary entries,
memoranda, letters and commonplaces edited by Dexter's close friend, Riggs
O'Hara. While such documents have a vital place in the writing of a
biography, they are less compelling as the entire hook.
Dexter was one of the greatest directors of the last three decades, notable
for his many collaborations with Wesker and Shaffer, as well as premiere
productions by Arden, Osborne, Rattigan and Griffiths. His classical
productions included Olivier's Othello, Plowright's St Joan, Gambon's
Galileo and the McCowen-Rigg Pygmalion. He discovered the translating
talents of Tony Harrison (The Misanthrope, Phaedra Britannica), directed
film (The Virgin Soldiers), musicals (Half A Sixpence, Do I Hear A Waltz?)
and, for seven years, ran the Metropolitan Opera in New York,
The Honourable Beast gives only tantalising glimpses of this. The lack is
all the more acute as it is very much a work-story rather than a life-story.
Dexter writes that 'work is the only worship I know and understand' and the
book follows this line. In spite of his own suggestion that he suffered
professionally for his homosexuality, there is little mention of his private
life and none of his imprisonment for a sexual offence.
After a few backward glances at his Royal Court training ground, the book is
divided into a number of often overlapping sections which encompass his
early days at the National, his freelance work after his sacking by Olivier,
his return to the National under Peter Hall, and his plans for a company of
his own. The centrepiece is his work at the Met, which he was determined to
drag into the 20th century and where he was thwarted by the vested interests
of the musical, technical and administrative staff and the all-important
sponsors.
Intriguing as such material is, it suffers from an almost total lack of
context. The letters and notes are not revealing, witty or profound enough
to be of interest in themselves and there is an insufficient background for
them to illuminate the working process. The reader is constantly at sea,
clamouring for a passing reference. Never have I yearned so hard for
footnotes.
The book is most valuable for the almost incidental credo on the importance
of work and the role of the director and his tribute to the designer,
Jocelyn Herbert. But, apart from the extended discussion of the operatic
triple bill, Parade, in letters to Hockney and Nureyev, where, as the
project's initiator, he is forced for once to fill in the artistic and
historical background, there is far too much about his work-load and too
little about his working methods. For the latter, it would be wiser to turn
to Jim Hiley's Theatre At Work, a detailed account of rehearsals for the
National's Galileo.
Threaded through the book is a threnody of aborted projects: Shaw's Man and
Superman, Verdi's Falstaff, King Lear with Richard Burton, The Seagull with
Makarova; and it is tragic that his early death robbed us of so much more .
. . although it's doubtful whether even he could have made a silk purse out
of Howard Brenton and Tariq Ali's Moscow Gold. Another lost project is the
book on directing which he discusses in a letter to Joan Plowright; instead,
we have this compilation of preliminary notes. Some may consider it a worthy
substitute, but I suspect that Dexter, a life-long perfectionist, would have
disagreed.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: Sinan, master builder of the Ottomans - Patricia
Morison on the life of an architect who reinvented the mosque and influenced
the cathedral and church builders of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON

OTTOMAN ARCHITECTURE AND ITS VALUES TODAY G Goodwin Saqi Books Pounds 29.95
132 Pages
IF AN arrow had despatched the young Sinan as he marched with the
janissaries across Hungary, it would have been as great a loss as if
Leonardo, Michelangelo or Bramante had never lived. This is the contention
of a book which is no narrow academic study but a deeply perceptive inquiry
into the nature of architectural achievement.
Not a lot is known about the life of Sinan, a boy from a Christian village
in Anatolia who was recruited into the Ottoman army. He became Royal
Architect and died in 1588 aged 100. Building bridges and siege warfare
taught Sinan his craft. In Istanbul and Edirne he went on to build mosques
and public buildings which were brilliantly engineered to withstand
earthquakes. (Gleefully, Goodwin points out that master masons achieved a
less impressive record for Gothic cathedrals.)
Ironically, Europeans may have appreciated Sinan's achievement more in times
when it was harder for infidels to see his buildings at first hand. Wren,
pondering the dome of St Paul's, interrogated the Turkey merchant Roger
North about the construction of the mosque of Suleyman. 'Oxford would never
have been the same,' says Goodwin of Hawksmoor's plan to build a version of
the Suleymaniye on the site where the Radcliffe Camera was later built.
For the supreme achievement of Sinan one must visit the Thracian city of
Edirne and the mosque of Selim II, the Sot. Here is 'the dome to end all
domes', the climax of a building which Sinan named as his finest. The second
half of the book analyses what it is that sets this masterpiece apart as a
breakthrough in the history of architecture. Ottoman mosques before Sinan
had reached an aesthetic dead-end because of architects' rigorous focus on
'the elemental symbolism of the perfect hemisphere set on a cube'. Sinan
unified the pleasing disparate elements - the slender stone minaret, the
domes, semi-domes and the courtyard - and then set free interior space and
exterior forms.
A short, easy-to-read book on Sinan was badly needed because, as many among
this year's crop of tourists will surely discover, being frog-marched by a
guide around the mosques of Istanbul is not an enlightening experience. To
get the best from Rustem Pasha means waiting until light filtering from the
dome brings out the richness of superb glass and tiles. Sheltering from the
sun under a portico is the way to appreciate the particular grace of Shezade
Cami's courtyard.
Moreover, it is time well spent to observe a foreign mode of worship. At
least now and again, we should watch discreetly as someone makes their namaz
and linger as the courtyard of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha fills with the babble of
boys in black pinafores memorising the Koran.
Western church architecture is dominated by the idea of procession to the
altar. Mosques, however, require that the worshipper stays on one spot to
perform his prayers on one spot from where he should see the mihrab,
symbolic of the door to Paradise.
Another fundamental difference between church and mosque is in the
experience of light. Whereas Byzantine churches had been places of shadow,
Sinan's mosques were filled to the greatest possible extent with light,
symbolic of the divine enlightenment possible for all believers. Admiring
the shafts of light which strike down into the immensity of Aya Sofya, we
should remember that Sinan had the windows enlarged.
To the layman, Turkey's classical mosques appear timeless. Goodwin shows
that this is not so. Sinan's original decorations have been crudely
over-painted. It is impossible for us to imagine his domes when they were
lit by the beautiful oil-lamps which now sit 'like dumb nightingales' in
museums. Columns and pavements used to be polished, an effect which can
still be appreciated after rain. Minarets equipped with tape-recorders by
lazy muezzins are 'as dead as drained teeth.'
Goodwin is entitled to protest, after doing so much in his scholarly career
to introduce a wide audience to Ottoman culture. Thanks to his books, many
visitors to Turkey have found their way to obscure mosques and bath-houses.
Moreover, he has provided the kind of insight which helps to bridge the gap
between alien traditions and alien faiths. Sinan is the culmination of this
achievement, a book which no one who loves Turkey should miss.

<TEXT>
A FAMILY ROMANCE by Anita Brookner Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 218 pages
EYES by Maggie Hemingway Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 186 pages
MUSIC FOR GLASS ORCHESTRA by Grace Andreacchi Serpent's Tail Pounds 8.99,
199 pages
FEW contemporary novelists will be read 50 years from now but I am sure that
Anita Brookner will be one. This is her 13th novel and while it will
certainly please her admirers it is unlikely to win any converts among those
who find her work rather tame and predictable. It is some time since I read
Anita Brookner and I had forgotten how rich her work is in the quieter
pleasures of fiction. The careful precision of her beautifully-balanced
prose should not be underestimated, even if you cannot get excited by the
subject matter.
Once again, in A Family Romance, Anita Brookner writes about what the
narrator, Jane, refers to as 'the quiet exigencies of my not very onerous
life'. Jane, who was about five years old in 1969, is younger than many a
Brookner heroine but equal weight is given to Jane's Aunt Dolly, who was in
her early 20s during the American liberation of Paris. The title of the
novel is mildly ironic, as Jane has very little family - soon only Aunt
Dolly is left - and there is precious little romance. The story really
concerns the strange relationship which develops between frivolous, worldly
Aunt Dolly - 'Let them think of you always as singing and dancing' - and
quiet, intellectual Jane, of the 'not very onerous life'.
Jane is one of those people who are born middle-aged: a single,
independently-wealthy writer of children's books who also lectures on fairy
tales and is content to live in a small but sunny flat in Dolphin Square.
She is acclaimed by feminist academics of her own age but finds she prefers
company of 'placid, dignified women, mostly in their 50s . . .' There is no
sudden conquering of Jane and Dolly's mutual dislike but over the years Jane
comes to see a fascinating combination of toughness and simplicity in her
aunt, one of nature's survivors.
Eyes is, alas, published posthumously. Maggie Hemingway died at the age of
47 shortly after completing it. Four stories are told in alternating
sections, each taking place at a different time and place in history. There
is no obvious relation between the characters and events but in each there
is a sense that something very nasty is about to happen and there is a
witness to the growing evil who does nothing to avert it.
We observe the courtship of a young Duchess in the Veneto in 1528 through
the eyes of one of the Duke's secretaries; two French reed cutters, one of
them dumb, witness their psychopathic neighbour's brutal treatment of his
wife in 1871; a wealthy woman is picked up by a bounder in a Kensington
hotel in 1928 and takes him off to her house in Keswick; a lonely spinster
intrudes on the happy marriage of a farmer's friendly wife in the West
Country in 1971 . . . The interwoven fragments of story get shorter and
closer together and come to a climax in the last pages with four women
meeting watery deaths. The horror bridges the centuries. The last three
pages are a tour de force in stream-of-consciousness writing. This kind of
thing can only be carried off by the very best and we have lost one of them
in Hemingway.
Grace Andreacchi is an American who writes about Paris in a way that is
sometimes surreal, hence her publisher's claim that she is 'in the tradition
of Djuna Barnes'. The difference is that the great Djuna knew what she was
doing; Andreacchi does not. The novel is wildly out of control,
exhibitionist and self-indulgent, veering from grim realism to high
surrealism, coy confessional to learned dissertation. However, it is seldom
dull.
It begins well with the narrator's wry description of her escape from the
Boston suburbs, her decrepit Paris apartment and her alcoholic
violin-playing lover, Stephane. The Stephane sequences are the best thing in
the book, dominated by images of shattered glass, music, predatory birds and
wolves. In contrast to the poetic language and the erudition displayed
elsewhere, sex is described either mechanically or with compulsive
alliteration. The latter is truly awful: 'He pricked and pushed with his
penis which protruded like a pink plant from his printed pants'. Even worse,
in a novel which (believe it or not after that) does sometimes soar, is a
bathetic use of the American wise-guy voice in sly asides. The true
surrealist has no ego; Andreacchi has too much.

OM AN INDIAN PILGRIMAGE by Geoffrey Moorhouse Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds
16.99, 254 pages
THE Mandukya Upanishad says, 'OM, this eternal word is all, what was, what
is and what shall be, and what is beyond eternity. All is OM . . . It is
beyond the senses and it is the end of evolution. It is nonduality and love.
He goes with self to the supreme Self who knows this, who knows this.'
Geoffrey Moorhouse has made many passages to India in the past 25 years; the
latest was to South India in 1992 and the outcome is this book. OM falls
somewhere between VS Naipaul and Jan Morris. If I were marooned on a desert
island I would not ask for OM, but I would take it with me on a train or an
aircraft journey. Its unhurried pace, gentle melancholy and occasional
flintiness would ease the tedium of a long flight.
Moorhouse gives an honourable reason for his 1992 trip to India: 'And here I
am again, on a further stage of my own Indian pilgrimage, hoping to
understand something more of the great subcontinent. Also, trying to find
another part of myself'. It is entirely possible for a man to find his
spiritual home in another country.
The key word is 'understanding'. Writers from the West so often come either
to applaud or to condemn. Others get smitten by India's holy men, many of
whom are dedicated frauds. Those who seek understanding are rare.
Ancient India lives on in South India. It is refreshing to find an author
spending three months visiting 12 cities and towns, none boasting the false
glamour and synthetic liveliness of Bombay or Delhi. Moorhouse, it appears
to me, has caught the spirit of the south. He has got Madras just right. He
is excellent on Pondichery, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and the Mother (I had a
brief glimpse of her in 1956. She inspired neither admiration nor awe in me.
Sai Baba also gets a benign dose of Moorhouse scepticism.)
OM has some utterly beautiful passages. The first sentence in the book
conquers the heart and soothes the mind. Stand on the southernmost tip of
India at Kanya Kumari, he writes, 'this is where India begins. On this curve
of land, whose stained shore is washed by the jade green sea, an entire
subcontinent is poised as if upon a sharpened point.'
India helped Moorhouse to some extent to come to terms with personal grief:
'India . . . has taught me no longer to strain and fret against my
inadequacy; for India was above anywhere else, the land where every
distinction of faith, every equivocation, every contradiction, every doubt,
every reticence was commonplace . . . I said my last prayer (at San Thome)
in India and asked that I might be allowed to return.'
OM is a sensitively written book by a man whose knowledge of India, her
religions, her past, her literature, is both vast and deep. A very
worthwhile read.

THE KENNETH WILLIAMS DIARIES edited by Russell Davies HarperCollins Pounds
20, 827 pages
I MUST first of all declare an interest, as I appear fitfully in these pages
as Kenneth's producer of the five shows we did together. This is revealed in
the tone of voice, often disapproving, that he reserved for those with whom
he was working. But what does not emerge (perhaps expurgated by Russell
Davies, as I am one of the few members of Kenneth's circle still alive) are
the many occasions when we were together as friends long before we became
colleagues; and the latter years, when we had drifted so far apart
professionally but resumed our friendship in what was to be the last year of
his life.
These diaries certainly have an unputdownable quality about them, with the
appeal of eavesdropping on the conversation of a unique personality. The
entry for April 8 1988 reads like an unmitigated howl of pain. And yet I
have singled this day out because I realise that it was the last time I was
to hear from him. As we were neighbours, he delivered this note to me by
hand:
My dear Michael 8.4.88
Thought of you ALL DAY yesterday. Tried to phone but your office no. which I
have proved useless. Wanted to ask if you'd seen the news about the death of
Myra De Croot? It is extraordinary cos she'd written to me saying she was
coming over to do Chat Shows here]] apropos her part in NEIGHBOURS]] Must
have been a very sudden death. She was 51.
(Thanks) for your card this morning. Yes - the ULCER is back with a
vengeance. Made me give up the fags. Said if the Zantac doesn't work THIS
time I'll have to be operated on + the surgeon added 'Sooner the better
because let's face it, you're no chicken . . .' They kept me in the Cromwell
for 2 days - tests etc. - Oh] How I HATE these places]
Love Kenneth. I have quoted this letter because there is still the glimmer
of humour which Kenneth tried to retain when talking among his friends,
saving his desolation for the diary. The tone of the reviewers of the diary
has reflected that strain of despair that underpinned Kenneth's existence.
But the diaries were not the whole of his existence; they cannot, do not,
convey the exhilaration that his very presence would produce. He surely must
have been the funniest man to have a conversation with; admittedly this
would usually mean the conversation would quickly devolve into a one-sided
affair because his erudition was skilfully blended with his sense of the
ridiculous, and he knew that he was most loved at his most outrageous.
The role that he seemed to play in public dwindled into a self-disgusted
observer of his own foibles when alone with pen and paper. This is the most
startling revelation of his diary. That he could have the prescience to
record, when only 21, while having a coffee in Fortes among his fellow
homosexuals, 'How many future tragedies were present tonight', explains
perhaps that he was always half in love with easeful death.
These diaries have enabled me to see in retrospect why so often our
professional sorties, starting out with hope and optimism, ended in a state
of stress. He realised that he did not seem to belong to any category of
artist - 'too good for tat, not good enough for the truly art-purposeful
Theatre.'
The legacy of Kenneth will be for all to share in the recordings of his BBC
shows; even now they are able to provoke hysterical laughter. For myself, I
have a constant personal reminder of the contribution he made to my career
as an impressario. The success of Share My Lettuce was for both of us a
crucial turning point; he became a comic actor of the first rank and I had
the conviction to continue as a producer after two disastrous starts. I see
every day of my working life, in the entrance to my office, a scroll which
he had designed and calligraphed and which reads:
Presented to Michael Codron
by the members of his company in the production entitled SHARE MY LETTUCE on
the occasion of its third London opening at the Garrick Theatre, subsequent
to the runs at the Lyric Theatre at Hammersmith and the Comedy Theatre,
Panton Str.

<TEXT>
MAKING ARISTOCRACY WORK: THE PEERAGE AND THE POLITICAL SYSTEM 1884-1914 by
Andrew Adonis Oxford Pounds 35, 311 pages
THIS IS a very important and salutary book. It is obviously an expanded Ph.
D. thesis, intent on nailing every generalisation to hard objective proof.
Although weighed down by tables, it is written with elegance and clarity.
I have argued for years that the right question to ask about the aristocracy
in the 19th century is not why it declined, but how did it survive. Bruised
it may have been by the extension of the franchise in 1867 and by the fall
in the value of land in the 1870s. Reform - the long, slow tentative
adoption of limited democracy throughout the century - may have acted more
like the death watch beetle attacking age-old oak than dry-rot racing
through the structures of British government. As Adonis makes clear, the
phantoms that horrified the peerage in the early 1880s were largely
imaginary. The power of the peerage remained great but they lacked political
will. They hated attending the House of Lords. It rarely met for more than
two or three hours in the late afternoon and rose before dinner.
In crises that threatened their powers they poured into London and filled
their Chamber, but these were very rare. More important than the House of
Lords was the aristocratic domination of the Commons, the Cabinet and the
vast and growing patronage of imperial as well as local government. The
aristocracy and its smaller element, the peerage, dominated the institutions
of government, great or small. And it was Salisbury who gave the necessary
leadership to these powerful political and social forces. Its mass base was
created by the Primrose League, an astonishingly effective political
machine.
That and 'platform speaking'. Addressing mass political rallies was a
novelty of the late 19th century. Salisbury (who loathed them) went
regularly to political rallies, so did Rosebery and the other 19 members or
relations of the peerage who made up his 1895 Cabinet. They were not only
peers - they were full-time professional politicians, superbly good in their
professional skills and as hard working as any cabinet minister today.
Adonis makes his case over and over again that the end of the 19th century
showed a resurgence of the aristocracy, particularly the peerage, whose
power was greater perhaps that that enjoyed in the early part of the
century. I hope his book puts an end to the Guttsman thesis that the
aristocracy began its demise with the Great Reform Bill and went downhill
until the present day.
However, there was a worrying institutional problem in the House of Lords
itself. Except in dealing with private bills, it was extremely inefficient.
Attendance was poor and interest not great. It was happy to leave matters to
the men of business so long as they did not rock the boat by hints of
reform. They filled the House every year to debate whether a man might marry
his deceased wife's sister - but rarely for anything else. Salisbury and
Rosebery saw the problem.
What they wanted was a hard working House of Lords, which is why they both
toyed with the idea of life peerages. The idea was, of course, rejected. The
Lords were more concerned with immediate self interest and power rather than
the long term, and they paid for it in 1911. Yet they still survived and, to
some extent, they revived when life peerages became a reality.
The effects of the survival of hereditary power on society, on culture and
on the nature of our institutions still needs work before we can talk about
the fall of the aristocracy. It is still with us, it still permeates British
life: John Major's classless society is almost as remote as the stars.

SURVIVOR'S SONG: LIFE AND DEATH IN THE AFRICAN WILDERNESS by Delia and Mark
Owens HarperCollins Pounds 17.50, 306 pages
AT THE HAND OF MAN: PERIL AND HOPE FOR AFRICA'S WILDLIFE by Raymond Bonner
Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.95, 322 pages
THE MYTH OF WILD AFRICA: CONSERVATION WITHOUT ILLUSION by Jonathan S Adams
and Thomas O McShane W W Norton Pounds 15.95, 266 pages
AFRICAN animals, particularly the elephant, have become one of the most
powerful symbols of the conservation movement, and one of the most divisive.
Rows between conservationists centre on whether the the 1989 ban on ivory
trading is the best way to safeguard their future. Some favour 'sustainable
harvesting' - farming elephants for meat and hides, and allowing hunters to
shoot them for sport, to raise money and give African countries a reason to
protect them. Most controversial is the allegation, increasingly made by
environmental groups, that the longest established international
conservation bodies are insensitive to African needs.
In Survivor's Song, Delia and Mark Owens put themselves among those who see
killing wildlife as defilement of paradise and the ivory ban as the best way
to stop the killing. The book begins with their expulsion from Botswana
following their criticism of the government for encouraging cattle farming
at the expense of wildlife. Their search for a 'new Eden' ends in the
wilderness of Zambia's Luangwa Valley.
The Owens are unashamed, particularly in the passages written by Delia, of
their romanticism. Delia 'craves sinking into Nature and learning her ways',
and they plead for their favourite elephant, Survivor, who escapes the
poachers: 'He just wants to eat these fruits, wander these hills, and live
with his own kind. It is not too much for his kind to ask, or for our kind
to give'.
But the confusion of their metaphor of paradise - their banishment from
Botswana was because of the government's sin, not theirs, they feel - sets
up an ambivalence towards Africans that runs through the book. They spend
more time describing what a hunted elephant might feel than on the feelings
of villagers whom they are trying to wean off poaching. Their identification
with animals also leads to uncomfortable anthropomorphisms, such as calling
a forest clearing filled with bones an 'elephant's Auschwitz'. In many
places the Owens appear to feel closer to animals than to people, even to
each other - they split at one point, disagreeing on how to fight poachers.
Much of the book is a gripping adventure, particularly the accounts of the
poachers' attempts to kill the couple. It has something of a happy ending -
the Owens say that when they started in 1986 the elephants were being
poached at the rate of 1000 a year, but that had fallen to 12 a year by the
end of 1991. But it is unclear whether this is due to their battles with the
poachers, their loans to villagers or the 1989 international ban on the
ivory trade. Their proposed solutions are also tentative - they hope that
tourism should be 'designed so that it does not disrupt the ecosystem', and
limited to old-fashioned walking safaris.
Raymond Bonner, a former reporter for the New York Times, gives in to no
such romanticism in At The Hand of Man. He accuses the World Wide Fund For
Nature, in particular, of being steered too much by public opinion during
emotional 1980s advertising campaigns, and for being driven against the
judgment of its scientists into supporting the ivory ban. He is hard headed
about his backing for 'sustainable' use of big animals, including culling
them when their numbers grow too large.
But although provocatively written, with an investigative journalist's eye
for where the money comes from and where it goes, it is clumsily expressed.
He uses layers of subclauses to capture the nuances of internal WWF
wranglings, in a way that eventually slows his argument.
His portrait of the WWF is also partly countered by the perceptiveness
demonstrated by Adams and McShane, who are longstanding WWF staff, in The
Myth of Wild Africa. In many ways, theirs is the most thoughtful of the
three books in analysing the reasons for the past intractability of the
problem.
Their target is the kind of romantic views espoused by the Owens: the
'comfortable belief that Africa is a paradise to be defended, even against
the people who have lived there for thousands of years'. They are at their
best in tracing through history and literature 'the deeply rooted concept of
wilderness that lies at the heart of the myth of wild Africa'. Instead they
argue that human population growth will increasingly affect even the
remotest areas and that 'traditional conservation, which saves animals at
the cost of people' is doomed.
So far, so convincing, but their proposal for joint African and Western
schemes which will 'eventually . . . give control back to the African
nations' is scarcely spelt out. As a result, their final wish for an
approach to conservation 'in which people and their needs are brought back
into the equation but the animals are not abandoned' looks - without more
elaboration - almost as wistful as the romanticism they have condemned.

GRAMMAR AND STYLE by Michael Dummett Duckworth,Pounds 8.95,125 pages
WHAT is the difference between a participle and a gerund? When is it
appropriate to use a semi-colon in one's writing, and when a colon? How
should prose style best serve readers' interests? The answers to these and
many allied questions are to be found in this instructive and entertaining
essay by Michael Dummett on the fundamentals of good English.
Until his retirement two years ago Dummett was Wykeham Professor of Logic at
Oxford. Goaded by signs of increasing illiteracy among university examinees,
he intended this concise guide to English for students. But the prevalence
of bad English in the quality press and broadcasting media - and among his
fellow dons - prompted him to offer it more widely. He performs a valuable
service. For, in just over a 100 pages, he provides most of what anyone
needs to know about the anatomy and physiology of English: which is to say,
its basic grammar and its proper use.
There is much talk about the problem faced by school-teachers in giving
their pupils a proficiency in written English. In my view the best way is to
make Latin compulsory to GCSE standard and to have all pupils write weekly
essays. In the current educational environment, with its flabby attitudes
and reluctance to make demands on schoolchildren, such a proposal will get
nowhere. The remedy is to encourage anyone who writes, by choice or
necessity, to check their use of language.
Dummett's first two chapters introduce grammatical basics. Without some
grasp of these no-one can hope to write accurately. The diseases of
inaccuracy, ambiguity and illogicality flourish when language is ignorantly
employed, and this subverts the end for which it exists; namely,
communication.
The remaining chapters deal with the science and art of writing. Shades of
meaning, prose style, the importance of correct punctuation and the niceties
of orthography are all considered and counselled. Dummett's wry humour is
liberally mixed with instruction throughout. Commenting on a tiresome
contemporary cliche he says: 'The sole lasting accomplishment of the now
defunct Social Democratic Party seems to have been to induce everyone to
misuse the tag 'breaking the mould.' It comes from Ariosto's Orlando
Furioso, in which the poet says of the Scottish hero, Zerbino, that 'Nature
made him, and then broke the mould', so that she could never make his like
again. To break the mould is therefore, in general, a deplorable, not an
admirable, thing.'
For Dummett, the fundamental rule of good writing is that it should leave
readers free to concentrate on the thought. Well-mannered prose does not
obtrude on the reader's notice; it is a transparent medium. It must
therefore say what the writer means, without ambiguity and without forcing
the reader to hunt through a tangle of inversions and dependent clauses to
extract a sense. And it should be free of such irritations as cliches, mixed
metaphors and misused terms. Dummett gives many examples of poor English,
many drawn from respectable sources.
Critics of Dummett have in the past claimed that his writings - mostly huge
philosophical treatises, although he has also written about voting systems
and card-games - themselves fail as models of clarity. This is unfair;
Dummett's philosophical work deals with extremely complicated ideas, but
always in forthright fashion. Dummett's best-known books, it is true, are
scarcely the stuff of bedtime reading; but it is the difficulty of the
issues they deal with, not the language they are written in, which makes
this so.
The best book ever written on how to use English well is the classic by
Robert Graves and Alan Hodges, The Reader Over Your Shoulder. Its two
authors randomly selected passages from Bertrand Russell, H G Wells, T S
Eliot, J M Keynes and others, and subjected them to devastating analyses for
faults of logical weakness, irrelevance, over-emphasis, false contrast,
misused terms, inappropriate and mixed metaphors, circumlocution, awkward
inversion, and a rash of other blemishes and errors besides. The lessons
they teach are unforgettable. That book is very difficult to find now, but
Dummett's guide is a worthy substitute. By its help the written tongue may
yet survive its present grim malaise.

COTTAGE TALES by John Clare Carcanet Pounds 9.95, 158 pages
JOHN CLARE: THE POET AND THE PLACE by Peter Moyse Crossberry Press, Helpston
Pounds 11.95, 120 pages
UNLIKE many other poets of the English countryside John Clare, who was born
200 years ago this week, had a thorough-going knowledge of every aspect of
rural life and he wrote about it without sentimentality. Given his
background, this is not surprising. Born in the small village of Helpston,
then in Northamptonshire now in in Cambridgeshire, to parents that Clare
himself described as 'illiterate to the last degree', he worked at a whole
range of physical tasks as the occasion and the needs of the family
demanded: as corn thresher, ploughboy, gardener (at Burghley House,
Stamford), lime-burner and pot boy at the local inn. And even when at the
height of his brief period of fame in the 1820s, he continued to plough the
land.
His 'conversion' to poetry took place at 13. He was lent a copy of Thomson's
Seasons, a sequence of vague pastoral encomiums that was much in vogue at
the beginning of the 19th century. The book made Clare's heart 'twitter with
joy'. By the time he had reached his 20s, his own verse had been brought to
the attention of John Keats' publisher, John Taylor, who released his first
collection of poetry in 1820: Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenes by
John Clare, a Northamptonshire Peasant - title fit to make a proud
provincial blench.
It was reprinted several times and Clare, on the wings of unanticipated
success, made several visits to distant London, where he had his portrait
painted by William Hilton (RA) and was generally lionised, at the age of 26,
as the capital's newest literary celebrity. Unfortunately, the succeeding
volumes sold less and less well. Clare, it seems, was unable to meet the
general public's - and his own publisher's - incessant demands for novelty.
In fact, by the middle of the 1820s his publisher, once a helpmate, had
become a torment. Why was this so?
Clare was a poet who worked by his own lights, spelling and punctuating
exactly as he saw fit, and writing the kind of poetry that, in the opinion
of his publisher, would be less and less likely to find appeal in the
market-place. Unlike some of the other great Romantics - Shelley, Wordsworth
and Coleridge, for example - Clare was not a man accustomed to seeing
sermons in stones. What he saw were the stones themselves, all that hard,
flinty glitter, and he did his utmost to describe them with a particularity
unequalled by any previous poet.
The countryside that surrounds Helpston, a terrain of harsh, spare beauty
even to this day, is flat, with a great expanse of sky. It was Clare's
ambition to preserve an honest record of it, and its customs, in the teeth
of the double despoliations of the Enclosure Acts and the advent of the
railways.
John Taylor attacked Clare repeatedly for using 'the language of common
everyday description' and for eschewing the pressing need to introduce an
element of human interest into his nature poetry. These were, after all, the
years in which the novel was coming into vogue. Poetry must be seen to
compete. Clare remained his vulgar self, obstinately inclined to write of
low rustic manners, doggedly refusing to soar into loftier regions.
Taylor cut his manuscripts ruthlessly, changed words, objected to the vivid
local usages that Clare felt most appropriate, and introduced an abundance
of punctuation so that the eyes of the middle-class country tasters from the
metropolis would glide smoothly from line to line and not be brought up
short by bewildering grammatical or orthographical idiosyncrasies. Nowadays
 -and it has taken this long for publishers to recognise that Clare was not
being deliberately wrong-headed and perverse when he chose, like Yeats, to
follow his own instincts - publishers print his poems just as he wrote them,
warts and all, and the lack of punctuation, we now see, helps to give them a
welling, teeming, gulping quality that adds to the richness of the poet's
own observations.
His later years were a protracted agony, the last quarter of a century being
spent in the Northampton asylum, where he continued to write, though now it
was poetry of a much more rootless kind. He had needed Helpston. Without the
familiarity of his home village, its sights, sounds and smells, he felt
wrenched up by the roots and tossed aside.
Two new books have been published to coincide with the bicentenary of
Clare's birth. Cottage Tales is a collection of narrative poems that Clare
intended to include in The Shepherd's Calendar, his third book of poems;
John Clare: the Poet and the Place juxtaposes poems by Clare with
photographs of some of the places in and around Helpston with which he would
have been familiar.
The excellent John Clare Society can provide a list of bicentenary events
(sae please) upon request to: Peter Moyse, The Stables, 1a West St,
Helpston, Peterborough PE6 7DU.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Sport: Faldo leads the charge - Derek Lawrenson watches the
best players in the world move up the leader board / Open Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER TWO first-class days at the Open and two rounds over which the game's
shot makers revelled in conditions ideal for their art, the big names
dominate the best leader board a major championship has seen for a long
time.
We are used to Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer and Fred Couples and Greg
Norman and Nick Price making their way up there eventually. But when, if
ever, have they done so this early and all together?
'The course is playing tough and that's why the best players are all bunched
at the top,' Norman said.
Norman is among the mentally scarred artists who have suddenly discovered
that they can think more clearly again. Their taut facial muscles have
softened, their smiles have returned, and we shall remember the small
footnotes that people like Mark Calcavecchia and Severiano Ballesteros have
made in this championship.
Who among the 28,000 spectators who risked fractured limbs on Thursday
walking along rolling hills made treacherous underfoot, will forget the
vivid reminder of the Spaniard's wizardry as he remembered how it felt to be
young again?
But the lord of the links remains Faldo. Yesterday he became the sixth
player and the first at Sandwich to score 63 in an Open. His course record
gives him a one shot lead from Langer with Norman and Couples a further
stroke behind.
'This is as good as it gets,' he said.
Ben Hogan once said that four perfect shots was as near as he ever got to a
perfect round. The Hoganesque Faldo recalled four yesterday, most notably a
50 yard chip-in for a birdie at the 14th, and a raking two iron that set up
the last of his eight threes. And so the number one and two ranked golfers
in the world - Faldo and Langer  - will be paired together in the final
group out today in the game's most prestigious event.
What added to all the delight was the stark contrast to the sense of
foreboding that existed on the eve of the Open. Players rarely moan in
advance about conditions. There's no sense in placing yourself two down
mentally before striking a ball in earnest. But the fairways at Royal St
George's do not roll gently in front of a player as they do, say, at
Muirfield or Birkdale. They are covered in small pimples of turf and when
these are baked motorway hard by months of hot sun then the element of
chance rises to unhealthily significant proportions.
And then there are the blind shots. Norman, who stands 6ft 2in tall, reckons
there are 14. Asking a player to hit a blind approach shot and, oh, pitch it
40 yards short to take account of the wind and the scorched earth and then
hope for a kind bounce places fate far too highly up the list of questions
that a prospective Open champion should be required to answer.
The rain changed all that, and yesterday's stiff westerly breeze gave the
game's artists all the further encouragement they needed. Langer and
Couples, two players who easily fall within that definition, were the first
players to make their presence felt yesterday. This was a tad surprising
since on Tuesday, Couples had said he had no chance of winning, and on
Wednesday Langer said that he had little chance either.
Couples admitted that sloth had got the better of him. He used to be a couch
potato in his college days until his wife, Debbie, gave him the proverbial
kick up the backside. But Debbie hitched up her mini-skirts last year and
moved on and Fred has been buried ever since in divorce paperwork and
re-runs of old American television sit-coms.
'With everything that's been going on, I've just been a bit lazy,' he said.
The Open was to be merely the start of a return to serious competition, but
the American possesses a natural talent that borders on the outrageous and
so removing the layers of rust is not the problem it might have been for
others.
Birdies tended to come in pairs for Couples yesterday: At the second and the
third, for example, and at the 12th and the 13th. At the 16th he had an 8ft
birdie putt that brought the course record of 64 within his compass. But he
missed it and dropped shots at the 17th and the 18th holes. Still, he
finished with a 66, and an eminently useful six under par total. Not bad for
someone with no chance.
Langer arrived at an official function on Tuesday evening, looking like
someone had strapped a plank of wood to his back. He said that his neck was
still troubling him and his ball striking was not as he would like and so
naturally everyone who likes a bet and who possessed this inside knowledge
put large amounts of money on him. In every great golfer there is the touch
of the hypochondriac. Hence the cliche: beware the injured golfer.
A piece on this Open without mentioning John Daly, the man who has given new
meaning to the phrase: daily papers? That would be a novelty. It would also
be wrong. The American hit a 66. And that included a double bogey six, with
three putts from 4ft at the 17th. They even came out of the hospitality
units, that for the first time in an Open have encroached along the 18th
fairway, to watch him finish.
And so to the final 36 holes. The week began with stories about Payne
Stewart's enlarged heart. With so many good players in contention a big
heart will be a heck of an asset tomorrow.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT WAS the motoring equivalent of dining in three-star Michelin restaurants
two days running.
Come to France, Chrysler-Jeep UK had said. Helicopter from Nice to Monaco,
drive a four-litre Jeep Wrangler to the Carlton at Cannes for tea. Switch to
a Viper for a cruise along the Promenade des Anglais and out into the Alpes
Maritimes for the night. Drive the Viper to Monaco next morning for coffee
then Jeep to Nice for the flight home.
That was Wednesday and Thursday.
Join us at Goodwood on Friday, Aston Martin had said. Try some of our latest
cars on the old motor racing circuit. Stay as long as you like. Have a spot
of lunch.
What could one say but yes?
I will come to the Jeep Wrangler in a moment. But first, the Chrysler Viper
and the Aston Martin Virage, Volante and Vantage. Do not let the 'V' names
confuse you. The only things they have in common are buckets of horsepower
and vastly more potential performance than can possibly be used on the road.
Both cars make personal statements about their owners. Aston Martin V8s are
as quintessentially English and hand built as a Savile Row suit or a pair of
Lobb shoes.
They are for seriously rich people with a library of motor cars. People who
may decide to drive the Aston Martin up to Scotland for the Glorious Twelfth
because it is sportier than the Rolls-Royce and, I mean, we can always send
on the luggage in the Range Rover, can't we?
One feels that if Rolls-Royce had ever made a sports two-plus-two, it would
have been rather like an Aston Martin Virage, Volante or Vantage.
A Chrysler Viper is not like that at all. It is an outrageous car; an
eight-litre, 400 horsepower, V-10 engined monster with two seats and tyres
so wide they look like rubber rollers. It has the finesse of a battle tank.
Even before you turn the key and set the 10 cylinders bellowing, it exudes
excitement. I loved it.
Traffic on the Promenade des Anglais was as free flowing as a tailback on
the M25. But the Viper's clutch is miraculously light when you think of the
muscle it has to transmit. The steering is generously power assisted. As an
attention getter, it is unmatched. When I stopped at the lights,
motor-cyclists drew alongside, workmen leaned out of vans to ask what it
was, how fast it went (more than 165mph/265kph) and how much it cost (around
Pounds 55,000 when it reaches Britain).
The great lump of an engine is based on a truck diesel. Lamborghini (owned
by Chrysler) lent a hand developing it into a petrol engine for the Viper.
It has so much torque (pulling power) that for low-speed town driving, the
six-speed gearbox skips second and third and goes directly from first to
fourth. At 80mph (130kph) on the autoroute in sixth gear, the engine is
hardly more than idling. It is not a high-tech engine; and so low stressed
it should run untemperamentally for years.
Driving a Viper on the road is a great experience, even though one can only
scratch its potential. Having tried one a year ago on a Detroit proving
ground's handling circuit, I know it sticks to the road like glue and
accelerates like a rocket. But only drivers with quick reactions should give
those 400 horses their heads through curves.
Aston Martins, like Ferraris, are different animals when driven on circuits,
not public roads full of lesser cars. A Virage, Volante or Vantage (or for
that matter a Ferrari 512) feels as wide as a bus in a country lane. But it
shrinks in the privacy and unlimited elbow room of a race track on which a
handful of cars are all going the same way. In Park Lane or Piccadilly the
rich furnishings of an Aston Martin impress.
On Goodwood's short straights, fast bends and tight corners, you learn that
inside all this extravagantly expensive (from Pounds 133,574 to Pounds
177,600) luxury package there is an athletic car itching to get out.
All Aston Martins have 5,340 cc V8 engines with twin camshafts operating
four valves per cylinder. The standard Virage hardtop coupe or Volante
cabriolet do 155mph (250kph) the Vantage 170mph (274kph).
I did not drive the 550 horsepower Vantage, which sounded like a low-flying
aircraft as it accelerated out of the chicane. But former Grand Prix driver
Peter Gethin, who gives all Vantage buyers a course of instruction at
Goodwood, took me round for a few quick laps. It was not a white knuckle
experience; just enjoyable, with the same tinge of apprehension one feels
when putting a horse at a fence.
And the leather-seated Jeep Wrangler Limited? I nearly forgot. On a hot
sunny day, hood and doors off, it was great transport in the south of
France. It would be, too, for extroverts in Britain, drawn by its promise of
a wild blue yonder lifestyle, even if they only drive it in London SW3.
It will see-off most cars up to 60mph (100kph) and felt fine, if a mite
draughty, at 80mph (130kph) on the autoroute, at which there was a lot of
power in hand. All this, with more off-road capability than 99 per cent of
owners will ever need, for Pounds 14,995.

JUAN Antonio Samaranch calls it a Golden Rule. While it might occasionally
be necessary to bribe or flatter the International Olympic Committee it is
never good tactics to visibly bully them. The US Congress appears bent on
such a course, with its opposition to Beijing's candidature for the 2000
Olympics.
'We are a bit surprised at the attitude,' said Samaranch, in London this
week and using the royal plural which he favours. 'We remember very well
that in the 1984 Games at Los Angeles the Chinese were received as heroes.
And now they have Most Favoured Nation status in trade with America. So we
do not understand this change. We have to respect all the governments of the
world and work with them. But they have to respect us and our independence.'
In case such high-minded appeals fail he revealed that lobbyists are working
Capitol Hill on behalf of the IOC. Samaranch expects no long-term problems
from the US. Furthermore, many lobbyists in Washington work on corporate
accounts and many big businesses stand to benefit from the rapid
internationalisation of China which the 2000 Games could help stimulate.
Many of the IOC's 90 members are not from the west and tend to resent
weight-throwing by Uncle Sam. It may also prove counter-productive come the
privacy of the vote in Monte Carlo on September 23. Four voters have already
indicated that they will support Beijing to show that they cannot be pushed
around.
With 10 weeks to go, the temperature is rising among the bidding cities. The
publication last Monday of the IOC's technical report added fuel. It gave
Sydney highest marks, saying that it 'felt the concept of the Games was
based on priority to the athletes'. The Australian city has long been a
front-runner, so the report was little more than another A+ for a high
achiever.
Perhaps more interesting was the bucketing it gave the bid from Brasilia.
Senior IOC figures have already privately dismissed the Brazilian effort as
the worst in Olympic history. Samaranch conceded in London that he had asked
them to withdraw, but Brasilia had complied with the regulations and he was
powerless.
In Monaco, the voting will take several rounds, with the least-supported
city dropping out each time until a clear majority is achieved. Stories are
emerging of a Latin-American first-round block vote, orchestrated by Fifa
president Joao Havelange, to prevent Brasilia's humiliation. If such a
scheme mustered, say, just 10 votes on the first ballot, when members often
vote to fly the regional flag, it could knock out candidates such as
Manchester or Sydney.
Samaranch concedes the possibility but shrugs the resigned answer of the
diplomat he once was. 'I cannot properly tell my members not to vote for
them. And if I did, maybe they don't follow my advice when they write on the
ballot slips.'
He had just returned from a visit to Manchester, inspecting the extant and
planned Olympic facilities. He found the northern city in jubilant mood,
following the technical report which had placed it second to Sydney and far
ahead of Beijing. Comparing Manchester's present state with his visit four
years ago in connection with the bid for the 1996 Games, Samaranch was
complimentary. 'Manchester is now a bid with stones, not just words,' he
said, referring to the building projects under way or just completed, such
as the Olympic terminal at the airport.
In spite of Samaranch's policy of verbal and voting neutrality - he does not
vote in the choice of city - there are signals that Beijing is his baby. He
said that he was pleased that the Olympics are now symbolically and
commercially powerful enough to be the engine of change, although he is
careful to insist that the IOC is not a deliberate agent of 'political
change.'
'The 1964 Games in Tokyo were the turning point for the post-war Japanese
economy,' he said. 'Seoul brought big changes in politics and economics. It
is now the second most powerful economy in Asia and they have a full
democratic government.'
Asked if he thought choosing China would be a high-risk strategy for the
IOC, Samaranch accepted that it would divide the Olympic family into two
camps. 'Some people say that to support Beijing is to support the Chinese
government. Others believe that it would support the possibility of huge
economic and political changes in China.' In other words, the Olympic
movement, as the good fairy, is able to achieve through 'Higher, Faster,
Stronger' what the polity of nations assembled elsewhere have been unable to
manage.
Samaranch will not necessarily get his way. Bidding cities have seldom been
able to assemble enough committed friends to guarantee a win. If that had
been true they would have won at the first ballot.
'The crucial thing at this stage is not to have enemies,' said a senior,
highly experienced Manchester figure. On that basis, the most likely betting
order is Sydney and Manchester followed by Beijing. Do not stake the rent
money on Istanbul, Berlin or Brasilia.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Sport: Laughter in the rain - Derek Lawrenson on a downpour
that washed away the worries of the world's top players / Open Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAIN that fell in biblical proportions on the eve of the Open saved the
tournament from being decided by the luck of the bounce. The waters doused
fairways so hard that cruel bounces would have been the rule rather than the
exception.
When the championship began, an entire flock of mentally scarred golfers
suddenly discovered they could think straight again. In some instances, this
had not been the case for months. Now the taut facial muscles softened, the
smiles returned. The consequence is that the Open goes into its final two
rounds with the strong possibility that it could be one to remember.
Was there one heart among the 28,000 spectators who risked fractured limbs
on Thursday, walking along rolling hills made treacherous underfoot, that
did not swell as Severiano Ballesteros remembered how it felt to be young
again? And what about Greg Norman, or Fred Couples, or Mark Calcavecchia, or
Jack Nicklaus? What a thrilling coincidence that they should all come up
with an answer to their indifferent form at the same time. What has made the
first half of the event even more of a joy is the contrast it offered to the
sense of foreboding that hung over the proceedings on Wednesday afternoon.
Players rarely moan in advance about conditions. There is no sense in
placing yourself two down mentally before striking a ball in earnest. But
the fairways at Royal St George's do not roll gently in front of a player as
they do, say, at Muirfield or Birkdale. They are covered in small pimples of
turf and when these are baked motorway-hard by months of hot sun then the
element of chance rises to unhealthily proportions.
Then there are the blind shots. Norman, who stands 6ft 2ins, reckons there
are 14. Asking a player to hit a blind approach shot and pitch it 40 yards
short to take account of the wind and the scorched earth and then hope for a
kind bounce places fate too highly up the list of questions that a
prospective Open champion should be required to answer.
The wet stuff changed all that, and when yesterday brought a stiff westerly
breeze, the correct balance had been restored and the tournament was placed
back in the hands of the shot makers. Bernhard Langer and Couples, two
players who easily fall within that definition, were the first players to
make their presence felt yesterday. This was a tad surprising because on
Tuesday, Couples had said he had no chance of winning, and on Wednesday,
Langer had said he had little chance either.
Couples admitted that sloth had got the better of him. He used to be a couch
potato in his college days until his wife, Debbie, gave him the proverbial
kick up the backside. But Debbie hitched up her mini-skirts last year and
moved on and Fred has been buried ever since in divorce paperwork and
re-runs of old American TV sit-coms.
'With everything that's been going on, I've just been a bit lazy,' he said.
The Open was to be merely the start of a return to serious competition, but
the American possesses a natural talent that borders on the outrageous and
so removing the layers of rust is not the problem it might have been for
others.
Birdies tended to come in pairs for Couples yesterday. At the second and the
third, for example, and the 12th and the 13th. At the 16th he had an 8ft
birdie putt that brought the course record of 64 within his compass. But he
missed it and dropped shots at the 17th and the 18th holes. Still, he
finished with a 66, and an eminently useful six-under-par total. Not bad for
someone with no chance.
Langer arrived at an official function on Tuesday evening looking like
someone had strapped a plank of wood to his back. Guardsman straight wasn't
in it. He said that his neck was still troubling him and his ball striking
was not as he would like, and so naturally everyone who likes a bet and who
possessed this inside knowledge put large amounts of money on him. In every
great golfer there is the touch of the hypochondriac. Hence the cliche:
beware the injured golfer.
Mental bruising is far more difficult to cure. Watch Ballesteros and Norman
on the practice ground and they hit drives that do not deviate by more than
10 yards either left and right. Contrast that to the play itself.
Ballesteros's opening drive in the championship was in the thick rough. His
drive to the 17th was almost as wide as it was long. He told a glorious fib
afterwards, saying he had only missed three fairways but who cared because
his short game provided vivid reminders of the most sublime talent we shall
ever see. They even came out of the hospitality units.
For the first time in an Open, these have encroached along the 18th fairway.
They are still a discreet distance from the action and do not encroach on
spectator paths. It is not like a tacky sponsored event. All the same, let
us hope this is not the thin end of the wedge.
A piece on the Open without a mention of the man who has given new meaning
to the words daily papers? That would be a novelty. John Daly's day will
come, but not this time. This weekend the more experienced shotmakers will
dominate TV screens. The week began with stories about Payne Stewart's
enlarged heart. With so many good players in contention, a big heart will be
quite an asset tomorrow.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Gardening: Blossom with the scents of romance - Robin Lane
Fox finds philadelphus makes a splendid substitute for reluctant roses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALREADY this season, roses have excelled themselves and even non-gardeners
have noticed them. Roses do not like my stony soil and I have been watching
another great season instead, not on struggling Kathleen, Harrop or mottled
Louise Odier but from sweet clouds of flower on shrubs which illumine an
entire evening. I mean the orange blossoms of British gardens, still known
as syringea among older gardeners but as philadelphus to the horticulturally
correct.
To me, they are orange blossom because the name does them justice. They are
powerfully romantic, stirring the senses of sight and smell. The scent of a
full-flowering philadelphus lifts me away to contradictory times and places:
to late June evenings in London when the cocktails turn into a party; or
early April in those stolen weeks of early blossom when true orange trees
are flowering in the southern Mediterranean.
You cannot be in two places at once, except in the imagination, but you can
pay a tribute to the philadelphus during this weekend as the main season
ends. If you want to tidy up the bush, cut back the wood which has flowered
but leave the younger, emerging shoots alone. Orange blossom flowers next
year on this year's young growth.
The ignorant way to treat them is to go out into the garden where an old
philadelphus Virginal is beginning to block the path, and set about it in
the evening when the fancy takes you. Cut it only within the next two weeks
and distinguish between the older, flowered wood and the unflowered, which
must be left alone.
There is a myth that philadelphuses are much the same and last for only one
glorious fortnight. True, they are all white; but within this whiteness,
they are not all sweet, and their shapes and markings vary as widely as
their size and season. By now, I think I have tried most of them, although
40 varieties are listed in Britain, increasing yearly as other good ones
emerge from America.
Nobody, it seems, yet sells the earliest pair, with each of which I once
co-habited in Germany. Shcrenkii begins to flower late in May, followed
closely by the lovelier Magdalenae, which is a wild Chinese variety with
grey leaves. Neither is especially scented, if I remember correctly, but
could they not go on general UK release?
Instead, my year begins early in June with Atlas, bought five years ago on
'spec' from Hopleys in Hertfordshire. Atlas is tall and unscented, but its
wonderfully plain white flowers have peaked while the rest of you are
starting to notice your conventional forms. At the other extreme, another
three weeks of orange blossom still stretch before those of you who bother
to hunt it out.
Among the breeders' forms, the latest is Innocence, a sweet and rather thin
bush distinguished by flecks of cream on its green leaves. The latest,
however, are two wild forms: Incarnus, which is scented like a hawthorn, and
Insignis, which is better because its leaves are glossy. People who want a
longer season should hunt them out from their few suppliers.
Those who want a quiet life should bless the French and continue to opt for
their superb creation, Belle Etoile. After years of experiment, I have
reached the same conclusion: the public favourite is the best. Its flowers
have a pink-purple centre and pointed petals, and the scent is beyond
compare.
If you want a double-flowered form as well, the best two are Virginal and
the much scarcer Minnesota Snowflake, which looks like a snowstorm when its
flowers bend the branches to the ground. In Britain, Virginal is the common
one, notorious for doing the opposite and becoming bare at the bottom
beneath its dark green leaves. Virginal, therefore, is the one variety which
needs to be pruned hard from its early youth.
Is there something smaller, scented and special? Yes, both in shape and also
in the size of flower. Among the lower-growing varieties, Sybille is much
the best of the various small forms which are now sold in Britain, although
it spreads to about 6ft with age. Among the small double forms, the best is
Frosty Moon. Together, they answer people who complain that their town
gardens are too small for a proper, scented orange blossom.
Among those with small flowers, there is one for people who say their garden
is too dry and shaded to be worth much trouble. Under tall trees, early in
June, you should try the oldest and sweetest of the varieties long known in
Europe: plain old Coronarius, which has the stamina to put up with neglected
life in drab, forgotten corners of London beyond the Thames. The flowers
give a heavenly scent.
Years ago, at school, the sight of these shrubs in summer reminded me of
other, unregulated worlds. Remove them and high summer will not be the same,
not just in those hours of direct sunlight when even a white flower glares
under the impact, but during those late hours of garden prowling when the
moon is coming up all orange and only the sweetest, palest and brightest
show up. One big bush of Virginal can match the moon by twilight: even in
this year, there is life without roses, and I doubt if our philadelphus has
ever made better use of it.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Fishing: Down-at-eel duo's Test catch special
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNING: there are aspects of the following narrative which some may find
offensive. There is no sex, gratuitous or otherwise, and all gross and vile
language has been edited out. But there are scenes which may be considered
depraved. They involve, among other things, a manure heap, worms and eels.
I fear that I could incur the disgust of the purist/traditionalist - the man
who splutters at limited-over cricket, quivers at the prospect of
professional rugby union, and believes politicians should put the interests
of the country before their own. Such a man (if he knows anything about the
river Test in Hampshire) will take a dim view of someone who, invited to
fish on the most famous trout stream in the world, arrives harbouring
ambitions against eels.
It is difficult to convey to a non-angler the degree of the impropriety. To
appear at Henley in a kayak, at Lord's with a baseball bat, or to shoot at a
crow on a grouse moor might give some idea of my offence.
I could not help it, though. I know I should have been thinking of trout as
I bowled down the Test valley past villages like Bossington and Mottisfont,
hallowed by dry fly men through the ages. But the eels kept intruding. In my
car, next to the fly rod and waders, was the eel tackle.
The eel gets a bad press. It is despised and reviled, relegated to the
piscatorial ghetto. Its appearance is hideous. Its sliminess and convulsive
muscularity make it horrible to touch. Its feeding habits are not
salubrious. It lurks in dark places, crawls along ditches at night, and
travels halfway around the world to mate.
My defence of my conduct is that it was going to be a long day and a hot
one; that I knew the trout would not rise properly until the evening; that I
wished to defy convention; and that I have a soft spot for eels. So does my
friend Stephen, who had also been invited, which was why we were soon
scavenging in a large manure heap for nasty brandling worms.
While the others dozed in the heat of the afternoon, the hunters hunted. We
stalked the banks, searching the water for the tell-tale wave of an eelish
tail or the movement of its questing snout. Against the pale, chalky bottom
they showed up well. Once located, the fun began.
The skill was to land the worms a foot or so beyond the snout, to see the
bait on the gravel, and to wait for the savour to activate the eel's
foraging instincts. As often as not, the snout would eventually move up
towards the worms, descend on them, then drift away. A sharp strike, a brief
tussle, and the thrashing beast was on the bank. A boot was then jammed on
its neck while the hook was removed, and into the bucket it went.
It took us a while to master this new art. With only one rod there were
disagreements of a who-does-what nature. The heat and the tension rendered
us somewhat overwrought. Worms were cast round rushes, strikes were missed,
oaths were uttered. But, by the end of the session, there were half-a-dozen
in the bucket and the talk was of eel fillets on the barbecue. Stephen, an
expert in such matters, described the technique of skinning. Nails came into
it, and pliers, but I shall spare you the grislier details.
I would, however, like to commend the attitude taken by our hosts. They
were, initially, uncomprehending. Requests for a garden fork and directions
to the manure were received with bemusement. Unanswered questions - 'Can
they really be serious?' - hung in the air. But when they knew we were
happy, they were happy, too, which made them the best sort of hosts. And
when it comes to entertaining small children, live eels in a bucket beat a
dead trout any time.
Eventually, we exhausted the thrills of eel-hunting and our minds were
recalled to higher things, such as the spotted trout. A delicious evening
fell. As the sun declined, taking the glare off the water, the river came to
life. Sedges began to hatch, and the trout to chase them.
Stephen, who had removed his trousers because of the heat and was standing
in the water in a pair of green checked underpants, rose and missed a fish
four times. He looked at his hook, found there wasn't one, put on a new fly,
caught a chub and yelled with rage and disbelief. Soon, though, he was
catching proper fish. We all were.
A glowing moon rose behind us, and between it and the molten sky in the west
flowed the Test, dark and alive with feeding fish. I had a brace of spanking
grayling and three trout, all returned. The last fish was a violent,
hook-jawed bruiser which must have been close in weight to the four-pounder
I had landed in the morning before eel frenzy took hold. Thanks to Test
trout, Test eels and kind friends, it had been a magical day.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Property: Shropshire, county with a split personality - In a
region where England and Wales meet, Gerald Cadogan finds the landscape
beguiling and no lack of attractive houses for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHOOSE your bridge when you enter Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire
that sits on a promontory above a large horseshoe bend in the river Severn.
If you come from the left on the map, it is the Welsh bridge; from the
right, the English. For centuries that choice - England or Wales - has
influenced this old border capital and its county.
Shrewsbury is an attractive town, packed with impressive buildings. Many are
half-timbered, painted black and white and with overhanging eaves in the
style that continues into Cheshire and Wales.
Sometimes, brick replaces the wattle and daub filling between the beams.
There are grand 18th and 19th century houses, and the glorious 1792 round
church of St Chad designed by George Steuart.
Shrewsbury has had less post-war redevelopment than most county towns;
indeed, it has, to some extent, missed out on growth as the Japanese have
located their factories at Telford, in east Shropshire. But with the new A5
Shrewsbury bypass linking to the M54 and M6, west Shropshire will prosper
now that it is more accessible.
Birmingham airport is less than an hour away by road (although north
Shropshire people use Manchester) and London 2 1/2 hours. Unfortunately,
train services are no longer so good.
The county is extraordinarily beautiful, with long views and large valleys
interrupted by the small mountains of the Wrekin, Wenlock Edge and the Long
Mynd, and the hills of Wales on the skyline. There are sheep in plenty, and
market gardening.
When you look down from Clee Hill, over south Shropshire into Herefordshire
and Worcestershire, the pattern of small fields and rolling country could be
a Sienese painting, if in green rather than the Tuscan beige.
As elsewhere, the housing market has been sluggish. But Anthony Clay, of
Smith-Woolley, says it is picking up a little although remaining sticky
around the Pounds 250,000-Pounds 350,000 range. Having 32 estate agents in
Shrewsbury means considerable competition, and a danger that agents may
over-value houses to secure vendors' business. There is always a shortage of
good houses to sell in such a settled county where people live near their
jobs, as they have done for ages. The new roads may well affect this,
though.
In Shrewsbury, Cooper &amp; Green offers a substantial Georgian town house (155
Abbey Foregate, just before the English bridge) at an enticing Pounds
170,000 although it needs some work. At the same price is a half-timbered,
black-and-white, 15th century cottage called Wayside in Eaton Constantine,
eight miles east of the town and close to the M54.
Nearby, for Pounds 160,000, is a brick and timber cottage in Aston called
The Thatches (agent: John German). This is also the price of Wadboro Thatch,
at Haytons Bent, close to the attractive old town of Ludlow (Cooper &amp;
Green).
For Pounds 107,500, there is Rose Cottage in Condover, five miles south of
Shrewsbury; while Pounds 178,000 is being asked for the four-bedroomed
Waterside Cottage, beside the Shropshire Union canal at St Martins near
Oswestry, in the northwest of the county (both from John German). At
Marshbrook, between Church Stretton and Craven Arms in south Shropshire,
Pounds 155,000 secures the Victorian brick Cwm Head House (agent: Balfour &amp;
Cooke).
At nearby Cardington Shoot, the grade II-listed Rough Shoot Farm is a
medieval cruck hall with Tudor and 18th century additions in stone,
half-timbering and brick. This good example of Shropshire vernacular costs
around Pounds 225,000 from John German, which also is selling the 17th
century stone and half-timbered Chatwall Home Farm, a mile away, for Pounds
280,000.
A mile further in the lovely south Shropshire countryside, Smith-Woolley is
offering Park House at Plaish, also in stone, for Pounds 270,000. On its
books also is the half-timbered and brick Upper Monkhall at Monkhopton,
south of Much Wenlock, for around Pounds 400,000 including a stone barn and
seven acres. The site used to be a farm for the monks of Wenlock Abbey.
The same agent (with Carter Jonas) is selling the stone-built Woodhouse Farm
at Wyke, north-east of Much Wenlock and west of Ironbridge, for Pounds
350,000.
The handsomest brick dwelling on the market is Farmcote House at Claverley,
between Bridgnorth and Wolverhampton, which Balfour &amp; Cooke offers at over
Pounds 400,000.
Two brick houses for sale near Shrewsbury, through Cooper &amp; Green, are The
Lynches at Yockleton (originally 17th century, Grade II, Pounds 240,000) and
The Grange at Upton Magna (18th century, Pounds 250,000).
In north Shropshire, Hampton House at Welshampton, near Ellesmere, dates
from around 1830 and was built for the Tophams, who owned Aintree racecourse
 -famous for the Grand National.
Smith-Woolley is selling it at Pounds 340,000 along with Ellesmere House in
Ellesmere; this originally was the Steward's House for the Earl of
Bridgewater's estates and lately has been a home run by the county council,
the vendor.
The garden has a fine cedar tree and runs down to the Mere, Price: around
Pounds 285,000.
Two Victorian vicarages on offer are at Fauls Green, near Whitchurch, built
solidly by the local lord in 1857 with Staffordshire blue diamond patterning
on the red brick and now enhanced by an indoor swimming pool (Smith-Woolley:
Pounds 395,000); and at Easthope, near Much Wenlock (Balfour &amp; Cooke: over
Pounds 250,000).
Shropshire's most unusual property for sale is the grade II Rowton Castle,
10 miles west of Shrewsbury and a mixture of medieval, William and Mary, and
Regency Gothic.
Now a hotel popular for wedding receptions, it is being sold by receivers
through Balfour &amp; Cooke for Pounds 495,000. With 19 bedrooms for letting, 17
acres and what is said to be the largest cedar in the country, it looks a
snip.
Further information from: Balfour &amp; Cooke, Shrewsbury (0743-241181); Carter
Jonas, Bridgnorth (0746-761711); Cooper &amp; Green, Shrewsbury (0743-232244);
John German, Shrewsbury (0743-231661); Smith-Woolley, Shrewsbury
(0743-232477).

FT  17 JUL 93 / Travel: A perfect spot, it rains and there's nothing to do -
Doug Sager explores the primeval beauty of the Queen Charlotte Islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOUG SAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOPHISTICATED travellers have been hard hit by the trickling of wanderlust
down to the masses, cheap long-haul flights and the opening of borders
closed for generations. Where can they go that the neighbours haven't been?
Where can they go that has not been 'discovered'? One answer is the Queen
Charlotte Islands.
There is absolutely nothing to do on the Charlottes. The inhabited part, to
the north, is a time warp of small-town life, where the world's largest
black bears routinely trash the municipal dump looking for leftovers and
where traffic is entertainment rather than a nuisance.
Conversely, the southern archipelago, populated by a handful of humans, is a
living museum of flora and fauna untouched by the last ice age 10,000 years
ago. The world's most impressive totem poles, left standing in deserted
Haida Indian villages, are the only guardians of what was once a bountiful
and artistically brilliant civilisation.
How do you get there? First go to Vancouver on the misty and drizzly western
coast of Canada. Then fly direct or travel north to Prince Rupert and take
the meandering coastal ferry, 95km across the shallow Hecate Strait, which
is racked by some of the biggest tidal shifts on the planet. When you reach
the Queen Charlotte airport at Sandspit or cross on the local ferry to the
main town of Queen Charlotte City, you will know what rain is.
The Charlottes, as everyone calls them, are an arrowhead-shaped grouping of
islands breaking up into smaller shapes as they stretch to the south-east.
Graham Island, to the north, where the 6,000 people live, is almost as big
as the other 150 islands and islets together. Everywhere the climate is wet
and fecund. This is a rainforest in the northern hemisphere.
Logging is the big business in the Charlottes, with whole islands clear-cut
like a Mohican with stubble. Pitched battles were fought over clear-cutting
in the 1980s, with mainland environmentalists joining the politically savvy
Haida in a coalition against the logging barons and the provincial
government. There is still an emotional divide between what locals refer to
as the 'hippies' and the 'rednecks.'
The Haida, who once flourished everywhere in the southern archipelago, now
live in reservations outside the main towns on the northern island. Their
artistic tradition has been largely preserved, and they are culturally alert
and relatively enterprising.
Haida activists have been negotiating aggressively with the Canadian
government for administrative rights over the entire southern chain. Haida
'watchmen,' a kind of tribal militia, have travelled to the Amazon to advise
Brazilian tribes in their struggles to preserve the rainforest.
The Haida call the southern islands of South Moresby 'Haida Gwaii', or 'the
place of wonder.' There are no roads and no way to visit these islands
except by boat. Helicopters and float planes fly over the islands but are
forbidden to land in sensitive areas. Kayak tours are popular with the
ecological, bearded crowd, but the waters around the Charlottes are cold and
camping is certainly no more attentive to the environment than sleeping on a
yacht.
The Charlottes are sometimes called the Canadian Galapagos, because of the
unique species preserved there when the last ice age passed the islands by.
Animals and plants abound. Unique species include senecio newcombei, a
yellow flowering perennial daisy, and the world's largest black bear. There
are unique types of pine marten, deer mouse, hairy woodpecker, saw whet owl
and Stellar's jay. There are also six unique species of moss and liverwort.
The world's largest population of Peale's peregrine falcons nests in the
Charlottes. Bald eagles perch in house-sized lofts high up 600-year-old
trees, waiting for you to toss them a fish for the photo-opportunity of a
lifetime. There are more eagles here than anywhere else in Canada. But the
more elusive black-footed albatross has an even bigger wingspan, and seems
to prefer popcorn, heavily buttered, to fish.
Fishing, as I was taught by my boat owner's four-year-old daughter,
Charlotte, consists of throwing a line into the water, counting to 10 and
pulling it out. Forget the bait. We had a 25kg halibut, barbecued in massive
chunks on the boat.
As my hosts on the 71ft Darwin Sound sailing yacht were confirmed hunters
and gatherers, we ate our own catches of red snapper and the varieties of
salmon described to me, in my ignorance of non-frozen seafood, as chum,
chinook, coho and pink. We gathered razor clams, rock scallops, pinto
abalone and giant Pacific scallops. We tried to shoot a deer, but missed. I
am told I ate sea cucumber and goose-neck barnacles.
On land, we penetrated 'climax forest' of Sitka spruce, red and yellow
cedar. A single Sitka log can have a commercial value of Pounds 40,000, so
the argument over clear-cut logging is not just academic. The forest floor
is a spooky moss-covered undulation of fallen trees being digested.
All 400 former Haida settlements, with their large wooden clan houses, have
been reclaimed by the rainforest. But the totem poles survive. All the Haida
villages were on the edge of the water. Ninstints, a UN World Heritage site,
has the world's largest collection of in situ totem poles. Sailing into this
calm and protected harbour, and watching the totem poles emerge from the
trees, is affecting. More than anything else, the difficulty of access
preserves the romance of the site. Do not look for a visitors' centre.
There are other islands with natural hot springs, colonies of sea-lions,
curious seals and wary otters. Whales appear and spout off. Negotiating this
region, with its sudden storms and wild tidal surges, is best done in as
large a vessel as possible. Anyway, nobody is going to rent you a self-drive
boat.
The western exposure of the island chain is etched with deep fiords, best
seen from the air. This is the highest-energy coastline in north America,
and Canada's most active earthquake zone. Down around Cape St James, at the
bottom - very popular with sea-lions - the current runs at 7 knots and the
tidal range is over 8 metres.
This water, enriched by the warm Kuroshio, or Japan current, which staved
off the ice age, is phenomenally rich in nutrients. An amazing sight is the
Burnaby Narrows in South Moresby. Here a channel some 50m wide enjoys
alternating north-south tides.
At the right time the ankle-deep water reveals crystal-clear spectacles of
starfish and curious tropical fish - the single richest collection of
biological diversity on the Pacific coast of the Americas. In the shallows,
thousands of clams squirt like an ocean of suburban lawn sprinklers.
All in all, I cannot think of any place on earth more worth visiting.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Records: New generation of Lieder flourishes - Max Loppert

THE ARTS renew themselves, in sometimes surprising ways. The current vogue
for Lieder, most intimate and exposed of the musical media, affords a prime
example. In the principal cities of Europe the halls are filled whenever
such admired veterans as Peter Schreier and Brigitte Fassbaender are billed
there; and then there are the younger masters and mistresses of the art,
discovered and speedily taken into audience favour.
This vogue was not at all predictable. Fifteen years ago, indeed, Andrew
Porter could write, fearfully, in the New Yorker, 'I trust I am wrong, but
sometimes it seems to me that when Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Elisabeth
Soderstrom, Peter Pears and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau retire, Lieder singing
will become a lost art. There is no one in younger generations who commands
as they do the understanding and the technique that bring German songs to
life'.
All four have departed the scene, yet in the happiest way Porter's fears
have proved groundless. Through the influence of those named Lieder
grandees, and others as well, younger communicators have been found to carry
the torch. New ways of presenting the recitals themselves (such as those
devised by the now-defunct Songmakers' Almanac) have added interest; the
astute talent-promotion of such concert-hall managements as the Wigmore Hall
 -in many ways the 1990s Mecca of Lieder performance - has borne fruit.
As always, records mirror the situation. Reprints of distinguished 'old'
singers bulk large alongside the continuance of imaginative projects and the
regular introduction of fresh Lieder talent. The re-publication on 12 CDs of
Fischer-Dieskau's giant DG Schubert opus: the regular issues from the mighty
Schubert project on the Hyperion label, currently at about the halfway mark;
and the recognition on disc of such important younger artists as the
Austrian baritone Wolfgang Holzmair - these are just three tokens of the
renewed interest.
A fourth is the Lieder-recording career of Fassbaender, which in recent
times has developed remarkable impetus: four new Fassbaender Lieder CDs have
come out on three different labels in less than a year. The German mezzo
merits the attention, as each of the four shows. Across the span of a career
now more than 30 years long, she has developed unique insight into the
Lieder repertory and a uniquely involving, emotionally uninhibited way of
manifesting it.
She is an opera performer of renown able to focus all her considerable
powers of musical dramatisation on Lieder; but whereas too many opera
singers, in transferring their attentions to the song-recital format, prove
unable to make precise, vigorous points and effects without spilling out of
the frame of each song, Fassbaender's sense of scale seems almost always
immaculate, native-born.
She has the command of story-telling, of beautiful word-utterance free of
cosmetic application, of inflecting phrases with 'personal' touches that set
listeners' scalps and spines tingling. All four new records - the two
Schuberts, the Liszt German songs, the Wolf - provide choice examples of
those gifts. In the DG Schwanengesang I instance the spontaneity of rhythmic
and verbal emphasis that refreshes the sentiments of 'Standchen'; in the two
Decca discs, the grading of narrative intensity so that Wolf's tale of
storks and shepherds in 'Storchenbotschaft', or Liszt's of the 'Drei
Zigeuner', gains exhilarating dramatic urgency.
Parallels abound with Lotte Lehmann, another great German bete du theatre,
who in the latter part of a long career achieved special distinction in
Lieder, another risk-taker with the voice. Fassbaender often puts pressure
on a worn-sounding upper register. Plunges into passionate chest-tones can
occasionally seem melodramatic. Calm, spun-out lyricism is not a feature of
her performance. A new record of Brahms songs by a younger leading mezzo,
Marjana Lipovsek, affords a revealing point of comparison - entirely lacking
as it is in individuality of the Fassbaender sort, full of warm, amply
sustained mezzo sound.
As one might expect, Fassbaender's pianists make the crucial difference to
the overall impression of each record. (That suggests an order of preference
 -but I'd not be without all four.) Her partnership with the composer
Aribert Reimann is the longest-lived, and it tells: in this Schwanengesang
the pianistic personality, angular and sometimes abrupt though it may be,
responds arrestingly to the vocal.
The young Frenchman Thibaudet, a notable virtuoso soloist, achieves marvels
of Lisztian and Wolfian textural limpidity and clarification, supporting the
voice sympathetically but not always distilling the poetic or dramatic
essence of the piano-writing. Garben, a record-producer of some experience
as a Lieder pianist, is a bit ham-fisted, a bit of a banger, though not so
much as to drain the excitements of Fassbaender's Goethe selection.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY POSTGATE

<TEXT>
SO Trollope has his plaque in Westminster Abbey. Now there is more good
news: Cover to Cover Cassettes and Timothy West have begun to record the
Palliser novels. Having completed the Barsetshire series lost year, they
have now issued Can You Forgive Her?, published in 1864-5 (CTC 0H4; 21
cassettes; 28 hours 2O minutes; unabridged): from diocesan politics to
Parliamentary, viewed from the sawdust level of tricky political agents and
from the dinner table of the great Duke of Omnium. We are asked to forgive
motherless Alice Vavasor, young, well-bred but not rich, for having become a
jilt. She longs to be useful and capriciously rejects a worthy suitor who
prefers a quiet life; she is even willing to con template a marriage with
her blackguard of a cousin, George Vavasor, if her money can be used for his
political career. Another cousin, the adorable Lady Glencora, also wonders
what to do, but stays with her husband, Plantagenet Palliser, long enough to
find happiness within her marriage. Timothy West's reading is as impressive
as ever.
Penelope Lively's novel of 1991, City of the Mind (Chivers Audio Books CAB
735; 5 cassettes; 7 hours 15 minutes; unabridged), beautifully read by
Terrence Hardiman, is preoccupied with the continuum of Time. The London in
which the architect hero, Matthew, is building a tower in Docklands
co-exists for him with the city of the Blitz, and with an earlier city where
a ragged child survives in the gutter. A celebration of London, and
incidentally a tale of romantic love as well. Highly enjoyable.
In 1987, Bill Bryson, an American journalist living in Britain, set out from
Iowa to find the ideal small American town. He drove 13,978 miles and
visited 38 states, and the result was The Lost Continent (CAB 804; 8
cassettes; 10 hours 30 minutes; unabridged). He saw much to grieve over: a
loss of dignity; over-visited historical places full of hamburgers, junk
souvenirs and 'fat people in noisy clothes'. But some places were lovely:
Savannah, Georgia; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Colonial Williamsburg. (but what a
rip-off that bus trip would have been, had he fallen for it). His bad temper
and streams of invective might have become wearisome but for the vitality
and charm of the reader, William Roberts.
Among Isis Audio Books' bargain reissues, Mary Wesley's Harnessing Peacocks
(TE 563; 7 cassettes; 9 hours 45 minutes; unabridged) is lively and funny.
Hebe, having escaped young from grandparents who wanted her to have an
abortion, has made a comfortable life for herself and her son by cooking and
'tarting' - she is good at both. An entertainment, attractively read by
Carole Boyd; not for Aunt Edna.
From Random Century Audiobooks comes a good abridged version of one of Ruth
Rendell's Wexford stories, No More Dying Then (RD 125; 2 cassettes, 3
hours), superbly read by Christopher Ravenscroft (Wexford's sidekick, Mike
Burden, in the ITV series). Burden is the star in this search for a missing
child.
Six episodes from the TV series featuring John Thaw as Inspector Morse have
been adapted for audio cassette from the original TV soundtracks, an
initiative of Central Independent Television via Music Collection
International. Each 2-cassette set lasts for two hours. The titles are:
Deceived by Flight; The Ghost in the Machine; The Secret of Bay 5B; Masonic
Mysteries; Driven to Distraction, and Infernal Serpent. Catalogue numbers
from TALKMC 001 to TALKMC 006 respectively.
From 5A Telltapes, Plain Tales from the Hills - Pt 2 (TTDMC 418; 2
cassettes; 3 hours), read by Martin Jarvis, has 12 of Rudyard Kipling's
tales of the Raj, published in 1888. With comedy, pathos, irony and horror,
they gave a foretaste of future triumphs. The Pat Hobby Stories (TTDMC 420;
2 cassettes; 3 hours) is a humorous series written by Scott Fitzgerald for
Esquire (1939-40), about a has-been of the film world who haunts the
Hollywood lots hoping for work, but remains his own man. Kerry Shale reads
nicely.
Random Century Audiobooks have recorded Kenneth Branagh reading 21 of
Wilfred Owen's war poems and some of his letters in Anthem for Doomed Youth
(RD 126; 2 cassettes; 1 hour 12 minutes), a recording which the BBC
broadcast in five 15-minute gobbets to celebrate the centenary of Owen's
birth; 15 minutes being as much as one can take of this at one time. Perhaps
no actor could do justice to the pity and terror of the poetry, but Branagh
reads the admirably chosen letters with sensitivity.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Records: Nostalgic compilations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL HARDY

<TEXT>
THE ART of the compilation album is an odd one. Consider Topic's collections
of sea shanties, Blow the Man Down (TSCD464), and industrial songs, The Iron
Muse (TSCD465). Both are CDs that have been expanded from original concept
albums, of the early 1960s and the late 1950s respectively. Both are
important collections of folk songs. However, from the perspective of the
1990s, The Iron Muse is the more vibrant. Blow The Man Down is imprisoned by
the rhythms of the sea and the sound of the accordion and is severely
limited in its potential villains. The rhythms of The Iron Muse are more
varied and the stories more complex. Moreover as Theme Park Britain comes
closer and closer, the description of work and its deprivations, originally
complained off or protested about, take upon an almost nostalgic hue.
Particularly affecting are the miners songs.
White Country Blues (Columbia Legacy 472886 2) confirms the fact that though
the American South was segregated for much of this century, culturally black
and white musics were closely intertwined. The set's sub-title 'a white
shade of blue', is also accurate, pointing to the fact that these white
bluesmen of the 1920s and 1930s were more melancholic and rural and less
mythic and impassioned than their black brothers. Particularly powerful are
the performances by Frank Hutchinson, Charlie Poole and the Allen Brothers.
Instrumentals (Hannibal HNCD 8302) seemingly lacks a similarly convincing
raison d'etre: after all it is only a collection of instrumentals. In fact,
thanks to careful selection it has an unusually strong presence and operates
rather like a carefully routed tour of world music. Typically the haunting
opening track which sets the feel of the CD, a seven minute
didgeridoo-guitar combination 'Dance The Devil Away', is fake folk but the
feeling is as real as that of the Bulgarian group Blakena, the Romanian
Muszsikas or the British Fairport Convention.
Mynd Excursions (Sequel NEXCD 237), Every Great Motown: The First 25 Years:
Vol II, the 1970s (Motown 530 114-2) and Fontana, the Sixties and Nineties
Collections (Fontana 515 892-2) are more straightforward examples of the
compilers art. The Sequel offering collects together 30 essays in
psychedelia from the Kama-Sutra label. Most are minor (The Tradewinds, The
Innocence), a few terrible (The Mulberry Fruit band's version of 'Yes We
Have No Bananas' is absolutely horrendous) and a few real finds. Best of the
bunch is The Vacels. Their version of Dylan's 'Can You Please Crawl Out Of
Your Window' is a superior example of pop psychedelia in which blue-eyed
soul meets the Lovin' Spoonful. The result is a cult classic. With only 11
tracks the Motown offering is a little short. More intriguing is the Fontana
offering, a three CD set, one devoted to the 1960s and two to the 1990s when
PolyGram revived the label. The 1960s CD mixes British R'n'B (The Pretty
Things, The Spencer Davis Group, Alexis Koerner) with pop (The Troggs) and
cultdom (The High Numbers, ie the Who before they were The Who) with wild
abandon in the manner of the times. As befits its time the 1990s set (which
starts in 1987) is more calculated, mixing the Fall with le Mystere de Voix
Bulgares and Tears For Fears with a knowing post modernism in which
eclecticism is the norm.
Sometimes compilations have the power to both surprise one and confirm a
generally perceived view. Such an album is the perfectly titled The Genius
Of Dave Bartholomew (EMI 8018421). Best known as the writer and arranger of
numerous Fats Domino hits, Bartholomew, as this double CD of recordings
produced by him and featuring his band from the late 1940s to the early
1960s confirms, had a far wider palette at his disposal. The central element
of the Bartholomew sound is the relaxed beat of his band, but on such pared
down productions as Archibald's 'Stack-a-Lee', Jewel King's 'Don't Marry too
Soon', or Peew Wee Crayton's marvellously subdued 'Every Dog Must Have It's
Day' or T. Bone Walker's hilarious 'Teen Age Baby', Bartholomew reveals
himself as a master of all the musics of New Orleans.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Records: Hell-for-leather down the sax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF THE quick and the dead, Jackie McLean's alto sound comes out of the horn
at you like a turbo-charged kazoo. A direct inheritor of the Charlie Parker
bop tradition, McLean puts his unmistakeable music firmly into the
listeners' ear and, like his friend and mentor, leaves it there until the
recipient feels a little dizzy. Where other saxophonists turn their
instrument inside out to realise their ideas, the McLean technique is to
find a line and then proceed hell-for-leather down it in breakneck
improvisation, relying on hairpin bends for excitement rather than harmonic
humps.
So it is with the new live recording, made in 1991 and appropriately titled
The Jackie Mac Attack (Birdology 519 270 2). The appeal of any McLean band
lies more in its insistency than its scope. They can and do turn a ballad,
but the leader's tartness is put to best use in the driving originals which
feature on this latest recordings. Appearing earlier this week at the Union
Chapel in a sextet, son Rene and trombonist Steve Davis provided some angles
to augment the linear acceleration of father's playing. The new record,
however, with Hotep Idris Galeta (who shares the writing) at the keyboard,
Nat Reeves on bass and Carl Allen in the traps, has McLean plaintively and
hypnotically 'on' for most of its 55 minutes.
Another speed freak saxophonist, Johnny Griffin, has a new disc Dance of
Passion (Antilles 512 604-2) which sheds new, softer light on the tenor
fireball. Catch Griffin live and you are likely to come away with your hair
standing on end after a no holds barred hard bop session. These sides,
however, add tuba, French horn and trombone to the standard piano quartet
format, to produce an altogether more measured affair. The dance is slow and
the passion smouldering. Set against a sturdy but agile brass section
(notably Steve Turre's talking trombone), the Griffin tenor stretches out
beautifully across original compositions tenderly arranged by pianist
Michael Weiss. A blue interlude in The Way It Is allows close examination of
Griff's technique while All Through The Night has a more familiar Griff
blowing lightning changes.
Don Pullen's new Ode To Life (Blue Note CDP 0777 7 89233 29) finds the
usually explosive pianist in an uncharacteristically subdued mood. But this
is a pianist who delights in every setting and the African-Brazilian
Connection has Pullen's glissando spreading across samba syncopations,
flamenco inflections and African dance. A dark hued work, the disc features
a sad, rolling tribute to his sideman of many years, saxophonist George
Adams who died last year. The track 'Ah George, We Hardly Knew Ya' employs
altoist Carlos Ward's supple sound to moving effect.
Notable among the reissues, which abound, is a swinging selection of late
guitarist Grand Green's groovier works The Best of Grant Green (Blue Note
0777 789622 29) Prodigious though erratic in output until drugs finally
stopped him, Green could swing with the fastest of them. This 75 minute
compilation shows him at his funkiest and fittest. Another from the Blue
Note stale that returns repeatedly to the turntable is a 11961 collaboration
between radiant vocalist Nancy Wilson and sweet toned altoist, the late
Cannonball Adderley (Capitol Jazz 0777 7 8120421). Joined by brother Nat on
cornet, Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums) they
create 42 minutes of condensed pleasure with a mixture of originals and
standards.

Monk: Atlas. Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble/Wayne Hankin. ECM 437 773-2 (two
CDs)
Maderna: Hyperion. Jacques Zoon, Penelope Walmsley-Clark, Bruno Ganz, Les
Jeunes Solistes, ASKO Ensemble/Peter Eotvos. Disques Montaigne 782014 (two

ATLAS is the longest, most ambitious of Meredith Monk's performance pieces
so far, categorised as 'an opera in three parts' but just as heavily
dependent upon dance and gesture as on music and text. When it was first
performed at the Houston Opera in February 1991 Max Loppert greeted Atlas
here with great enthusiasm; when Monk toured an abridged concert version to
London last year it made a charming if slighter impression.
Certainly in concert and even more in a recording the dramatic essence of
Atlas, the distinctive flavour of its visual and musical synthesis, are
significantly diminished. The 15 numbers which make up the musical score do
not carry the narrative forward so much as provide gloss and illustration.
The majority of them are essentially textless, the dance and mime provide a
kind of thread of continuity in the theatre, but to a large extent the
audience has to take the story (an allegorical tale of a young girl
travelling through life and through the world until she finds the spiritual
peace she seeks) as given.
On disc, then, each number has to survive on its own intrinsic musical
merits; there can be no real sense of cumulative effect or of a dramatic
context into which they can be fitted. The sequence of musical concepts has
vivid and inspired moments as well as some that are insipid and
inconsequential. At its best the music of Atlas is disarmingly likeable,
constructed from the minimum of material - a simple melodic pattern, a
handful of syllables, a second-hand folk tune  - and worked with great
imagination and a minimum of rhetoric. The instrumental accompaniments are
no more than functional, their scoring sometimes rather crude. It is the
voices, wonderfully disciplined and precise, that matter, but their effect
one must be incomparably enhanced when combined with congruent visuals and
Monk's conception can be assimilated whole.
Alongside Atlas, Maderna's Hyperion seems very much the product of a totally
alien culture, almost a period piece. Slowly but surely Maderna's musical
personality, which was very much shaded in his own lifetime by the greater
flamboyance of his younger contemporaries Boulez and Stockhausen, seems to
be acquiring a kind of icon-like stature, his achievement as a conductor
recognised as hugely influential, his own music celebrated as one of the
most lyrical products of the post-war avant garde. Certainly Hyperion is the
quintessential 1960s piece, assembled over some six years from a variety of
compositions that have independent lives of their own yet are linked more or
less by their relationship to the poetry of Holderlin, and particularly to
his Hyperion poems.
The cycle contains orchestral pieces, a massive soprano aria, important
solos for a flute and readings from Holderlin's verse; the ordering of these
events is left to the performers. The Disques Montaigne recording, as well
documented as always, is taken from performances staged at the Vienna
Festwochen in 1992, a production shared with festivals in Amsterdam, Paris
and Rome. The performing version was made by Peter Eotvos, and in musical
terms at least it coheres wonderfully, full of marvellous orchestral writing
 -Maderna was a master of texture and colour - intensely lyrical writing for
both the flute (vividly played by Jacques Zoon) and the soprano (the
indefatigable Penelope Walmsley-Clark), with Bruno Ganz relishing his
delivery of the poetry. On disc, when the sequence of events can be tailored
to the listener's own taste, it is endlessly diverting; on stage, one
fancies, it would require a thoroughly imaginative staging to work
effectively.
When Dusapin's Medeamaterial was first performed at the Monnaie in Brussels
in March 1992 it was hindered rather than helped by it as stage production,
which blurred what was already a profoundly ambiguous scenario and text
taken from Heiner Muller's playlet of the same name. On disc it begins to
make more sense, and it is possible to appreciate far more the ingenuity of
Dusapin's score, composed for a baroque orchestra playing in baroque
temperament - the original commission specified that the work would be given
in a double bill with Purcell's Dido and Aeneas.
The burden of the work falls upon the character of Medea. gallantly taken by
Heide Leidland; though the Nurse and her husband Jason are given a few
phrases in the opening moments of the work, Medea taskes central stage for
more than half an hour with a huge monologue, a grand apologia pro vita sua,
while the orchestra busies itself with minute figuration and the occasional
disconcerting baroque echo. The accompanying booklet provides texts in
French and German, as well as an introduction translated from the French
original; those who wish to get to grips with an intriguing work would be
advised to read the French rather than the English version, which obscures
far more than it manages to clarify.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A riposte to the supermarkets - Jancis
Robinson tastes some of the offerings at Whitbread's wine shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST until Victoria Wine and Augustus Barnett are fully integrated, the
Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up group of Whitbread-owned off-licences will
continue to be the major (only?) challenger to the supermarkets' increasing
domination of wine retailing in Britain.
The group's resourceful public relations manager - the one who had to deal
with all those inquiries about former chancellor Norman Lamont's champagne -
invited wine writers to taste 190 of its wines recently. Not everyone could
come, so she laid the whole thing on again.
Of the 80-odd wines I tasted, these made the strongest impression in terms
of value. I loved the 1952 Verdelho Madeira at Pounds 69 per bottle, but was
slightly sceptical about the claim that this rarity is available at each of
the three chains.
Note that some wines may have to be ordered, and that Thresher Wine Shops
carry a much wider range of wines than Thresher Drinks Stores. Thresher
recently launched an admirable booklet on matching food and wine. Bottoms Up
offers to refund the difference if beaten on case prices of any wine, and
throws in an extra bottle for goodwill.
Thresher does not try to fight the supermarkets on rock bottom prices, but
tries, with varying degrees of success, to offer at least as good value. Its
enthusiasms include Alsace, superior Languedoc-Roussillon, New Zealand and
fortified wines.
WHITES
Slovakians: The Gruner Veltliner from Nitra is sheer delight, with real
Balkan intensity, yet crystal clear acidity. Price is kept at Pounds 2.99 by
bottling in Germany. Thresher's buyer has sent some to potential Austrian
suppliers to show what can be done with their native grape variety just over
the border. The Gewurztraminer at Pounds 3.29 is equally convincing and
withstood comparison with a much more expensive example from Alsace.
NZ 1992 Chardonnay: Montana at Pounds 4.99 is very serviceable. Lots of
pineapple and acidity. Truly representative, but not nearly as fine and
lively as Hunter's, also from Marlborough, at Pounds 9.99.
For white Graves enthusiasts: all the thrill at half the price in Ch Bonnet
1992 at Pounds 4.99. Now this is what Entre-Deux-Mers is best at]
Portuguese Chardonnay: Peter Bright must be thrilled with his 1991 vintage
of Cova de Ursa at Pounds 6.99 which delivers great fruit, clean oak, some
lemony acidity and an odd Australian twang (yeast?).
Southern French: Domaine Gauby's oak aged white 1991 is just the sort of
creamy, fragrant, full-bodied dryish white Roussillon oddity for which I
would happily pay Pounds 7.99, and indeed have, but it will be too full for
some. WR/BU only.
California Chardonnay: one which has even impressed Burgundians, Chalk
Hill's 1991 is Pounds 11.99 and very fine indeed. BU/WR only.
REDS
Eastern Europeans at Pounds 2.99: Slovakian 1991 St Laurent also teaches the
Austrians a lesson about pricing (see above). Lovely direct fruit flavours
and even more exciting than the equally well made Hungarian Cabernet
Sauvignon and even fruitier Merlot from Villanyi Hills.
Southern French reds: Excellent buying here with the stupendously
concentrated Domaine de l'Hortus at Pounds 4.99 (BU only), the intense,
long-term old vine bottling from Ch de la Liquiere 1991 in Faugeres at
Pounds 4.99 (WR/BU only), the more international oak-aged Cabernet Domaine
de la Rivoyre 1990 at Pounds 3.99, and Terroir de Tuchan 1991, the most
excitingly substantial Fitou I have tasted for five years, at Pounds 7.49.
OTHERS
Pinks: A fine and varied range includes Ch Bonnet's rosy Bordeaux Clairet at
Pounds 4.99, the deeply fruity and serious Domaine de l'Hortus 1992 Rose (BU
only), and the pale and frivolous Domaine Tastavy from the Domaines Virginie
in Herault at Pounds 3.39 which should be consumed this minute.
Palest sherry: Don Zoilo Manzanilla at Pounds 7.99 is described as Very Old,
but is the palest, driest, freshest drink you could hope for on a hot day.
Presumably it is the solera whence it comes whose origins are so old?
Sticky and weird: Cavendish Late Bottled 1963, Pounds 6.99. This South
African fortified relic, sweet, ancient, and a bargain, tastes like a
particularly venerable cross between Australian Liqueur Muscat and Madeira,
and comes from a bottle that looks like a Walnut Whip. One of the few wines
you could drink with same.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Cookery: Why the simple ways are best - Philippa Davenport
concludes her short series on pasta with some home-made sauces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD PASTA needs little adornment. Often, it seems more appropriate to talk
of dressing it rather than saucing it, of anointing it sparingly, not
smothering it.
Some of the most complementary finishing touches can be supplied by
ingredients stocked in every self-respecting store cupboard. I find good
pasta irresistible when simply tossed in melted butter and served with a
hunk of Parmesan cheese to grate over it at table. Equally delicious is a
smear of good olive oil, heated and perfumed with garlic and chilli.
Toasted and crushed cumin seeds mixed with chopped green coriander are
another flavour combination of which I am fond, while chopped fresh thyme
and parsley or other garden herbs go well with lemon-scented olive oil.
Beware, though, of ready-grated Parmesan. The worst is sawdust stale and the
best is never as good as Parmesan grated at home when needed - and not a
moment before. For, just as peppercorns and coffee beans lose their aroma
rapidly after grinding, so does Parmesan's flavour fade after grating.
SPAGHETTI ALLA CARBONARA (serves 3-4)
Ingredients:  3/4 lb spaghetti or tagliatelle; 3 eggs; 3 tablespoons cream
(optional); 4oz green streaky bacon or pancetta, cut into snippets; up to
2oz butter; 2oz Parmesan cheese, grated freshly, plus extra for serving if
liked.
Method: Beat the eggs as though for scrambling with plenty of pepper, some
salt and 2oz freshly grated Parmesan. Add the cream if using it.
While the pasta is boiling, fry the bacon gently until browned in a little
butter in a Le Creuset casserole or other dish suitable for bringing to
table.
If not using cream, add more butter to the bacon. Let it melt and become
hot. Add the cooked and drained spaghetti, pour on the egg mixture and draw
the dish away from the heat. Turn the spaghetti gently over and over until
the eggs are cooked creamily and every strand of pasta is coated with the
bacon-flecked sauce.
PASTA WITH FENNEL AND OLIVES (serves 3-4)
Ingredients: 10oz-12oz small pasta shapes such as shells, farfalle or
bucatini;  3/4 lb-1lb bulb fennel; 1 teaspoon fennel seed crushed to a
powder; 1 1/2 oz-2oz black olives, halved and stoned; olive oil; 2
tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan plus extra for serving if liked.
Method: Trim the fennel, discarding any stringy outer parts, and reserve the
green fronds. Chop the rest into small pieces and fry them in 1-1 1/2
tablespoons olive oil for a few minutes until the surfaces are scorched with
gold here and there and the centres are tender, yet retain a little crunch.
Add another teaspoon or two of olive oil to the pan and let it become hot.
Then, tip the vegetable and its flavoursome oil into a warmed serving dish
and stir in the crushed fennel seeds, the chopped fennel fronds, the olives
and a little salt and pepper.
Add the pasta as soon as it is cooked and drained. Sprinkle lightly with
Parmesan and toss quickly to mix.
FLORENTINE SPIRALS (serves 2-3)
Ingredients: 8oz fusili or other small pasta shapes; 6oz-8oz spinach;
3oz-4oz streaky bacon, cut into snippets; a very generous nugget of butter;
plenty of freshly-grated nutmeg and black pepper.
Method: 6oz spinach is plenty here but I sometimes use 8oz to make more of a
vegetable dish. Wash and dry the leaves and chop them finely by hand or
whizz them briefly in a food processor. While the pasta is boiling, fry the
bacon snippets in a smidgeon of butter. Remove them. Add a good lump of
butter to the saute pan. Let it sizzle.
Add the spinach, and stir and turn it until wilted. Season well and draw the
pan away from the heat. Add quickly the cooked and drained pasta and the
bacon, and toss until mixed. This is a very savoury mixture. I think it
would be gilding the lily to offer Parmesan at table with it.
Following last week's article on bought pastas a number of readers have
asked for stockists of the Spinosi brand. They include: Selfridges, London
W1; Bowlers of Bray, Bray-on-Thames, Berks; Mario's Delicatessen of Bromley,
Kent; Todder Staffes of Lytham St Anne's, Lancs; Mackintosh of Marlborough,
Wilts; Emmett &amp; Husband of Mayfield, Sussex; R. Menzies of Perth, Scotland;
Mary's of Richmond, Yorks; and Barlows Butcher of Winchester, Hants.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Fashion: Peacocks, yes, but never sissies - Last week, the
female fashion editors. This week, Richard Rawlinson meets the men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SELECT male fashion editors on Britain's glossy magazines and newspapers
have a lot to live up to. They also have a lot to live down. On the one
hand, they are the style gurus who inform the public of the latest trends.
Together with the world's top retailers, they decide which looks to promote
to the consumer, having studied the images on the catwalks in Milan,
Florence, Paris, New York and London six months before merchandise hits the
shops.
One would expect male fashion editors to be as fulfilled as any professional
in the knowledge that their work, like that of their female counterparts,
has cultural influences on society and economic implications for the
clothing industry But one thing niggles them.
Fashion is widely perceived to be superficial and sissy. This often affects
how they dress as individuals. 'Most editors would die of horror if anyone
suggested they were fashion victims,' says Nick Sullivan, fashion director
of Esquire magazine. 'There is nothing wrong with showing an interest in
fashion but it should not manifest itself as an obsession. I am interested
in clothes because of my job, not the other way round.'
Sullivan, 29, never predicted his career path. After studying French at
Warwick University, he taught English before finding work on the trade
magazine, International Textile. 'I would visit Italian mills and see how
suits are made,' he says. 'Fine details in cut are what make menswear either
right or wrong.'
He wears understated suits by designers Giorgio Armani and Nicole Fahri. His
shirts are either classics by Hackett and Van Heusen or funky adaptations of
the traditional look by designers Paul Smith and Richard James. He buys silk
ties in Milan by Dortani.
His fashion pages do not always reflect his sober taste. In a recent issue
of Esquire, he wrote about the influence on the catwalks of the film Bram
Stoker's Dracula. 'Patrician sophisticate Valentino, trendy duo Dolce &amp;
Gabbana and Katharine Hamnett all plugged into the dandy weirdo look sending
out frock coats, high-collared shirts with cravats, . . . toppers and little
round sunglasses.'
Sullivan sees no contradiction between his wardrobe and his work. 'I am not
judged on what I wear but on what I produce on the page,' he says. 'Readers
want to know what is going on, but to be told in a light-hearted way. I do
not say 'you must wear this'.'
Peter Howarth, fashion director of GQ magazine, says: 'If you work with
clothes every day, you tend to want to switch off in your free time, go to
the pub and talk about girls and football. The last thing you want to do is
shop. I live out dreams through my fashion shoots.'
Howarth, 28, read English at Cambridge University but a holiday job with
Paul Smith led to a full-time job. He was poached by Nicole Fahri to head
her menswear sales office but, while working there, he wrote freelance
articles for magazines including Elle and GQ.
Opting for a more casual look than Sullivan, he wears Nicole Fahri suits
with turtle neck jerseys by John Smedley or a suit jacket and jersey with
Levi's jeans. 'To be comfortable is to be confident,' he says. 'I have
developed a wardrobe which I do not need to worry about co-ordinating in the
morning. Almost everything is navy or black.'
In the April GQ he produced two fashion features: one showing grey, summer
suits - more Cary Grant than John Major - and one paying tribute to the
1950s revival: 'So put on your flower prints, new trousers and way-out
waistcoats.'
'The overall look is hippie but when individual items of clothing used in
the shoot are separated out they can be worn by men who are not going for
that look,' he says. 'Readers want to know what is fashionable but they are
more concerned about what is the best than what is the latest thing.'
The approach of Dave Bradshaw, fashion editor of Arena magazine, is more
eclectic than most of his male glossies rivals. 'Arena man is harder to
define than GQ or Esquire man,' he says. 'He is not inspired by the depth of
turn-ups and is more likely to be influenced by the quirkiness of London
street-style. Most editors always seem to be looking for something to
connect 25 shows such as the sailor look, whereas I just use individual
pieces that I like and put them together.
Bradshaw, 30, joined the fashion media after studying civil engineering at
Brighton Polytechnic and says he still feels like a round peg in a square
hole, in spite of having styled advertising shoots for companies such as
Katharine Hamnett, Next and Wrangler, as well as having worked
internationally on a freelance basis for magazines.
He owns suits by Yohji Yamamoto, Katharine Hamnett and Paul Smith but mixes
them with second-hand discoveries from charity shops, achieving an
individualistic hotchpotch of old, new, casual and formal. On the day I
interviewed him he was wearing a brown, flared, pinstripe suit with a round
neck tank top, Adidas trainers and white socks. 'Anyone with money can buy a
suit,' he says. 'It is much more intelligent to look smart and contemporary
on little money.'
Marcus von Ackerman, having edited the now defunct men's section of British
Vogue and worked for Vogue Homme in Paris, jumped from men's to women's wear
to become the fashion director of Elle. He became disillusioned with what he
describes as the 'homophobia of the British male fashion press' and feels he
can best express his flamboyant style through women's magazines.
'I find British men's fashion banal,' he says. 'The French and Italians
still have a nostalgic view of le style Anglais but in reality they are
better dressed than us. At Vogue, I chose desert and mountain locations to
shoot the most photogenic outfits, which could be as wild as a fluorescent
pink suit. Most men's magazines would not allow this but I feel a duty to
challenge and put forward strong directions.'
Von Ackerman, 32, displays a love of opulent clothes in person but his image
is nevertheless conservative. He has 20 designer suits by either Romeo Gigli
or Richard James, his shirts come from Turnbull &amp; Asser and his ties from
Gene Meyer in New York or Charvet in Paris. Oversized cufflinks come from
Lalique or Chanel. 'I love the extravagance of designers such as Gianni
Versace although I tend not to wear loud clothes as I do not like to be
stared at,' he says.
lain R Webb, fashion editor of The Times, is responsible for covering men's
and women's fashion and he aims to use his platform to 'inspire people to
have more fun with clothes.' Aged 35, he studied fashion at St Martin's
College of Art and Design in London during the punk era and has since worked
for the Evening Standard, Elle and Harpers &amp; Queen.
'Fashion is a way of life for me that embraces everything from coffee to
clubs to clothes,' he says.
Like his contemporaries, he prefers tailored suits, teamed with either
shirts and ties or jerseys, to casualwear. But he has already nodded
approval to the Dracula look by buying a frock coat by Paul Smith. Instead
of wearing black tie at formal occasions he puts on a satin suit by designer
Helmut Lang instead.
'Dress codes are for people who are scared to express themselves,' he says.
'There have been times when I have thought I should be more fashionable but
I do not feel comfortable if I am too dandified. I like simple, clean lines,
single-breasted jackets and narrow trousers.'
Looking back over the last 10 years, it seems that some of the taboos of
men's fashion have disappeared and for that we have to thank in part the
images displayed on the catwalks and in the press - they may seem extreme
but they have helped loosen attitudes.
Even so high fashion for men is still, by and large, seen as either
something for the very young or as a hyperbolic statement which is not to be
taken literally.

FT  17 JUL 93 / How To Spend It: Fit for a Fiver: test-drive your body -
Lucia van der Post on the FT's latest offer which allows readers to try out
their local health and fitness centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SHE LIKED going to the gym, or rather, she liked having been to the gym,
and the only way to have been was to go.'
Suzanne Vale in Postcards from the Edge by Carrie Fisher.
IN JANUARY, just when most of us were feeling at our lowest, the Weekend FT
gave readers the chance to lunch for a fiver at many of the country's top
restaurants. Now, at the start of the high holiday season, just when our
bodies are most on show, the Weekend FT offers a chance to get Fit for a
Fiver.
Health and fitness centres are one of the business phenomena of the age.
From Land's End to John O'Groats classes in everything from step aerobics
and yoga, from cross-training to weight-lifting and Stretch 'n' Tone are on
offer while in the treatment rooms the pampering with oils and lotions and
potions goes on. No smart hotel wooing sophisticated international customers
would hope to get by without a mini-spa and almost every small town has one.
But there are plenty of us who have never been near one. If you have ever
wondered just what goes on in them or what they could possibly offer you,
now is the time to find out.
The FT's Lunch for a Fiver offer is a hard act to follow but we believe many
of you will jump at the chance to try our Fit for a Fiver scheme. Around 100
top health and leisure clubs have agreed to open up their clubs and allow FT
readers to sample their facilities for just Pounds 5 a time.
All the clubs have been carefully selected - we wanted to give a good
geographical spread so that as many readers as possible could benefit and we
wanted to make sure the clubs could cope with the demand. Though no two
clubs are identical they all have a gym and offer a proper fitness
assessment, a range of classes and treatments and many, but not all, have
swimming pools and saunas.
For your fiver you can enjoy everything a member enjoys for half a day,
including a fitness assessment and one of the available exercise classes.
The specialist beauty treatments and therapies are not included.
The fitness assessment varies slightly from club to club but all should take
a verbal history of illnesses and injuries, test the blood pressure, weigh
and measure you, do some sort of cardio-vascular test which usually involves
assessing the heart-beat when resting and after several minutes of vigorous
exercise. Some add in blood tests, many do fat tests (a most unedifying
business - callipers measure the fat at different points on the body), some
test oxygen intake, some test cholesterol.
Fit for a Fiver starts today and runs up to and including Friday, August 13.
The list of clubs is printed in the box on the right of this page and if you
want to have a go all you need to do is make an appointment with the club of
your choice, take along the application form (also printed here) and present
it together with your Pounds 5. If you are keen to try, I suggest you lose
no time - those who dithered about where to go for lunch for a fiver found
that most of the restaurants they wanted to try were already booked up.
Of course, we are not suggesting that any of our readers could possibly
become truly fit after just one visit to a health club but what we are
hoping is that it may be just the kick-start that many of you need to embark
on a sensible sustained programme of exercise. Now is your chance to build
up your muscles, to tackle your cellulite, to try out a facial, to get rid
of the flab and generally feel better and stronger.
It should give anybody who has been seriously considering joining a gym or
health club a wonderful opportunity to see just what they have to offer and
to talk through, at the fitness assessment, just what you hope to achieve -
greater aerobic fitness, greater suppleness or strength or simply a modicum
of gentle exercise such as yoga, some complementary treatments and
companionship. If you do decide to join afterwards (and absolutely no
pressure will be put on you to do so) a good club should help you find ways
of doing all this.
One of the great mysteries is why, when almost everybody agrees that a
certain amount of exercise is essential for most people's health and sense
of well-being, so few people actually do anything about it. I reported
earlier this year how Allied Dunbar (which produced an excellent study on
the physical state of the nation) had found that though four out of five
people believe some form of exercise is good for them only half of those who
believed it ever got around to doing anything about it.
Dr James M Rippe (Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School) in a series of learned papers on the research
into the effects of exercise on people with medical ailments as well as
healthy people is in no doubt at all about the benefits. 'The jury is in,'
he writes - he may be short on colourful phrases but his message is clear -
'There can no longer be any doubt that daily habits and practices have a
profound impact on long-term health . . . the decision to lead an active
life is one of the most positive steps an individual can take not only to
improve quality of life but also to reduce the risk of developing a host of
chronic diseases.' More than that: 'A sedentary lifestyle, is hazardous to
an individual's health.'
But this does not mean you have to go in for pain and punishment. Those who
fear that a gym or health club has nothing to offer but stress, sweat and
toil should take heart. Health clubs these days are much gentler, less
punishing places, as concerned about reducing stress as taking off the
inches and increasing aerobic strength. Holistic is the buzz-word for
1990s-style clubs. Dr Rippe, for instance, in his researches found that
'gentle exercise, such as slow or moderate paced walking, when coupled with
a cognitive component, such as the 'mindful' exercise disciplines of yoga or
t'ai chi or other relaxation techniques (which most up-to-date clubs offer),
results in immediate physical and psychological benefits.'
I've always felt we could learn a lot from the French when it comes to
health and beauty. When things begin to get her down, a French woman (and in
case this sounds sexist let me just say I don't recall any French men having
recourse to this particular ploy) can indulge in a small crise, nothing too
serious, of course, just a little crise, of les nerfs or la foie, depending
on her temperament, which then allows her to indulge herself at one of those
marvellous instituts de beaute that are so practised at recognising the
intimate connection between health and beauty. There women are pampered and
polished, massaged and soothed and, if things are really serious, they go in
for a cure de detente, from which they emerge all cleansed and rested ready
to face the world again.
British clubs are at last adopting something of this approach. Women readers
will find many of the clubs absolute havens - no longer cold and draughty
with inadequate showering arrangements, most of them now go in for piles of
fluffy towels, generous boxes of tissues, plenty of hot showers,
hair-dryers, restaurants with delicious (but low-fat) food.
They are places where you can take time out from the world, where you can
have any or all of the lovely pampering treatments that are part of today's
approach to health and beauty . . . aromatherapy, massage, facials,
manicures, reflexology. You do not need to perform like a hamster on a
treadmill or sweat away re-aligning your muscles. Today health and fitness
clubs are much more like the old-fashioned, proper clubs . . . places where
you can go to feel good, to swim or have a massage, take a class, have a
meal and meet some friends.
My final thought is that if you take as your motto 'If I don't enjoy it I'm
not going to do it' you cannot go far wrong. Have a go - you may enjoy it
all a great deal more than you think.
Over the next two weeks a selection of participating clubs will be listed
daily in the FT. The application form will be included on alternate days.

FT  17 JUL 93 / The Victorian fraud legacy: Andrew St George on the morality
handed down to the City of London's brokers, insurers and bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON FEBRUARY 17 1856, a Sunday, a suicide was discovered on Hampstead Heath
in London. With the body was this note:
I can not live - I have ruined too many - I could not live and see their
agony - I have committed diabolical crimes unknown to any human being. They
will now appear, bringing my family and others to distress - causing to all
shame and grief that they should ever have known me.
I blame no one, but attribute all to my own infamous villainy . . . I could
go through any torture as a punishment for my crimes . . . but I can not
live to see the tortures I inflict . . .
The note, written the previous evening, belonged to John Sadleir MP, junior
Lord of the Treasury, chairman of the Royal Swedish Railway Company and of
the London &amp; County Joint-Stock Banking Company. His crime? Fraud. He dared
not name it. Nor had he, at his death, been convicted.
Sadleir issued Pounds 150,000 in false shares from the Royal Swedish, and
defrauded the Tipperary Joint Stock Bank of Pounds 200,000. He was a smart
Dublin solicitor with a modest lifestyle thought incompatible with vast
fraudulence. The Times described him as a 'national calamity.'
His offence was to break the rules which, then as now, governed our
confidence in each other and confidence in the future. Today's frauds tend
to be more technical, less easily discovered, and almost impossible to
sentence. The Victorians had no equivalent of the Serious Fraud Office, let
alone any institution with wide powers to search outside the ambit of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act.
The present-day Serious Fraud Office of Barbara Mills and George Staple has
a 65 per cent success rate in convicting serious frauds, but this should be
balanced by its failures in the Guinness and Blue Arrow trials and by its
lack of control over the Pounds 40m legal costs in the latter. Defendants in
the Bank of Commerce &amp; Credit International (BCCI), Brent Walker and Maxwell
cases still have no trial date. Only the lawyers will benefit.
The Victorians, facing organised and thoroughgoing fraud for the first time,
were slow to bless and quick to chide. They deployed a high moral tone when
dealing with the miscreants. Here, from 1857, is a judge addressing the
accused:
'You are a person who has forged on a large scale; you have played for heavy
stakes, and you must have been aware all the time that if your iniquities
were discovered, you would be called to a heavy account. That account it is
my duty to close by pronouncing upon you the sentence of the court, which
is, that you be transported beyond the seas for the term of your natural
life.'
In Victorian times the City of London was policed not by self-regulation but
by rules of behaviour. Fraud and over-speculation were bad behaviour in a
market which, ideally at least, ran on probity. Speculation was the supreme
sin and charity the supreme virtue, although buying cheap and selling dear
was felt by many to be part of God's grandeur.
Moreover, when frauds were discovered, the Victorian system put fraudster
and victim in close proximity. One of the greatest cases of fraud was that
of Sir John Dean Paul, of the bank Straham, Paul &amp; Bates, which lost money
in the 1850s in mining and railway drainage. By June 11 1855 the bank's
liabilities were Pounds 750,000. One creditor, the Rev Dr Griffiths,
prebendary of Rochester (who was owed Pounds 22,000) had the partners
arraigned under the Fraudulent Trustees Act. The scene at the Central
Criminal court was pure moral drama. Sir John and his two partners were
sentenced to 14 years' transportation. The Times obituary described Sir John
in 1868 as 'a once notorious character.'
That Victorian moral legacy survives. The shame of the current Lloyd's
insurance losses is the breach of trust between individuals. The Lloyd's
crash is a social affair, played out in Home County drawing-rooms. While
bright particular stars such as Swaleh Naqvi of the corrupt BCCI or Octav
Botnar of Nissan illuminate the firmament, fraud remains the most social of
crimes: it depends on others' trust and it is maintained by social position.
Fraudsters in the 1850s were every bit as colourful as our own. Leopold
Redpath was the most anomalous of all. An insurance broker from the
Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, he perpetrated the Great
Northern Railway frauds, in which non-existent stock was issued. He combined
successful swindling with high moral reputation and a benevolent career.
A city commentator wrote: 'Never was money obtained with more wicked
subtlety; never was it spent more charitably. The thief and the desperate
criminal were intertwined with the philanthropist.'
Redpath became a governor of the St Anne's Society for impoverished
gentlefolk, and of Christ's Hospital. His philanthropy was a mockery of the
benevolence shown by, say, George Peabody in the 1860s; it was a form of
social insider dealing within Victorian middle-class society. Redpath had
lied to his wife, waiting at their Weybridge house as he was arrested. A
detective appeared and she fainted at the news that her husband was a forger
and a thief. He was caught by accident in 1856 when a messenger was
intercepted with incriminating papers, and deported in 1857. His financial
expertise would prove useful in Australia.
The Redpath revelations followed the frauds of Sadleir and William Robson,
the great Crystal Palace forger. While Redpath took the philanthropic route
to acceptability, Robson took the thespian way. The acute and creative
Robson made the ideal fraudster: he had the sense to know what to do and the
wit to carry it out.
In 1854, he joined the Crystal Palace Company as chief of the transfer
department, reporting to the company registrar, who noted Robson's aptness
and 'his engaging and agreeable manners.' Robson sold shares in the name of
Johnson (his brother-in-law), 'witnessing' the signature himself. His fraud
netted Pounds 27,000. When arrested, he was writing a play called Love and
Loyalty.
Amid much partying and sailing with friends, he bought and lavishly
furnished Kilburn Priory. He fled to Scandinavia, but was found in
Copenhagen, the first fraudster to be captured by means of the telegraph. In
November 1856 he was sentenced to 20 years' transportation.
Robson, in turn, had modelled himself on the brilliant Walter Watts, a clerk
at the Globe Assurance Company. Watts emerged from obscurity in 1844 to buy
and manage the Marylebone Theatre and the New Olympic in London in the late
1840s. City opinion later supposed that Watts' theatrical speculations were
the cause rather than the result of his crimes.
Watts used an antiquated share-dealing system which based the company's
accounts on its banker's pass-book, a form of out-dated company etiquette.
It cost Globe Insurance Pounds 700,000 (laundered through Watts' bankers)
between 1844 and 1850. Watts was tried on May 10 1850 at the Old Bailey for
stealing a Pounds 1,400 cheque, but technical objections clogged the case.
He was finally convicted of stealing 'a piece of paper of the value of 1d'
and sentenced to 10 years' transportation. He never left. He killed himself
at Newgate.
Throughout the Victorian period the City of London was as skittish as the
fraudsters who flourished in it. Market crises in 1837, 1847, 1857 and 1866
saw railways, banks and insurance companies fail, a process exacerbated by
limited liability legislation in 1855 and 1862, and by the Bank Indemnity
Bill of 1857. The descent of manners in the City was a social phenomenon
riding on changes in attitudes to money, making and spending it.
The City remained essentially Victorian until the 1960s - still run by
brokers, jobbers, insurers and bankers. Insider dealing was how money was
made. Everyone did it, because information was a social commodity exchanged
on the grouse moor and not via the modem.
One merchant bank chairman from the 1960s said: 'The whole object was to
know something nobody else did. Inside information was what one expected;
one needed a good story from the stockbroker, whereupon the stock was duly
bought. Sometime it worked, sometimes not.'
Throughout the 1960s, new and more technical investment tools developed. The
Eurodollar bonds pioneered by Warburgs or the unit life insurance pioneered
by Hambros began to shift investment away from traditional means. The City's
Victorian legacy reached down the century as far as the great City battle
over British Aluminium in 1958-59. From then on, however, the gentlemen
retired and the players took over.
Yet a permitted amount of insider dealing and advance information was
allowed. This seemed to prevent out-and-out fraudulence, since a decent
amount of money could be made. But with the arrival of wider, more direct
and more public share ownership, and with increasingly complex
communications and investment vehicles, this world was bound to change.
The basis of trust between individuals and the money society which
controlled money manners changed rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, so that the
scope for fraud became international. In many cases white-collar crime
operated offshore, in foreign markets.
There is still scope for fraud, conducted more circumspectly than by the
great Victorians. In the first four months of 1993, Pounds 571m in fraud was
reported (the total for 1992 was Pounds 671m). Simone Weill, the French
philosopher, thought fraud the most heinous of crimes, because it affected
large numbers of people who had never harmed you and whom you would never
see. It was a breach of trust magnified many times over.
Andrew St George's book, The Descent of Manners, Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 20,

FT  17 JUL 93 / As They Say in Europe: Still Harry Lime's town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE British, the French and Italians, Europe consists of those three
states, plus the Germans. Then there is a jumble of funny countries, mostly
new, dotted about the middle and a large beach called Spain. And finally
there are the boring countries. They have often been neutral, mostly outside
the EC and now trying, for some unfathomable reason, to get in.
But they are not always boring. I find Austria interesting, as do the
natives who resent the fact that this once great power plays such a
diminished role on the world stage. The latest lament came in a column by
Willy Hillek in the Vorarlberger Nachrichten. He had just been in the US.
The experience led him to write: 'For the world's leading power, the USA,
Austria is de facto non-existent.' He added that the only time his little
country had made the news in the US was during the Waldheim outcry. The
former Austrian president made a considerable impact as a result of the
omission of the more interesting aspects of his war service in his
autobiography. US ignorance of Austria is something of which I have some
experience: when I lived in Vienna I regularly received mail from the US
which reached me via Sydney. I understand the New South Wales postal
department has a full-time employee whose job it is to forward letters from
Australia to Vienna.
In spite of this widespread ignorance and apathy, there is much that
deserves a wider audience. The outside world does not appreciate the steady
flow of scandals such as the Dollars 200m that disappeared in the
construction of Vienna's general hospital, the anti-freeze additive in wine
affair, the curious system for procuring fighters for the air force and much
else. Last month a former chancellor was in court (he was acquitted) while
one of his ministers got nine months over illegal arms exports.
The latest scandal, if that is the word, has blown up over the state of the
Roman Catholic Church in Austria. To get to the bottom of it all I needed a
guide from the Hamburg weekly, Die Zeit. Like everybody in north Germany it
finds something vaguely ludicrous about Austria, but on this occasion wrote
gravely that the present Pope's 'counter-reformation' had left a deeper
impression on Austria than on any other country in Europe. This explains the
preoccupation of the domestic press with religious issues. The second
biggest tabloid, Kurier, has been running a series entitled 'The flight from
celibacy.' It is briskly written stuff: 'Herbert Bartl was a priest for only
two years in Vienna- Breitensee when he decided to hang up his soutane and
get married. That was 24 years ago. Now he is a priest- without-office and a
double father . . .'
The latest uproar concerns the bishop of St Polten, Kurt Krenn. He is widely
attacked for being 'too conservative.' That is an astonishing allegation in
Austria, akin to British sports writers criticising the England football
manager because his team scored too many goals. But the Austrian catholic
church gained a modest reputation for progressiveness because its leaders
showed a tepid preference for maintaining the independent 'Austro-fascist'
state in the face of the challenge of Hitler's more robust version in the
1930s.
Bishop Krenn's conservatism is based on his belief that too much attention
has been paid to the gospels rather than church tradition. Opponents say he
sees the role of women as Kinder, Kuche, Kirche (children, kitchen, church).
He has the support of the leader of the 'Freedom Party,' Jorg Haider, who
gained fame a by proclaiming the virtues of the labour laws of the Third
Reich. Since anti-clericalism in Austria tends to be a tendency of the
far-right this came as a surprise, but Haider was on his way for an audience
with John Paul II who had appointed Krenn to his bishopric.
The bishop has been forceful in his own defence. As Die Zeit writes: 'In
interviews he compares himself with Jesus ('He was also crucified.')' Then
there was the unusual piece in Austria's biggest selling paper,
Kronen-Zeitung. A columnist writing under the pseudonym Christianus defended
Krenn on the day a local demonstration was due to take place against him:
'Jesus also experienced fear which on the night before his suffering took
him into profound fear of of death on the Mount of Olives.'
It turned out that 'Christianus' was none other than Krenn himself. So that
afternoon 15,000 turned up in rain outside St Polten cathedral where
thunderous applause greeted the appeal from Father Udo Fischer: 'Mr Bishop,
it's enough, resign. The Vatican has given us a present. We are sending it
back.' Since I receive the Austrian papers a week late and nobody else
reports events from that country, I am sorry to say that I do not know if
the call has been successful.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Peps are separate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A HUSBAND and wife each invests Pounds 6,000 in a personal equity plan using
money from a bank account held in their joint names. One partner dies - say,
the husband.
Is his Pep investment allowed to be part of his estate, or do the
accumulated funds transfer to the survivor? Is the answer affected by the
two investments being with the same plan manager?
Pep investments made by a husband and wife would form part of their separate
estates. It makes no difference who the plan managers are. Any remaining
funds within a bank account in joint names would pass automatically to the
other holder of the joint account.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Deed does make sense
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY UNCLE has just died aged 100, leaving an estate of Pounds 372,000. The
inheritance tax will be Pounds 88,000. His wife, who is 97, has an estate
worth Pounds 105,000, from which she pays Pounds 320 a week in a nursing
home.
When I asked the solicitor about a deed of variation to transfer Pounds
60,000 over to her to save on tax (about Pounds 25,000), he said that as
there were 12 beneficiaries to sign, it would cost as much as it would save.
Is this right? And do the expenses of the funeral, including a stone, come
out of the estate before tax is due?
It would appear from your letter that your uncle has left your estate to
beneficiaries other than his wife, and that a transfer of assets would need
their agreement.
If the wife's will leaves her assets to the same beneficiaries, then, unless
she changes her will in the meantime, the beneficiaries would only be losing
the cash flow use of the money, but could be saving tax, by a deed of
variation.
Assuming that his wife has not made any previous chargeable gifts, then it
would be possible for her to make annual gifts of Pounds 3,000 using her
annual exemption. If she has not made any gifts for the previous year, she
can make a gift of Pounds 6,000 in this tax year.
The most tax-efficient arrangement would be for a sum to be transferred to
her by way of a deed of variation so that her eventual chargeable estate was
valued at Pounds 150,000 and was, thereby, covered by her own nil rate band.
If we assume that she was able to give away, say, Pounds 6,000 using the
annual exemption, then this would reduce her chargeable estate to just under
Pounds 100,000.
Therefore, a deed of variation transferring Pounds 50,000 to her would bring
the chargeable estate approximately in line with the nil rate band, so that
no tax would be payable. This could give rise to tax savings of around
Pounds 20,000.
I do believe there is merit in the deed of variation and that this matter
could be put to the other beneficiaries. I can also confirm that reasonable
funeral expenses are deductible for inheritance tax purposes.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT has no age limits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I RECENTLY sold my house, which I bought in 1969. It consisted of four
flats, one of which I occupied.
The Inland Revenue has indicated I might have to pay capital gains tax,
based on its value as of April 1982 and the price at which I sold it.
As a pensioner, I thought I would be exempt from CGT. How can I obtain a
1982 valuation?
There is no maximum (or minimum) age limit for CGT. Ask your tax office for
the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction) and CGT16
(Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988).*
It is a pity you did not ask your solicitor about your CGT position before
the house was sold. Even at this late stage, it will probably be best to go
back to him for help since he knows (or can readily establish) the relevant
facts and figures as well as the relevant CGT law and practice (or, at
least, will probably have a colleague who does).
In particular, he can (presumably) help you in your negotiations with the
district valuer over the market worth of the house at March 31 1982, taking
into account the terms on which each of the flats was let on that day.
You are likely to need the services of a surveyor (or other land agent).
Perhaps the estate agent who acted for you in the sale will be prepared to
co-ordinate the negotiations with the district valuer.
The cost of ascertaining the March 31 1982 value will be deductible in
calculating the chargeable gain.
If the conversion into flats was done after you bought the house, give your
solicitor the details, as this could reduce significantly the prospective
CGT bill.
You should also let him know if you have lived in any of the other three
flats because this, too, could reduce the prospective CGT bill. (The rules
of CGT are quite arbitrary).
*The pamphlet CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses) might also be helpful - but do
not place too much reliance upon it as it tends to over-simplify the rules
laid down by parliament.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I INTEND TO give my nephew Pounds 3,000 a year until I die. Can I take it
that this will this be free of death duties and also free of tax on him? Am
I obliged to tell the Inland Revenue about it?
This gift falls within your annual exemption. There is no need to inform the
Revenue so long as this exemption has not been exceeded.
For the record, if you were to give more than Pounds 3,000 (so that it
became a potentially exempt transfer), you would not need to tell the
Revenue at the time. The gift would need to be notified by your executors
only if you died within seven years of making it, in which case the
potentially exempt transfer would become chargeable.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The company that recut its cloth
 -Clive Fewins describes the action that saved a textile firm from the
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS only one way to save the family firm. At the age of 63, Malcolm
Mackinnon put the Pounds 350,000 house he had owned for 22 years on the
market. He and his wife then lived in a caravan for 18 months until a new,
more modest, house could be built on part of the plot he had kept.
The funds released helped fend off the bank, to which Textra owed nearly
Pounds 1m. The company stabilised its affairs by pruning the workforce from
98 to 33 and closing its London showroom and Keighley warehouse.
Textra is one of a handful of textile converters of its type in the UK.
Textile converters smooth the path between the manufacturer and big
customers: wholesalers, stores or large organisations such as a government
department. They help manufacturers to produce the fabrics customers want to
buy.
But the recession was bad news for companies such as Textra, which
specialised in UK-produced designs and fabrics and were dependent on a
buoyant home market.
'Being specialists in furnishing fabrics we are heavily geared to the
property market,' said Mackinnon, managing director of the family company.
'Three years ago when we had to take our drastic steps not only was the
property market on the way down, but interest rates were rising and I had
just bought out my partner. On top of that our annual turnover was dropping.
'I just managed to sell my house and half the land for Pounds 300,000 before
the price dropped heavily. Even with the redundancies we fell from Pounds
70,000 profit in 1988-89 to a loss of Pounds 134,000 the following year.'
It was not a happy experience for a man who might have been looking forward
to retirement from the company he started in 1963.
Another blow was the decision to close the company's showroom and
headquarters in the West End of London, close to the premises of other
leading names in furnishing fabrics, including the former Sanderson
headquarters, where Mackinnon had learned his trade in the early 1950s.
'It was a worrying time transferring so much from central London to Abingdon
and converting an ugly 1960s interior into a stylish showroom. We had to use
all our talent,' said Mackinnon's daughter, Penny Hill, Textra's sales
director.
'We wondered how we would fare without a London presence, but there was no
alternative. A lot of people in the capital thought it was the end. But for
various reasons other companies in the business moved out of the West End at
about that time, so that softened the blow a little.'
Abingdon-on-Thames may seem a strange location for a textiles company.
Mackinnon had taken a lease of the 14,000 sq ft building in 1971 when the
family moved house from London to a village nearby. Most of the workforce
was there so it seemed logical to make Abingdon the headquarters.
'We find the majority of customers are happy to come to see us here,' said
Hill. 'We have to make more of an effort to pull them in, but when they
arrive here we have their undivided attention.'
The Textra collection comprises British designed and manufactured furnishing
fabrics. About 50 per cent of turnover comes from government contracts. Hill
or Vivian Edwards, the contracts manager, frequently visit the buyers from
the National Health Service or Ministry of Defence. Visitors to the showroom
include retailers such as Harrods, Marks and Spencer and John Lewis,
hoteliers or interior designers.
'We go out of our way to cater for them every September, when we erect a
tent within the warehouse for our annual autumn event. We also run monthly
courses for our customers in the Abingdon showroom,' said Hill.
Textra is design-led. Although it does not weave or print fabrics it is
entirely responsible for the design, whether that originates from one of the
two in-house designers, or from the many freelances Textra uses.
'Father has a wonderful eye and many years of experience,' said Hill. 'We
are a close family and often we have a family discussion before finally
deciding on the final colourways of a design or the weights and mixtures of
a set of fabrics.'
Mackinnon's wife Mary, who was company secretary until she retired last
year, son Tim, who is technical director, and son-in-law Paul Lewis, the
warehouse manager, all play a role in this. This year Textra has added 12
designs to its collection of around 150.
Mackinnon is confident that Textra has turned the corner. 'It was very
traumatic having to prune so drastically,' he said. 'Some of the people that
went had been with us since the age of 16. But now I look back, I am
convinced it was the only possible course.
'After three years of losses and a constantly diminishing turnover we are
confident that we have come through it and that the year that ended in April
will show a small profit.
'I realise that when I founded the company 30 years ago I went for the hard
option in sticking to all British designs and fabrics. But I do not regret
this. We still produce some of the finest furnishing fabrics in the world.'
'It was the currency crisis of last October that has helped our recovery. As
a result of the devaluation of the pound we have become far more competitive
overseas. Doors that were closed before are now slightly ajar.'

FT  17 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Entrepreneur with bottle - Nick
Garnett on a manager who went solo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT

<TEXT>
HARRY DRNEC recently heard himself described on radio as a millionaire
drinks man. 'I got a big kick out of that one. I'm broke, but happily so.'
Drnec is an American, a big-company manager who turned his back on corporate
life and bought his own company. His is a breed found more rarely among
British executives whose entrepreneurial zeal seems to crumple in the
corridors of corporate HQs. However, the route to wealth can be tortuous
even for the brave.
Drnec is a 46-year-old former pilot. He was European marketing director of
Anheuser-Busch, the largest brewer in the US. In 1988 he fell out with the
Busch family and left.
'I love London and wanted to stay here. I took a look at the jobs market.
The best salary I could get was maybe Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 60,000 a year.
I had been making Pounds 120,000. It's difficult to retrench. Beer was the
only industry I knew.'
Using borrowed money Drnec, whose family roots are Czech, paid Pounds 9m for
a small drinks distributor, Maison Caurette, which already had a regional
distribution agreement for Beck's and had begun distributing Sol and
Michelob. Under Drnec sales have jumped from Pounds 16m to Pounds 50m.
Maison Caurette makes a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3m and has a
workforce of 155. But big borrowings weigh heavily on its new owners. 'I
can't take a profit until there is an exit route for the other investors in
the company. Maybe it will all come good in five to 10 years.'
Maison Caurette is a study in company acquisition by borrowing and of
running a smallish business in a fragmented industry in which, says Drnec,
'the level of jealousy is incredible.'
His first piece of fortune was knowing an accountant and a solicitor
prepared to work while deferring their fees for a year. The next was
persuading the East End Jewish entrepreneurial owner of Maison Caurette to
sell. 'It was a very difficult set of negotiations. It took between July
1988 and November 1989. He was one of the toughest negotiators you could
ever meet.'
Granville, a merchant bank, fed in Pounds 2.5m of equity and Security
Pacific of the US provided Pounds 6.5m debt cover. 'That was the only
organisation we could find operating in the UK that would look at
shareholding stock as collateral.' Since the purchase, Pounds 1m of funding
has been pumped in, Security Pacific has dropped out and Midland Montagu and
Bank of Scotland have together committed Pounds 9.5m.
Drnec chipped in just Pounds 100,000 of borrowed money and got 32 per cent
of the company's shares. 'My shares were effectively given to me. The deal
was that my shareholding would fall to 22 per cent if I failed to meet
targets of a Pounds 1m profit in the first year to a Pounds 3m profit in the
third year.'
One weakness of the purchase was that Drnec went in partly blind. 'I had
only been on the premises twice.' The company operated from an archway in
London's Waterloo station. 'There was one door in and out through which we
were shipping 3,000 cases a day and bringing in a similar number. The roof
leaked when it rained heavily and you could only stack one pallet high.' The
following year the company moved to a bigger, 60,000 sq ft site in
Bermondsey at Pounds 6 a sq ft yearly rent. The computer system was replaced
for Pounds 50,000 and credit days reduced from 90 days - 'that was horrific'
 -to 62 days.
Maison Caurette has tripled sales in four years. One reason is the growth of
so-called premium imported lagers, sometimes called 'designer' beers, to the
annoyance of the trade. Drnec has added a number of imported beers,
including Miller Genuine Draught, the Finnish lager Kulta, 'that's my
favourite', as well as Chilean wine. Beer accounts for 60 per cent of sales.
Another source of growth was the effort to spread sales beyond the circle of
the M25 motorway. 'We now sell something to every major supermarket multiple
in Britain and every national cash and carry, as well as to 32 of the top 35
brewers and 197 wholesalers.'
The company aims to secure distribution rights for more imported brands and
make a bottom line return of 7 or 8 per cent. 'If a distributor is making
more than that, he is either incredibly efficient or is taking the piss out
of the consumer'.
Drnec has found a few things difficult to absorb. One is his inability to
establish profitable working relations with wholesalers. 'It's been almost
impossible to use other wholesalers in a successful way. They are not into
brand building. They are more into business breaking. We'll sell to a
wholesaler in Birmingham and he'll try and sell at 35p less back to our own
customers in London. These parallel sales are outrageous. It is very
unpleasant. We are still stuffed on this, so we are looking now to purchase
wholesalers or set up joint ventures with them, with the idea of having
eight or 10 depots around the country. We have to buy distribution.'
Another problem is the drinks dealers in continental Europe shipping in
crates of lager outside agreed distribution channels and undercutting
prices. Brewers produce a case (24 bottles) of Sol for Pounds 4 to Pounds 5.
On top of that are shipping costs, import duty of 24 per cent, the Pounds 2
per case Drnec says he spends on marketing and the gross margin of about 18
per cent Maison Caurette takes. 'But then you get some guy on the Continent
with just a phone and a dog and no overheads. He gets hold of a supply of
Sol, maybe from an Italian wholesaler. I sell a case of Sol for Pounds
14.25. The other guy sells for Pounds 12 a case to a cash and carry and the
cash and carry might sell that at Pounds 12.50 a case. Meanwhile the brewery
I sell to passes it on to a wine bar for Pounds 17.50 or Pounds 18. This
makes everybody look like a dickhead.'
Drnec is also irritated by north American beers - like some types of Coors
and Molson - brewed under licence in the UK but sold at close to import
prices. 'It costs Pounds 1.10 to ship a case across the ocean and import
duty adds perhaps Pounds 1.60, so where does the Pounds 2.70 go in the
price? Some companies are screwing up a free lunch.'
Like many American managers, Drnec is energetic, open and a little showy. He
tests products on visitors (in my case, peach-flavoured iced tea). He has a
simple ethos in an industry where so many take a piece of the profit.
'You should get a fair return for hard work. Never look at what the other
guy gets. Are you happy with what you get? That's what you should ask
yourself.'

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Slow start, strong Recovery - Unit
Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M &amp; G has been to unit trusts what Walt Disney was to animation. Its First
British Fixed trust, launched 62 years ago, was a new kind of open-ended
investment fund and founded the UK unit trust industry. Today, Muncipal &amp;
General has 31 unit trusts and its Recovery fund, with Pounds 1bn assets
under management, is one of the three largest of the country's 1,490 unit
trusts.
Launched in 1969, it has had only two managers. David Tucker ran it from
inception until 1987, when Richard Hughes was eased into the job after being
recruited from Derbyshire county council a year earlier.
Originally, Recovery went against conventional investment principles by
choosing companies that most people thought would fail, says Hughes. The
public was unimpressed, and the initial subscription was only Pounds
200,000. But this approach has sprouted at least a dozen funds outside M&amp;G
since then, and Recovery's performance over 10 years has been impressive (as
the chart shows). It has easily outstripped the FT-Actuaries All-Share, but
performance has suffered over five years because of the recession. Only in
the past few months has it again overtaken the FT-A All Share after several
years of underperformance.
Recovery funds do not prosper in times of deepening recession because they
invest in companies which are already in difficulty. 'The fund had a very
bad time in 1974 which knocked confidence but, after that recession, the
money came in,' says Hughes.
'Things went quiet again in the 1981/82 recession. By 1983, the size of the
fund was Pounds 85m. David Tucker could not see it growing by much more, but
then we had very high inflows in 1986 until 1991.'
The original philosophy has been refined through trial and error. The
companies chosen today are not ones which are simply doing badly - their
problems must be of a particular nature. They might have bad management or a
weak balance sheet, or the shares may be falling because of fraud or a
particular disaster.
Hughes avoids investing in companies which depend on a turn in the economy
for improved performance. In all cases, the price of the shares must have
fallen and the company must have the potential to make a good profit once it
tackles its problems.
The trust holds 90 stocks but Commercial Union, Charter Consolidated, Royal
Insurance, T &amp; N and Cookson account for 18-20 per cent of them. Recovery's
sheer size means it can, and does, influence the strategy that a company in
which it invests should take in order to 'recover' (although, as a unit
trust, it is restricted to a maximum holding of 10 per cent of a company's
share capital).
'Nearly Pounds 60m has gone into rights issues of one sort or another in the
first half of this year,' says Hughes. 'Companies know that without a change
in management we will not provide new capital. If we are already
shareholders and things start to go wrong, we will put pressure on the
non-executives to change the management.'
Cookson, the industrial materials company, is one of many companies which
has benefited from new money injected by M &amp; G. Hughes started buying into
Cookson in March 1991 when it launched a rights issue. The shares were 126p;
they are now around 210p. Money was also put into Granada, the leisure
group, after poor profits and the resignation of the chief executive led to
a rights issue in June 1991. Hughes bought at 150p; they are over 400p now.
Recovery is predominantly UK-based but it sometimes ventures overseas. One
of Hughes' best stocks was Quantum Chemicals, a US petrochemicals giant,
which he bought just three months ago at Dollars 12.25. Earlier this month,
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, bid Dollars 20 and Hughes was
quick to sell.
On the negative side, one big disappointment has been Greycoat, the property
company, which Hughes bought for 400p at the end of 1990; he stopped buying
when the shares hit 45p in June 1992. Shares in Ferranti International, the
electronics and defence concern, which were hit after the 1989 discovery of
fraud in its US subsidiary, have not performed, either, but Hughes remains
hopeful. 'Recovery fund managers are always optimistic,' he beams.
What of the drawbacks of operating a large fund with so many stocks? One of
the restrictions is sometimes having to reject smaller recovery shares which
look appealing, although Hughes says only 30 per cent of the fund is in
FT-100 companies. He runs Recovery himself; the only additional input is
from colleagues who hold the same companies. 'We are long term, so we do not
jump in and out of shares. I meet the companies once or twice a year.'
It can take a long time for companies to recover and, with 45 per cent of
the stock in the fund for more than five years, M &amp; G Recovery is like an
enormous charabanc, taking new passengers on board continually. 'We hold on
to shares in the hope that a dog will one day become a star.'
Charges
The initial charge on the units is 5 per cent, and the bid-offer spread on
July 14 was 5.5 per cent. The annual charge is 1 per cent and the minimum
investment is Pounds 500. The minimum monthly investment into the savings
scheme is Pounds 50. Recovery qualifies for full Pep status; there are no
extra charges for the Pep.

A HANDFUL of new business expansion schemes was launched this week.
Nationwide building society has brought out a contracted exit scheme which
aims to raise Pounds 20m to buy 400 repossessed Nationwide properties which
will be let under assured tenancies.
Nationwide Aegis is sponsored jointly by Nationwide Fund Management and
Matrix Securities. The exit price is 117.5p for every 100p invested, which
equates to an annualised return of 13.52 per cent for a higher rate taxpayer
and 9.07 per cent to a lower-rate taxpayer after five years.
The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 and the scheme is backed by cash
deposits with Nationwide.
Sponsor Neill Clerk has released two cash-backed contracted exit schemes.
Leeds Metropolitan Halls aims to raise up to Pounds 10m for new student
accommodation at Leeds Metropolitan University, formerly Leeds Polytechnic.
The exit price is 123p for every 100p invested, which is the equivalent to a
return of 14 per cent a year for a higher-rate taxpayer and 9.8 per cent for
a lower rate-payer. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
Southampton Student Halls plans to raise Pounds 7m for accommodation for
Southampton University. The exit price is 122p for every 100p invested,
equivalent to 13.8 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer and 9.6 per cent for
a lower rate-payer. Both Neill Clerk schemes are cash-backed.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: So you think your pension is safe .
. . - Most are - but there is a minority of cases where employers have gone
bust. Debbie Harrison examines the risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MAXWELL case made many pension scheme members realise, perhaps for the
first time, that their money could be lost if their employer went bust. In
1992 alone, more than 24,000 companies in England and Wales became insolvent
and similar figures are expected for this year. Investigations show that a
small but significant minority of these had tapped into the pension fund.
When an employer becomes insolvent, the company pension scheme has to be
wound up in accordance with the trust deed. This means that the scheme is
terminated legally and the assets are either transferred to another scheme,
as might happen in the case of a take-over or merger, or are used to buy
annuities from life offices to provide present or future pension income for
members.
Ellison Westhorp, a London firm of pension solicitors, has produced a free
guide* which provides practical tips on how to check that pensions are safe.
The firm stresses that most UK company schemes are protected by
comprehensive regulation and have adequate assets to meet their liabilities
as well as reliable trustees to safeguard their interests.
Even where there is no suspicion of fraud, though, the time taken to sort
out benefits can be unnerving. The important point is knowing when to panic
and when to leave things to the professional. According to the guide,
typical pension problems at insolvency include:
Delays in paying your pension or your transfer value to a new scheme.
Difficulty or delay in finding out information, especially about who is in
charge of the scheme.
Lower benefits than you expected. Ellison Westhorp recommends that if your
employer goes bust, you should check that the insolvency practitioner has
appointed an independent trustee. His role is to make sure members are
represented fairly in dividing the spoils, and to reassure worried members
that the correct procedures are taking place.
Under the Social Security Act 1990, this appointment must be made where the
insolvent employer ran a final salary scheme - that is, one which provides a
pension linked to a member's final pay. Any delay in appointing an
independent trustee can endanger your pension benefits, particularly if the
employer was the only (or dominant member) of the trustee board and is
suspected of serving his own interests rather than those of the scheme.
Moreover, where the original trustee board has dispersed, the insolvency
practitioner might become the sole trustee. This can lead to a conflict of
interests unless there is an independent trustee to provide a balance, since
the insolvency practitioner's main duty is to collect as much money as
possible for the creditors - not for the pension scheme.
Certain delays in disentangling pension benefits from the insolvency
quagmire are both understandable and reasonable. In order for the scheme to
be wound up, it is necessary for its assets to be collected and turned into
cash. In practice, this takes time, especially if the fund had direct
investments in property; in this case, it might take several years to wait
for the market to turn in order to get a good price.
Other delays may relate to the administration of the scheme. Records on each
member's length of service, salary and transfers into the plan, for example,
could be incomplete and the independent trustee must fill any gaps before
the scheme's liabilities can be assessed fully. The guide advises members to
write to the insolvency practitioner or independent trustee to check their
personal records are complete and accurate.
If the independent trustee is able to wind up the scheme, he could hit
problems when he attempts to buy annuities. Insurance companies must set
aside substantial reserves for these, but Ellison Westhorp's Robin Ellison
says many insurers do not have the capacity to handle bulk annuity purchases
because they have 'burnt' their reserves on insurance claims or have taken
too much new business.
Ellison warns: 'When it comes to bulk purchases - say, of 100 members - the
insurance companies haven't got the solvency margins to take on the business
and our experience is that, at present, it's a waste of time and money to
try.'
Where the employer has tampered with the pension fund - as happened in the
Maxwell case - the scheme is likely to be in deficit and unable to pay
members' benefits in full. Since the Social Security Act 1990 came into
force, any deficit in the scheme becomes a debt on the employer.
Unfortunately, it does not have the status of a preferential debt; thus, the
independent trustee will have to compete with all the other unsecured
creditors after the Inland Revenue and those with debentures or mortgages
have taken their shares.
Explaining the likely implications for members if the scheme is in deficit,
Ellison says: 'What can happen is that all benefits are reduced on a pro
rata basis before the annuities are purchased. Alternatively, the trustees
may decide to pay current pensions out of the pot and review the position of
the rest of the members in a year or two when the legal and financial
position is more clear.'
One word of warning. You might feel anxious to get your money out of the
company fund as quickly as possible but, ideally, you should wait until all
the scheme assets have been collected and your position is clear. It is
important to review all your options - certainly, you should not consider
transferring to a personal pension before taking independent advice.
If you have a complaint about your pension, put it in writing to the
independent trustee. If you are dissatisfied with the response, contact the
Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS).

LOWNDES Lambert, the insurance broking group, came to the market two years
ago, but its share price has proved volatile. Since last September, however,
this has climbed steadily from just over 220p to the present level at which
six board members have sold a total of 277,000. The largest was chairman
Richard Shaw's disposal of 200,000 although he retains 1.34m. Announcing
final results at the end of June, Shaw talked confidently about the profit
outlook for this year - something borne out by brokers' forecasts which
produce a consensus earnings figure of 31p.
Kevin McDonald and Geoffrey Howison are regular sellers of shares in
Polypipe. Against one of the most difficult trading backgrounds for many
decades, it has proved it can generate consistent profit and earnings
growth, and has been rewarded with a premium rating. McDonald sold 2m shares
at the beginning of the year and Howison has just sold 1m at 135p. This sale
was made just after the year-end and before the closed period which forbids
directors from dealing. On forecast earnings for the year just finished, the
gross yield is just over 2 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, reports its second
quarter results on Tuesday. Analysts expect a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 280m, excluding any one-time exceptional items such as
disposals to Wella and Sara Lee. The dividend is likely to be unchanged.
Sales are expected to be up by about 25 per cent in the pharmaceuticals
division and the group. Both figures will be assisted by currencies.
Analysts will be looking for strong growth from Engerix-B, the hepatitis B
vaccine, Seroxat, an anti-depressant, Kytril, an anti-nausea treatment.
Relafen, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for arthritis, and Augmentin,
an anti-biotic. The latter may overtake SB's anti-ulcer treatment Tagamet as
the company's most important drug.
The impact of the healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy will be carefully
monitored, as will the company's progress in the increasingly competitive US
market.
Waste Management International is expected to report on Monday interim
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 75m and Pounds 80m against Pounds 62.5m a
year earlier.
The company, floated by its US parent Waste Management which retain majority
control, has benefited from its joint venture with Wessex Water in the UK
and from expanding business in the Far East and Pacific Rim countries. Full
year profits for the year ending December are forecast at about Pounds 180m
(Pounds 144m).
First Technology, a maker of crash dummies and security equipment for the
car industry, is forecast to turn in a big increase in pre-tax profits to
about Pounds 2m from Pounds 0.6m for the year to April.
The company has added new customers among European car makers and has
enjoyed a pick up in US demand.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Fixed interest yields weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIXED interest investments such as onshore bond funds and permanent interest
bearing shares continue to offer attractive yields, in spite of weakening
since last month, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
Onshore bond funds
Performance has been boosted by the slide in interest rates, which has led
to capital appreciation.
The outlook depends on the direction of interest rates - if these fall
further, prices will rise. But few fund managers expect the same level of
gains that were achieved in the past few years.
The best-performing fund over three years, according to Micropal, is Aetna
Preference unit trust which, like the Gartmore trust also listed in the
table, invests primarily in preference shares (shares in a company yielding
a fixed rate of interest).
Geoff Burton, director of fixed-interest securities at Aetna and manager of
the fund, attributes the strong performance to the narrowing of margins
between yields on preference shares and gilts. The Aetna fund has also
benefited from old issues of preference shares being repaid.
Its largest holdings are in Evered Bardon, the international building
materials group, Bulmer Holdings, which makes cider and soft drinks, and
Prowtner, the house-builder.
Aetna UK has been sold to Windsor Life and the company will be changing its
name by September. Windsor Life is owned by New York Life, the large US life
company.
Permanent interest bearing shares
Yields on Pibs - fixed interest-paying shares issued by building societies
to raise money - are continuing to drop as prices rise.
Simon Mozeley, of Hoare Govett, says: 'Pibs continue to see strong demand
and, with strong gilt performance, yields have continued to trade below 10
per cent, with Halifax now yielding around 9.5 per cent.
'The Newcastle issues have broken 10 per cent and look expensive when larger
societies, such as the Britannia, give more than this.'

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Paying for Nature's violence - Eric
Short on why insurers are re-assessing premiums in areas of Britain most
prone to severe weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOK carefully at the map. If you live in an area shaded X or Y, then it is
a high-risk storm area - and you can expect your buildings insurance premium
to be altered accordingly.
Gone are the days when insurers charged one rate for the whole country -
effectively putting householders into one big pool, with the low risks
subsidising the high. Now, underwriters are splitting the country into
separate areas according to their risk factors.
Underwriters take five major risks into account when setting rates for
insuring buildings: fire, flood, storm, frost and subsidence. Of these,
storm and subsidence generally cause heavier claims.
Most fires are confined to a particular building, so the risk can be
controlled and damage minimised. Floods tend to be localised in well-defined
areas, usually affecting only a few hundred buildings at most.
Damage caused by frost can be widespread and, in the past, a sudden
freeze-up has led to massive claims for damage from burst pipes. But lagging
exposed pipes in new houses is now standard and most residents of older
properties have learnt from experience to do likewise and take other
precautions. Underwriters are less concerned about cold spells than they
used to be.
It is the storms of winter and a succession of dry summers that have played
havoc with claims. Insurers shudder to think about the great storms of
October 1987 and January 1990, and the summers of 1988-91.
Using past claims information and large-scale geological maps, underwriters
have been assessing the subsidence risk nationally and now have a clearer
picture of its extent. Assessing storm risks proved trickier, mainly because
there was not enough data over an extended period. Storms still occur
infrequently but, when they do, the damage is widespread and costly.
The climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia has, however,
examined 47 major storms between 1920-90. This helped to provide the
material from which the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries produced a report
last year on Storm Rating in the Nineties.
For the first time, underwriters now have a clear picture of storm frequency
in various parts of the UK (as shown on the map) - although, interestingly,
the institute found there was no conclusive evidence of an increasing trend
in storm losses, or to support the global warming theory.
Underwriters now are assessing these storm patterns, together with their own
claims' experience, to establish the changes that should be made to
buildings insurance rates.
The map shows that people living in most of Scotland have the highest risk -
more than 180 per cent of the average. But Scots have known this for decades
and have built their houses to withstand the weather. Thus, the likely
premium increases will be much less than one would expect from the risk
factor.
The areas most likely to be affected adversely by premium increases are the
next highest-risk areas of Kent, Sussex, Cornwall and northern England,
where the storm risk is 130-180 per cent above average. Houses in these
regions generally were not built to withstand ultra-severe weather and
claims have hit insurers hard in recent years.
While builders now are adapting new homes to cope better with storms,
existing properties remain exposed to the next blast. So, if premium rates
are increased in these areas, house-owners will know why. Conversely, owners
in central England may anticipate a reduction in rates because of their
below-average storm risk.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: When inequality rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS who ease the path to early retirement by topping up payments to
those too young to qualify for state benefits can breathe more easily
following an opinion from the Advocate-General of the European Court of
Justice.
The case, which will have implications for employers in several European
states, centres on what have become known as 'bridging pensions.' These pay
top-up benefits equal to those which would be offered by state social
security provided the individual was old enough to receive it.
Because Britain has unequal ages at which men and women qualify for state
pensions, men are given more generous bridging pensions than women. This
practice flies in the face of other ECJ rulings which say that a pension is
deferred pay and that employers may not discriminate over pay on the basis
of sex.
British employers had feared they would be forced to offer the more generous
terms to their women workers as well, either causing them to absorb
additional costs or to abandon their efforts to ease early retirement for
men. In this case, though, the ECJ seems to be saying that inequality is
acceptable under some circumstances.
Bridging pensions can make a significant difference in the value of an
individual's retirement package, as the case before the ECJ shows. It
involved Mrs Friedel Roberts, formerly employed by Birds Eye Walls, the ice
cream-maker as a slicer of its Swiss Roll product.
She took ill-health retirement at the age of 57, receiving an annual
bridging pension of Pounds 1,302 a year. But this was cut by more than half,
to Pounds 546, at 60 when she became eligible for the state pension - with
the difference to be provided by the state.
Some lawyers had argued privately that her case was a poor one to bring as a
test because her pension entitlement was so paltry that a judge might have
been hard pressed to deny her the extra cash.
Also, the British government intervened unexpectedly at the last minute,
arguing that to allow some discrimination would open the door to legal
challenges from individuals seeking exceptions in many different
circumstances.
Allan Jenkinson, policy director at consulting actuary Noble Lowndes, said
the advice - which is almost certain to be accepted by the ECJ - will
certainly create more work for lawyers. For one thing, it contradicts the
ECJ's own landmark 1990 ruling in Barber v GRE in which it said that each
aspect of a pension must paid equally to men and women. It has now created
the very first exception to its own rule.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Sickness need not harm your wealth -
Permanent health insurance can provide a decent income if you are too ill or
disabled to work. Bethan Hutton explains the advantages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 1m people of working age have been off work sick for more than a year
at any given time. State sickness pay, at Pounds 52.50 a week, is hardly
enough to meet most people's financial commitments, and company sick pay
does not last forever.
The arguments for permanent health insurance, which provides an income if
you are too ill or disabled to work, would seem clear but it is often
described as the most under-sold form of insurance. Only 3m people in the UK
are covered by a PHI policy.
Around 50 companies offer PHI (sometimes also called income protection or
income security insurance). The basic policies are all very similar,
promising to pay up to 75 per cent of your normal income, less state
sickness benefits, if you are unable to work due to sickness or an accident
for more than a few weeks. They continue to pay out until you recover and
return to work, or until you reach retirement age.
How much you pay in premiums depends on the level of income you want to
insure, your job, sex, age and state of health. Insurers will refuse some
dangerous jobs, such as the armed forces and some oil industry workers, and
will charge far more for heavy manual workers than for white-collar workers.
Women pay less for life assurance than men but, when it comes to PHI, they
can pay up to 50 per cent more. The companies cite statistics that women are
more likely to be off work through illness than men and take longer to
recover.
Some insurers offer reduced premiums for non-smokers, but others argue -
unlike life insurance - that there is no evidence of increased levels of
claims under PHI from smokers.
Mark Bolland, of independent financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe, says:
'The main thing to look for is cost - at the end of the day, this is a very
premium-driven market. You are then looking at flexibility, in terms of
whether or not the policy is index-linked or level and whether or not there
is any proportionate/rehabilitation benefit.'
An important factor in deciding the premium level is how long you are
prepared to wait after falling ill before having payments start. This will
depend on your employer's sick pay arrangements and your level of savings.
Self-employed people often need benefits to start after one or two months
because their income dries up as soon as they stop working. Employees may
find they are covered by company sick pay for six months or a year, so can
afford to wait until that runs out.
The longer the deferred period you choose, the cheaper PHI becomes. The
shortest waiting period available is one month (although some companies do
not offer this); the longest is two years. The most common periods are 13
and 26 weeks.
The other choice to be made is between level and increasing cover. Level
means that the benefit remains the same and decreases in real value because
of inflation; increasing gives you the option of premiums rising by a set 5
or 7.5 per cent a year, or being index-linked, with the benefit going up in
proportion.
With some policies, the benefit level will rise by 5 per cent a year while
you are claiming, but will return to the original level when you return to
work.
PHI has been available for several decades, but claims have been more
frequent recently and for longer periods than insurers had previously
experienced. This has left some companies with a shortfall and a choice
between raising rates, changing the premium structure or pulling out of the
market.
'Some insurance companies are moving towards reviewable premiums so that
they can cover themselves against a sharp increase in claims,' says Bolland.
A reviewable policy means that the company can increase your premiums at its
discretion if claim levels are higher than expected. But Friends Provident
and Sun Alliance are two PHI providers which still offer guaranteed premiums
for the life of the policy.
A number of policies are unit-linked so that they build up a cash value over
the years. This can act as a cushion to prevent premiums rising immediately
if the company is hit by high claim levels. It can also provide a cash lump
sum when the policy expires or the holder dies.
The sum will be very small in relation to total premiums paid, however, and
probably non-existent in the early years. PHI policies are not designed as
savings products.
Most policies last until retirement age, but some companies offer renewable
policies which are for a fixed term, usually five or 10 years. At the end,
you have the option to renew the contract without further underwriting but
with higher premiums.
Companies which offer only reviewable premium policies will need to be
notified if you change your job, and may increase your premiums if the new
job is seen as higher risk, but the ones which have guaranteed premiums will
not usually make you pay more in these circumstances.
All companies exclude war disabilities, and injuries or illnesses caused by
alcohol or non-prescribed drugs. Attitudes to customers becoming HIV
positive vary. Some companies will cancel a policy automatically if the
holder tests HIV positive. Others will keep it in force but pay out only if
the person is unable to work because of an accident or illness unconnected
to HIV, such as a broken leg from a car crash.
Normally, the insurers will pay out if you are unable to do your own job.
But there are some occupations where insurers specify they will pay only if
you are unable to perform a job for which you are 'reasonably suited by
education, training or experience.' This usually applies to professions such
as airline pilots where even a minor problem, such as poor eyesight, can end
a career. Some jobs normally have an earlier retirement age than 60 or 65,
and the policy will incorporate that.
It is obviously in the companies' best interests to encourage you to return
to work as soon as possible. For this reason, most have a rehabilitation
option which allows partial payments if you return to your old job part-time
as you begin to recover. Most will also pay proportionate benefit if you
take up another less well-paid occupation while still unable to do your
normal job.
Some insurers offer housewife/husband policies which will pay a benefit if
you are bringing up children or looking after the home but cannot do this
because of illness. There is usually a standard level of benefit, around
Pounds 100 a week, under such contracts.
High earners need to check carefully how much of their salary a policy will
guarantee to replace. Some have relatively low limits, offering 75 per cent
of salary only up to around Pounds 30,000, and perhaps as low as 25 per cent
after that. The maximum salary which can be covered under individual
policies is in the region of Pounds 120,000.
Benefits paid under individual PHI policies are tax-free until after one
complete tax year has passed. Thus, if you start claiming in May one year,
you could receive up to 23 months' benefit free of tax. This does not apply
to employees covered by a company scheme, where benefits are taxed
immediately under PAYE.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Where to find a PHI policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOLLOWING is a small selection of companies providing PHI, but many
others offer similar policies. An independent financial adviser can help you
to find the best one for your circumstances.
Unless otherwise stated, the premiums quoted are for level cover for a male
white collar worker who is 35 next birthday, earns around Pounds 40,000 and
wants the maximum sickness benefit possible, retiring at 65 with a 13-week
deferred period; and for a woman with the same details except for a
retirement age of 60. The premiums quoted are for illustration and are not
strictly comparable.
Friends Provident. Guaranteed premiums. Maximum benefit Pounds 1,000 a week.
For benefit of Pounds 480 a week, a man's premium would be Pounds 43.24; a
woman's Pounds 58.12.
Norwich Union. Reviewable premiums. Maximum benefit Pounds 78,000 a year.
For a benefit of around Pounds 2,083 a month, the premium would be Pounds
48.20 for a man, Pounds 37.16 for a woman.
Permanent Insurance, a subsidiary of the Medical Sickness Society, which
insures doctors and dentists. Reviewable premiums. Maximum benefit Pounds
1,000 a week. For benefit of Pounds 521 a week, a man's premium would be
Pounds 44.35 and a woman's Pounds 68.97.
Prime Health, a specialist health insurer. Reviewable premiums for benefit
of Pounds 2,000 a month, increasing by 5 per cent, would cost a man Pounds
33.60 a month and a woman Pounds 43.
Standard Life. Reviewable premiums for benefit of Pounds 2,257 a month,
assuming a retirement age of 65 for both with cover increasing by 5 per
cent, would be Pounds 56.02 for a man and Pounds 82.97 for a woman.
Sun Alliance. Guaranteed premiums. Maximum salary coverable Pounds 120,000 a
year. For benefit of Pounds 480 a week, the man's premium would be Pounds
45.99 and the woman's Pounds 67.74, with non-smoker discount.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: 'Monopoly' under fire - Commission
queries private medical practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPLEX monopoly situation exists in private medical care and the
behaviour of parts of the medical profession and private health insurers
could be against the public interest, according to a letter from the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission which is investigating the industry.
The inquiry started in September and one of its provisional findings is that
9,500 NHS consultants last year fixed more than half of their fees for
private medical services at, or very close to, figures in the British
Medical Association guidelines or scales set by the British United Provident
Association and Private Patients Plan, two of the main private medical
insurers.
'We think that this conduct - of following what are, in effect, tariffs -
restricts competition,' the commission said in a letter to consultants and
others affected by the inquiry. But it emphasised that it had not yet
reached a conclusion on whether the effects of this were good or bad. The
commission's final report could be published in October.
'We have identified a number of 'issues', or respects in which the behaviour
of the BMA, Bupa and PPP, or of consultants, might be thought to be against
the public interest,' the commission said. The issues include whether
fee-scale publishing has led to charges being higher than would otherwise
have been the case, or has reduced regional variation.
At present, patients must be referred to a consultant by a GP before medical
insurers will meet a claim, and they will not pay for services not provided
by an NHS consultant or someone holding another approved qualification.
The commission questioned if these practices were bad for competition and
against the public interest. If it decides they are, the way could be opened
for non-UK qualified consultants to practice in the private medical sector.
The letter also asked 'whether any benefits to the public interest result
from the practices of fee scale-following by consultants or fee
scale-publishing by the BMA, Bupa and PPP.'
Bupa's David Bryant said of the letter: 'There could be some major
implications for the industry. Our schedule of procedures is mentioned; and
if that had to be removed, then that would change the basis on which we
conduct our business with our customers and the medical profession. We would
need some other method of paying claims.'
He suggested that Bupa's schedule of benefits actually acted as a ceiling
for medical costs. Charges on the BMA scale are usually higher than BUPA's
schedule.
Among possible remedies put forward by the commission - on which consultants
and other interested parties have been invited to comment - were:
Prohibiting the BMA from publishing its guidelines.
Stopping consultants fixing charges with reference to published guidance.
Prohibiting private medical insurers from reimbursing claims according to a
tariff.
Requiring consultants to itemise their charges.
Stopping differentiation between insured and non-insured private patients.

Rothschild Asset Management has changed the name of its New Court unit
trusts and restructured the charges. Since July 15, the New Court name has
been replaced by Five Arrows, a name derived from the Rothschild crest. The
name has been in use in other parts of the world for some time. The initial
charge for unit trusts was reduced from 6 per cent to 5.25 per cent on July
15, and the annual charge will be increased from 1.25 per cent to 1.5 per

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Dunedin looks east for recovery - At
a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dunedin Fund Managers this week launched a Japanese investment trust to take
advantage of what it sees as early signs of recovery in the Japanese
economy. Shares are offered in units, priced at 500p, of five shares with
one warrant attached. The warrant entitles the holder to buy one ordinary
share at 100p in the month of September in any of the years 1995-1999. The
minimum initial investment is Pounds 250, and the offer period closes on
Friday July 23.
For the first five years, Dunedin will donate 35 per cent of the 1 per cent
annual management fee to the charity Barnardo's, to be used for a series of
community projects around the UK. In exchange, Barnados is sending details
of the fund to its 185,000-strong mail list.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil was the best-performing emerging market in Latin America in the
second quarter, according to the quarterly monitor of emerging markets from
Fund Research. The market rose 24.8 per cent in US dollar terms in the three
months to July 1, and has risen 49.1 per cent in the year to date. The
strong performance in spite of high inflation is attributed to political
stabilisation and signs of economic recovery. In Europe, Turkey dominated
emerging markets, rising 58.7 per cent in the second quarter. Global
emerging market funds ran a close second to Asian funds in the last quarter,
outstripping Latin America and Europe by a considerable margin, Fund
Research says.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Franc under pressure - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc was under pressure on the foreign exchange markets this
week, prompted by depressing economic figures and high real interest rates,
together with the Bundesbank's decision not to cut official German interest
rates. The franc has come under periodic pressure over the past year, before
the Maastrich referendum and the general election, and also because of
market worries about economic problems, but it has resisted realignment
within the ERM. Sterling's position outside the ERM, combined with
favourable economic data, has enabled it to strengthen against other
European currencies, but summer holidaymakers will still find exchange rates
in Europe far less attractive than last summer, before sterling's exit from
the ERM.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Markets: Just how private are your affairs? - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RIGHT to privacy is one which people have every reason to expect from
those offering professional services. You would not expect your doctor or
accountant to give away details of your health or finances without your
permission, and if you found out that insurance companies or tax inspectors
were surreptitiously obtaining such information, you would have every reason
to feel outraged.
Customers expect the same degree of confidentiality of their banks, yet this
week serious concerns were voiced about the way in which banks hold and
release information about their customers' accounts.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said that banks
were breaking their own voluntary Code of Banking Practice, which was
introduced in March 1992 to improve bank/customer relations.
Under the Code, banks are not allowed to disclose customer information
unless it is at the request of or with the consent of the customer.
This is to prevent customers being pestered by bank subsidiaries, such as
their insurance arms, trying to sell them products. An increasing proportion
of banks' earnings is made through such 'cross-selling' of financial
products.
However, banks have been getting around this requirement in a manner which
Carsberg described as against 'the spirit and perhaps even the letter of the
Code.'
Tactics include requiring the customer to tick a box only if they do not
want information about themselves disclosed and making the provision of
services dependent on consent being given. Entry to some competitions or the
opening of some accounts is also on condition of consent being given.
In other cases, rather than supplying a subsidiary with customers'
addresses, the bank itself sends out junk mail on its behalf. This can be
refined so that financial information is indirectly passed on to the
subsidiary - for example, by telling the subsidiary that customers with a
minimum balance will be sent mailshots, so that the subsidiary will know
which are the most creditworthy customers.
Some customers with a healthy bank balance have received cold-calls at home
or their place of work by a bank's financial marketing arm inviting them for
a chat in order to sell them pensions and other insurance-related products.
This was the sort of behaviour which the Code of Banking was meant to stop
but clearly it has not been enough. Earlier this month, the National
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux called for a statutory code to
regulate banks' behaviour. It found worrying breaches of confidentiality to
third parties. In one case, a man's parents were telephoned and told that
unless his Pounds 370 overdraft was paid off, bailiffs would be sent round
to the parents' house.
Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, also expressed his doubts this
week that customer confidentiality is being upheld because banks and other
institutions sell information about creditworthy customers to credit
reference agencies.
These agencies are used by stores and lenders to rate the credit risk of
applicants. They supply details about bad debts and county court judgments
against the applicants to those who are authorised bodies. When an
individual wants to borrow money, it seems reasonable that the lender should
want to know something about them.
Under the Consumer Credit Act, individuals have a right to see the
information which is held on them by a credit reference agency. This is
particularly important for those who find they are being denied credit,
since banks can and do make mistakes and it can be a long time before
incorrect information is spotted - and even longer before it is amended.
Howe pointed to worrying developments in the way that this information is
gained and used. A black market in confidential personal information is
growing because the security systems of banks are being breached and a
loophole in the law protects the bank from prosecution. Unauthorised
individuals have been able to get information about a person's bank account
or credit ratings by calling a bank and pretending to be a tracing agent - a
licensed organisation which specialises in debt collection - or by bribing
bank staff.
If the information is obtained through this kind of deception, the bank
cannot be prosecuted for passing on the information. The problem is so
serious that Howe has called for a parliamentary enquiry and has suggested
changes in the law.
For the consumer, these are worrying developments. There was always a strong
suspicion that the Code of Banking Practice was little more than a public
relations exercise on the part of banks, and the alacrity with which banks
have got around their own guidelines will do nothing to diminish this
impression.
A committee headed by Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the
Bank of England, is reviewing the Code and any changes will be introduced
next March. But this may not be enough. Breach of confidentiality is a
serious matter and if a voluntary code is not enough to halt excess, a
statutory one may be needed.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Markets: A chill year for MFI - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MFI can still be considered a barometer of the UK's economic climate,
then the pointer still seems to be hovering around 'change'.
Predicting the fortunes of the furniture retailer and manufacturer,
moreover, has turned out to be a less exact science than forecasting the
weather, as analysts who were looking for profits of Pounds 80m plus from
MFI when it was floated last July have discovered.
On Monday, MFI unveiled a 39 per cent fall in pro forma pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 66.1m to Pounds 40.2m for the year to April 24 - only half some
forecasts a year ago. Investors may have been left wondering if MFI still
deserved its reputation as a strong recovery stock.
The results were, however, in line with recent forecasts.
Derek Hunt, MFI's chairman, warned at the half-year stage in February that
sales had nosedived after Black Wednesday in September, and trading in the
first half of its 10-week New Year sale, which usually accounts for a third
of annual turnover, was down.
MFI can do little about the state of the UK economy, but it did suffer
unduly from the sales downturn.
Sales fell further than than they might have done because MFI lost market
share to competitors such as B &amp; Q, Texas and Magnet during the January sale
by misjudging its pricing and advertising campaign.
Moreover, the drop in sales had a disproportionate effect on margins because
the items affected were mainly kitchens and bedrooms. MFI manufactures these
itself, and so enjoys both a manufacturing and a selling margin on them.
But the company is working hard to improve its performance this year,
irrespective of economic recovery.
After its experiences in January, it adjusted some prices - without, it
says, sacrificing too much gross margin - and revamped its advertising to
highlight not the massive percentage reductions it was making, but the
actual prices customers would pay for goods.
It is also refitting its stores, improving the display of beds and sofas,
employing more specially-trained staff, and increasing the range of flatpack
furniture. Some 56 of MFI's 175 stores have been refurbished, and have shown
a 6 per cent average sales increase. More stores will be updated this year.
MFI reduced overheads by 7.2 per cent last year. Analysts believe there is
more to come. The staff has been reduced by 820, and pay frozen this year.
The company has reduced occupancy costs in some of its larger stores by
subletting surplus space - providing rental income likely to reach Pounds
8.5m this year - and by buying the freeholds.
The company says the introduction of a computer system across the group will
lead to further savings.
But MFI has still to prove it can raise sales as effectively as it can cut
costs. Analysts are fond of referring to MFI's very high operational
gearing, which means even a small swing in the right direction would
significantly boost the bottom line. A 1 per cent rise in sales for MFI,
they say, adds about Pounds 3m to profits, and some are already talking of
Pounds 60m profits this year, assuming further productivity improvements and
a sales increase of about 4 per cent.
But that means sales must continue to improve - Hunt said on Monday they
were running about 3 per cent ahead of last year - and MFI must avoid last
year's mistakes.
Some observers believe MFI may reap less benefit than expected from any
economic upturn, as its product offer is not as strong as it was a few years
ago, and it faces growing competition not just from the likes of B &amp; Q, but
from Ikea, the Swedish furniture superstore operator.
On the other hand, MFI is a clearly focused business, with nothing to
distract it from its furniture stores, and its management enjoys respect in
the City and among other retailers.
'Derek Hunt is one of the best operators in the business,' said one rival
retailer yesterday. 'If things aren't going right he knows how to respond
very quickly.'
Given the question marks, however, many analysts believe MFI's shares, at
about 128p, are high enough, even if the economic barometer finally swings
towards 'set fair'.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Markets: Dow climbs through corporate wreckage - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble battens down the hatches for a war of attrition with rival
consumer products groups. Apple Computer takes a Dollars 320m charge and
announces plans to slash costs. Merck, the country's biggest pharmaceuticals
company, reels from the loss of its next prospective head. Corporate
disaster stories have littered the ground on Wall Street this week: but that
has not stopped share prices from scraping against their all-time highs.
It is not difficult to see where the support for share prices has come from.
The threat of renewed inflation, which haunted Wall Street earlier this
year, retreated further this week as figures for June brought the second
consecutive month of reassuring news. This drove the bond market still
further ahead during the week, cutting a further 10 basis points (0.1
percentage point) off the yield of the benchmark 30-year bond. That brought
the yield to within a whisker of the magic 6.5 per cent level of which fixed
income investors have been dreaming.
With long-term interest rates continuing to fall and no sign of the Federal
Reserve moving to tighten short-term ones, the equity market continued to
act as a magnet for investors' cash.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered ahead to 3550 on Thursday, close to
its May all-time high, driven by the bond market rally, though by midday on
Friday it had eased back to 3537 on profit taking. The more broadly-based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 had a less scintillating week, easing up to break
through 450 before slipping back slightly.
Where, though, is the earnings growth to lift share prices from their
current trading range and take the bull market on to new highs?
While equity prices remain in thrall to the bond market, there is little to
excite equity investors. The early signs from the second-quarter results
season offer scant hope of a new surge in share prices. Earnings figures so
far have been much in line with market expectations, reinforcing the
expectation of slow but steady growth as the US economy picks itself up out
of recession and exporters continue to struggle against the twin handicaps
of a strong dollar and economic weakness in Europe and Japan.
And then there were the disaster stories. Procter &amp; Gamble's announcement
that it planned to shed around 13,000 of its 106,000 jobs around the world
took Dollars 2 off its share price during the week. The shares were trading
at Dollars 50 1/4 at midday in New York yesterday. News of the restructuring
at Apple Computer wiped no less than Dollars 7 5/8 from the share price,
taking it down to Dollars 28 1/4 . Such news continues to act as a reminder
that the climb out of recession will be a slow and painful one for some of
the biggest companies in the US.
At current levels, the prospective price / earnings ratio of stocks in the
broad-based S&amp;P 500 index stands at an ambitious 22.5, according to Birinyi
Associates, a research firm. That may be lower than the 24.1 market p / e at
the start of the year, but it still represents demanding expectations of
earnings growth.
And with share prices rising faster than dividends, the average dividend
yield on stocks in te S&amp;P 500 has fallen to below 2.8 per cent. Falling bond
yields at least offer support for the market at that level: as yields on
bonds have plummeted faster than those on equities, the gap between the two
has dropped to less than 4 per cent, well below its average for the 1980s.
Any fall in the differential below this level would hark back to the 1970s
and 1960s, before investors learned to fear inflation, and would require
considerable confidence that low inflation was really back to stay.
While Wall Street continued to wait for news that would give a new momentum
to share prices, perhaps the general tone of buoyancy during the week was
accounted for by something altogether different.
Given the chunky bonuses they are likely to receive this year, it should not
be surprising if traders are feeling optimistic. Merrill Lynch recorded
second quarter profits up by a half, to a record Dollars 354m. JP Morgan,
which has managed the switch from commercial bank to trading house faster
than most, saw profits in the same period climb by a third. The share prices
of brokerage companies are around their all-time highs, back from the depths
of the late 1980s. The markets may still be trying to decide whether the
latest bull phase has further to run, but the boom times have certainly
returned for New York's financial district.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Markets: Is the bull market finally extinct? - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKING FROM only a small sample of DNA, stock market scientists are trying
to recreate the bull market of 1993. Why, they are asking, did the beast
which roamed the London markets until relatively recently die out?
After all, living conditions for the voracious animal have been near ideal.
Economic news has been better than even optimists hoped, and the positive
macro environment has been confirmed by some good corporate news. With those
lush green shoots to satisfy its appetite, how could the beast have starved?
Yet the equity market, which started in January with high hopes of a third
year of growth, is now down on its opening level.
Many of the scientists are hopeful that the creature has not actually died.
They point out that the equity market as measured by the Footsie index,
although down from over 2900 in the last three weeks, is still only a few
points below the 2846.5 it stood at on January 2.
Were it dead, signs of degeneration would be setting in and the index would
be much lower. Further, on the second tier index - the mid 250, or Tootsie -
the market is up 12 1/2 per cent so far this year.
In fact, rather than having starved to death, the scientists think that
their pet has been stupefied by a diet of excessive stock.
The final mouthful proved to be the Pounds 5bn BT3 issue which was weighing
heavily on the stomach up to the end of the trading week, when the offer
closed. On top of Pounds 7bn of new equity in the first half of the year and
the heavy sales of gilt-edged stock the government has had to make because
of its budget deficit, it is not surprising that even such a giant animal,
too stupid to realise when it has overeaten, has been stopped in its tracks.
As Nick Knight, strategist at Nomura Research Institute delicately puts it:
'The market has had a good night out, and now it is feeling a bit Uncle
Dick'. His remedy is either a short, sharp fall in the index to clear the
indigestion, or an Alka-Seltzer in the form of a base rate cut.
He points out that in the few weeks up to the BT2 share sale, in December
1991, the Footsie fell from 2550 to 2400, but it recovered all that amount
in the following few weeks. The same could happen again.
So how is the economy faring, according to this week's economic statistics?
The first was the manufacturing output numbers for May, released on Tuesday.
These were unexpectedly good, with total industrial production up 2 per
cent.
Then on Wednesday came news that inflation was running at only 1.2 per cent
in June, the lowest level for nearly 30 years. The holy grail of economic
growth combined with low inflation almost seems within grasp.
Thursday was even better, with unemployment falling yet again, productivity
up 10 1/2 per cent in May - a 13-year high - and average earnings up 3 3/4
per cent, a 26-year low.
Judging by these figures, Norman Lamont can feel vindicated and justified in
his backhanded compliment to Kenneth Clarke in the House of Commons on
Thursday. As for Clarke, after only two months in charge he might consider
resigning now while he is well ahead.
The good economic news was backed by some positive corporate news. Marks and
Spencer's annual meeting was a cheery affair, with the chairman reporting a
good start to the current year. And two estate agents, Savills and John D
Wood, reported a return to profits, the later only in the last quarter of
its financial year.
But perhaps the most interesting was from Rover, the car company owned by
British Aerospace, which reported worldwide sales up 13 per cent in the
first half of the year, including a 5 per cent rise in continental Europe at
a time when every other car maker is suffering sharp falls in car sales
there.
Rover illustrates just what a bonus the devaluation of sterling has been to
the UK's exporters, a competitive edge industry would be loath to lose via a
recovery in the pound.
So the chancellor may already be thinking about the next cut in base rates,
which could reawaken the bull market. As the chart shows, the relationship
between falls in base rates and the rise in the market's rating is close.
If European interest rates were to fall again, and push sterling higher, the
temptation to cut rates would increase. While on the one hand a rise in the
pound helps keep inflation down, a cut in base rates, if passed through to
lower mortgage rates, would also ward off a likely rise in inflation later
in the year. Lower interest rates would also help if the economic recovery
began to falter - a probability given what has been happening in the US.
Elsewhere in the corporate Jurassic Park, Great Universal Stores is planning
to mutate into a modern being with the ending of its two-tier share capital
and a new-style, Cadbury approved board structure.
GUS's shares have been stodgy performers for years, though never
disappointing. Perhaps that was not down to its voting structure - by which
the Pounds 4.7bn company was controlled by holders of 2.2 per cent of its
shares - but to fact that it has been converting from a retailer to a
property and finance group.
Of its annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 475m in the year to March, a quarter
was interest receivable on its cash pile of more than Pounds 1.3bn, 17 per
cent came from its non-retailing trading activities, and another 10 per cent
was rental income from its properties.
But if GUS moved into the present this week, Tiphook, the trailer and
container leasing group, re-entered the corporate equivalent of the primeval
slime. After a a Pounds 21.8m loss for the year to end April and a switch to
using dollars as its accounting currency, the shares were downgraded to
'speculative' by the Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency.

FT  17 JUL 93 / The Long View: A forecast too far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
FIRST, an apology. Plainly, I made a bad miscalculation last year when, in
the wake of Black Wednesday, I forecast that inflation would jump into the
range of 6 to 7 per cent over the next year.
As this week's figures have hammered home, the outturn is not going to be
anything like as bad as that. Like many other people, I have been surprised
at how little difference the exit from the exchange rate mechanism has made
to the profile of inflation.
The headline rate of 1.2 per cent for June is, of course, misleading. Cuts
in mortgage rates have been worth 1.6 percentage points over the past year,
and this bonus is likely to fall out of the annual comparison by early next
year. The underlying rate is nearly 3 per cent.
Why did I get it so wrong? Partly because I assumed there would be a
comprehensive post-ERM rebalancing of economic policy. Interest rates would
be cut very sharply, perhaps in stages to 4 or 5 per cent, and taxes would
be increased, almost certainly indirect taxes of the kind that push the
retail prices index higher. Sterling would fall a long way.
These drastic measures, I thought, would be necessary to address the
structural problems which show up in the notorious twin deficits, Pounds
50bn this year on government finances and Pounds 20bn on trade. If these
policies had indeed been followed, I believe underlying inflation would now
be around 5-5 1/2 per cent.
In fact, the Treasury brought interest rates down, grudgingly, to only 7 per
cent before being ordered by the prime minister to cut to 6 per cent in
January (which was the last change). The sterling exchange rate index, about
92 this time last year while the UK was still in the ERM, reached a low of
76.0 in February but has recovered by about 7 per cent since then.
More than half of the fall against the D-Mark since Black Wednesday has been
regained (although sterling is still down by a quarter against the dollar
and by a third against the yen). Taxes have scarcely been raised so far,
although VAT will go on household fuel next year and Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, is pondering whether to bite the bullet on taxes in his November
Budget.
The prospect after Black Wednesday seemed to be one of a painful but rather
short adjustment in which real incomes would go down and profit margins
would be widened. I was not much concerned about the danger of a permanent
increase in inflation (the monetary fuel for such an acceleration is absent)
but, rather, about a one-off upwards shift in the domestic price level.
The problem now is that the re-balancing process remains sadly incomplete.
It is hard to see a return to balance between imports and exports at this
level of sterling.
Companies are finding it hard to raise prices - indeed, a price war broke
out among national tabloid newspapers this week - while the big consumer
brand names in food and detergents are under heavy margin pressure. People
in work are still enjoying rises in real incomes, even though earnings
growth has dipped below 4 per cent.
This brings me to the other reason why I was too pessimistic about
inflation. The labour market has reacted with amazing restraint to the
floating of sterling. Earnings growth was very slow to decline during the
two years that the UK spent within the ERM, and it certainly seemed unwise
to expect that pay increases after last September would become any more
moderate than during the mid-1980s, when unemployment levels were roughly
similar and pay inflation usually fluctuated between 6 and 8 per cent.
Yet, it is obvious that conditions in the labour market are, in fact, now
quite different, perhaps because the fear of unemployment is much more
widespread than it was a decade ago when manufacturing industry bore the
brunt. Or perhaps it is that people are fooled by a headline inflation rate
of 1.2 per cent - although I doubt it.
In fact, some people are arguing that the UK, along with most of the
economies of the western world, is being gripped by profound deflationary
forces connected with banking industry contraction and the competitive power
of developing economies in the production of traded goods. The OECD expects
average inflation in the developed economies to fall to 2.8 per cent in
1994.
Global bond yields are continuing to trend strongly downwards because of the
weakness of inflation (the UK's own long gilt yield fell below 8 per cent
this week). But the gilt market is still discounting inflation of about 4.5
per cent, judging by the real yield on the index-linkers, and the City of
London consensus is that headline inflation will rise to about 4.3 per cent
by the end of next year (some leading forecasters are expecting 5 per cent,
partly because indirect tax rises will at last be coming through). These
inflation forecasts, however, are tending to be revised downwards all the
while.
It could be that the more moderate behaviour of the labour market will
rescue the government's half-hearted strategy. But the risk is that because
headline inflation will be rising next year, it will impose a delayed shock
while the economy is recovering, thus giving a push to pay inflation; it
would have been better for there to have been an instant shock while labour
market confidence was at rock bottom last autumn and winter.
Meanwhile, the structural imbalances in the economy pose a background
threat; while things are going well, they can be financed easily; but if
there is a mishap of some kind, they could easily generate crises of
confidence in the gilt-edged and foreign exchange markets. That is why it
would be so much better to see the back of them sooner rather than later.
To help cure them we need, you might say, a little bit more of the right
kind of inflation. But I am not going to make any more forecasts.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Through a glass, darkly: If nothing else, the case for
plain-speaking over Northern Ireland is now overwhelming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today he remarked how a shower of rain
Had stopped so cleanly across Golightly's lane
It might have been a wall of glass
That had toppled over. He stood there, for ages,
To wonder which side, if any, he should be on.
 - 'The Boundary Commission' Paul Muldoon
THE REVEREND Ian Paisley, scourge of liberals, Catholics and Irish
romanticism, who towers over Northern Ireland politics like the Mourne
mountains weep over Carlingford loch, was not being helpful.
As I tested, gingerly, his reaction to my plan for Irish unification, his
words of foreboding were as sulphurous as any in Paisley's three decades as
Free Presbyterian minister and hard-line Unionist leader. 'God knows what
will happen. There could be assassinations everywhere. It could be like
Yugoslavia.'
The British sell-out is already under way, he rasped. The effect could be
read in people's faces and in loyalist violence. 'I go to funerals and it
used to be that people talked. If they go today, they just walk. It's deep,
deep, bitter resentment and anger.'
Sitting in the small study of his voluminous Belfast home, Paisley glanced
at a photograph of loyalist folk-hero Edward Carson, whose militia trooped
in 1912 against Home Rule. Next to it on the wall were the wooden training
gun and bandoleer of Paisley's father. There was no doubt that he was
prepared to raise the loyalist standard again.
To have expected anything less would have been naive. Paisley's career has
been built on bogeyman politics; the apostates and Papists could not now be
let through the glass partition.
But the need for a positive contribution to stir debate and counter the
rhetoric of Paisley and his followers is overwhelming. Terrorism abounds,
but among politicians there is only imagery, stubborn threats - and an
overwhelming sense that for one side to give just a little would be to
shatter hundreds of years of history like a glass window caught in a
downtown explosion.
The province's political landscape has hardly changed since the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement when Margaret Thatcher and Dr Garett Fitzgerald, the
UK and Irish prime ministers, agreed that the south should have a token say
in the north's affairs. Since then the governments have looked to local
nationalist politicians and those who want to preserve the union with the UK
to dismantle the defences they have themselves erected.
Northern Ireland is the biggest problem facing two west European
governments. Each year about 100 people die. Damage to property in the
province and on the British mainland runs into billions of pounds. Yet the
recent Opsahl report on Northern Ireland, by independent commissioners,
said: 'The British government's insistence that it is an honest broker, and
that the ingredients of a settlement must be worked out by the two
communities, adds to the recipe for conflict.'
Hence my trip to see Ian Paisley, to look for a way beyond the miasma. To
say Irish unification is a bold proposal is an understatement. There are
doomsters aplenty, arguing that the Unionist veto that led to partition in
1921 is as potent as any time since the Protestant settlers of the 1600s.
But there is a robust logic to the case for unity that - if all ways forward
are to be explored - justifies testing. Leap forward a few years. A Northern
Ireland secretary sits in his panelled office overlooking Horseguards'
Parade, Whitehall. He baulks as news arrives of the latest terrorist
atrocity. Loyalist killings, supposedly in the name of King Charles III, are
rampant. His own life has been threatened by Protestant Red Hand Commandoes.
Bombings by the nationalist IRA on the mainland have not stopped.
But the newly-formed Democratic Unionist Paisley Memorial Party and the
larger, more moderate Ulster Unionist Party are encased in a glassy silence,
refusing to talk to the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party.
The secretary of state, who was at primary school when 'the troubles'
erupted, sighs and begins to draft a House of Commons statement:
'Mr Speaker, His Majesty's government is concerned about uncertainty over
Northern Ireland's future. The provisional IRA believes it can bomb the
British out of the province; loyalist paramilitaries kill nationalists in
retaliation.
'I emphasise that the government will never give in to terrorism, but we
accept that the people of Northern Ireland have a right to know about their
future.
'Over the 40 years since the 'troubles' erupted, many suggestions have been
made for accommodating unionist and nationalist aspirations. Few have won
support among more than a handful; none has endured.
'We believe there are only two practical choices. First, that Northern
Ireland should remain part of the UK in perpetuity. We could massively
escalate the security apparatus. Many Sinn Fein and IRA supporters could be
interned. A system of local government, as in English counties, could be
introduced. But the breaches of civil liberties would be indefensible, the
alienation of nationalists would deepen, the 1985 agreement would have to be
torn up and the geographical anomaly of a land divided along a border drawn
up after the first world war explicitly to create a protestant majority
would remain.
'The second option is a united Ireland (gasps). We intend to open
negotiations with the Dublin government about creating a new Ireland with
protection for religious freedom and a powerful devolved Ulster assembly.
'Northern Ireland citizens will keep rights to British passports and to live
in the UK. We see the new Ireland as having a special link with the UK,
particularly in a European context. We envisage the UK Treasury subsidy to
Northern Ireland, worth Pounds 3bn in 1993, continuing for many years. An
extra 10,000 troops are being sent tonight to the province to reinforce the
police against loyalist paramilitaries.
'It is a big step but, just as we cannot bow to IRA terrorism, we cannot
allow the threat of a loyalist terrorist revolution to dictate the agenda.'
(Uproar, shouts of 'Never', Ian Paisley Junior MP and 12 other Unionist MPs
plus two dozen Conservative MPs storm out of the chamber. 'Order, Order.')
Could it happen? Could a deal be struck between London and Dublin? How
violent would be the backlash of unionists? Would the people of Ulster ever
agree?
In Dublin, the aspiration to unite Ireland exists, but with the anger,
disarray and killings it would cause among compatriots in the north so
obvious, there is little appetite to turn dreams into realities. At the
Department of Foreign Affairs, a warren-like house off St Stephen's Green,
stacks of the 1984 New Ireland Forum Report fill a room. This is the text
from which the policy of the Fianna Fail and Labour party coalition
government is still drawn.
Compiled by nationalists opposed to violence, it prefered a united Ireland,
'achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland
and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of
both the Unionist and nationalist identities.'
So much is encouraging. But the words were carefully chosen. The emphasis at
the foreign affairs department under Labour's Dick Spring is on 'agreement
and consent'. He has angered the British government in the last week by
floating ideas such as 'joint-soveignty' - but only as proposals that could
be put to political leaders or voters in the province. It is striking
talking to officials and politicians in Dublin how unification talk is
regarded as blarney. I was left with a palpable sense of hypocrisy.
'There is no question,' one senior diplomat told me, 'of us imposing
ourselves on the people of Northern Ireland.' There is horror at the
prospect that Dublin might have to foot the bill for policing Northern
Ireland and subsidising its welfare state. The British Treasury's Pounds 3bn
annual subsidy is equivalent to a third of Ireland's total tax revenue.
Already the Irish Republic spends three times as much on security per capita
than the British.
In the Dail there still hangs a copy of the 1916 proclamation of
independence, asserting: 'We declare the right of the people of Ireland to
the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies.'
But on the opposition benches, Prionsias DeRossa, leader of the Democratic
Left and former president of the Workers Party - which sprang out of the
official IRA when it declared a ceasefire - is now prominent in the campaign
for Ireland's constitutional claim on the north to be amended. He was
interned in the late 1950s but renounces terrorism because: 'You don't win
freedom by denying someone else their freedomcatastrophe.'
Far more immediate are the problems of a 19 per cent unemployment rate.
Middle class families who have moved from north to south Ireland complain
about low child benefit, the cost of health care or education and of poorer
roads.
Northerners' suspicions, particularly of the continuing dominance of the
Roman Catholic church, are reflected in inward reappraisal among the Dublin
political establishment. 'Society in the republic is going through a process
of rapid change,' says Ivan Yates, a protestant Fine Gael member of the
Dail: 'Traditional values and beliefs and the influence of religion are all
parts of this process of change.'
Thus impetus for unification would have to come from Britain. Backing for
unification by consent has come close: it is Labour party policy and, except
after a particularly horrendous atrocity, Northern Ireland rarely rates as a
political issue at Westminster. There is a sense of despair and - let us be
frank - indifference as long as the number of casualties appears
containable.
Formal links between the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionist Party are all
but broken. Under James Molyneaux, UUP leader, the party's MPs sit on the
opposition benches. Statuesque friends of the union like Enoch Powell and
Ian Gow have retired or been murdered by the IRA.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, says Britain has no economic
or strategic interest in Northern Ireland. He uses a careful formula: the
province will remain part of the UK so long as a majority of its population
want to stay. The Northern Ireland Office would object strongly, but it does
not take much twisting of words to convert that into saying that Britain
would back unity by consent.
Andrew Hunter, Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee chairman, complains
that the government's policy encourages the 'one more heavers' in the IRA.
But indifference now is far from saying that unification could win support
among Conservative MPs. Such a move would depend critically on whether a
deal could be peacefully achieved. At this point the argument for
unification by consent begins to fall apart. For it is apparent to any
visitor to Northern Ireland that there could never be agreement on anything
other than that Ulster's tragedy is deep indeed.
It is wrong, for example, to suppose that Northern Ireland's Roman Catholics
will soon outnumber the Protestants. Censuses have been misleading because
until recently Catholics were urged by Sinn Fein not to answer the voluntary
religion question. So the Catholic population is shown as jumping from 28
per cent to 38.4 per cent over the past decade.
Smoothing out such aberrations, Professor Paul Compton,of Queens University,
Belfast, reckons the Catholic population is growing by roughly 2 percentage
points a decade. 'If you extrapolate that it still gives you between 40 and
50 years before you have a Catholic majority and it will probably be another
20 years before there is a Catholic majority in the voting population.
Whether they will all want a united Ireland as well is another question.'
But the defences against encroaching nationalism are already being raised.
In a spartan office above a parade of shops in Lisburn, Ray Smallwood and
David Adams puff nervously at cigarettes. They are chairman and secretary of
the Ulster Democratic Party - ostensibly a fringe unionist party, committed
to peaceful means, but regarded as voicing the thoughts of the outlawed
Ulster Defence Association, a shadowy umbrella organisation for working
class unionists and loyalist paramilitaries.
'The British people of Ulster know,' says Smallwood, 'that the 1985
Anglo-Irish dictat is about a process of unification by the back door.' UDP
membership, he reckons, is more than 200.
What would happen if unification moved closer? 'If my right to self
determination was taken away. . . ' His voice trails. He pauses, then looks
at me. 'All people have a right to self-determination.'
That unspoken threat of the protestant population rising in revolt is
prevalent across Northern Ireland, not just in the hearts of organised
extremists. It worries the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The loyalist terror
groups, the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force, are not
as numerous as the nationalist IRA but older leaders have been purged,
replaced by more ruthless, younger commanders. The security forces believe
members move in and out, making infiltration harder.
So far they remain largely a reactive force, retaliating against the IRA.
The UFF and UVF have access to guns and grenades but as yet have no
bomb-making facilities. Arms come from east Europe, South Africa and via
pockets of Orange loyalism in Scotland and north England. Financing is via
large-scale racketeering and extortion. At a time of perceived crises,
however, the number of paramilitaries could quickly rise to wreak havoc
across the province. The mostly-Protestant RUC itself, and the Royal Irish
Regiment, would be under pressure to avert revolt within their ranks.
In the middle class belt that stretches eastwards along Belfast lough from
Northern Ireland's capital, the stubborn resistance of the Ulsterman is
obvious. Talking to locals about unification closes doors, not opens them.
Two local businessmen I approached refused to talk, even about the massive
scope for cross-border trade (only 5 per cent of the republic's exports are
to the north). They were probably sensible - strong words could catch the
ears of paramilitaries looking for economic targets.
Go into people's homes, and talk of unification is treacherous. Suspicion of
the Irish republic - regarded as a safe haven for nationalist paramilitaries
 -is rampant. 'There is too much history, too many people have been killed.
These things are not forgotten. I'd leave the country,' said one
professional family man I met.
At Bangor Rugby Club I met Ronnie Boston, former club president and a
retired local businessman. The club is a member of the all-Ireland rugby
league but limits are firmly drawn: 'There was no conscription here during
the war,' he says, 'but 100,000 people volunteered so it would anger me if
Britain did announce that it was going to let Northern Ireland go. Our
ancestors laid down their lives for the British.'
Such realities are not lost on leaders of the nationalist community. John
Hume, veteran leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, told me that
a 32-county Ireland 'can only evolve and it can only evolve based on
diversity.' He does not talk about divided territory, only divided people.
'Ireland is already one piece of land.' The SDLP looks to the model of
European union - even though the Unionist community is among the most
Euro-sceptical in the UK.
So the glass walls remain. The most poignant impression is of how the
province is seen through prisms in London and Dublin. The republic acts as
if pursuing unity but clearly could not accept unification without consent,
and consent will not be forthcoming. The UK government wants a
locally-acceptable settlement but seems blind to the uncertainty and fear
its neutral position creates. At least Ian Paisley is unequivocal.
A first step towards peace would be for both governments to be explicit
about what they want. Is Dublin serious about unification? If not, why not
say so? The air of dangerous confusion might clear. If both governments can
agree on the province's constitutional future, a common strategy could be
devised to tackle terrorism and economic deprivation. There would be some
certainties.
It would be far better than politicians in London and Dublin standing there
wondering which side, if any, they should be on.

FT  17 JUL 93 / EC banks unite to keep krone in ERM
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S European Com-munity partners yesterday joined forces to defend the
embattled krone with concerted intervention as Danish authorities again
raised interest rates to hold the currency in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
ERM central banks launched several waves of buying for the krone. But after
intervention, estimated by some market participants at between DM3bn (Pounds
1.1bn) and DM4bn, the krone closed the week near its lower intervention
points in the ERM.
The Danish National Bank announced yesterday it would raise its key deposit
and discount rates from 7.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent from Monday. The
Dutch central bank cut its special deposit rate to 6.6 per cent from 6.7 per
cent in an effort to ease tensions between the krone and guilder in the ERM.
Yesterday's speculation against the krone caused the EC to postpone yet
again a meeting of its monetary committee, scheduled for Monday in Brussels,
for fear that it might become a focus of speculation. The committee had been
due to meet on July 14 but that meeting was delayed because of speculation
against the French franc.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank governor, declared the krone would
'be defended no matter what happens'.
Ms Marianne Jelved, the Danish economy minister, said her government fully
supported the interest rate increases. She said Denmark was determined to
take every possible step to protect the krone within the ERM.
With Danish prices having risen by only 0.9 per cent in the year to June,
she said the latest speculation was 'without any basis in economic reality'.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Miyazawa set to lose majority: Ruling LDP leader denies
suggestion of VAT rise in run-up to poll

JAPANESE politicians have taken to the streets for their final pleas to
voters before tomorrow's general election, which is expected to leave the
ruling Liberal Democratic party without a majority and struggling to find a
coalition partner.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, entered the final day of the
campaign with a cabinet popularity rating of 10.3 per cent. Campaigning in
Hiroshima yesterday, he was forced to disown an ill-timed suggestion that an
increase in an unpopular value added tax might be necessary.
Other LDP officials, aware that talk of lifting the 3 per cent tax could be
a vote-loser, insisted there would be no need for an increase after the
election and said the greatest threat to the economy's health was political
instability.
A survey of executives released yesterday by the Japan Association of
Corporate Executives found that the appreciation of the yen and the fall of
Mr Miyazawa's government have prompted more business people to expect a
delay in economic recovery.
Three months ago, 17 per cent of the executives surveyed thought the
recovery would not come until next year or later, but the figure is now 29
per cent. The association found that member executives, on average, expect
economic growth of 1.8 per cent in the year to March 1994 against a figure
of 2.18 per cent three months ago.
Japanese executives have generally supported calls for political reform, but
there are concerns that the election will be inconclusive, creating a year
or more of political instability and hindering the introduction of a
stimulatory spending package.
An opinion poll released yesterday by Jiji, the Japanese news agency,
suggested that 38.2 per cent of respondents favoured a post-election
coalition government led by the LDP, while 25.7 per cent preferred a
coalition containing newer groups such as the Japan Renewal party and the
Japan New party. These results contrasted with the 25.6 per cent of voters
who said they would support the LDP tomorrow, down from 31.9 per cent in a
similar survey taken a month ago by the same agency, and a sign that the
polished performance by Mr Miyazawa at the Group of Seven summit earlier
this month was not enough to satisfy voters.
In spite of his cabinet's unpopularity, Mr Miyazawa was confident yesterday
he would win another term as prime minister. His fate is likely to be
decided by the voting patterns revealed tomorrow evening.

FT  17 JUL 93 / PSBR rises sharply despite higher government receipts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT borrowing in the first three months of the financial year rose
by nearly a quarter on the corresponding period of 1992-93, according to
Treasury figures published yesterday.
The deterioration came in spite of higher-than-expected government receipts
last month caused largely by individuals and companies paying their tax
bills early.
The public sector borrowing requirement in April-June was Pounds 13.2bn,
compared with Pounds 10.7bn in the same period a year earlier.
Government borrowing in June came to Pounds 3.88bn, nearly Pounds 1.5bn less
than forecasts by City economists. The increased flow of cash into the
Treasury from tax payments only partly compensated for a big rise in
government spending, caused by higher social security payments linked to the
recession.
The figures provide a warning of the fiscal problems facing the government.
They came after a series of favourable statistics earlier this week which
showed manufacturing output is picking up, while unemployment is coming down
and retail price inflation is at a 30-year low.
The Treasury expects the gap between spending and borrowing this financial
year to reach Pounds 50bn. It will decide over the next few months whether
new tax increases next April are required to bring down the deficit.
Last month, central government receipts came to Pounds 15.6bn, 12.6 per cent
up on the Pounds 13.9bn recorded in June last year. Receipts from income tax
and value added tax were buoyant, partly as a result of payments which would
normally be made later in the summer being brought forward to June.
Government officials said this might be due to new rules requiring big
companies to pay VAT monthly rather than quarterly. Another reason was
advance payment of tax the self-employed.
In the first three months of this financial year, central government income
totalled Pounds 48.4bn, 5.5 per cent up on the Pounds 46bn collected in the
equivalent time last year. Over the same period, spending by central
government rose 8.5 per cent to Pounds 61.3bn from Pounds 56.4bn.
In June, overall borrowing was brought down slightly through the government
collecting Pounds 210m in privatisation proceeds.
City and academic forecasters expect the 1993-94 PSBR to be Pounds 47.6bn,
slightly less than they estimated in June and just under the Treasury
projection, according to non-government forecasts issued yesterday by the
Treasury.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in gold during the second quarter of the year had a stagey - if not
stage-managed - feel about it. Clearly the central character was Sir James
Goldsmith, who successfully cut his involvement in Newmont Mining back to 5
per cent, helped by the fact that gold has floated up towards Dollars 400 an
ounce. His other interests in bullion or gold options are, naturally enough,
now a lot more difficult to fathom. While he has publicised his gold-buying
sprees, there has been a notable silence over any profits which might have
been taken.
The opacity of Goldsmith's trading activities is just one reason why
speculators are wary of jumping in at this level. Hedge funds and bullion
unit trusts which have been buying as they have moved up the performance
tables would quickly turn sellers if the price starts to slide. There are
also persistent rumours that central banks are writing options against
bullion holdings at about Dollars 400, which would certainly slow any rise.
Yet the run is not entirely speculative. Fabrication and other end uses for
gold will consume more than total mined output this year. The oddest element
of the recent rise is that it has happened against a background of strong
deflationary forces worldwide. Either the Jeremiahs of economic doom sense
something distantly over the horizon, or this is the start of a classic
speculative fit. The latter seems more likely, but the difficulty then is
calling the turn. There may well be a pull back, but bullion does not yet
feel to have run its course.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fiasco over the scheduling of News at Ten highlights in technicolour the
unwieldy operation of the ITV network. If the ITV system did not exist,
nobody would bother to invent it. Splitting one television channel among 15
companies is manifestly wasteful and prevents more resources being devoted
to programme-making. Some industry rationalisation may occur next year when
the moratorium preventing hostile takeovers of the smaller companies ends.
But given the inertia of government, Mr Peter Brooke seems unlikely to lift
the restraints on any of the big nine companies buying each other. The only
spur to change might be if a foreign company bid for a station and aroused
jingoistic passions.
It is bizarre to regulate any industry in such a way, especially when a
clear distinction can easily be drawn between the ownership of a TV station
and its regional character. Some big bets are now being placed on this
nonsense ending. Granada's Pounds 90m acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in
LWT is the boldest move. The carrying cost of this investment will be about
Pounds 4m a year. But the prize will be great if the rules are changed and
Granada can win LWT and merge its operations.
Yet in a truly open market, LWT would be worth more to its neighbour,
Carlton, which could be expected to win any bidding war. In that case,
Granada may effectively exchange its LWT holding for LWT's own interest in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, creating a strong northern operation. As for Carlton,
it may fall back on buying Central, in which it holds a 20 per cent stake,
if, as seems likely, the MMC blocked a bid for LWT. The large companies seem
more inclined to wait for the bigger catches to wriggle free than to chase
the smaller fry. This makes the surging share prices of the tiddlers rather
hard to justify.

FT  17 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The unseemly scuffle between Spring Ram's management and its institutional
shareholders is developing into a minor City classic. Three profits warnings
from Spring Ram in eight months have, to say the least, left the management
with a serious credibility problem. The finance director has been the one
sacrificial lamb so far. But the company's furious shareholders, led by the
Prudential, are still charging head first at the apparently immovable
chairman and chief executive, Mr Bill Rooney.
Without the injection of fresh management and adherence to a coherent
strategy, Spring Ram's shares will continue to founder and its trading
position deteriorate. As things stand, the company would be defenceless
against even a derisory bid. Any profits forecast from Spring Ram in such
circumstances would surely be greeted with hollow laughter.
There is a danger that if the institutions oust Mr Rooney there may be
boardroom defections which would leave the company rudderless. The onus must
be on Spring Ram's sheepish board to resolve the situation. Ironically, Mr
Rooney might be the greatest beneficiary from his own departure. He and his
family trusts own 16 per cent of Spring Ram's equity and must crave the
restoration of share price stability.

FT  17 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Rating recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrast between this week's upbeat economic statistics and the sombre
mood of the equity market is slightly unnerving. This is particularly so for
those optimists who have been looking for the FT-SE 100 index to move
decisively over 3,000. The real economy is clearly recovering, even when
allowance is made for the fact that May's industrial production figures were
badly distorted by bank holidays. The main impetus for economic growth is
coming from manufacturing - especially in capital goods and exports. That
cheering, if unlikely, news was followed by the lowest inflation rate for 30
years and best unit wage figures on record.
Yet companies remain cautious and forecasts of this year's profits are not
rising. Despite recovery, earnings may struggle to rise by 15 per cent and
dividends may not increase by more than 3-4 per cent. Given Budget tax
changes, institutions will see their dividend income fall this year. The
equity market largely discounted recovery in the last quarter of 1992, and
so far in 1993 the Pounds 8bn of rights issues, Pounds 1bn of enhanced scrip
dividends, Pounds 3bn of new issues and BT3 have all been a drain on
institutional and private investors' cash flow. Low inflation is also
putting pressure on the margins of companies close to consumer markets. That
squeeze will pass back down the chain to manufacturers. The stock market may
be able to live with a higher rating if inflation is low, but companies have
yet to prove they can deliver the earnings to justify the price.

FT  17 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency pressure excites
Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market pressure switched from the French franc to the Danish crown
yesterday, leaving Paris wary, and Copenhagen a little excited, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS offered conflicting views. Some observers believed that if the krone
were forced out of the ERM, the assault on the franc would be renewed with
added vigour. Others said that the franc will resist all attempts by
speculators to break the ERM, given the publicised support of the German and
other European monetary authorities.
The CAC-40 index ended 11.85 higher at 1,974.93, a week's gain of 0.5 per
cent, in turnover estimated at FFr2.5bn.
A strong rise was noted in Matra-Hachette, up FFr6.40 or 5 per cent at
FFr133.4, partly on rumours that the group had won a defence contract.
Elsewhere Michelin gained FFr5.10 to FFr173 and Peugeot by FFr10 to FFr630.
COPENHAGEN climbed higher on speculation about a possible devaluation of the
krone as the currency came under attack from speculators in the money
markets.
The KFX index closed up 0.55 at 90.62 in turnover of DKr430m.
Den Danske Bank closed up DKr6 at DKr327 while Unidanmark climbed DKr4 to
DKr184.
As options and futures contracts expired on the Deutsche Terminborse,
FRANKFURT expected selling from the DTB in an attempt to push the DAX index
down to 1,800. Instead, it got late buying from the same source, said Mr
Jurgen Rossa at B Metzler, and the DAX closed 5.80 higher at 1,813.46.
Turnover eased from DM8.4bn to DM7.7bn. There were contrasts in carmakers
where worries over the future of the Volkswagen director, Mr Iganacio Lopez,
sent the shares down DM5.20 to DM360.50 as Daimler rose DM5 to DM677.50.
DB Research yesterday reconfirmed the buy recommendation it made for Daimler
in mid June. That got into the post-bourse where Daimler was bid up to
DM693.50, more than DM100 ahead of its price on June 14. The Ibis-indicated
DAX responded with a rise to 1,829.43 in the afternoon.
AMSTERDAM rose on the expiry of options, the CBS Tendency index closing up
1.0 at 118.0, but off the day's high of 118.6. The index has gained 1 per
cent on the week.
Nedlloyd ended at a 12-month high on speculation that a US group was seeking
a merger with the shipping division. The shares put on Fl 1.50 to Fl 38.10.
KLM closed off 10 cents at Fl 33.30 after earlier seeing Fl 34.20 as it said
that it would match the fares of a US competitor on transatlantic routes.
Hoogovens rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 41.10 after Thursday's news that the city of
Amsterdam had sold its 5 per cent stake.
MILAN was pleased at the performance of the enlarged screen trading system
which came into operation yesterday. Most of the major stocks are now
available on the telematic, which accounts for some 80 per cent of total
market capitalisation.
The Comit index finished 1.84 higher at 556.41, a rise of 2 per cent on the
week, in good volume.
Telecommunications issues fell back after Thursday's news of delays in the
privatisation programme: Stet slipped L149 to L3,776 and Sip lost L74 to
L2,736.
However, losses in this sector were the exception with the other blue chips
picking up gains across the board. Fiat put on L134 to L6,604 and Pirelli
L80 to L1,589. Generali continued its rally and broke the L40,000 level with
a rise of L258 to L40,008.
Benetton, another popular stock at the moment, ended L302 higher at L20,562.
ZURICH saw most interest in special situations as the SMI index eased 2.7 to
2,396.4, 0.3 per cent down on the week after Wednesday's 1993 closing high
of 2,419.0. SMH, the watchmaker, fell SFr4 to SFr234 after SFr222, down
SFr31 on the week after a Goldman Sachs downgrade on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Saurer, the textile machinery and technology group, recovered
another SFr50 to SFr2,150 as Mr Vittorio Ghidella, who resigned as board
chairman on Thursday, handed himself over to Italian authorities, as the
group appointed the former Volkswagen chief, Mr Carl Hahn, to replace him
and as it forecast higher earnings for 1993.
STOCKHOLM closed higher for the ninth straight session on gains in selected
blue chips and in the forestry sector. This helped offset a decline in
Ericsson, which has led the market's rally this week, as its B shares lost
SKr3 to SKr380.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 3.1 to 1148.0, up 3 per cent on the
week. Turnover was SKr869m.
OSLO rose to a new 22-month high, led by strength in shipping stocks. The
All-share index rose 3.13 to 521.72 and the shipping index 15.82 to 571.99.
Bergesen put on NKr5.50 to NKr152. Hafslund Nycomed went against the trend,
losing NKr5.50 to NKr120 following downgrades of pharmaceutical shares in
the US on Thursday.
ISTANBUL closed the week on a positive note although some sporadic
profit-taking was noted throughout the day. The composite index gained 173.6
to 10,617, for a rise of 3.3 per cent on the week.

technology sector

Wall Street
US SHARE price movements were governed by the release of corporate quarterly
results yesterday, and a sell-off in the technology sector triggered by
disappointing figures from Apple Computer had a particularly savage effect
on the Nasdaq market, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.64 at 3,528.29, pulling away from
its record levels. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.47
at 445.75, while the Amex composite lost 1.51 at 436.47, and the Nasdaq
composite tumbled 8.96 at 699.73. Trading volume on the NYSE was more than
264m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,000 to 896.
Meanwhile a report of weak consumer confidence lifted treasury prices. In
late trading, the treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up  7/32 at 107
19/32 , yielding 6.538 per cent, while the one-year note was unchanged to
yield 3.956 per cent.
The University of Michigan's early reading on its July consumer sentiment
index reportedly showed a decline to 76.9 from 81.5 in June.
Liz Claiborne was one of the biggest losers of morning trading. The stock
plummeted Dollars 6 5/8 to a 52-week low of Dollars 23 after the women's
apparel maker posted second quarter earnings of 38 cents a share, down from
47 cents a year ago, and forecast a 30 per cent slump in full year earnings
for 1993.
Shares in The Limited, a chain of women's apparel stores, edged Dollars  1/4
lower to Dollars 21 1/8 , and The Gap, another specialty retailer, fell
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 7/8 .
Heavy third quarter losses at Apple Computer took a toll on the entire
technology sector. IBM lost Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 45 5/8 . Texas
Instruments fell Dollars 4 to Dollars 71 7/8 in spite of unexpectedly strong
second quarter earnings and Storage Technology dropped Dollars 4 3/4 to
Dollars 28 1/2 , adding to its Dollars 7 7/8 loss on Thursday on the back of
disappointing results.
Shares in Apple plunged Dollars 8 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/2 in heavy Nasdaq
trading. News that the company had lost Dollars 188.3m in the quarter, after
a pre-tax charge of Dollars 320.9m, was released after the close of trading
on Thursday.
Among other Nasdaq technology stocks PictureTel dropped Dollars 6 1/8 to
Dollars 19 1/2 after the manufacturer of visual communications systems
reported second quarter net income of 17 cents a share.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices ended solidly lower in relatively quiet trading.
According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index was down 29.48 points,
or 0.75 per cent, to 3,901.79, for a loss on the week of about 26 points.
Losing issues were ahead of winners by 280 to 434, volume slowed to 44.694m
shares from Thursday's 65.046m and trading value was CDollars 510.2m against
CDollars 732m. Twelve of the 14 sub-indices fell. Energy declined 1.82 per
cent and industrial products, mining and golds fell more than 1 per cent.

FT  17 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rises
ahead of elections

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE afternoon buying by futures traders, covering their shorts ahead of
Sunday's general elections, fuelled speculation of an imminent rate cut,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 173.51 to 20,331.53 after a low of 20,164.72 in
the morning session and a high of 20,352.54 just before the close. The index
was up 2.3 per cent on the week.
Volume was 330m shares against 385m. Gainers led losers by 707 to 299, with
385 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 13.20 to
1,652.88 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.57 to 1,257.12.
Arbitrage buying centred around shares linked to the Topix index rather than
to the Nikkei 225. Traders said that investors and arbitrageurs were
shifting futures positions to the Topix contract as the Nikkei 225 future is
expected to be changed to a new 350 issue index. New investment trusts funds
worth Y150bn, launched yesterday, also helped to support the market.
The communications sector was strong on the advance of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, which rose Y15,000 to Y915,000. Companies with close links to NTT
were also stronger, with NEC up Y48 to Y1,020.
Speculators dabbled in Gajoen Kanko which rose Y27 to Y170 on bargain
hunting after falling by its daily limit on Thursday.
Kirin Brewery gained Y20 to Y1,280 in spite of its announcement that it
would withdraw adverts and sponsorship for concerts and other events after
the revelation of its links to racketeers. Analysts feared this would hit
profits at a time of declining demand, because of the economic slowdown.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 91.09 to 22,379.86 in volume of 21.9m shares.
Roundup
INDIVIDUAL issues dominated the trading on the region's markets yesterday.
TAIWAN fell back on heavy selling in the Big Three banks after the
provincial assembly dissolved without voting to approve their dividends.
The weighted index lost 55.13 to 3,914.04, for a week's fall of 3.8 per
cent. Turnover was TDollars 13.5bn against Thursday's TDollars 14.4bn.
First Commercial Bank plunged TDollars 6.50 to TDollars 139, Changhwa lost
TDollars 4 to TDollars 119 and Hua Nan dropped TDollars 7 to TDollars
126.50.
HONG KONG declined on institutional selling in thin trading. The Hang Seng
Index shed 53.32 to 6,925.22, a 2 per cent fall on the week. Turnover was
low at HKDollars 2.7bn against HKDollars 3.9bn on Thursday.
China related stocks continued to dominate, with the newly-listed Tsingtao
Brewery easing 5 cents to HKDollars 3.55.
SINGAPORE gathered pace in late trading on bargain hunting. The Straits
Times Industrial index picked up 14.71 to 1,777.66, a 1 per cent fall over
the week.
KUALA LUMPUR, too, rebounded strongly at the close on bargain hunting and
renewed institutional and retail buying. The KLSE composite index rose
21.55, or 3 per cent to 735.78, 1.1 per cent up on the week.
MANILA eased on selling of blue chips after Philippine Long Distance
Telephone fell in overnight New York trade. Its shares lost 5 pesos to 1,000
pesos and the composite index shed 9.01 to 1,615.06, a 1 per cent drop on
the week.
AUSTRALIA closed below the 1,800 level on selling of key issues. The All

turnover of ADollars 282.5m.
BHP lost 16 cents to ADollars 14.50 and CRA 34 cents to ADollars 13.40.
The market was prevented from a steeper fall by the alcohol and tobacco
index, which added 100.4 or 1.8 per cent, to 5,526.6.
BANGKOK ended broadly lower as turnover slipped to its lowest level for a
month. The SET index dropped 4.69 to 885.36, in turnover of Bt2.8bn, off 2.4
per cent on the week.

FT  17 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: US indices propped up near their record
highs - Patrick Harverson on equity theory in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As long as interest rates keep coming down, US share prices are likely to
remain propped up near their record highs. While they may not go up much
further, the markets should not suffer any kind of serious setback if
borrowing costs in the US remain at the lowest levels seen in more than
thirty years.
This, at least, is the theory that the market optimists are counting on, and
recent trends in stock prices support their view. In the past few months
equities have bounced up and down, but always within a relatively narrow
range. And that range has been close to the markets' peaks - so that at any
time prices could reach, or exceed, previous record highs.
It happened earlier this week. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed within 13 points of its record high of 3,554.83, and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, the broadest market measure, closed within 6
points of its all-time high of 456.33. The Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks actually moved into virgin territory, buoyed by
strong demand for smaller company and technology stocks. The new record was
712.49. The Russell 2000, the most comprehensive index of small-cap stocks,
also set a new record high.
These gains were not achieved in a typically subdued mid-summer market.
Volume has held up surprisingly well, considering that summer is well
underway and that many market participants, sensibly, have fled to the beach
or to the country.
On Wednesday, when the Dow climbed 27 points, volume reached 285m shares on
the market's busiest day in six weeks. Clearly, some investors are still
hungry for stocks, although it appears that they are being very choosy - not
buying the market, or sectors, as a whole, but seeking out the recovery
plays, the inexpensive stocks or under-appreciated companies with growth
potential.
In spite of recent gains, and the ability of stocks to hold their ground at
historically high levels, there is not much of a consensus on Wall Street
about where prices are heading next.
Overall, the balance of opinion probably still favours the cautious
forecasters. They warn that, with stocks looking expensive and earnings
growth less than impressive because of a near-stagnant economic recovery, a
correction, albeit not a large one, may be somewhere around the corner.
Yet the tentative forecasts of the pessimists are based upon the assumption
that interest rates are staying where they are, or possibly even going up.
And rates show no such inclination to go up, or even to hold steady. On
Thursday, after two sets of encouragingly weak inflation data, the yield on
the benchmark 30-year government bond dropped to 6.550 per cent, the lowest
it has been since 1977 when the Treasury began issuing 30-year bonds on a
regular basis.
Some bond market economists predict that yields will fall further -
certainly to 6.5 per cent, and possibly lower, because the inflationary
pressures that bumped yields higher in the spring have abated, and because
the economy continues to under-perform. The most bullish of bond market
forecasters believe that President Clinton's deficit-reduction package will
depress economic growth, and lower interest rates further. For them, yields
in the 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent range would not be out of the question.
Such a situation would be both good and bad for equities. The good part
would be lower interest rates, which would divert more investors' cash into
equities and which would cut the cost of borrowing for companies. The bad
part would be the weak economy, which would crimp corporate profitability
and dampen demand for jobs, restricting consumer spending in the process. If
the positive and negative factors balance each other out, prices should
trade near their record highs, but not much beyond that. In other words,
expect more of the same.
Among those forecasting lower interest rates is Ms Elaine Garzarelli of the
investment bank Lehman Brothers, who is one of Wall Street's biggest bulls.
Like many others, she believes that President Clinton's deficit reduction
package will keep interest rates low. Where she differs from her
counterparts, however, is in her analysis of how the package will affect the
economy, and how, ultimately, stock prices will react.
Instead of slowing the economy, she says, 'deficit reduction will cause
moderate economic growth, allow interest rates to remain low, and lead to
higher stock market valuations'. Ms Garzarelli has enough confidence in the
markets to predict that the Dow will break through 4,000 before the year is
out, and reach 4,500 some time next year.
There is only one thing missing from the talk of deficit reduction, interest
rates, stock valuations and economic growth - corporate earnings. The
markets have held their ground well in recent months because improvements in
earnings have been priced into stocks. If companies fail to match those
expected improvements, a sustained sell-off may be inevitable, even with
declining interest rates.

FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL action shook stock index futures which have recently been treading
water and brisk selling was followed by a rally that left the September
contract at a healthy premium to the cash market, Christine Buckley writes.
The expiry yesterday morning of the July contract on index options
stimulated dealers to gauge their positions in futures. The contract opened
at 2,840 and quickly fell to 2,827 as selling started. It stayed around that
level until 10.30am signalled the end of the July contract and then futures
set off upwards. Some bounce came from the lower-than-expected public sector
borrowing requirement figures.
The contract closed at 2,847 putting it just over 8 points ahead of its fair
value premium to cash of 7 points. Volume was 7,512 lots. Traded options
kept a steady volume at 26,418 lots with the July contract expiry triggering
action in index options - the FT-SE 100 option was 8,254 and the Euro FT-SE
100 option at 4,991.

FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Resort suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shock suspension of shares in Resort Hotels sent reverberations around
the hotel sector, impacting in particular on the market's other leading
small regional hotelier Friendly Hotels, which fell 21 to 198. Resort shares
were suspended at 45p, the company concerned 'over a number of financing and
reporting issues' and sacking its managing director. An independent
accountants report is being commissioned.
Leisure analysts, philosophical at the second suspension to hit the sector
this year following Queens Moat Houses, said that while the information flow
from Resort could have been better, concern over the company's debt levels
had already put the stock on a low rating. One analyst said: 'The most
worrying aspect is that Queens Moat and Resort, which are both specific
situations, could frighten off investors from the sector just at the time
when it's beginning to take off.'
There were no such worries at Forte yesterday as the company said it was
increasing the size of its floating rate note announced on July 9 from
Pounds 70m to Pounds 100m. The proceeds would be used to cut its short-term
debt. Forte shares gained 2 to 222p.
Meanwhile, the insurance sector was alive with bid speculation. The
strongest of the many rumours doing the rounds was that Commercial Union was
eyeing Sun Alliance. The latter held a near-15 per cent stake in the former
until it was sold last September. However one analyst dismissed the
speculation saying it was nothing but 'idle summer talk. Such a deal does
not make sense.' Shares in Commercial Union closed 4 ahead at 620p, on
volume of 1.1m, with Sun Alliance up 6 at 378p, in trade of 1.7m.
Another name mentioned as a possible target for Commercial Union was
Guardian Royal Exchange. The shares firmed 4 to 203p. The bid talk in the
sector boosted Royal Insurance which closed 3 up at 322p on heavy turnover
of 4.7m.
An upbeat agm statement from Thorn EMI helped the shares climb 8 to 920p.
The stock was also boosted by a hefty buy note from Smith New Court. Analyst
Mr Bruce Jones said: 'Thorn is ideally positioned to exploit the growth of
world music markets and, with advances in rental, should produce significant
benefits to shareholders.'
Another torrid day's trading saw Rank Organisation tumble initially on a
wave of criticism over its dividend policy announced on Thursday. But the
shares rallied during the session to close 8 off at 739p.
After Thursday's shock announcement on enfranchising its non-voting shares,
Great Universal Stores continued to make ground, the 'A' shares adding 35 to
1910p. Next, where GUS is tipped to go shopping in the near future, gained 2
1/2 to 177p.
International trading group Inchcape fell 7 to 528p, on volume of 3.5m after
James Capel was reported to have downgraded current year profit expectations
by Pounds 10m to Pounds 290m. Sentiment was also said to have been damaged
by the cancellation of a series of briefings to analysts usually held just
before the company goes into closed season.
Another resurgence of rights issues rumours knocked Tarmac down 2 1/2 to
127p. Although the story has hovered over the stock, the company's on-going
review of its housing division has rekindled the speculation. Turnover was
moderate at 2.7m.
The selling of its loss-making housebuilding company by Costain Group pushed
down its price 3 to 36p. The purchase by Redrow was well known, but the
staggered payment arrangement disappointed some analysts.

FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: P&amp;O property hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation that P&amp;O was about to announce a huge Pounds 600m property
disposal drove the shares sharply forward. They closed 13 ahead at 633p, in
strong turnover of 3.2m. US buyers were said to have contributed
significantly to that total, with rumours that Quantum Fund was in the
market for stock.
Quantum, which is owned by Mr George Soros, the billionaire investor,
recently established a property vehicle with British Land and talk in the
market suggested that this could be the recipient of any deal with P&amp;O.
British Land shares finished 9 better at 352p.

FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks hit by US downgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUG stocks weakened in the face of a wave of negativity from the US, with
Smith Barney leading the charge. The broker suggested that stock prices,
which are some 25 per cent off their all-time highs of 18 months ago, could
face a further correction of around 30 per cent within the next 12 months.
The reasons for this, according to Smith Barney, are likely to be triggered
by either patent expirations, or generic substitution of some of the
sector's leading brands.
The broker cut its forecasts across the sector and moved its industry rating
from 'neutral' to 'underperform and high risk'. Warning of the rising
dangers to some of the leading drugs, analyst Ms Christine Heuer said: 'For
investors, we believe the situation is untenable. The downside risk is
simply too great; we can envisage no commensurate upside potential.' She
added that 1994 could bring dividend cuts for some of the drugs stocks which
'could send shock waves through the investment community'.
Among the worst hit stocks, Glaxo slid 14 1/2 to 538 1/2 p, SmithKline
Beechm rallied to close 6 off at 415p and Wellcome finished 16 down at 634p.

FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Late buying boosts struggling FTSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE flurry of buying interest, prompted by a burst of takeover
speculation in the composite insurance arena, enabled the UK equity market
to limp into positive territory at the end of a dismal week and trading
account.
The FT-SE 100 share index closed 1.3 higher at 2,833.0, reducing the decline
on the week to 10.2. Over the two-week trading account the index fell 24.7.
The FT-SE Mid 250 index remained under pressure however, closing 8.0 lower
at 3,217.5, extending the fall on the week to 19.3.
The market lacked enthusiasm ahead of the start of trading on Monday morning
of BT partly-paid shares. Dealings in BT3 will commence at 7.30am on Monday,
a full hour before the rest of the market, to ensure smooth trading.
Dealers said they expected BT3 shares to get off to a reasonably good start,
which should put more heart back into the stock market after its recent poor
showing. Since the start of the month the FT-SE has fallen from the
2,900-level, despite a run of highly encouraging economic data.
Mr Ian Harnett, equity market strategist at Strauss Turnbull, the
French-owned securities house, said this week 'has seen the best week of
economic news since 1987-88'.
The news included a strong rise in manufacturing output, a further fall in
unemployment and the lowest headline inflation rate for thirty years.
Gilts, unlike equities, slipped back after a firmer opening, with sentiment
slightly upset by news of the next gilts auction and a small decline in
sterling. By the close the long-dated issues were around 1/16 lower on
balance.
The equity market fell back at the outset, dragged down by renewed weakness
in the drug stocks which were hit by a series of profits downgrades
instigated by Smith Barney on Wall Street overnight.
Oil shares were looking vulnerable as more analysts were said to be moving
to lower their oil price forecasts and earnings estimates for the big oil
companies.
At its worst the FT-SE was down 9.3 within the first hour of trading
yesterday. Thereafter, the leading stocks embarked on a painfully slow rally
which left the FT-SE index marginally higher on the day.
Turnover remained surprisingly high with the non-FT-SE comprising 57 per
cent of the day's total of 628m shares traded. The value of customer
business on Thursday was a healthy Pounds 1.44bn.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: All hands on Danish krone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danish krone finished the week clinging to its position in the ERM after
a concerted effort to defend it by European central banks, writes Stephanie
Flanders.
A string of announcements on Friday morning confirmed that the Belgian,
French, Spanish and German central banks were joining the Danish and Dutch
authorities in purchasing the Danish currency. The Danish unit was under
steady selling pressure throughout the day, which reached its height during
the afternoon as speculators gambled on a weekend realignment.
When London markets closed, the krone was trading just above its ERM floor
of DKr3.9016 against the D-Mark, at DKr3.8885. The currency had closed on
Thursday at DKr3.8925.
Traders were divided about the volume of krone trading on either side.
Rumours that the combined intervention of behalf of the krone totalled
around DM3-4bn were generally considered plausible.
Some thought that the Danish government's claim that it had enough reserves
to defend the currency meant that large speculative selling had not quite
begun. 'They could not say that if the big money was involved,' said one
London-based trader. Julian Jessop, of Midland Global Markets, confirmed
this: 'Today's pressure on the krone is the collective action of many small
players. There's no-one big in the market saying it has to go.'
By and large, the situation was hard to gauge, as Malcolm Barr at Chemical
Bank in London explained: 'There are echoes of the previous ERM tumults,' he
said, 'but at the same time the crisis has a different character, it is less
frantic, despite all the central bank interventions.'
Few thought that the ERM could ultimately survive a Danish devaluation. 'The
Danish have made a show of good faith by increasing their interest rates to
help the krone,' said one analyst. 'If the Bundesbank does not help them by
cutting rates, the markets will really begin to wonder if they would do it
for the franc.'
The dollar was largely sidelined by events in the ERM, although there was a
brief rally in the dollar-yen rate with the announcement of unexpectedly
good US trade data. This took the dollar to Y108.70 at one point, before
falling back as European markets closed, finishing at Y108.15, only slightly
above Thursday's Y108.20.
Despite the ERM turbulence, sterling lost ground yesterday against the
D-mark and the dollar, falling throughout the day to close at DM2.550 and
Dollars 1.4790 in London, down 1 1/2 pfennigs, and nearly a cent, on
Thursday's finish.

THE DUTCH central bank yesterday buttressed its continued support for the
Danish krone by cutting 10 basis points off a key money market rate, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
Lowering its special advances money market rate to 6.60 from 6.70 per cent
was a surprise move by the Dutch authorities. But some in the markets
considered it a 'dry run' for Bundesbank official rate cuts at its council
meeting on July 29.
Although the official German interest rates cannot fall until then, the
relaxed liquidity conditions in Germany created by Wednesday's generous
Bundesbank tender might allow German call money rates to fall substantially.
Yesterday afternoon German overnight money stood at around 7.10 per cent,
against 7.30 per cent at the beginning of the week, and 7.18 on Thursday.
Dealers speculated that the Bundesbank will set a lower, fixed repo rate
next week if it wishes to appear more supportive of the ERM. But since the
market is likely to take the repo rate down, with or without the central
bank's assistance, the policy shift would be somewhat cosmetic.
Yesterday's turbulence drove up the Danish short-term interbank interest
rate to over 40 per cent. In the afternoon, the Danish National Bank
announced that it would raise its key deposit and discount rates to 9.25 per
cent from 7.25 per cent from Monday to give the krone extra support.
The Bank of England forecast another sizeable shortage yesterday morning of
Pounds 1.35bn. In contrast to the previous day, the shortfall was quickly
dealt with in the early rounds. The majority of the funds consisted of bills
for repurchase at an interest rate of 5 29/32 per cent. Overnight rates
began at 5 5/8 per cent and finished at 4 5/8 per cent.
Sterling money markets were very quiet for most of the day, with period
rates little changed at the end of trading. Rates for sterling futures were
similarly subdued. The December sterling contract edged down three basis
points from Thursday's close to end the week at 94.37.
Liquidity conditions next week look set to be more changeable, with
settlement of the BT3 share offer on Monday. 'Some people may be concerned
about Thursday's Maastricht vote, but the underlying uncertainty for the
next few days is about money, not any shift in policy', said one London
trader.

lowest since October 1990

APPLE Computer's share price plunged Dollars 7 1/2 by noon yesterday and
slipped a further Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 27 1/2 , its lowest since
October 1990.
The fall followed disclosure of the personal computer pioneer's worst
quarterly losses and signs that sales of its Macintosh computers are
slowing.
Apple reported third-quarter losses of Dollars 188m, or Dollars 1.63 a
share, after the market closed on Thursday. The losses included a Dollars
321m pre-tax charge - much higher than analysts had expected - to cover the
costs of 2,500 job cuts announced last week.
Analysts were also shocked by Apple's weak operating results. Excluding the
restructuring charge, pre-tax profits slumped to Dollars 17m, from Dollars
212m in the same quarter last year. Revenues of Dollars 1.86bn also failed
to meet analysts' expectations of around Dollars 2bn.
The results were the worst in the history of the company, which was hatched
in a Silicon Valley garage in 1976 and went public four years later to
become one of the most influential forces in personal computing.
Apple said shipments of its Macintosh PCs increased by 20 per cent in volume
in the quarter, but revenues rose only 7 per cent. Apple has been forced
repeatedly to cut Macintosh prices as it struggles to maintain market share.
While expressing confidence that Apple could quickly return to
profitability, Mr Michael Spindler, Apple's new chief executive, warned the
company 'must significantly - and permanently  - lower our cost of doing
business'.
Mr Spindler replaced John Sculley as chief executive last month. He had
previously been Apple president. Mr Sculley remains chairman of the company
in charge of strategic alliances. In spite of denials by the company, Mr
Sculley is widely rumoured to be planning to leave the company. He is
currently on sabbatical.
Yesterday several Wall Street analysts downgraded their recommendations on
Apple's stock and revised projections for future earnings. They expressed
concerns that additional restructuring charges may be needed.

VOLKSWAGEN will return to profit in 1994 even if demand for cars does not
improve and turnover remains unchanged, Mr Werner Schmidt, group finance
director, claimed yesterday.
Sales fell 12 per cent in the first six months of the current year to just
under DM39bn (Dollars 22.6bn), he added, and would reach DM80bn 'with a
little luck' in the full 12 months, compared with DM85.4bn in 1992.
Deliveries of vehicles had also fallen 12 per cent at the half-way mark to
1.63m units, Mr Schmidt said.
The increased strength of the US dollar would have a positive effect,
although because of a sharp fall in US deliveries, the Volkswagen of America
subsidiary would again suffer heavy losses.
Last year, when group profits plunged 87 per cent to DM142m, the US business
lost DM100m.
Seat, the Spanish business, was also heading for a further deficit after
losing DM180m in 1992, Mr Schmidt said.
VW has repeatedly stated that it expected to return to profit in the third
quarter of this year and break-even overall, in spite of a DM1.25bn loss in
the first quarter.
The group has implemented job cuts and other cost-cutting and improved
efficiency measures.

CHINA MERCHANTS, one of the largest Beijing-controlled conglomerates in Hong
Kong, yesterday said it would pay HKDollars 509m (USDollars 65.7m) to take
its interest in Hong Kong Chinese Bank to 50 per cent from its current 15
per cent holding.
Hong Kong Chinese Bank is the main asset of HKCB Bank Holding, a company
controlled by Lippo, an Indonesian-Chinese finance and property group listed
in Hong Kong which is controlled by the Riady family.
Prior to yesterday's deal HKCB owned 85 per cent of the bank. China
Resources and Lippo have had a longstanding business relationship. In
addition to its interest in the bank, China Resources owns 4.9 per cent of
Lippo and 1.3 per cent of HKCB.
The two are partners in Hong Kong Building and Loan Agency, a locally-listed
mortgage financier. In March, Lippo paid HKDollars 164m for a 67.6 per cent
interest in the company, and later sold a 10 per cent holding to China
Merchants.
A general offer and subsequent placing of stock - to enable Hong Kong
Building and Loan Agency to remain listed - has left Lippo owning 65 per
cent of the company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO POPULAR, Spain's sixth-largest commercial bank in terms of assets,
said its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1993 had risen 7.6
per cent over the same period last year, to Pta29.9bn (Dollars 221.5m).
Although Spanish banks had become accustomed in the recent past to report
double-digit profit increases, performance has been badly hit in the past
year by recession and mounting bad debts. Analysts in Madrid said yesterday
that Popular's figures could be regarded as very strong in the
circumstances.
Popular is consistently the most profitable of Spain's larger banks and is
frequently rated as one of the most profitable in the world. The bank
eschews the large industrial holdings common among its Spanish rivals and it
has quietly and successfully avoided being drawn into the many market share
battles being fought among Spanish banks for savers and consumers.
Popular said it had made provision for loan losses and other costs of
Pta11.7bn, a 32 per cent increase on the first half of 1992.
But operating income rose 12 per cent to Pta104bn, faster than the 8 per
cent increase in operating costs. Nevertheless, the figures showed that
while the bank's consolidated financial margin grew 14.1 per cent over 1992,
the cost of deposits grew by more than 17 per cent, reflecting tighter
margins as competition intensifies.
Total assets, which fell slightly in the first quarter, increased by 3.5 per
cent overall in the first half to Pta2,903bn.

TEXAS Instruments reported a record second-quarter performance, boosted by a
strong improvement in its semiconductor operations.
Net income and net revenues for the electronics manufacturing group reached
an all-time high.
Net revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.1bn, up 13 per cent from Dollars
1.9bn in the same period last year, while net income was Dollars 112m, or
Dollars 1.18 a share, compared with Dollars 72m, or 73 cents, in last year's
second quarter.
Profits were well above Wall Street projections of about 99 cents per share.
Profits from operations for the second quarter were Dollars 173m, compared
with Dollars 128m in the same period last year.
Substantially higher profits from semiconductor sales more than offset a
loss in computer operations, the company said.
Defence electronics profit margins remained stable on lower revenues.
Semiconductor revenues increased by 26 per cent, while the digital products
division increased sales by 4 per cent. Defence electronics revenues dropped
8 per cent.
'TI's semiconductor business has improved steadily over the past five
quarters, despite delayed economic recovery in some of the industry's key
geographic regions,' said Mr Jerry Junkins, TI chairman, president and chief
executive.
Semiconductor orders reached record levels in Japan, Europe and the
Asia-Pacific region, with strong demand across all product lines, Mr Junkins
said. Revenues from semiconductor patent royalties contributed Dollars 125m
in the quarter, including Dollars 31m from agreements reached during the
quarter with Hyundai Electronics, Gateway 2000, and Nippon Steel
Semiconductor.
Mr Junkins announced plans to increase capital spending on semiconductor
production facilities to about Dollars 700m this year, an increase of
Dollars 50m over the company's previous projection.
He also reported that TI's joint venture semiconductor manufacturing
operation in Japan with Kobe Steel achieved volume production during the
quarter.
Another joint venture with Canon, Hewlett-Packard and the Singapore Economic
Development Board, in Singapore, began operations during the quarter and is
expected to reach volume production next year.
Net revenues for the first six months of 1993 were Dollars 4bn up 12 per
cent from the same period of 1992.
Net income for the half-year was Dollars 192m, or Dollars 2.04 a share, up
from Dollars 112m, or Dollars 1.10, in the same period last year.

However, it has completed a reshuffle of share-holdings with the Luxembourg
state and Societe Generale de Belgique to establish the vehicle which will
eventually form the partnership.
The Luxembourg state and SGB have each transferred 440,000 shares to
partnership vehicle Luxembourg Generale Arbed (LGA). This brought
Luxembourg's stake in Arbed's voting stock to 31.87 per cent, or 34.11 per

SGB's stake fell to 14.96 per cent of voting stock, or 19.33 per cent of

FT  17 JUL 93 / International Company News: Crucial debut for Swedish model
 -The 900, to be launched next week, is vital to Saab
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAKING a play on his country's national emergency telephone number, a Swede
joked last week that the long-awaited new model that Saab Automobile will
launch next Wednesday should be called the Saab 90000, not the Saab 900.
Few in Sweden would fail to appreciate the wisecrack. Saab, 50 per cent
owned by General Motors of the US since 1989, is widely perceived to be
relying on the new 900 to secure its future after a succession of losses
that have raised a question-mark over the company's survival.
It is not just the fate of Volvo's local rival that is at stake: GM has seen
Saab losses rebound with painful effect on the results of its overall
European operation. Saab's other 50 per cent owner, Saab-Scania, is in turn
100 per cent held by Investor, the chief industrial vehicle of the
Wallenberg family, itself battling against losses and high debts.
Not least, the demise of Saab would deepen worries in a country proud of its
industrial heritage that it has become too uncompetitive to sustain such a
large-scale business as motor manufacturing.
With so much seen to be riding on the success of the new 900, it is not
surprising that Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, a Briton who has been in charge
of Saab since last September, tries to play down the 'make or break' tag
that has been pinned on the car. 'It is the beginning of the process of
rejuvenation,' he says at Saab's headquarters and assembly centre just
outside the western city of Trollhatten.
It is clear, however, that rejuvenation is well-nigh impossible unless the
new model is a hit. Apart from a 900 convertible, Saab has only one other
model, the luxury 9000 range, on the market. The new car is replacing the
old 900 model, which was launched in 1979 - and that was based on the 1968
Saab 99.
Saab last made a profit in 1988. Since then it has run up losses of more
than SKr10bn (Dollars 1.25bn). Since mid-1991, GM and Saab-Scania have
together pumped in SKr8.3bn in two capital injections to keep Saab going.
Sales have slumped from 109,483 cars in 1989 to 86,800 last year. In the
first half of this year, sales in the US and western Europe were down by
29.6 per cent and 28.8 per cent respectively.
The new 900, competing in the same market segment as the BMW 3-series and
the Audi 80, is hitting falling markets in most of Europe, while demand for
this type of vehicle in the US is still weak.
'Yes, it is very tough,' says Mr Butler-Wheelhouse. 'I would just say we are
lucky in one respect: we are launching a car the size of which and the price
of which are still within the reach of many people. I would far rather
replace the 900 now than the 9000.'
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse was brought in by GM, which has effective management
control at Saab, from South Africa where he had led the management buy-out
of GM's local business in the 1980s.
He has pressed on with the task of drastically restructuring Saab to
increase productivity and win the cost advantage from the link to GM.
Since GM came in, the workforce in Sweden has been halved to 7,300 and the
number of plants cut to three. Productivity of 56 hours per car for the 9000
is still high, but compares with the 110 hours of three years ago.
Moreover, the figure for the new 900 will be 35 hours per car at launch and
will come down to less than 30 hours next year - approaching market-leading
figures for Japanese plants in Europe, according to Mr Butler-Wheelhouse.
Break-even point is now around 80,000 cars a year sold.
The GM link has also enabled Saab to reduce the time and cost of developing
the new 900 model by around 30 per cent, says Mr Stig-Goran Larsson, Saab's
product development chief.
The car, which industry analysts estimate cost less than SKr5bn to develop,
shares a number of base components with the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier.
But a key element of the strategy behind the car is that it is a Saab, not a
GM product.
Mr Larsson stresses that his development team includes only one person from
GM - a financial officer. 'There has been a concern that we keep our
identity,' says Mr Larsson, clearly speaking for his Swedish colleagues at
Saab. 'If we lose that, what is Saab then? Then it is lost.'
Much effort has been put into ensuring that the new 900 'looks like a Saab
and feels like a Saab'. This extends from quirks like keeping the ignition
on the gear-stick console, to making the body design as reminiscent of the
highly individualistic old 900 as possible.
This is not for sentimental reasons. GM readily agrees that it bought into
Saab in order to reach a market niche that its mainstream cars could not.
Whatever tensions there might be between the top management GM has put in
place and the Swedes below them, GM agrees that Saab must retain its place
as an individualistic car known for its responsive drive and its 'Swedish'
qualities of safety and reliability.
'There is absolutely no sense in GM doing anything to negate the equity in
Saab's name,' says Mr John Fleming, Saab's American marketing chief.
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse says that it will take about six months before it will
be clear if the new 900 has been a success. In the meantime, he will make no
forecast about a return to profit, beyond pointing out that first-quarter
losses were cut by 50 per cent to SKr138m.
Design work is going ahead on a new 9000 planned for sometime in the next
five years. Earlier talk of a third top-of-the-market model been supplanted
by discussion of a model smaller than the 900. But for now it is no more
than discussion. Everything hinges on the 900. Mr Butler-Wheelhouse says
that GM and Saab-Scania have patience. However, he acknowledges: 'What they
don't need right now is a lame duck.'

FT  17 JUL 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Iraq/UN talks dominate
oil market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EYES of the world's oil traders remained fixed on New York this week as
United Nations and Iraqi representatives continued negotiations there on the
proposed Dollars 1.6bn one-off sale of oil to pay for humanitarian aid.
As the threat of this untimely influx into an already oversupplied market
was perceived first to wane and then to wax prices for the commodity
responded accordingly. At London's International Petroleum Exchange this
resulted in a welcome boost to business, with daily turnover on the crude
oil market peaking on Wednesday at 61,738 lots, the highest level since the
mid-January allied strikes against Iraqi missile sites.
The market began the week in a cautiously bullish mood, encouraged by
reports that the New York talks had become deadlocked over the weekend. The
resulting upturn lasted for a few days, lifting the IPE's September contract
from last Friday's Dollars 16.80 a barrel to Dollars 17.23, before the trend
was abruptly reversed on Wednesday night by news that the negotiators were
thrashing out a draft agreement for submission to Baghdad. The ensuing fall
sent the price down to Dollars 16.35 a barrel at one stage, but it recovered
to reach Dollars 16.84 in late trading yesterday, up four cents on the week.
The UN/Iraq talks are to resume next week, though the precise date remains
unspecified. While clearance for the proposed sale would clearly be bearish
in itself it would at least end the present uncertainty, which some oil
dealers believe is preventing the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries from addressing the more fundamental problem of above-quota
production within its ranks.
Excess supply is an equally familiar problem in the copper market and one
that this week appeared to return to its rightful prominence following the
recent technically-inspired rally. The downtrend that set in on Friday of
last week continued unabated in the first half of this week, taking the
three months delivery price at the London Metal Exchange down to Dollars
1,861 a tonne at one stage. Technical factors then reasserted themselves to
some extent and the price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,914 a tonne, but
that was still Dollars 60 down on the week and Dollars 106 below the
three-month peak reached before last Friday's sell-off.
The technical supply tightness that pushed prices to last week's highs and
lifted them from this week's lows is reflected in a very narrow cash
discount against three months metal - Dollars 2.50 at last night's close,
compared with a more normal Dollars 30 two months ago - and that is worrying
the exchange's management. Mr David King, the chief executive, told members
this week that the LME board was concerned about the situation. That was
taken as a clear early warning that a move into substantial 'backwardation'
 -where nearby positions command a premium over forwards - could prompt some
form of exchange intervention. Backwardation is usual in periods of severe
supply shortage, but with the exchange's registered warehouse stocks now
close to a 15-year high it would raise suspicions of market manipulation.
Other LME contracts were undermined by copper's weakness, notably aluminium,
which closed yesterday at Dollars 1,208.50 a tonne for three months
delivery, down Dollars 36 on the week, and zinc, the three months price of
which was Dollars 32 down at Dollars 940.50 a tonne.
News yesterday of a serious explosion at Metaleurop's 250,000-tonnes-a-year
lead/zinc complex at Noyelles-Godault, France, did little to boost prices of
either metal. The three months LME lead price closed unchanged on the day at
Dollars 404.75 a tonne, down Dollars 7.75 on the week.
Meanwhile the three months nickel price was pushed to a fresh six-year low
of Dollars 5,057.50 a tonne, down Dollars 210 on the week, after news of a
further big rise in LME stocks.
At the London bullion market the gold price, having last week demonstrated
its inability to break decisively through the Dollars 400-a-troy-ounce
barrier, this week reluctantly accepted Dollars 395 an ounce as the top of
its present range.
In the process it seemed to have lost the good opinion of the speculators
who had driven it to a post-Gulf War peak and an increasing number of
analysts were talking in terms of how low far the price could slip rather
than how high it might rise.
Silver continued to hold up well, however. A mid-week dip to Dollars 4.97
1/2 an ounce was shrugged off as New York buyers returned and the price
ended the week three cents up at Dollars 5.06 1/2 an ounce.
At the London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee futures built on the uptrend
started two weeks ago by the agreement among Latin American producers to
retain 20 per cent of their exports from the start of October as frost fears
in Brazil encouraged the more bullish sentiment. But the frosts failed to
materialise and prices backtracked towards the end of the week. At
yesterday's close the September futures position, which had peaked on
Tuesday at Dollars 1,016 a tonne, stood at Dollars 977 a tonne, down Dollars
4 on the week.
Cocoa traders began to take a less sceptical view of constructive
supply/demand factors this week and nearby futures climbed to 19-month highs
at one point. The September position was trimmed back by Dollars 8 to Pounds
767 a tonne yesterday, following an overnight downturn in New York, but that
was still Pounds 3 up on the week.

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Institutions bid for 2bn BT shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders had bid for more than 2bn British
Telecommunications shares after the international offer closed yesterday.
The final figures will not be released until tomorrow, but SG Warburg and
Co, global coordinators of the bookbuilding exercise, said that orders for
2bn shares had been received by the close of the first day of bidding and
that the book had grown since then.
A total of 1.2bn shares are on sale, tentatively split equally between
institutions and retail investors although the ratio might be changed over
the weekend. Trading in the partly paid shares begins on Monday.
Of the institutional bids received it is believed that as many as 1.5bn were
at a price equivalent to about 12p over yesterday's closing price of 408p
for existing shares. The premium is close to the theoretical value to
investors of 13p a share of buying part-paid shares.
As a result of the demand, several leading UK institutional investors said
that they expected the deal to be highly successful but they no longer
thought the shares worth bidding for at this price.
'It's just not worth it at this level,' said one life insurance company
investment manager.
Another insurance company fund manager said that while he had placed bids
for up to 1m shares, he realised that the prices he offered for them were
too low relative to where BT shares were trading late Friday.
'We won't get any shares and we don't care to at these prices', he said.
Figures from the first day's bidding suggest that UK institutions are less
enthusiastic than their counterparts abroad about the new shares. Although
UK shareholders account for well over half of all current BT investors, they
were only half of all bidders on the first day.
Retail investors have applied for just over 1bn BT shares in the UK public
offer, according to final figures released yesterday. This is slightly more
than expected but well down on applications for 1.7bn in the last sale of
government BT shares in 1991.

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Food in US deal with Del Monte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Food Group, the Bradford-based food processor floated in March,
has quickly fulfilled its promise to expand by announcing a Pounds 17.8m
deal with Del Monte Corporation, the US food company.
It is setting up a joint venture to acquire the US group's Californian-based
business, Del Monte Dried Fruit, which is one of the largest participants in
the US market, processing a variety of dried fruit and fruit snacks under
the Del Monte brand.
Mr Mike Firth, chairman and chief executive of YFG, said: 'The business is
one we know very well. It has a strong retail presence and we believe its
quality product range can be extended to non-retail markets. We also believe
there is scope for substantial cost-savings under our management.'
The Californian business will be acquired by a newly incorporated company,
Yorkshire Dried Fruit, of which YFG will control 80 per cent and DMC the
rest. The consideration will be about Dollars 26.7m (Pounds 17.8m), to be
satisfied by Dollars 20.2m in cash and the balance by shares in Yorkshire
Dried Fruit.
In order to fund its investment, YFG will raise Pounds 11.4m through a
placing and open offer to shareholders; up to 10.48m shares will be issued
at 114p each. The company's shares were placed in March at 110p, but
immediately jumped to 138p. They yesterday rose 4p to 129p.
The new shares have been conditionally placed with Charterhouse Bank, the
group's financial advisers. Shareholders can claw back on the basis of
4-for-13, with Panmure Gordon as broker to the issue. The issue will
represent about 23.5 per cent of the enlarged capital.
The joint venture will be licensed to use the Del Monte brand in the US,
Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean, in perpetuity, for specified
products including dried fruit, processed nuts, and seeds.
For the 11 months to May, Del Monte Dried Fruit made operating profits of
Dollars 7.3m on sales of Dollars 51m, but Mr Firth was confident profits
could be quickly increased.
Mr Bob D'Ornellas, president and chief operating officer of DMC, said:
'YFG's blend of skills and management style will bring a new dimension to
Del Monte Dried Fruit. The joint venture will enable us to retain an ongoing
involvement in this branded products range whilst furthering our objective
of focusing on our core activities.'
DMC is controlled a private US consortium led by Merrill Lynch which bought
Del Monte's produce business for Dollars 1.54bn in 1990 from Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, the US buy-out specialists. KKR had bought RJR Nabisco, the US food
and tobacco group which exclusively owned the Del Monte name, for Dollars
25bn in 1989.
KKR broke up Del Monte into two parts, selling the fresh fruit business in
September 1989 to Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics
conglomerate which collapsed in 1990. Last year PPI Del Monte Fresh Produce,
the fresh fruit side of Polly Peck International, was sold for Dollars 499m
to a mainly Mexican investor group.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Institutions bid for 1.4bn BT shares

<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders had bid for more than 1.4bn British
Telecommunications shares after the international offer closed yesterday.
The final figures will not be released until tomorrow.
However, several leading UK institutional investors said they had declined
to bid for shares because the price was too high.
'It's just not worth it at this level,' said one life insurance company
investment manager. 'The deal will go well; we just aren't interested at
these levels.'
Another insurance company fund manager said that while he had placed bids
for up to 1m shares, he realised that the prices he offered for them were
too low relative to where BT shares were trading late Friday.
'We won't get any shares and we don't care to at these prices,' he said.
The institutions point to the so-called 'time value of money' implied in the
price of the partly paid shares.
While this has been estimated at 14p per share, the premium has risen to
roughly 12p, narrowing the discount to the market offered on the
government's stake in BT.
Retail investors have applied for just over 1bn BT shares in the UK public
offer, according to final figures released yesterday.
This is slightly more than expected but well down on the 1.7bn applications
in the last sale of government BT shares in 1991.
The total number of shares being sold is 1.2bn compared to 1.7bn last time.
The number of individuals applying for shares was 1.66m. Share Shops took
978,000 applications compared to the 685,000 which went through the Share
Information Office.
More than half of all the applications came from existing BT shareholders
compared to 15 per cent in the last sale in 1991.
The government's advisers said this showed that the sale had succeed in
deepening as well as widening share ownership.
Retail investors have on average applied for 634 shares at total cost of
Pounds 951.

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: European decline leaves Multitone lower at
Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIT BY the downturn in the German economy, Multitone Electronics reported a
drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.93m to Pounds 1.62m for the year ended
April 30.
'In Europe, which accounts for nearly 90 per cent of our sales, trading
cond-itions continued to be difficult and caused pressure on margins,' said
Mr Ian Karten, chairman.
The group manufactures and supplies specialised radio communication systems,
and developed the world's first paging system in 1956.
An increase from 3p to 3.5p in dividend (the final is 2p) for the year
failed to offset the trading statement, and the shares closed down 8p at
119p.
Business, particularly in Germany, began to weaken last autumn when many
customers started postponing capital spending. Although those markets were
unlikely to pick up quickly this year, the company said it was well placed
to increase its market share.
In the UK more customers were hiring in preference to buying paging
equipment, leading to continuing rather than one-off payments to Multitone.
The results included a first time contribution of Pounds 415,000 from Paging
Systems and Pounds 174,000 from settlement of litigation, offset by Pounds
285,000 of costs relating to new busin-ess.
Turnover came to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 23.2m). Earnings per share were 7.17p
(8.33p).

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Resort suspended as board asks for
accountants' report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Resort Hotels, a chain that grew from humble origins in Brighton
with the help of four rights issues in five years, were suspended on the
Stock Exchange yesterday.
The board said in a statement it was concerned 'over a number of financing
and reporting issues'. Independent accountants have been asked to put
together a report.
Mr Robert Feld, managing director and the head of the family that built the
group, has resigned his executive duties with immediate effect.
Neither Mr Feld, nor Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the company's advisers nor Mr
Roland Lewis, the finance director who is to become acting managing
director, would expand on the brief statement from the company.
Mr Tim Barker, non-executive deputy chairman since March, said he would not
be drawn on what the investigation would cover. 'All I can add is that the
matter that gave rise to it happened very recently,' he said.
Analysts were not altogether surprised yesterday that there might be
problems at Resort Hotels given the speed at which it has been growing and
the high gearing involved in hotel ownership.
Since 1988 the group has raised more than Pounds 50m through four rights
issues, the most recent in April 1992, underwritten by BZW at 63p. The
shares fell to a low of 24p by early December but had recovered to 45p
yesterday when they were suspended.
Some analysts which follow Resort Hotels had thought, however, that trading
was going fairly well. They had seen Thursday's announcement that Resort
Hotels would lease a number of hotels owned by Welsh Water as further
evidence that trading was on track.
Resort was formed with the backing of four Business Expansion Schemes in
1984 and became the second BES scheme to float.
As with Queens Moat Hotels, which was suspended in April, yesterday's
announcement comes just two weeks before Resort Hotels was due to report its
preliminary results.

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Costain raises Pounds 23m from housing sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the heavily indebted UK construction company, yesterday raised
Pounds 23m by selling its loss-making UK housebuilding operations to Redrow,
the privately-owned housebuilder and construction company.
The sale of Costain Homes, which was flagged in May, means Costain is well
on the way to achieving its target of raising Pounds 50m from disposals
during the next two years to reduce net debts of about Pounds 200m before
the latest disposal.
The sale price of Pounds 23m, according to Costain, is equivalent to the net
book value of the housing operation. About Pounds 15m is expected to be paid
immediately, with the remainder to be paid over the next few years.
Costain admitted that in present value terms it had 'marginally' not
achieved net book value because of the deferred element of the deal.
Redrow, which now claims to be the UK's largest unquoted housebuilder and
may come to the market, said the acquisition financed by borrowings would be
a platform for growth into the South East, bringing the number of its
regional operations to seven.
Mr Paul Pedley, deputy chairman of Redrow, said: 'This will expand our
housing operations quite significantly. The one area in which we have no
representation is the south east.' The company withdrew from Kent in 1988:
'We now believe it is exactly the right time to be investing in the south
east,' he said.
Mr Pedley said Redrow would consider floating on the stock exchange at an
appropriate opportunity: 'If you analyse the group you will see that we have
done everything necessary for a flotation so we can float if we want to.'
Redrow expects to report profits of about Pounds 13m on turnover of Pounds
130m for the year ended June. At year end it had debt of Pounds 4m and
gearing of 7 per cent. The Costain purchase will push gearing to about 40
per cent. It plans to build about 2,000 units this financial year, up 400
from last year.
The deal marks Costain's departure from UK private sector housebuilding.
Costain Homes made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 48.5m, after land write downs
and provisions of Pounds 40.8m, in the year to end December.
The company is staying, however, in social and public sector housing.
Costain said the deal allowed it to raise cash from the disposal of a
non-core business. Already this year it has sold development land worth
Pounds 3m. Costain is keeping some investment assets of Costain Homes worth
about Pounds 4m. This is mainly equity retained in various houses that have
been sold and a piece of land which is being sold.
The company also plans to sell a small amount of commercial property
interests in Melbourne, Australia, as well as some small parcels of
development land in the UK worth at most Pounds 10m, some residential
property in Spain and the US. It would also like to rid itself of some of
its non-coal US mineral interests such as its small gold operations.

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The annoyance of a one-man band - Andrew
Bolger looks at the mounting pressure to remove Spring Ram's chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS difficult for anyone to imagine life at Spring Ram Corporation, the
bathrooms and kitchens group, without Mr Bill Rooney, its 53 year-old
chairman, chief executive and co-founder.
That is the main reason for the current extraordinary stand-off between the
City and the board of the Yorkshire company, which was a stock market star
until last year.
Mr Rooney is under pressure from institutional investors to resign after
Spring Ram issued three profit warnings within eight months, leading to a
collapse in its share price.
The move is led by the Prudential Corporation, and is believed to be
supported by institutions which own 35 per cent of the group's equity.
Spring Ram's board met on Wednesday and issued a gnomic statement which said
it both remained united in its support for Mr Rooney but 'recognises and
accepts the need for immediate and major changes in the structure, style and
management of the company for the 1990s.'
Since then there has been only silence from the company, although with its
share price languishing the board is under huge pressure to break the
stalemate with some of its biggest shareholders.
Mr Rooney founded the original bathrooms and kitchens fittings business in
1979. A graduate of Liverpool University, he decided to set up his own
business after a management career that had started with the Milk Marketing
Board and ended up with Gower Furniture in Halifax.
His partner was Mr Bob Murray, a former wages clerk at the old Consett iron
works who qualified as an accountant and worked with Mr Rooney at Gower
Furniture. A brilliant salesman, Mr Rooney was Spring Ram's high-profile
spokesman while the low-key Mr Murray concentrated on the financial side.
When asked about the secret of the company's prodigious growth, Mr Rooney
liked to reply 'magic beans' and run from the room to bring in a jar full of
brightly coloured little balls. 'We tell people that we each eat one of
these every day because they won't believe that it is just common sense.'
Magic beans aside, his explanation of the group's success falls into three
categories: market-led products of guaranteed quality at lower, unchanging
prices; short delivery times - the company's standard is 48 hours; and
motivated people, notably the directors.
The companies operate separately and often compete with one another, with
individual managers teams under great pressure to keep up sales. Last
November the group itself blamed this 'growth culture' for serious
misrepresentation and false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms
subsidiary.
Analysts believe a key factor in Spring Ram's crisis was the departure of Mr
Murray, who left the company in 1990.
Mr Derek Reed, an analyst with Smith New Court, wrote recently that Mr
Murray employed a degree of financial skill which, backed by his commercial
acumen and intellectual rigour, has since been sorely missed.
He added: 'With Mr Murray on the board, Spring Ram was run with an attention
to detail which now seems to be lacking. There is no doubting the
entrepreneurial skills, the innovation and the brilliant generation of ideas
of Mr Rooney, but Mr Murray was patently not awarded the credit he deserved
for his part in the development of the group.'
In spite of the widespread perception that Spring Ram is too much of a
one-man band, it has so far improved impossible for the institutions to get
rid of Mr Rooney, whose family owns 16 per cent of the group. Mr Rooney has
said he would be prepared to give up the role of chairman or chief
executive, but not both.
Company sources have suggested that the other executive directors would not
be prepared to work with an imposed chairman. However, institutional
investors insist they will fall in line with the wishes of shareholders, in
spite of their loyalty to Mr Rooney.
A measure of City opinion after Spring Ram's most recent profits warning
came from Smith New Court: 'Incredulity and despair now best describe our
emotions on discovering the latest down spiralling fortunes of Spring Ram.
'We continue to believe there is physical value to be unlocked in the
company, but equally maintain that the stock is untouchable by serious
investors until such time as radical progress is seen in improving
management and structure.
'It is now of deep concern that the group, if left unattended by change,
could implode as quickly as it grew.'

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Protest over Asda options to chief and four
directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading institutional shareholders in Asda, the supermarkets group, said
they intend to protest to its board about stock options granted practically
free of charge to chief executive Mr Archie Norman and four other directors.
The investors say the options violate guidelines set out by the UK's two
leading shareholder groups, the National Association of Pension Funds and
the Association of British Insurers which urge that options only be granted
at the market price of the stock on the day it is issued.
Discounting means that even if the share price remains stagnant, directors
have the opportunity to earn profits.
Executive share option schemes are the one aspect of executive remuneration
which shareholders have the opportunity to vote on but only if the number of
new shares to be issued is more than 5 per cent of a company's existing
share capital.
Thus, Asda did not need to seek shareholders' approval when it authorised
the programme six months ago.
Mr Norman is granted the option of purchasing up to 2m shares between 1996
and 1997 at a nominal price of 0.01p. This is compared with yesterday's
closing price of 60.5p.
They are only exercisable if Asda's earnings per share over five years are
at least 15 per cent per year while the share price must be at least 100p.
No exercise of options is allowed if earnings per share growth is below 10
per cent and the share price is below 45p.
The National Association of Pension Funds, in particular, has criticised the
granting of options where the exercise is linked to earnings per share
because it is regarded as a measurement too easily manipulated by
managements.

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at Independent Inv
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Investment proposes to reorganise its capital to ensure that the
market value of shareholders' investment reflects more closely the
underlying net asset value.
The scheme involves cancelling the ordinary shares and warrants and setting
up a holding company, Ivory &amp; Sime Enterprise Capital, in which shareholders
will receive ordinary shares and convertible unsecured loan stock units, and
warrant holders get warrants with rights to subscribe for ordinary shares.
For every Pounds 100 of formula asset value attributable to each holding at
the reference date - expected to be September 10 - an ordinary holder will
receive 60 ISEC shares with an initial net asset value of Pounds 1 and 40
convertible loan stock units of Pounds 1.
Meetings are expected to be held on August 18. High Court sanction will be
required.

Pounds 208,287.
The company's annual report shows that most of the rise was accounted for by

FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Alexanders Pounds 32,000 first-half profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The combination of a slowly strengthening market and enhanced operational
efficiency enabled Glasgow-based Ford main dealer Alexanders Holdings to
make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 32,000 in the six months ended March 31
1993.
That compared with Pounds 408,000 last time, which was boosted by
non-trading activities. However, for the full year ended September 30 1992,
that was turned into a restated loss of Pounds 998,000, after Pounds 476,000
exceptional charges for costs incurred in reviewing various activities and
reorganisation and restructuring.
Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, chairman, said the latest profit reflected
progressive recovery in the six months, the first half of which was
characterised by continuing depressed conditions particularly in the used
car market.
Operational improvements were a function of substantially reduced operating
costs, significant drop in staffing levels, and tighter control procedures.
'Further benefits from restructuring will be realised during a stronger
second-half market', Mrs Clayton said.
Earnings per share were 0.06p, against the reported 1.065p.

Shares in Mckay Securities, the property investor and developer, moved up 5p
to 115p yesterday as the company announced that all its banking facilities
had been put on a secured basis, with the earliest expiry date being
September 30 1996.
Satisfactory agreements had been concluded with the unsecured banks on
normal banking terms, the company said.
Since January sales of the supermarket at Brighton and two flats at
Parkside, London SW, had taken place 'at satisfactory prices'.
Together with undrawn committed facilities available, the company had
adequate funds to meet all current and planned commitments.
The second half of the financial year was expected to show an improvement in
underlying profitability over the first, but there will be a provision of
Pounds 680,000 for refinancing costs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Victoria Carpet Holdings slumped 65.5 per cent in the
year ended March 31 1993 and the dividend is cut by 33 per cent.
Mr John Bettinson, chairman, said in the face of low level demand across the
whole industry, sales were unlikely to be achieved without loss of margin.
This had been the case as turnover in the UK and Australia remained static
at Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 33.8m), but profit fell to Pounds 598,000 (Pounds
1.74m).
Earnings per share dropped to 5.28p (18.08p) and the dividend is cut from
4.5p to 3p.
The chairman said the emphasis at Kidderminster throughout the year had been
on continuing development of new and imported carpet ranges, involving
considerable investment.
In Australia the market had not yet shown any sign of recovery and there had
been even less demand than previously for better quality products. Colin
Campbell &amp; Sons, of Vancouver, had returned to modest profit after
restructuring.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Sporting chance at the big time: Throwing, kicking or
hitting balls can still put some bounce into your business career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The venue was the 350-year-old Englefield Estate in the royal county of
Berkshire. The players were members of Lloyd's of London and the Stock
Exchange. The game was polo.
Wednesday's match marked the pinnacle of the corporate sporting year,
offering a lavish display of money, skill and snobbery. Yet one element was
missing: influence.
Once upon a time, a polo tournament would have been a golden opportunity for
anyone wanting to make friends and influence people in either market. But
this year the Stock Exchange could not even find four suitable players, so
that half of those on its side had never seen the inside of a dealing room.
Sport is no longer a sure means of career advancement. There was a time when
to be in the rugby First Fifteen at a private school would mean you were
never out of a job and when being the star of the company golf team would
improve your chances of promotion. These days most companies like to think
they promote people on merit and sports teams have become so competitive
that many have gone outside the company to pick their best players.
Even at the Bank of England, which has one of the finest private sports
grounds in the UK, things have changed. Robin Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord
Kingsdown), the former governor who has a cricket pitch in his own back
garden, was taken aback when his Governor's Eleven (culled from the great
and the good among his chums) played the Bank's first team. He found that
the captain of the Bank's team did not even work there. Now the Bank's club
has a commercial manager and outsiders are welcomed as members.
Yet this does not mean that ambitious thrusters should spend less time on
the playing field and more in the office. There is a link between sport and
business success, although it is more circuitous than is often thought.
A Financial Times survey of top British businessmen reveals an overwhelming
preponderance of sports enthusiasts. All but two of the bosses of the 30
constituents of the FT Ordinary Share Index list sport among their
recreations in Who's Who. Only Colin Southgate of Thorn EMI and Allen
Sheppard of GrandMet prefer pruning the roses to throwing, kicking or
hitting balls.
There are plenty of famous sportsmen who have made it in business. Tony
O'Reilly, president of Heinz, was an Irish international rugby player, while
Jan Leschley, chief executive designate of SmithKline Beecham, used to play
tennis at Wimbledon. Allan Munro, managing director of Ivory &amp; Sime,
Scottish fund manager, was a professional footballer, and Norman Sansom,
head of McKinsey, used to be an international rugby referee.
So does sport help to open doors in business? Or are the sort of people who
are good at sport also likely to make good businessmen?
Yes to both, up to a point.
Christopher Rodrigues, a Cambridge rowing blue who is now chief executive of
Thomas Cook, denies that his rowing helped him get a job. He admits,
however, that 'fellow blues will answer each other's phone calls. Having a
blue tells you who to talk to.'
Much more important, he says, is that anyone with a blue has a 'demonstrated
ability to deliver and they also know how nice it is to win'.
It is this ultra-competitive streak that best explains the link between
sport and business. One keen golfer says you can recognise big businessmen a
long way off on the golf course. 'They are very, very determined. The act of
winning gives them a rare degree of satisfaction and pleasure.'
In sporty organisations it may help to be a hearty. 'How you perform within
the culture is what matters. Like-minded people tend to perform better,'
says Lenny Kristal, an occupational psychologist.
Barry Dinan of Hanson Green, a specialist headhunter for non-executive
directors, says that, in extreme cases, a sporting bent could be a
pre-requisite for employment. At Johnson Fry, the small merchant bank run by
Charles Fry, son of famous cricketer C B Fry, 'someone who was not a cricket
enthusiast might not last long', he says.
So, which sport should hopefuls take up?
The FT survey shows golfers in a strong majority, with tennis players coming
a distant second and, behind them, yachtsmen. The fact that some 60 per cent
of top businessmen play golf suggests the course and the clubhouse must
present formidable opportunities for networking. A survey published last
week by Hyatt Hotels and Resorts found that a third of golf-playing
businessmen said they had made some of their biggest deals on the golf
course.
Golf is not a universal passport, however. At Freshfields, the London
solicitors, employees face a tough challenge if they are to keep up with the
senior partner. John Grieves started to run the London marathon in the 1980s
and, since then, six or eight colleagues have started doing likewise. 'This
has no relevance to career at all,' Grieves insists. 'If you are fit, your
energy levels are higher, you have more enthusiasm and drive.'
More way out still are Sir John Harvey-Jones and his donkey racing and Alan
Lewis, the Yorkshire wool baron, who is a black belt at Karate.
The career-enhancing opportunities of many sports may be limited, as is that
of the 'work-out', which is gaining in popularity among younger managers.
In the modern company, sport is seen not as a way of building team spirit,
but of building personal fitness. According to Nigel Whittaker, a director
of Kingfisher who is frequently to be found in the gym of his local sports
club: 'It is not a networking matter. I take exercise because I find
physical fitness helps mental alertness.' With the same aim in mind, Geoff
Mulcahy, chief executive, plays a fierce game of squash nearly every day.
Whether it is golf or something more obscure, sport may present a problem
for women trying to make it in business. A young woman who recently joined a
City merchant bank was taken aside by a male director and told to do
everything that the others did: play squash and go on the company skiing
holiday. She did not follow his advice and is no longer with that company.
According to Rhiannon Chapman of the Industrial Society, it is not just a
question of playing sport but being able to talk about it. 'Quite a lot of
corporate hospitality is around sport, golf, car racing and football. Unless
you are known to be interested, you won't get invited to the right
function.'
Yet sport is not always a winner in business: a headhunter was told recently
by Fairclough builders, a British construction company, to find a manager
with a golf handicap of at least 24, as it did not want to employ someone
who spent the whole day practising his swing.
Neither are all big sportsman-turned-businessmen successful. George Walker,
the ex-boxer and boss of the bankrupt Brent Walker, is now fighting in court
rather than in the ring.
And if anyone needed an example of how sport and business need not mix, they
need look no further than Alan Sugar and Terry Venables.

Sir, I have always felt that I should take note of the commentary of the
Financial Times, but if a vital, direct ancestor of mine died childless
(Observer: 'Title tattle', July 15), I feel singularly ill-equipped to do
so.
The first Lord Kingsdown was in fact my great-great-grandfather's elder
brother.
And perhaps I could add there is a third Kingsdown in Kent, whose church,
reconstructed by my collateral ancestor (sic) with the assistance of Pugin,
I can see from this house, which has always been my home.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: Pensions 'cap' hits mid-career moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A W C DAVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised at the stance taken by Barry Riley in his article, 'The
Long View' (July 10), about the 'pensions cap'. Although I agree entirely
with his advocacy for clearer government thinking on pensions (or, indeed,
on anything), his proposals for the sacrifice of the pensions of the rich on
the altar of egalitarianism would seem more suitable for Fabian Society
pamphlets.
That is ignoring the fact that that the society is now publishing right-wing
leaflets from a socialist member of Parliament (Labour MP (Frank) 'Field
calls for pensions switch', July 12) I believe that the government has
pitched its 'pensions cap' at the right level of Pounds 75,000, always
assuming that it has to have a cap at all and provided this level is
reviewed in April each year as originally promised.
A problem, however, which companies are now facing as a result of the 'cap'
is how to attract executives to join them in mid- or late-career without
damaging their pension prospects.
The case of Sir Anthony Tennant, which is quoted by Barry Riley, is an
interesting example of the recruitment of a chief executive towards the end
of his career who at that time could be persuaded to make a late career move
when Guinness was clearly in need of his services. Given a similar need
today it would be probable that the right person could not be persuaded to
move because of the penalty in lost pensions expectations as a result of the
'cap'.
One solution to help mid-career moves, which I advocate, would be to revert
to the pre-1987 practice of permitting the accrual of a maximum pension over
10 years instead of the 20-year period now required, albeit of 'capped'
salary. It would not happen very often, because companies would have to pay
for it. But given the higher incidence of preserved pension from earlier
employment the costs might not be overwhelming.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Stretched to breaking point: Is the UN falling apart? If so,
says Edward Mortimer, it is because its members expect too much
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER

<TEXT>
Iraq's defiance increases threat of UN attack.' 'UN to maintain Somali
action despite bloodshed.' 'Nato will use jets in Bosnia to protect UN's
peace troops.'
Every day this week, the same two letters - UN - have leapt out at us in the
newspaper headlines, as the United Nations has struggled with three crises
in three different continents. In each case the world body was either using
or threatening the use of military force, in an increasingly desperate
attempt to impose its authority on recalcitrant warlords. And in each case
there were visible strains on its cohesion, as leading member governments
argued among themselves, and with the secretariat, over the course of action
to be pursued.
In Iraq, the unity of the Security Council in taking a firm line with
President Saddam Hussein was damaged last month when the US took unilateral
action, bombing Baghdad in retaliation for an Iraqi attempt to assassinate
ex-president George Bush. Last weekend, when a UN inspection team abruptly
left Baghdad after being refused permission to seal off two missile testing
sites, the US's European allies feared they were about to be bounced into a
new US-led air attack. In the event the Council sent Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of
the UN special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, on a
further trip to Baghdad to try to defuse the crisis.
Meanwhile the spotlight switched to Somalia, where US helicopters serving
with the UN force bombarded a 'command centre' used by General Mohammed
Farah Aideed, a Somali warlord who has been defying UN orders to disarm, and
has ordered attacks on UN troops. The US claimed only 13 Somalis were killed
in the attack, but the International Committee of the Red Cross gave a
figure of 54, while General Aideed's supporters produced a videotape showing
scores of bodies. Four foreign journalists were killed by a mob seeking
revenge.
Italy, one of the main contributors to the UN force, called for a suspension
of combat operations and a reconsideration of the 'overall objective', and
warned that it would withdraw its troops if differences over the conduct of
the operation could not be resolved. Mr Kofi Annan, the UN
undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping operations, responded by
announcing that the UN had demanded the recall of the Italian commander,
General Bruno Loi, who was said to have taken orders from Rome instead of
from the UN force commander, General Civek Bir. Yesterday the Italian
government bluntly refused to comply with this demand, declaring that
General Loi enjoyed its full confidence.
But if the UN was embarrassed by the threat of European troops pulling out
in Somalia, it was scarcely less so by the offer from seven Islamic
countries to send troops into Bosnia-Hercegovina. The existing, mainly
western contributors have conspicuously failed to send enough troops to
defend the UN 'safe areas' for Bosnian Moslems. Yet they fear that the
arrival of up to 18,000 soldiers from other Moslem countries, including
10,000 from revolutionary Iran, would only exacerbate the conflict, pitting
Moslems against Christians on an international scale.
The UN is expected to accept an offer from Nato to deploy ground-attack
aircraft over Bosnia, which may add some credibility to the safe areas plan.
But it could be further embarrassed by the fact that these aircraft would
not be mandated to act directly in defence of the beleaguered Moslems, but
only to protect the UN's own ground forces. The danger of a Somali-style
escalation, with the UN appearing to engage in its own blood feud with local
forces and the humanitarian objective being pushed into the background, is
obvious enough.
Coincidentally, this week also saw the publication of a report from the
foreign affairs committee of the British House of Commons, criticising the
ill-thought-out expansion of the UN's worldwide military role, and in
particular the way the UN operation in Bosnia is being transformed from
peacekeeping to enforcement, with no clear understanding of the different
principles involved.
Bosnia, Iraq and Somalia are by no means the only crises the UN is currently
involved in. It has had its successes in recent years, notably in bringing
peace to El Salvador and Namibia. Its most conspicuous recent failure was in
Angola, where civil war has resumed after last year's UN-supervised
election. Observers are now holding their breath to see whether the same
will happen in Cambodia.
The Angolan experience partly explains the tough attitude UN officials are
taking towards the warlords in Somalia. It shows, they believe, the absolute
necessity of disarming the factions if any peaceful solution is to stick;
and they point out that many Somalis have supported the action against
General Aideed.
Yet the results have appalled many old UN hands. Sir Brian Urquhart, UN
undersecretary-general until 1986 and regarded as the main architect of the
UN's traditional peacekeeping role, winces at reports of UN 'retaliation' in
Somalia. 'That would have been inconceivable in my day,' he says. 'Nobody's
thought out what the nature of the UN's activities really is.' This line was
echoed in a New York Times editorial on Wednesday: 'The United Nations is a
peace organisation. It should not be gunning down Somalis from helicopters,
no matter what warlord they support.'
UN officials argue that this line of criticism reflects nostalgia for the
cold war era, when the UN was limited to relatively straightforward
peacekeeping operations, usually in interstate conflicts where the parties
had already agreed to cease fire. The Somali operation, they explain, is the
first of a new type, with an explicit mandate under Chapter VII of the
charter, the part that refers to 'enforcement'.
Sir Brian concedes this. 'Yes, they've gone beyond peacekeeping,' he says.
'But they haven't changed the method. The result is that command and control
are now disintegrating, with national contingents taking orders from
national governments.' To avoid this, he has revived a proposal made in 1948
by the UN's first secretary-general, Trygve Lie, for a volunteer military
force to be recruited directly by the UN and 'placed at the disposal of the
Security Council'. He believes such a force could be sent in quickly, for
instance when the Council orders a ceasefire, to show that the UN is
serious. But since the force would necessarily be small, and could hardly be
deployed in more than two or three parts of the world at the same time, it
is not clear what the next move would be if its arrival failed to have the
desired effect.
What is clear is that, apart from inevitable blunders through lack of
experience, the UN is above all the victim of the expectations vested in it
by its members, in a world pullulating with local conflicts and no longer
disciplined by great-power rivalry. Most of these conflicts are more
domestic than international. Few can be solved without the military defeat
of the warlords, the imposition of peace by external power for a prolonged
period, and the use of that period to rebuild social and political
structures.
That is a process closely akin to old-style colonial government. The UN at
present has neither the machinery nor the resources to undertake it; yet
that is the task that it is being progressively pushed into.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: Importance of know-what
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JULIAN NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Dixon rightly distinguishes 'know-how' from 'know-what'
('Jobs', July 7). We find that graduates vary in these respects and that
employers could sometimes do more to help themselves when making
appointments. They could, for instance, take tutorial advice about the
qualities required of applicants, although that is no longer fashionable.
And, in the now-confusing educational jungle, they should identify degree
courses most likely to produce graduates with practical flair.
In business studies, such students may well be focused on one sector. They
should be challenged from the start with difficult tasks, with rigorous
deadlines and a high workload. They should be given presentational skills.
There should be easy access to staff for consultation. Sandwich placements
may add an important dimension. Students should be assessed in various ways
but exams should not demand feats of memory. None of that need detract from
academic standards or the wider benefits of student life.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: Narrow-minded attitude to events held outside
south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R WATERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The motoring section told us ('Be a VIP for just Pounds 15', July
10/11) the British international car show at the National Exhibition Centre
is really a regional event. Why do the London-based media so often make
these snobbish attacks on events held outside the south-east?
This narrow-minded idea, that an event staged in London is national (or
international), while those held elsewhere are regional only, hinders the
country.
As cities like Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester, etc, look to find new
positions for themselves, they are not helped by the constant sniping in the
national press.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Life's a beach when the water's dirty: Bronwen Maddox on a
row over EC standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Angry Blackpool hotel managers this week accused Brussels of double
standards, following the ruling by the European Court of Justice that the
resort's beach fell below EC standards. 'They have far bigger problems
abroad, where they have sewers running into the streets, but we always get
the brunt of it,' said Mr John Donovan, secretary of the 1,300-strong
Blackpool Hotel and Guest House Association.
The ruling has touched a nerve in Britain, against a background of national
unease about the extent of Brussels' influence. It has also inflamed a
simmering row about whether EC water standards are unnecessarily high. The
day before the Blackpool judgment, Ofwat, the UK water industry regulator,
argued that the UK should ask for more time to meet EC rules to slow down
the rise in customers' bills.
The controversy is likely to be long and emotive because the EC directives
on bathing and drinking water and on the treatment of waste water from towns
have been among the Commission's most popular measures  - until the costs of
compliance began to be clear. They stipulate the maximum permissible levels
of bacteria, chemicals and minerals that can be present in drinking water
and at designated bathing beaches, and standards of sewage treatment. Among
other changes, they have forced Britain to agree to stop piping untreated
sewage into the sea by 1998.
But the investment needed is high. The UK water industry has embarked on an
investment programme that could top Pounds 45bn this decade. The
consequence, Mr Byatt points out, is that customers' bills will rise much
faster than the rate of inflation.
The UK government, responding to public concern about bills, has complained
that many other EC countries are not making the same effort. It points out
that court actions on beach standards are pending against all other member
countries except Denmark, and that the UK's vigorous pressure groups
precipitate more legal actions than those in other countries.
However, the European Commission this week rejected Mr Byatt's call for more
time. It said the EC directive on urban waste water had been agreed by all
EC countries, and that some of the poorest had started implementing it.
The Commission also joined with environmentalists in telling the UK
government to make water polluters pay more. Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns
director of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said: 'Mr Byatt poses
a false choice - allowing pollution on welfare grounds. If you want to meet
a social objective, such as helping poorer households with high water bills,
you should do it through welfare not environmental policy.'
The Commission acknowledges one element of the UK's complaint: the lack of
comprehensive and comparable data. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said:
'There is no way to compare the excellent quality of our drinking water with
other countries.' The Department of the Environment argues that no other
member country has the equivalent of the Drinking Water Inspectorate, set up
in 1990 to ensure that water companies meet regulations.
The inspectorate, which will produce its third report at the end of the
month, found last year that 98.7 per cent of companies complied with
national legal standards that are the same or higher than EC rules. Water
companies and environmentalists alike have found it frustrating that
comparable figures are not available for most other EC countries.
Data on beach quality are slightly better, partly because public demand for
information has been greater. The EC compiles a league table, according to
which the UK is the second dirtiest country, with 79 per cent of beaches
complying, better only than Germany with 76 per cent. But the data are
supplied by the member countries and the Commission warns that sampling and
testing methods differ.
The EC-wide Blue Flag scheme, the best known of the European beach guides,
suffers the same handicap. The UK and Germany have complained that the Blue
Flag tests are applied unevenly, with dispensations given to Ireland,
Denmark, Netherlands and France. The Tidy Britain Group, a charity
part-funded by the DoE, which administers the UK contribution to the Blue
Flag scheme, said last month that it was considering withdrawing because of
unfairness.
Grumbles with European-wide league tables have spawned a plethora of
national ranking tables. The Tidy Britain Group has launched its own Seaside
Award scheme, and jousted last month with the Marine Conservation Society's
Good Beach Guide about which was the more thorough.
The Commission has increasingly shown itself sensitive to complaints about
uneven enforcement, and officials argue that the information about
compliance will gradually improve. However, the Commission's awareness of
the problem gives little comfort to those about to set off on a holiday
somewhere in the EC. We are still a long way from knowing what is in the tap
water, and whether you can safely swim in the sea.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: Privatisation endangers data confidentiality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From CLIVE BROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Data Protection Registrar's call for new laws to protect the
confidentiality of personal information is to be welcomed ('New laws urged
to counter black market in secret data', July 15). It follows in the wake of
last year's revelations about the former chancellor Norman Lamont's credit
card details, and public awareness of a growing black market trade in
personal financial and credit data.
But what about the protection of personal data held on the state's computer
systems? And what about data on companies as well as individuals? At the
moment this information is highly secure due to civil service standards and
traditions.
But all that is about to change and we will see a much greater threat to
personal confidentiality if privatised computer files on tax, social
security, police and other records are put onto the data 'black market'.
These are not groundless concerns. In little more than two months the Inland
Revenue will award a contract for its computer operations to one of two
American bidders. The contract will mean the transfer of 40m computer
records on UK companies, partnerships and individual taxpayers into the
private sector.
There will be no guarantee that the the files or data processing work on
them will stay in the UK. And all this is happening without public debate
and without any real acknowledgment by ministers of the seriousness of the
threat.
In the light of revelations about the black market for credit data,
assurances that the privatised tax computer records will be 'as confidential
as information held by a bank' is no comfort at all. The government must
change its mind about the privatisation of computer information held by the
state.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Changeable forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW GALLING it has been, trudging through the puddles of damp and drizzly
London this week, to remember that only a fortnight ago the capital was
bathed in sunshine at the climax of the first weather-uninterrupted
Wimbledon fortnight in more than a decade. Might the current optimism about
the pace of economic recovery change as fast? This week's economic news
certainly suggests that the rays of economic recovery are warming up. But it
is still too early to forecast that the economy is set fair for a sunny
August.
Forecasters in the US certainly try harder, and often seem to do a better
job of forecasting trends in its weather, than UK weather-watchers. The
scale of the devastation that floods are currently causing in the US Midwest
helps explain why this predictability is important. But the size of the US
economy, and the relatively small role played by international trade, also
suggest that American economic forecasters should have an easier time than
their UK counterparts.
Not so. US forecasters remain baffled by the corrugated nature of the
recovery and bemused by the failure of some consumers and businesses to rid
themselves of excessive debts, while others decline to take advantage of low
interest rates. Two weeks ago, figures appeared showing that manufacturing
orders and business confidence had fallen sharply, while manufacturing
employment was down in June for the fourth successive month. This week, it
emerged that retail sales and consumer spending picked up last month, but
that industrial production fell by 0.2 per cent in June.
UK buoyancy
UK economists, by contrast, are buoyant following the news that
manufacturing output rose by an unexpected 1.8 per cent in May. Yet the
recent US experience cautions against calling a sustained recovery too soon.
For while the British economy is, at last, benefiting from levels of
interest rates approaching those that the US Federal Reserve was able to
deliver from the beginning of the US downturn, UK consumers and businesses
remain at least as burdened by debts as their US counterparts.
Moreover, recent UK economic indicators remain as erratic as those in the
US. The Nationwide building society says house prices rose in June but the
Halifax says they fell. New car registrations rose in June, but a recent
survey from Gallup and BSL showed that consumers in the south of the country
believe their financial position to be deteriorating. The government's
narrow monetary aggregate is strong but broad money growth remains
depressed. The annual rate of retail price inflation is at its lowest level
for nearly 30 years, but average earnings growth in manufacturing remains
unsustainably high.
Most puzzling has been Britain's labour market. Last month, registered
unemployment fell by 8,000, the fifth successive monthly fall and an
unprecedented event at this stage of a recovery. In spite of assiduous
research, compelling evidence has yet to be found that the government has
fiddled the figures. But the Department of Employment also reported that
total employment fell in the first quarter of this year, by 25,000 jobs,
while manufacturing employment fell a further 15,000 in May.
Apparent contradiction
One reason for this apparent contradiction is that many people,
predominantly women, do not qualify for unemployment benefits and thus
simply disappear from official records when they lose their jobs. In an
economy with a lot of female, part-time employment, less generous benefits
and fewer restrictions on hiring and firing, movements in unemployment rates
miss a lot of the action because they do not catch people who move quickly
into and out of the labour force. This is why US economists watch more
carefully changes in employment than unemployment. The UK is now much more
like the US than it was a decade ago in all these indicators of labour
market structure.
The shifting pattern of UK employment over the past year may also explain
why the unemployment rate has been falling this year. Employment dropped by
132,000 in the first half of last year even though the decline in output had
already stopped. It then tumbled by a further 477,000 in the second half of
last year as the economy was gripped by the trauma of Black Wednesday. But
retail sales and output did not follow suit, thus delivering substantial
productivity gains to manufacturing employers. One by-product has been that
companies feel they can afford to offer smaller workforces ever higher real
wages, a practice which cannot continue indefinitely.
Employment has since fallen at a sufficiently slow rate to allow the
registered unemployment count to follow suit, suggesting that employers may
have concluded that the autumn job-shedding went too far. But it would be
dangerous to put too much faith in falling unemployment as an indicator of
future economic trends. Economic recovery may well be here, but it is worth
keeping a close eye on future movements in employment levels.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Tricky feats at the top: Allegations of industrial espionage
are flying from GM to VW in a long and twisted tale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of Volkswagen and Adam Opel has taken on all the characteristics
of tales in the life of a circus: a rich mix of escapology, vanishing acts
and fire-eaters among the side-shows. On Thursday this week the waiting
audience was offered a tantalising glimpse of the show when a handful of the
players appeared in a Hamburg courtroom.
The occasion was a bid by the weekly magazine Der Spiegel to extricate
itself from a muzzle fitted by the court at Volkswagen's request. This was
to stop it publishing further allegations of industrial espionage against
the company's new production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
and some of his colleagues who followed him to VW from GM.
Mr Lopez was out of Germany. He, his colleagues and VW were represented by a
single lawyer. The magazine was backed by more than 20 witnesses, four from
the US, all of them from General Motors, prepared to back allegations and
their affidavits with testimony.
GM and Adam Opel, its German subsidiary, which have initiated criminal
investigations in Germany and the US on the basis of their suspicions that
Mr Lopez and his team stole confidential information before defecting to VW
in March, were not directly involved. The witnesses had come voluntarily,
officials stressed.
The effect was that of a hall of mirrors, the GM troupe flashed in and out
of view in the courthouse corridors, for once with nothing to say to the
media. There were glimpses of Volkswagen's case: extracts from affidavits
muttered by the company's lawyer. From the outset, VW has steadfastly
refused to answer questions on the accusations of industrial espionage. But
the Hamburg hearing, a sideshow to the main event - the direct clash between
VW and GM - offered startling insights into the core of the US group's legal
case, and uncomfortable reflections on Mr Lopez.
Ms Toni Simonetti, formerly an aide to Mr Lopez, testified he had dictated
to her a fulsome speech - a proclamation of 'love' for GM and its
people,intended as his explanation for staying in Detroit despite the lures
of Wolfsburg, where VW has it headquarters. Mr Lopez has repeatedly and
formally denied he had anything to do with the speech. Ms Simonetti picked
her way through her notebook: ' 'When I communicated position to leave to my
staff they cried. That broke my health',' she read. 'He meant heart . . .
this was broken English.'
Ms Simonetti may have noted 'overheard' comments, Mr Lopez's lawyer offered
on his behalf. No, said Ms Simonetti. Mr Lopez had made final adjustments to
the speech on the morning of March 15. But he was not there to read it, as
planned, that afternoon. He had disappeared only to turn up the next day as
production and purchasing director of Volkswagen.
The circus stopped in Hamburg this week after a journey which has so far
lasted almost 16 months. It started last spring in a small way as Mr Carl
Hahn, then-chairman of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest car maker, began
searching for his successor. He was to retire in December at what was to
prove a grim moment in his career.
Having taken over SEAT in Spain, Skoda in Czechoslovakia, and setting up an
assembly plant in China, all during the 1980s, he had built an
impressive-looking international group. But the structure was rickety.
Earnings evaporated. In the first quarter of this year, after an 87 per cent
profits plunge in 1992, the Volkswagen group showed a DM1.25bn ( deficit.
In March last year, Mr Hahn approached Mr Louis Hughes, then-chairman of
arch-rival Adam Opel, offering him the top VW job. Mr Hughes refused then
and again a month later. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed head of GM
Europe.
The job of VW chairman fell to Mr Ferdinand Piech, head of the luxury car
division, Audi. Although not at the time a member of the group's main board,
he was respected for his technical skills and building the Audi brand into a
fitting, though still small, rival to BMW and Mercedes-Benz. A grandson of
Ferdinand Porsche, the man who developed the VW Beetle, he had, they say,
'petrol in his blood'.
Even before he took charge at VW, Mr Piech was in talks with Mr Lopez. He
had found a soul mate. Like him, Mr Lopez was a brilliant engineer who
wanted a robust European motor industry, led by VW, able to repel Japanese.
But while Mr Piech was a cool Austrian, and vastly rich through his Porsche
family links, Mr Lopez was a volatile Basque of more humble origins, driven
by ambitions for political influence in his homeland. At the time, the only
apparent difficulty was that Mr Lopez worked for General Motors. In tribute
to his achievements in cutting costs at Adam Opel, mainly by squeezing price
cuts out of parts suppliers, that he had been moved to Detroit to work his
restorative magic on the ailing GM parent last year.
The circus, an overlapping succession of bizarre events, was about the
start. The two men had met secretly before Christmas, then again in the new
year. They deny anything was agreed then, although they have since agreed on
how they came together: through an intermediary, not, as Mr Piech told this
newspaper last month, through a direct approach from Mr Lopez.
In late February, officials of the Lower Saxony government, VW's largest
shareholder, let it be known that Mr Lopez was formally to be inducted as a
VW director on March 16. GM, meanwhile, which had already tried to 'buy' him
back by promoting him to group vice-president and global purchasing chief,
confidently announced: 'He is happy here and is staying here.'
On March 7 he flew to Frankfurt for a two-day meeting of GM's international
strategy board, where, according to Mr Jack Smith, group president, all
future products were to be discussed. These include a new Astra, Opel's
rival to the Golf, and a top-secret cheap mini-car. Some of the new models,
as emerged in Hamburg on Thursday, were on display, including the successor
to the Opel Vectra. Mr Smith: 'This was major stuff.'
Mr John Howell, director of business planning at GM Europe, told the Hamburg
court that on March 8, the first day of the meeting, after two long
presentations, Mr Lopez and other directors asked for copies of the papers
presented there. Mr Howell said he 'specifically remembered' giving Mr Lopez
a sheaf about 2cm thick. Mr Lopez has formally declared that he remembered
asking only for four or five charts - all relating to a secret new plant
project for GM, known as Plateau 6, on which he had worked for 18 months.
None of the documents has since been found, GM says.
It was at this strategy meeting that Mr Lopez learnt that Plateau 6 had been
earmarked for Hungary - if it was to be built - not his native Basque
country, even though it is understood he had arranged a deal with a local
consortium to pay for and construct the building.
It was also at the meeting, he said last month, that he lost his enthusiasm
for GM. He resigned two days later, on Thursday March 11. The next Sunday,
he was back on board at GM. Press officials announced he would give a press
conference at 1pm on Monday March 15.
According to Ms Simonetti's testimony, he dictated the outlines of his
'hello again' speech to her on the Saturday evening. According to her notes:
'One of the issues was the (Plateau 6) advanced manfacturing concept . . .
we're confident it can work . . . compensation was never an issue . . .
stronger level of commitment with regard to the plant in Spain . . . we must
match very good offer from VW.'
After amending a final draft on the Monday morning, he vanished and was
appointed to the VW board the next day.
Alarm bells rang in Detroit. An immediate search of his office failed to
turn up secret documents, including the 2cm wad Mr Howell said he had handed
over to him. A search on March 17 of offices occupied by Mr Jose Manuel
Gutierrez, Mr Lopez's closest colleague, for details of a top-secret diesel
engine allegedly in his possession (formally denied by Mr Gutierrez) was
also fruitless. Mr Gutierrez, on a GM business trip to Japan on that day,
also failed to return to Detroit.
But it was not until March 24 that GM revealed the scale of VW's coup: as
well as Mr Gutierrez, in charge of machinery buying, Mr Hugo van der Auwera,
metals purchasing, Mr Francisco Garcia, electrical parts buyer, and Mr Andre
Versteeg, a more junior buyer, had flown the coop. Two Adam Opel staff, Mr
Jose Alvarez and Mr Ramon Piazza, had also elected to join their former boss
in Wolfsburg. The searching began again.
On April 2 Opel won a court order barring VW from trying to lure more of its
key German staff. The company claimed that about 40 had been approached.
Some had been called by Mr Lopez and offered doubled salaries to defect.
However, Opel later failed in a bid to win an injunction preventing its
former employees for working at VW for a year. The court ruled that Mr
Lopez's 'charisma' had been responsible for their leaving.
On April 30, German prosecutors began investigating GM claims of industrial
espionage, despite claims from VW that none of its new employees made off
with secrets. Mr David Herman, new head of Opel: 'All we know is they had
them. We don't have them. If they don't have them, then where the hell are
they?'
A partial answer emerged earlier this month when state prosecution officials
discovered four large boxes of papers - including details of the top-secret
O-car, the vehicle to be built in the projected Plateau 6 plant - in a
Wiesbaden apartment with the names J Alvarez and R Piazza on the doorbell.
VW remains inscrutable, insisting none of its new employees have any GM
documents. Last Thursday, after the Hamburg judge said he would issue a
ruling on the Der Spiegel case, VW's lawyer challenged the confidentiality
of the disputed documents, although he has not seen them. He asked why it
should be unusual for senior executives to have secret information.
Yet there is no mistaking the mounting anticipation in the GM team. They are
convinced that investigating prosecutors at last have something in to which
to sink their teeth. Moreover, they feel it is nearly time for the
ringmaster to bring out the lions.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Man in the News: Pushing the boat into calmer seas - Rupert
Murdoch / Raymond Snoddy on media manoeuvres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is extremely unlikely that Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The News
Corporation, will do any deals this weekend or launch dramatic media
initiatives.
He's far too busy relaxing on his new toy, Morning Glory, an Italian-built
50-metre yacht launched in May and undergoing trials in the Mediterranean.
When he lived in Australia, Murdoch always had a yacht but he did not see
much point in keeping one when he was founding the core of his newspaper
empire in London.
Morning Glory, which has the latest high-tech equipment, from
computer-controlled sails to satellite telephones, will eventually be based
on the west coast of the US, where Murdoch lives, after possibly stopping
off in the West Indies for a break at Christmas.
The restless media tycoon may have been forced to relax this week - his
long-time personal assistant Dot was making sure very few telephone calls
got through to Morning Glory - but the holiday followed a period of frenetic
activity.
Within a matter of days, he achieved near total victory in regaining the New
York Post; launched a cut-price campaign designed to revive the flagging
sales of The Sun, which galvanised the popular newspaper market in the UK;
and bought 50 per cent of a record distributor in Australia. For good
measure, News Corporation is also involved with several Australian
television channelsand Australia Telecom, the national telecommunications
network, to launch pay television in the country.
While all that was going on, a much slower poker game continued - Murdoch
was trying to play the right diplomatic cards to remove the regulatory
barriers to his 22 per cent stake in Television Broadcasts, one of Hong
Kong's commercial television stations.
'All of this means that Murdoch is out of jail,' said one News Corporation
watcher in a reference to the miss-three-turns penalty in the game of
Monopoly.
The nature and size of the deals and initiatives taken by Murdoch recently,
and the way in which they were done, give considerable clues to his present
business priorities. They come at a time when News Corporation, with
interests ranging from Twentieth Century Fox film studios to ownership of
five national UK newspapers, is largely free from the financial constraints
that brought the multi-media group to its knees three years ago.
'We are not rushing to expand. This is all just normal business. This is the
1990s. In the 1980s the banks threw money at us. That's all finished now,'
said Mr Gus Fischer, chief operating officer of News Corporation, and one of
those minding the shop while Murdoch sails his boat. The top team, which
increasingly runs the business on a day-to-day basis, includes Mr David
DeVoe, News Corporation's finance director, and Mr Arthur Siskind, general
counsel.
Wall Street observers note that, after three years of doing little but run
existing businesses, Murdoch is on the hunt again. Rather approvingly, they
note that the deals are relatively small and measured and that there is no
sign of the mega-acquisitions of the past, such as the multi-billion-dollar
purchase of TV Guide.
Perhaps the most telling indication of his current motives is Murdoch's
return to New York to save the 192-year-old Post newspaper, which he owned
until 1988.
In strictly business terms it is probably imprudent for Murdoch to try to
buy back the ailing Post. Unless he can force the rival Daily News out of
business, or take it over at some later date, it is difficult to see how the
paper can ever make money.
The symbolic importance of rescuing the Post is great, however. Murdoch was
forced by US regulations on media ownership to sell the Post to keep his New
York television station. He would be happy to be back in the New York swim,
having talks with allies such as New York governor Mario Cuomo.
'He was really full of beans when he turned up in the newsroom,' said one
New York Post journalist.
Murdoch is reported to have bought an apartment again in the city, and has
even involved himself in contentious local issues, such as whether the New
York Yankees baseball team should be allowed to move to New Jersey because
their Bronx home is in too violent an area.
Murdoch has even been reported to be in talks with Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner about the possibility of helping to build a covered stadium
which would contain television or film studios. They would call it Fox
Plaza.
But strict business limits have been applied to the plans for the Post. Last
Friday, when Murdoch was completing a week of meetings in London - the
longest period he has spent in the UK this year - the decision was taken to
abandon the deal. The unions would not agree to cost-cutting of Dollars
6.2m. By Monday the unions had agreed to the concession.
News Corporation insists that the deal will only go through if there is a
chance that the paper can break even, despite the pleasure it would give
Murdoch to run a newspaper in New York again. Tough negotiations with the
paper's creditors are now likely.
While the Murdoch management was walking out - temporarily - from the Post,
Murdoch was putting his imprimatur on the controversial plan to cut the
price of The Sun by 5p to 20p for the summer. The proprietor has become
convinced that popular UK newspapers have become too expensive, particularly
in a recession.
It is too early to judge the success of the experiment, which is seen in
News International, Murdoch's UK subsidiary, as giving the readers back some
of the promotional money that would otherwise go to the ITV companies on
television advertising. The first signs are that The Sun is selling about 8
per cent more copies, and that the Daily Mirror is not, so far, being
damaged, even though it is now 7p dearer. Total sales in the popular
newspaper market have risen by about 2 per cent.
Evidence would suggest that the newspaper market is not very price
sensitive. Mr Harry Henry, in his Dynamics of the British Press, found that
between 1961 and 1984 the cover price of newspapers doubled in real terms,
while the number of copies sold fell by only 15 per cent.
Murdoch and his senior managers will be watching to see whether the same
trend holds true today. If The Sun were to lift its circulation well above
4m from its present 3.6m, the experiment could be extended beyond the
summer. If the increase in sales stays at its present 8 per cent, there is a
good chance of a possibly counter-productive price 'rise' for The Sun in
September.
At the same time as they were looking at The Sun's circulation in the UK,
Murdoch's men were making a record deal in Australia this week. Though
small, - Dollars 34m for a 50 per cent stake in Mushroom Records,
Australia's largest independent record distributor - it is a further
indication that News Corporation intends to expand into every corner of
media 'software'.
But the biggest prospects of all are not in London or Sydney, but in Asia,
in China in particular. Last month Murdoch announced that News Corporation
was paying Dollars 238.8m for a 22 per cent stake in Television Broadcasts
in a venture with the company's controlling shareholders, Sir Run Run Shaw
and Mr Robert Kuok.
However, he asked the Hong Kong regulatory authorities to defer a decision
on his bid because he feared it was going to be turned down - he already
owns the South China Morning Post - and because of uncertainty about the
attitude of the Chinese government. But it has emerged that he has not given
up on the deal, that more detailed work on it is now being carried out, and
that if necessary he will fly to Beijing for talks with the Chinese
leadership about his Asian ambitions. In the past Murdoch has been adept at
finding a way round or over regulatory hurdles.
One further venture attracted his attention last week. In London, he was
able to catch up with the progress of what started out as an outrageous
gamble - British Sky Broadcasting.
On September 1 the satellite venture, in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, holds a substantial stake, will create a subscription
package of at least 14 channels. From then, only those who pay a monthly
subscription will be able to watch - with the exception of Sky News, the
24-hour-a-day news channel which will go out all over Europe.
If the gamble works and BSkyB does not lose too many of its viewers - at the
moment is it available in more than 3.5m homes through cable and satellite
dishes - the move will create growing subscription revenues for Murdoch.
As he relaxes this weekend on the deck of Morning Glory, there can be little
doubt that from New York to London, and Sydney to Hong Kong, Murdoch is back
with a vengeance.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Bullish motor talk hides doubt: Commercial vehicle sales are
curiously low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID all the bullish talk of recovery in the motor trade one discordant
question remains: why are commercial vehicle sales still so low?
Last month's 11.9 per cent rise in new-car registrations was greeted with
joy. But the market's apparently strong upturn from one of its steepest
declines on record is not consistent. Sales of commercial vehicles are still
below those of last year - itself the worst sales year since the 1950s.
Commercial vehicles are bought not on whim or sentiment but to transport
goods. Their purchase, therefore, might be regarded as an accurate indicator
of economic activity.
Statistics released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show
that commercial vehicle sales of 14,735 in June were 8.91 per cent lower
than in the corresponding month last year. Sales fell by 5.15 per cent
compared with the first six months of last year. Car sales over the same
period rose 9.14 per cent.
The decline disguises large variations in demand for different types of
vehicle. Truck sales rose 15.35 per cent, compared with a 2.7 per cent fall
in sales of medium commercial vehicles typified by Ford's Transit panel van
and a 28.55 per cent fall in the sale of light vans.
Ford's researchers say that sales of commercial vehicles traditionally have
lagged improvements in the rest of the economy.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford UK, is in no doubt that the new-car
market is well into a recovery, although he acknowledges that the pace of
revival is not as strong as the raw figures might indicate.
The figures have been flattered by the practice of dealers 'pre-registering'
cars which have yet to find buyers. The recovery may also have been
over-hyped by manufacturers keen to instil some buoyancy into showrooms.
Registrations of trucks of over 3.5 tonnes have risen in all but two of the
past 11 months, particularly those of heavy trucks over 15 tonnes.
The problem for medium commercial vehicles, Mr McAllister suggests, is that
much of the demand for them comes from hard-pressed small traders in the
construction industry and consumer businesses.
'If the demand is not there within these sectors, no one is going to invest
in new commercials. They will do everything they can to extend the life of
what they've got,' says Mr McAllister.
Customers have not survived the recession. Of the tens of thousands of small
businesses that have failed over the past three years, the majority would
have been van or light truck operators.
Another factor is the receivership of Leyland Daf, Ford's closest rival in
the van market, early this year. That may have artificially depressed demand
while customers loyal to the marque, including large organisations such as
the Post Office, waited to see if it could be salvaged.
The share of the panel-van sector held by the reborn Leyland Daf did leap
sharply last month, to 14.35 per cent - double its level during the
receivership. But this should have added to total demand. Instead, total
panel-van sales in June were down by 2.77 per cent compared with the same,
severely depressed month last year, contributing to a 6.76 per cent drop for
the first half of the year.
Mr Allan Amey, Leyland Daf Vans' managing director, only sees 'hopeful'
signs that the economy is picking up and that 'this will be reflected in the
second half with demand beginning to increase again'.
Professor Garel Rhys, an independent industry analyst at Cardiff Business
School and adviser to the Commons trade and industry committee, suggests
that the recovery in heavy truck sales partly reflects the fact that these
are used primarily for long-distance haulage.
Some of these ageing, long-haul fleets are already overdue for replacement.
Demand may be helped by the fact that these vehicles tend to be operated
primarily by larger companies possibly better attuned to early economic
stirrings.
'That smaller companies, the van buyers, clearly want more evidence that the
upturn is under way is indicative of the brittleness of the recovery,' Prof
Rhys suggests. He adds that there should not be too much scepticism about
recovery in the car market.
The company sector has held up better than the private car market, he points
out. But even though private consumers are holding back from daunting
decisions in the housing market, 'one of the results is that many have a lot
of money in their pockets and have begun consoling themselves with a new car
instead'.
Partly as a result he expects that total new-car sales this year will be 'at
least 1.7m' - a 7 per cent rise on last year's 1.59m, accelerating to 1.8m
next year.
But he and other analysts warn that the car market recovery, and the
industry's reviving profitability, could not withstand a significant further
worsening in continental Europe's economic plight. Ominously, statistics
this week showed a 17.2 per cent plunge in European new-car sales.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Banks warned on account charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 40 per cent of bank and building society customers would close their
accounts if such organisations introduced charges on current accounts with
low balances, says a survey published yesterday.
The survey found strongest opposition to charges from young customers, and
those living in southern England.
Although only one retail bank, Abbey National, has indicated that it is
considering imposing charges on current accounts, hints that clearing banks
might follow suit have provoked protests from consumer groups.
The survey, by the NOP Corporate and Financial research group, questioned
1,066 people, of whom 39 per cent said they would close accounts if banks
imposed a Pounds 5 fee on accounts whose balance fell below Pounds 50.
Another 48 per cent said they would ensure that their account did not fall
below this level. Only 9 per cent indicated willingness to pay a charge -
primarily because of the effort involved in changing accounts.
Although 55 per cent of customers aged between 15 and 24 said they would
close their account if charges were imposed, only 23 per cent of customers
over 65 indicated that they would do the same. Forty four per cent of
customers in the south said they would close their account, but only 27 per
cent in northern England and Scotland.
NOP said the findings should serve as a clear warning of the backlash that
financial institutions would face if they sought to impose charges.
Abbey National said: 'Everyone is aware of the risk that if you do impose
charges you may alienate some of your customers. That is a business decision
we have to make.'

FT  17 JUL 93 / Pop's Mr Power aims to make the business pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most controver-sial music figures at this weekend's festival will
be Mr Vince Power, its promoter, whose name does not appear on a single
billboard.
While many pundits bewail the death of youth pop, Mr Power, 46, is intent on
showing that he can make the business pay, in spite of the recession.
His rise on the music scene has been slow but steady. After opening his
first venue, the Mean Fiddler, in Harlesden, north London, 12 years ago he
has quietly expanded to control seven of London's most fashionable venues
and 11 UK festivals. Mr Power says his Mean Fiddler organisation is one of
the biggest in the business and worth more than Pounds 8m.
One London rival says: 'It's getting like a monopoly. The bands playing at
his festivals now get deals to play only at his venues, which means the
others can't compete.'
Mr Power's decision to launch Phoenix this summer was one of his more risky
steps.
As he admits, the festival was triggered more by politics than financial
planning - when Mean Fiddler lost control of the Reading Festival last year,
he launched Phoenix as a spoiler. Since then Mean Fiddler has regained
control of Reading, so it has the problem of promoting two rival venues in
the same month.
'We were shafted over Reading so I wanted a festival of my own,' says Mr
Power. 'But now we're doing both, there is definitely room for it.'
The signs are that most of the 25,000 tickets for the Phoenix Festival will
be sold at Pounds 55 a head, with another 15,000 day tickets on top.
Repeating the trick at the 35,000-ticket Reading Festival three weeks later
could be considerably harder.

FT  17 JUL 93 / 'Green' secrecy over oil lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to publish environmental conditions attached to oil
exploration licences for the first time, Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister,
said yesterday.
The move comes amid growing public concern on the issue. The Department of
Trade and Industry said it had received an 'awful lot of letters' about the
award of licences in the latest offshore oil exploration round. For the
first time the government has opened up some environmentally sensitive areas
close to shore.
Mr Eggar also imposed strict environmental conditions on some companies.
They include restrictions on activity at certain times when sea birds are
mating or moulting.
Environmental groups have been pushing the government to tighten
restrictions and even to exclude certain areas from oil industry activity.
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, called the publication of the
environmental conditions 'purely and simply a public relations exercise'.
Environmental groups may tackle the award of some licences at European
Community level because they believe they could infringe EC conventions.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Hype in a downbeat market: Rock concert promoters fear the
new Phoenix festival may add to their woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE rock groups get ready to plug in their guitars this weekend for the
launch of Phoenix, a new open-air pop festival to be staged on an airfield
site at Marston, Stratford-upon-Avon, the nervous promoters will be reaching
for their calculators and balance sheets.
Two years of recession have left much of Britain's already volatile pop
business feeling decidedly downbeat. Although this latest festival, launched
at a cost of Pounds 1.2m, seems likely to be a financial success pop pundits
fear the emergence of a third weekend festival on the British summer music
scene could add to promoters' woes.
In the cut-throat world of pop, hard data on the health of the business is
elusive. Nevertheless, most promoters admit takings have dropped by at least
20 per cent in the past two years.
While a few of the bigger promoters have expanded in spite of recession, and
the biggest concerts can still realise a turnover of more than Pounds 1m in
a single night, many of the smaller promoters are struggling.
Audiences have dropped in most venues, from the 2,000-a-night-ticket club to
giants like the 72,000 seater Wembley Arena. But ticket prices have barely
risen, after a rapid surge at the end of the 1980s.
Part of the promoters' problem stems from longer-term trends. While the
teenage population is shrinking the music scene is becoming fragmented and
undermined by an increase in home entertainment.
Mr Martin Corrie, press officer for the Wembley complex in London, says:
'The actual number of bands performing is not necessarily down, but the
tendency is for shorter runs. Whereas in the past a band might have played
for five nights, now they only play for three nights.'
He says Wembley Stadium is staging just four all-day 'mega' concerts this
year, compared with 13 last year, with a 20 per cent reduction in the number
of concerts staged in the smaller Wembley Arena.
Mr Corrie says that like other large promoters Wembley has successfully
filled the gap in concert demand by staging non-pop events. Smaller
promoters rarely have the flexibility to do this. And with all promoters
reporting late ticket sales, the margins are tighter.
Mr Paul Hutton of pop promotors Metropolis Music says: 'People have less
money in their pocket so they don't decide to go to a show until later in
the day. It makes it harder with your cashflows and harder to gauge your
advertising.' Metropolis Music promotes about 250 concerts a year at
medium-sized venues in London.
Mr Hutton, like most promoters, estimates that he needs to have at least 85
per cent capacity at his venues before breaking even, making him dependant
on a last-minute surge in ticket sales.
Many promoters insist the downturn in audience numbers is natural in a
business which is cyclical and open to fashion changes. Indeed, the success
of the huge Glastonbury Festival earlier this summer has left some believing
that the worst of the recession in the pop business is over.
'If you've got the right bands you can still make money,' says Mr Paul
Waldren of the Flying Music company, which is gearing up to promote Prince
at Wembley next month. 'It's just a question of picking them.'
But with more and more festivals on the scene, some promoters believe bands
and audiences are being spread too thinly. Consequently it is harder for the
smaller club venues to compete - not least because festivals are often more
lucrative than tours for the bands.
Mr David McLean, of River Man, promoters of small London club venues, says:
'The festivals make it harder for the smaller clubs because the bands end up
playing there. And if you've got 18 bands playing in one place a lot of the
fans will think that's better value too.'
Some promoters have responded to audience uncertainty by moving up-market.
Wembley Arena promoters have, for example, planned future business around
the over-thirties. It believes this audience will still attend concerts -
many of the big bands promoted over the past year are names familiar from
the 1970s. Upgrading Wembley Arena's facilities recently cost Pounds 60m -
with extra toilets, sound systems, merchandising stalls and up-market
catering installed.
Mr Danny Betesh, of Kennedy Street Enterprises, also believes that it is the
older pop fan who could sustain the business. 'The older audiences tend to
have higher disposable income,' he says, adding that one of his most
successful events in recent months was a 'Solid Silver Sixties tour'.
Others fear this growing conservatism could backfire on the industry. Mr
Chris Lysett, head of live music on BBC Radio 1, says: 'There's not a lot of
new stuff coming through. The bands that emerged in the 1980s have all
rather fizzled out.'
The Phoenix organisers, who expect an average audience age of 17, insist
there is still a market for new bands - like Pop Will Eat Itself and New
Fast Automatic Daffodils.
Nevertheless, as a sign of the times, the festival is hedging its bets and
offering jazz and Shakespeare shows along with the more up-beat music.

FT  17 JUL 93 / BBC staff criticise bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC STAFF members believe the corporation still suffers from a high level of
bureaucracy and red tape, and are critical of the organisation's management
at all levels.
The negative verdicts came in the most extensive sampling ever of BBC staff
about their attitudes to work, the corporation and its management. Nearly
4,900 people - 55 per cent of those asked  - answered 150 questions in a
survey that cost Pounds 85,000.
Staff also made it clear they believed the BBC operated as 'a system of
baronies and territories', had a 'centralised, top-down, controlling
structure that hindered departmental co-operation', and people did not feel
secure in their jobs.
There was also an echo of support for the argument made by Mr Mark Tully,
BBC South Asia correspondent, that there was an atmosphere of fear in the
corporation with people wary of speaking their minds. Respondents to the
questionnaire said that they did not think it 'safe to say what they feel'
and did not believe what was communicated to them about the BBC.
Staff were asked to respond to questions on a scale of one to five. Asked to
what extent bureaucracy was minimised in the BBC, the average score was 1.7.
There was also a much more positive side to the survey which showed that
staff were very proud to work for the BBC (3.8), and believed it provided an
excellent public service (4.0). Staff believed the BBC was a better place to
work than elsewhere (3.4), although they did not think it operated with the
full involvement of all staff (1.8).
Ms Margaret Salmon, BBC director of personnel, said yesterday that such
strong negative and positive results were not unusual in organisations going
through a difficult period of change.
Staff were also given the chance to say what single thing they would change
if they were in charge of the corporation. Only 5 per cent elected to
replace Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the chairman of the BBC's board of governors
and Mr John Birt, the director-general. Three per cent wanted to abolish
Producer Choice, the system of total costing which also gives producers the
right to buy services from the outside market.
Twenty per cent wanted to improve management communication, accessibility,
responsiveness and credibility. A further 20 per cent wanted to see more
staff involvement and responsibility. The third most popular suggestion came
from the 18 per cent who wanted to thin the ranks of middle management and
accountants.
Ms Salmon said yesterday that mangers would now be meeting with staff to see
what action could be taken to meet staff criticisms.
A further survey is to be carried out next year to monitor any improvements.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the broadcasting union, warned yesterday
that the BBC was trying to suggest that the main problems were
presentational. What staff were saying, Mr Lennon pointed out, was that they
did not like what was being done to them.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has not ruled out a full public inquiry into the Thorp
nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister,
has said.
The second round of public consultation due to begin soon does not mean a
subsequent inquiry will not take place, he told Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure group.
The consultation is likely to delay a decision on the future of the Pounds
2.8bn plant until November, but any inquiry could take more than a year.
British Nuclear Fuels has protested against delays for further consultation,
which it says cost it Pounds 2m a week.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Listing sought for tower block
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Fine Art Commission has recommended that Centrepoint, the central
London office block, become a listed building, Rachel Johnson writes. The
commission says the block has a 'structure deftly turning the corner' and
'elegance worthy of a Wren steeple'.
Meanwhile, Lord St John of Fawsley, the former arts minister, said yesterday
that the commission should have a statutory role in the listing of
buildings.
The commission is best known for the advice it gives on new architecture -
but it also emphasises preservation and conservation. Lord Fawsley said a
change in the commission's powers should be made and 'buildings should be
listed if it so recommends'.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, however, has rejected his
call. Listing recommendations currently rest with English Heritage.
Lord Fawsley complained that most post-war buildings referred to the
commission were worth listing, but only the Economist Building and Bracken
House - the former home of the Financial Times  - in London had been listed.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Automated benefits urged to beat fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDER USE of automated credit transfer for the payment of retirement
pensions and other benefits was urged again by Mr Alistair Burt, a junior
social security minister, in the Commons yesterday.
Stressing the contribution the system could make to combating social
security fraud - estimated to be in excess of Pounds 1bn a year  - Mr Burt
denied that extending automated payments would pose a threat to post
offices. He reaffirmed the government's wish to maintain a nationwide
network of post offices.
Mr Burt gave an assurance that any loss of Post Office business through the
use of automated credit transfer would be 'more than offset' by an overall
increase in the volume of social security transactions over the next few
years.
MPs were told that in 1991-92 fraudulent misuse of payment order books
accounted for Pounds 85m, while a further Pounds 16m was lost through the
fraudulent encashment of giro cheques.
New technology and the use of bar codes were helping to curb the use of
stolen payment order books, and the Department of Social Security was
developing plans for fraud-resistant computer systems.
Mr Burt said new computers had already been installed to help 'fraud
managers' identify patterns of crime, monitor performance and deploy
resources.
He added that while he was striving for value for money in the Benefits
Agency, no firm decision had yet been made about the introduction of market
testing in the investigation of fraud.
Mr Keith Bradley, Labour MP for Withington, joined the condemnation of
social security fraud, but called on the government to show equal
determination in dealing with tax evasion.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Intrigue under wraps at MI5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FASHION for open government yesterday took its toll in that most
romantically secretive of organisations, MI5.
Mrs Stella Rimington, MI5 director-general, posed for official photographs
for the first time. And for Pounds 4.95, the public can buy a 36-page guide
to the Security Service from HMSO and good bookshops.
The booklet poses no threat to any of the spy novels also available in
bookstores.
The pulse slows when Mrs Rimington announces in her introduction that
'details of the service's methods and operations in protecting national
security must necessarily remain secret'. But Security Service officials say
no contemporary spy novel accurately reflects their work, and recommend the
booklet for a more down-to-earth view.
It certainly provides that. The booklet reveals that an important part of
the Security Service management board's brief is not the running of agents,
but the management of financial resources.
It speaks of resource planning, performance measures and internal audit
controls. Being a secret agent, it seems, is like any other job in the
modern, financially pressured public sector.
MI5, as it has been popularly known since 1916, employs about 2,000 people.
More than half are women. There is a similar proportion of women among the
340 staff of the GI (general intelligence) group responsible for
investigations and tasks such as recruiting agents. Half the staff are under
40 and, while it might not always have been so, Oxford and Cambridge
universities contribute only a quarter of recruits.
Some people enter via normal Civil Service selection processes but, it
emerged yesterday, MI5 also places newspaper advertisements for recruits.
It does not advertise under its own name, or declare that the situation
vacant is one of secret agent. Intriguing, but officials could say no more
for security reasons.
Since last year the service has led the mainland intelligence effort against
IRA terrorism. About 70 per cent of work is concerned with terrorism, a big
shift in emphasis from the Cold War days. Mrs Rimington's introduction to
the booklet concludes with the message: 'Letters should be addressed to PO
Box 3255, London SW1P 1AE. All correspondence will be treated in strict
confidence and acknowledged.'
This is the service's first experiment in soliciting information directly
from the public. While not as colourful as burying a note beneath a tree in
Regent's Park, it is the closest the booklet comes to the atmosphere of the
spy novel.
But, an official stressed, MI5 wants to hear from people only if they have
information of a genuine security nature. 'Anyone wanting to report a crime
should ring the police, not write a letter to a box number,' the official
said.

FT  17 JUL 93 / High coal stocks are criticised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has been unable to win new contracts because of the 'high
levels' of stocks held at power stations and improved performance of nuclear
energy, Mr Andrew Horsler, the corporation's marketing chief, said
yesterday.
Talks with the main power generators in England and Wales have not led to
extra sales in spite of a 'very competitive' offer, Mr Horsler said.
The high level of coal stocks were a key factor in the generators' decision
to buy just 40m tonnes from British Coal this year, falling to 30m tonnes in
each of the next four years.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Parsons shows off first aero-engine fan case for Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TREVOR MURCH, managing director of Parsons, the Newcastle upon Tyne
turbine generator plant, yesterday showed off the company's first
aero-engine fan case for Rolls-Royce Aerospace Group, Chris Tighe writes.
The Pounds 250,000 case, produced for the Rolls-Royce BR211-535E4, is part
of the company's move into new product areas. It is the first large
Rolls-Royce component to be made by Northern Engineering Industries,
Parsons' parent company, since NEI was taken over by Rolls-Royce four years
ago.
Parsons, part of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, won the 10-year
contract against stiff competition from within and outside the company. It
has become one of two fan-case production sites within Rolls-Royce.
The fan cases are made of titanium, aluminium and Kevlar, a synthetic fibre
also used in bullet-proof vests. They are being produced in a former
pipemaking building, refurbished at a cost of Pounds 6m. Production of the
cases, which each need 800 worker hours, should reach one a fortnight this
year and eventually output is expected to rise to two a week, generating
annual turnover of Pounds 25m for Parsons.
The BR211-535 is one of Rolls-Royce's most successful aero-engines, used by
more than 80 per cent of Boeing 757 operators.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Cabinet set to rule on review of councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENT ministers are finalising revised guidelines for the Banham
review of local government in England, following renewed pressure from local
authority associations.
The cabinet, however, is unlikely to make a decision next week because of
Thursday's critical Commons debate on the social chapter of the Maastricht
Treaty.
Although this makes the precise timing uncertain, clarifying the task of the
Banham Commission - which has already recommended creating 24 unitary
councils in place of 66 county and district councils - is a priority for the
Department of the Environment.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told local authority
associations: 'Having had the first few proposals, there is sufficient
comment for it to be ridiculous for me merely to say we'll go on exactly as
we are. I hope to make some announcements very soon indeed.'
Mr Gummer could:
Speed up the review, which is expected to take another three years.
Allow an 'opt-in' approach, where councils must invite Sir John Banham to
review their structure.
Make clearer the guidelines on balancing the cost of changes with creating
local identity for authorities.
'Opting in' could be presented as giving more autonomy to local authorities,
and could speed the review's work. But divisions between districts and
counties mean ministers' hopes that the commission's work can be accelerated
seem forlorn. Districts fear that 'opting in' could be used to halt the
review, particularly if a large proportion of local councils or voters have
to agree.
But the Association of County Councils is opposed to changes in the
guidance. 'Opting in' would support its view that there is no need to change
the status quo in many areas.
Such an approach would be seen by Labour as deeply contentious. Since the
commission was a Conservative manifesto commitment, the opposition is
unlikely to be able to resist claiming another government U-turn if its
review became voluntary. There is more common ground on other ideas to
expedite the process, such as adjusting the guidance.
Yesterday the review was criticised by the European Policy Forum, which said
the commission's work should be redesigned, because the unitary principle
would be achieved 'at too high a cost'.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Tories stress independence in Euro poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party yesterday sought to tackle the difficulties it faces
in next year's elections for the European parliament over its relationship
with the European People's party, the alliance of right-of-centre European
parties.
Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the Foreign Office minister, emphasised that Tory
candidates would campaign on the basis of a Conservative manifesto in the
Euro-election, not on the basis of the federalist EPP manifesto, in spite of
the links between the two parties.
His words will come as a relief to Tory Euro-sceptics who have been lobbying
to make sure that the June 1994 campaign is not fought on an EPP platform.
The EPP is sympathetic to the social chapter, a European single currency and
the extension of majority voting to allow for the development of joint
action on foreign policy.
Whatever the formal separation of manifestos, the campaigns will not be
unrelated. The EPP is represented on the Conservative European elections
committee, chaired by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. The committee
will meet for the first time later this month.
The EPP also has an office in the Conservative party's London headquarters
in Smith Square, Westminster.
Mr Heathcoat-Amory was careful yesterday to spell out how useful the
alliance with the EPP at Strasbourg had been to the Tories so far, saying
that it had frustrated attempts by the left-of-centre majority to undermine
the UK's presidency of the Community last year.
In a speech yesterday to the Conservative Political Centre, a party
discussion group, he also set out some of the central themes for the
campaign, intended to unite the party around a vision of the EC almost all
Tories can share: de-centralised, open, free-trading, and based on
inter-governmental co-operation. The importance of the single market and of
greater powers for the European parliament will also be highlighted in the
campaign.

FT  17 JUL 93 / 'Leak' warning on data transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue Staff Federation is to write to the 50 largest UK
companies warning them that the imminent transfer of 40m computer records to
the private sector could result in leaks of confidential information.
The campaign follows this week's warning from Mr Eric Howe, the data
protection registrar, that new laws were needed to tackle the established
black market in personal financial and credit data held on computers.
Mr Clive Brooke, the general secretary of the IRSF tax inspectors' union,
said that the protection of personal data on state computers was not being
addressed by the government in its plans to contract out Whitehall work.
He will warn companies that the safety of computer files held by the Revenue
 -and 'highly secure due to Civil Service standards and traditions' - cannot
be guaranteed once the government awards a 10-year contract for its computer
operations to one of two US bidders.
'The contract will mean the transfer of 40m computer records on UK
companies, firms, partnerships and individual taxpayers' records away from
the civil service and into the private sector,' he said.
There was not even a guarantee that the files or processing would remain in
Britain.
The information technology division, which employs 2,700 staff, is the
largest division to be contracted out within the Revenue.
Mr Brooke said that civil service standards have up to now been effective in
protecting of the confidentiality of computer files. Only 'occasional'
inadvertent slips by temporary staff had resulted in leaks of information
such as Mr Norman Lamont's credit card details from the National Westminster
Bank.
Several companies due to receive the warning from the IRSF yesterday
indicated that they were confident that the right safeguards would be
implemented by the company that won the contract.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Labour motions back union vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, cannot necessarily count on the support of
many constituency parties in his battle with the unions over their links
with the party, judging by the motions tabled for Labour's annual
conference.
Almost 30 local parties have put down motions calling for the unions to
retain a voice in the selection of parliamentary candidates and the election
of the party leader. Only six have tabled motions giving clear support to
the leadership's plans for one member, one vote in party elections.
Although most constituency parties have decided not to put down motions on
this question, the proportion against the leadership's proposals out of
those which have tabled motions will be a warning to the party leadership.
The support of the constituency parties is critically important to the
leadership in promoting the changes, both for the votes they cast and also
for the pressure on the unions that would be created by overwhelming support
from party members for change.
Earlier this week, the Labour group reviewing links with the unions backed
Mr Smith's insistence that only full party members should vote in the
selection of parliamentary candidates. Labour-supporting trade unionists
would have to pay a reduced membership fee, in addition to the political
levy, to become members.

FT  17 JUL 93 / George Formby fans are not amused: Tim King visits Blackpool
to judge reaction to the EC environment ruling against its beaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKPOOL, Britain's biggest and brashest seaside town, was humbled this
week. Even the George Formby Appreciation Society was pushed to keep smiling
when the European Court of Justice ruled that Blackpool's beaches did not
meet environmental standards.
The court ruling came as no surprise to Mr Alan Hall, a Blackpool deckchair
attendant for four seasons. 'I would not set foot in the sea except to
recover a deckchair,' he says.
The timing of the court judgment - on the eve of the UK school holidays -
was a particular blow. The borough council's tourism office describes it as
Pounds 1m of bad publicity. It says the water is cleaner than it used to be,
and some day it will be cleaner still.
By the standards of most seaside resorts, Blackpool has a serious image
problem. But normal standards do not apply in this town of 105,000 people,
where Father Christmasses adorn seafront lamp-posts in July. Seventeen
million people visit Blackpool each year precisely because the town is not
normal. The business of Blackpool is to astonish the senses with noise,
colour, light and size.
Mr Geoffrey Thompson, managing director of Pleasure Beach, an amusement park
full of rides, shows and cafeterias which brings in 6.5m visitors a year,
says Blackpool has largely turned its back on the beach in favour of the
entertainments across the promenade, and has got a good swap.
Next year Pleasure Beach will unveil the largest roller coaster in the
world. To pay for itself, the Pounds 9m ride will need to attract another 1m
visitors. Mr Thompson believes it could achieve that in just one year.
To market Blackpool, Pleasure Beach has formed an alliance with First
Leisure Corporation which runs the three piers, the Winter Gardens, the
Blackpool Tower and dozens of clubs and shows. Restoration of the tower was
completed at Easter and next year will see extravagant celebrations of its
centenary.
Mr Roy Page, managing director of First Leisure's resorts division, says the
company invests 'because we believe Blackpool has a good future'. To
Blackpool's guest house owners, that future looks very different.
In days gone by Blackpool boomed when northern industrial towns shut down
for a fortnight and their populations emigrated en masse to the seaside. The
traditional boarding houses still cater for visitors from Tyneside, the west
Midlands, Glasgow, south Wales and Dublin. Competition makes Pounds 9 a
night for bed and breakfast very common - half what it would be in
Bournemouth.
But now the trend is for short breaks - a week at the most. The faster
turnover is good news for Pleasure Beach and First Leisure, but bad news for
the small hotels. Day trippers pour cash into the amusement parks but do
nothing for the hotels.
Mr John Donovan, secretary of the Blackpool Hotel and Guest House
Association, says his 1,300 members will suffer most from the bad publicity
about Blackpool beach. He says: 'I wouldn't say our members are making
money, they are covering debts, keeping their heads above water.'
Mr Donovan says hotel trade fell 20 per cent in 1991 on the previous year
and a further 10 per cent last year.
Water is one of the costs that is rising - North West Water has completed
its metering programme and water bills for some hoteliers have doubled.
The bigger hotels benefit most from Blackpool's conference trade, which has
just enjoyed its best year. Those attending events this year at the Winter
Gardens have included 20,000 pigeon fanciers and 10,000 young farmers, who
are regarded as good spenders.
Suggestions that the quality of the beach is of little importance are
supported by the fact that the resort is busiest when the beach is cold and
dark - during the traditional illuminations, the show of lights along the
promenade which this year runs from September 3 to November 5.
Old illuminations are one of Blackpool's few growth exports. Last year some
went to Bangkok. This year some were sold to Saudi Arabia and now adorn the
seafront at Jeddah - an irony, as British Aerospace, which employs about
5,000 people at nearby factories, is hoping for an order for Tornadoes from
the Saudis.
There have been successes in winning civil service jobs, principally the
Department of Social Security and National Savings, but employment in
manufacturing has been shrinking. Burton, the biscuit maker, has just
announced 450 job losses. British Nuclear Fuels is cutting back.
Lancashire County Council estimates that unemployment in Blackpool borough
is 10 per cent - 13 per cent in winter  - and as high as 30 per cent in some
areas.
Mr Ivan Taylor, the council's leader, said income levels were 32 per cent
below the national average. He fears a low-wage, low-skill economy,
over-dependent on tourism.
Blackpool is seeking assisted area status from the government, an appeal
which is not easy to make while the resort exudes brash self-confidence to
appeal to visitors.
Mr Taylor said: 'We have trouble convincing the civil servants in Whitehall
that we are a deprived area. They ask: 'Are you a deprived area or a nice
place to visit?''

FT  17 JUL 93 / Clarke prepared to extend scope of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE yesterday admitted that the government might extend
further the scope of value added tax if the recent acceleration in the pace
of economic recovery did not make a significant dent in the government's
borrowing requirement.
In a bid to shore up crumbling support for the Conservative candidate in the
Christchurch by-election he ruled out unequivocally the introduction of new
National Health Service charges for the elderly.
The chancellor did not attempt to counter the backlash in the once-safe Tory
constituency against the introduction of VAT on domestic heating, hinting
instead that he would be ready to widen further the VAT net to raise
additional revenue in his November Budget.
He told a press conference in Christchurch that he had supported from the
outset the imposition of VAT on fuel, adding that he had always regarded the
UK's relatively narrow indirect tax base as 'anomalous'.
Endorsing the progressive shift in the tax burden from direct to indirect
which has been engineered by previous Conservative chancellors, he left the
clear impression that, if necessary, he would consider ending the
zero-rating of other goods and services. But he insisted repeatedly he would
make his judgment on any tax changes much closer to the date of the November
Budget, holding out the possibility that faster-than-expected economic
growth might allow him to avoid any significant increases.
In a confident if relatively brief appearance on the by-election stage, Mr
Clarke set as his aim the once-and-for-all rebuttal of claims from
opposition parties that the government is considering charging the elderly
for prescriptions and introducing 'hotel charges' for stays in hospital.
Around a third of the voters in the constituency are elderly and the
combination of VAT on fuel and fears about the future of the welfare state
have dealt a crushing blow to Conservative hopes of retaining the seat in
the July 29 poll.
Mr Clarke also gave a broad hint that other groups currently exempt from
prescription charges - notably children  - would retain that privilege. But,
facing a Pounds 50bn annual borrowing requirement, he refused to give other
pledges on spending or taxation to prevent what party workers fear is a
haemorrhaging of support for Mr Robert Hayward, the Conservative candidate.
Instead the chancellor accused Mrs Diane Maddock, the Liberal Democrat
challenger in Christchurch, of promising billions in additional expenditure
that would be impossible to finance.
He confirmed that the cabinet was pressing ahead with plans to restrict the
scope of invalidity benefit and was looking for other savings across the
welfare budget.

BRITISH COAL has been unable to win new contracts because of the 'high
levels' of stocks held at power stations and improved performance of nuclear
energy, Mr Andrew Horsler, the corporation's marketing chief, said
yesterday.
The high level of coal stocks were a key factor in the generators' decision
to buy just 40m tonnes from British Coal this year, falling to 30m tonnes in
each of the next four years.
The High Court hearing on whether British Coal can use its half share of a
Pounds 1bn surplus in a pension fund to provide enhanced pensions for
employees being made redundant ended yesterday. Judgment is expected within

A ONE-DAY strike yesterday by 9,000 Home Office workers belonging to the two
largest Civil Service unions had little effect on the public, the

Officials of the CPSA and NUCPS unions said passport offices and airport

about the contracting out and market testing of government functions.
The Home Office said staff had walked out 'in considerable numbers' but
services were still provided.
The unions are seeking assurances that staff will not be made compulsorily
redundant and will be protected by employment legislation if services are
contracted out.

THE Independent Television Commission yesterday criticised London Weekend
Television for 'serious errors' in giving undue prominence to commercial
products.
The commission said that successive programmes in the popular Cilla Black
series Surprise Surprise gave undue prominence to company names or products
such as Delta Airlines, EverReady and Mothercare. It also decided that the
promotion of the restaurant Planet Hollywood on Aspel and Company went
beyond acceptable 'plugging'. This occurred when its owners, the actors
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis, appeared on the
show.
LWT has accepted that editorial mistakes were made and is appointing a
compliance officer to ensure the rules are observed.
The commission also issued a general warning about ITV companies giving
branded products undue prominence.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Assisted area map ready for approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW assisted areas map will be presented for approval to the weekly
meeting of the 17 European commissioners in Brussels on Wednesday, the
Department of Trade and Industry confirmed yesterday, Chris Tighe writes.
The map has been slightly amended since last week's negotiations between Mr
Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, and Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition
commissioner.
The government hopes to give details of the map, which is expected to give
assisted area status to some parts of southern England, in the Commons on
Wednesday.
The map has been slightly amended since last week's negotiations between Mr
Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, and Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition
commissioner.
It is not yet certain whether discussion of the map will be given priority
at the commissioners' meeting on Wednesday, the DTI said, and an
announcement might have to be postponed until Thursday, or even the start of
the following week just before parliament rises on July 27.
The DTI yesterday confirmed that the proportion of the working population
covered by the map would be about 35 per cent, less than 1 percentage point
below present coverage.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Authorities urge 6.5% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities yesterday called for a 6.5 per cent rise in government
grants for 1994-95.
Their call followed the leak of a letter sent to the Treasury in May by Mr
Michael Howard, the then environment secretary, which accepted a rise of
only 3.5 per cent. According to Mr Howard, this could be 'lived with'.
However, a joint submission by all five local authority associations - the
associations of County Councils, District Councils, London Authorities and
Metropolitan Authorities, and the London Boroughs Association - said that
budgeted spending on services for 1993-94 was Pounds 42.6bn, 'well over' the
settlement from government of Pounds 41.2bn.
The associations said this level of spending was achieved 'by a substantial
withdrawal from authorities' rapidly diminishing reserves'. It was also a
real reduction of 0.3 per cent in the volume of services, after adjusting
for changes in responsibilities.
Spending would need to rise further because of new government measures, they
said.
The document also took issue with the government's planned extra expenditure
of Pounds 700m on the care in the community programme, claiming Pounds 1.2bn
was needed. It predicted that the shortfall could grow 'still wider' in
later years.
The associations meet Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, next
Thursday.

THE High Court hearing over whether British Coal can use its half share of a
Pounds 1bn surplus in a staff pension fund to provide enhanced pensions for
employees being made redundant ended yesterday. Mr Justice Vinelott is
expected to give his judgment within the next fortnight.
The pension fund trustees have argued that using the surplus in such a way
breaches the fund's rules.

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government will hold new presidential elections on August
14, but only one party is prepared to take part.
The decision comes four days after President Ibrahim Babangida withdrew his
offer to the parties to form an unelected interim government when he hands
over power on August 27.
Last week's mass protests in Lagos and other mainly Yoruba cities showed
such hostility to any new elections that campaigning or polling in the
south-west of Nigeria could be impractical.
The Social Democratic party (SDP) last week declared a boycott of fresh
polls under President Babangida, saying they would have no credibility. The
SDP's candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, had a clear lead in the elections in
June when the government suspended the release of the results.
The National Republican Convention (NRC) said last night the party was ready
for elections and would decide on Wednesday how to choose their candidate.
According to the SDP and the protesters who turned out in Lagos and other
parts of the south-west last week, there is no need for a re-run. Most
voters, politicians and official foreign observers judged the June 12 polls
to be well-run and relatively fair.
The government annulled the polls because, it alleged, one or both of the
candidates had made 'negative use of money' during the campaigning and had
personal or business interests at odds with the office of head of state.
The government secretly organised a series of lawsuits after the elections
so the army could keep power, a top official with the organisation that
filed the suits said yesterday, AP reports.
Mr Abimola Davis of the Association for Better Nigeria said the annulment of
the elections was 'an organised confusion by just a few of us to prolong the
lifespan of the present military administration'. The association filed
lawsuits claiming the two candidates seeking the presidency were corrupt and
the president should remain in power. Mr Davis signed each of the suits.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Sudden influx of boat people upsets UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday expressed concern to China over a sudden influx of about
600 boat people of Vietnamese origin who have arrived in Hong Kong from
China in the past two weeks. The refugees from China's Guanxi province, some
of whom have lived there for up to 15 years, have told the Hong Kong
authorities that they were fleeing after their homes had been destroyed. The
reason was not known.
Mr Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office minister, called in China's charge
d'affaires, Mr Zheng Jinjiong, and asked the Chinese government to take all
necessary steps to stop the flow of people and to take back those who have
arrived in Hong Kong. Mr Zheng undertook to report back to Beijing.
The boat people are being put in two Hong Kong detention camps. Foreign
Office officials said there was no question of sending them to Vietnam. On
two previous occasions, in 1987 and 1988, people of Vietnamese origin who
landed from China were returned to China.
A resurgence of illegal immigrants would worry Hong Kong, which is seeing a
steady reduction in the number of Vietnamese in its camps.
Since it set up repatriation schemes with the Hanoi government, only 34 boat
people have landed in Hong Kong from Vietnam in 18 months, compared with
19,000 arrivals in 1991. So far this year, over 3,500 have voluntarily
returned to Vietnam, compared with 12,000 last year. About 40,675 are left
in Hong Kong.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR former South Korean defence officials are expected to be indicted for
allegedly accepting bribes and kickbacks from companies for military
contracts, in response to an official investigation.
The senior officials, all of whom served under the previous administration
of President Roh Tae-woo, include two former defence ministers, Mr Lee
Jong-koo and Mr Lee Sang-hoon, a former air force chief of staff, General
Han Chu-sok, and a former chief of naval operations, Admiral Kim Chul-woo.
The expected arrests are the result of a two-month investigation by the
Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) into military procurement.
The BAI estimated that at least Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.6m) was wasted in
corruption and mismanagement of the nation's multibillion dollar Yulgok
defence modernisation programme.
The investigation has implicated some of the country's leading industrial
groups, including Samsung, Hyundai and Daewoo. Daewoo is alleged by South
Korea's top public prosecutors' office to have given Won170m (Pounds
142,380) in bribes in connection with the procurement of the Lockheed P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft. Daewoo Heavy Industries produces wings for the US
patrol aircraft.
Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry is suspected of bribing officials for a
contract to supply components for the domestic K-1 tank, while Samsung
Aerospace Industries allegedly paid money to win an order for the supply of
helicopter parts.
The companies deny they bribed officials for military contracts although
Hyundai has reportedly conceded that it gave a 'monetary present' to one of
the officials.
BAI last week accused 53 senior officers and bureaucrats of being involved
in corruption associated with the Yulgok programme.
The Ministry of Defence immediately sacked the commanding general of the
First Army corps and an assistant defence minister.
There are suggestions that the government may only prosecute a few senior
defence officials because the new administration of President Kim Young-sam
is concerned about further alienating the military.
The US and North Korea appeared to have hit problems last night in talks
aimed at defusing a potentially dangerous disagreement over Pyongyang's
nuclear policy, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Only hours after optimistic statements from the two sides and a US
announcement that the discussions would be extended to Monday, both emerged
from a five-hour session saying they had not yet agreed to meet again
although they hoped to.
Assistant secretary of state Robert Gallucci, leader of the US side, told
reporters at the North Korean mission to the UN European headquarters the
delegates had 'long, intensive discussions' and would now consult their
governments.
The talks concern US demands that North Korea open up two sites near its
Yongbyon nuclear reactor north of the capital to inspection by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), something the North Koreans have
so far refused to do.
Washington, worried that North Korea may develop a nuclear weapon and spark
a crisis in Asia, has threatened to seek UN sanctions against Pyongyang
unless it agrees to IAEA inspections.

<TEXT>
THE Chinese Communist party yesterday rolled out the red carpet for the
first meeting of a controversial new panel that Beijing officials said would
'study' issues relating to Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in
1997.
The 'preparatory work subcommittee' was created by China's National People's
Congress at its annual meeting in March and represents a achievement for the
party's 'united front' tactics in Hong Kong ahead of 1997.
It is headed by Mr Qian Qichen, foreign minister, and includes a number of
leading Hong Kong citizens such as businessman Mr Li Ka-shing and former
advisers to the British colonial government such as Mrs Rita Fan.
The presence at the inauguration of Mr Jiang Zemin, Communist party chief,
and Mr Zhu Rongji, executive vice-premier, was seen as a demonstration to
Britain that many of Hong Kong's leading figures opposed Hong Kong Governor
Chris Patten's scheme to broaden local democracy.
Since China's decision to create the panel was announced, fears have been
expressed in Hong Kong that it may act as a 'shadow authority',
second-guessing the British colonial government's every move before 1997. Mr
Qian moved yesterday to quell those fears. He said China would not undermine
British sovereignty; the panel 'cannot be some second power centre or shadow
authority'.
Mr Jiang said it ushered in a 'new stage' of preparing for Hong Kong's
takeover; he hoped Beijing and London could 'overcome their
misunderstandings and strengthen co-operation and trust' to promote a smooth
transition.
Other senior Chinese government officials took the opportunity to send
various signals to Hong Kong. Mr Yu Xiaosong, vice minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, said measures taken to curb economic
overheating on the mainland would inevitably slow investment in Hong Kong.
He said no existing investment would be recalled, but China would curb
frenzied mainland speculation in Hong Kong's stock and real estate markets:
'China's is a developing economy that should try to retain its capital.'
Gen Xu Huizi, deputy chief of the general staff, said Beijing would station
troops in Hong Kong's rural and urban areas. They would be a multilingual,
incorruptible elite trained in the colony's law.
However, Mr Allen Lee, a member of the panel and a conservative Hong Kong
politician, warned Beijing not to station troops in urban areas. 'The
Chinese leadership ought to consider the psychological effect on Hong Kong
people,' he said.

FT  17 JUL 93 / The Japanese Elections: Mr Middle Japan wants change -
Robert Thomson meets Tokyo voters for whom personalities come first
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER two weeks of haranguing by passing loud-speaker vans and of quiet
contemplation, Mr and Mrs Middle Japan have firmly decided on their votes
for tomorrow's general election. But Tadaaki and Toshie Koizumi suspect that
the trip to the polling station will be repeated, as the results will set
the scene for another election within a year.
Tadaaki, 48, who works as an engineer at East Japan Sugar Industries, linked
to the Mitsubishi family of companies, admits that he still does not have
'much detail on the parties' policies', but wants to put fresh politicians
in the Japanese parliament.
Toshie, 45, a part-time assistant at the local school in Chiba, on the
fringe of Tokyo, has always voted for the Japan Socialist party - or, as it
is now known, the Social Democratic party. She is sad that the party appears
set for a beating at this election, but it will not get her vote.
'I think their era really ended when Ms Doi was replaced as leader,'
explains Toshie, referring to Ms Takako Doi, who lost the leadership two
years ago after appearing ready to drag the left-wing party towards the
centre and, perhaps, into government.
With the SDP having wasted past opportunities, both Tadaaki and Toshie will
vote for the Japan New party, formed last year by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, a
popular provincial governor.
'It's funny, but I don't really know what the details of the JNP's policies
are or will be, but that doesn't bother me. The important thing is to get
some new politicians into the parliament and to end the old alliances,'
Tadaaki says.
They suspect that the election will produce an uneasy coalition government,
which will be vulnerable to a no-confidence motion similar to that which
brought down the Liberal Democratic party government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa a
month ago.
In the time between tomorrow's election and the next poll, they expect that
the JNP will be able to muster more candidates and present the LDP with
tougher opposition. Tadaaki says change will come more gradually than many
people expect because 'it's very difficult to get sudden change in Japan'.
As for who should be the prime minister from next week, Toshie has a
preference that is rather out of line with her past as a socialist
supporter, but fits in with the general characteristic of personality being
more important than ideology in Japanese politics.
'If I had the choice of a person, I would select Shintaro Ishihara,' she
said. Mr Ishihara is a right-wing member of the LDP, who has disputed
accounts of Japan's brutality in its invasion of China, and was the author
of A Japan That Can Say No. In general, Mr Ishihara has a theory for every
occasion and more opinions than evidence to support them.
'I like him because he has opinions. I may not agree with them all, but he
has ideas. Most Japanese politicians are incoherent and weak. Mr Ishihara
leaves a strong impression,' Toshie says.

FT  17 JUL 93 / UN chiefs stand firm on action in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations made plain yesterday that there would be no weakening of
its resolve to meet the challenge of Somali warlords despite widespread
criticism of military actions that have caused much bloodshed.
Addressing criticisms, especially by the Italian government, Mr James Jonah,
senior official for African affairs, said that if the UN were seen to back
down this would have a 'devastating' effect on all its peace-keeping
operations now and in future.
It would mean it could not sustain an enforcement operation mounted by the
Security Council under the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter.
He rejected a contention that the UN took sides in Somalia, singling out
General Mohamed Farah Aideed as the main villain. In an enforcement
operation, 'you go after the delinquent side' he added at a UN press
conference.
The Sierra Leone-born official strongly defended UN actions and indicated
that the criticisms would not be allowed to sway policy.
Any weakening of UN resolve would produce repercussions among the other
warlords and return the country to the chaos that preceded the US military
intervention last December. As Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary
general, prepared for crucial talks next week with a senior Italian
government envoy to try to resolve what Mr Jonah called 'a fracas',
officials denied that he had apologised to Rome over recent events.
Mr Jonah mentioned that there had been parallel problems with some other
contingents, but the difference was that Italy had 'gone public'.
He confirmed that the Italians had not been invited to join the force in
Somalia, their former colony, but had pressed to be included - eventually
providing the third largest contingent, of about 2,400 soldiers.
Responding to criticism of what has been called the dominant role of the US,
which has 4,000 troops in the country and a quick reaction force of 1,200
offshore, Mr Jonah asked: 'Why is it such a surprise?'
When the UN force took over in April it was on the understanding there would
be strong US logistic support, that the marines would stay in place and that
'if we got into difficulties we were going to call on the Americans'.
Reuter adds from Mogadishu: There were worrying signs yesterday that Italian
troops risked being caught up in the two-year power struggle between Gen
Aideed and his rival Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
The UN said Italian troops 'received and returned fire' late on Thursday in
an area of north Mogadishu controlled by Mr Mahdi. It was the second
incident in two nights.
Ali Mahdi supporters apparently now fear Italy is sympathetic towards Gen
Aideed's Haber Gedir clan after having held talks with its clan leaders to
defuse tension in the north-south border areas Italian troops control.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Afrikaners make quiet U-turn to face future: Deep in the
Orange Free State, Patti Waldmeir finds racist rhetoric but pragmatic action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the Boer Republic of the Orange Free State was founded by Afrikaner
pioneers in the 19th century, there has never been a shortage of racists in
the land between the Orange and the Vaal rivers.
Even today, as black and white South Africans join hands at national level
over a new multi-racial constitution, the Free State can regularly be
counted on to show that racism is alive and well in the new South Africa.
Sit down at any bar in any dorp (town) in the Free State, and the racist
rhetoric flows as liberally as the rum and Coke: defend the African National
Congress, and you will be told the black man is not fit to govern; condemn
apartheid and you will learn that it was the only policy which could prevent
civil war; welcome the imminent abolition of segregated town councils, and
provoke defiance.
If you are a foreigner - or worse, a South African liberal - extra efforts
will be made to outrage you: eventually, someone will tell a crude joke
about a black and a dog, or a black and a monkey, with no prizes for
guessing which comes out on top.
So the Free State confronts the new South Africa with a swagger and a
bellow, promising to launch a new Boer war against blacks - and to win it,
this time.
But behind this facade of racist bravado, even the most belligerent Free
State farmer is quietly making his peace with the multi-racial future.
In the bar of the Friesland Hotel, in the tiny dorp of Koppies, with its
orderly, empty white streets and its vast dusty black township nearby, Mr
Sakkie van der Schyff recounts with pride the story of the Koppies blockade.
Earlier this month, hundreds of whites penned the black residents of
Kwakwatsi inside their township, and shot anyone who tried to leave
(wounding eight blacks). Mr van der Schyff, whose grandfather was a member
of the pro-Nazi Ossewa-Brandwag during the second world war, commanded
operations. Police did nothing to stop it.
Mr van der Schyff is confident the blacks of Kwakwatsi deserved their fate:
they had staged an almost total boycott of white shops for a fortnight (the
fourth boycott this year, not to mention six work stayaways), they had
burned down a warehouse at the local showgrounds, they were refusing to pay
for the electricity, sewerage and water provided to Kwakwatsi - in short,
they had exhausted the patience of white Koppies, which fell back on the old
apartheid methods to suppress them.
But the blockade of Koppies is far more likely to prove one of the last
battles of the old war, not the beginning of a new racial conflagration  -
and Mr van der Schyff knows it. As much as anyone, he has started to make
his peace with the new reality.
When squatters from Kwakwatsi stole the fencing from his farm, which borders
directly on the township, and began to graze their cattle in his field of
young sorghum, Farmer van der Schyff could simply have shot them, in the
time-honoured tradition of the old South Africa.
Instead, he used the tools of the new South Africa, negotiation and
compromise, to strike a deal with his neighbours to allow them to graze
their cattle in his winter fields (forfeiting thousands of rands he could
have earned by selling the stubble as feed) in exchange for keeping their
stock out of his fields during the summer growing season. He declares
himself satisfied with the trade-off.
Like many right-wing Afrikaners, 35-year-old Mr van der Schyff exhibits a
confusing mixture of defiance and resignation. With the same breath that he
promises never to give in, he avers that the political eclipse of the
Afrikaner is the will of God.
He would not consider leaving his farm to emigrate to the Afrikaner homeland
demanded by right-wing political parties, and seems surprisingly relaxed
about the advent of Nelson Mandela as president, so long as whites retain a
share of power What Mr van der Schyff most fears is communism - and he
listens carefully to me as I assure him that this is not the current agenda
of the ANC.
He would do better to listen to the remarkably moderate vice chairman of the
local ANC branch, Mr Solly Mayekiso. Scarcely days after the violence of the
blockade, this was his message to white Koppies: 'We understand the fears of
these people (whites). But there is the table: let's sit down and talk and
we might come up with a viable solution. . . Co-operation with the other
side will be the key word in future.'
Mr Mayekiso is grateful for the improvements in township life since the ANC
was unbanned in 1990: blacks no longer need enter the post office by a
separate door; they can use the library (though there are sometimes
problems); theoretically, they can swim in the local pool, though right-wing
threats have made this impossible in practice. And he cautions that the ANC
must control the expectations of its people, arguing that developing
Kwakwatsi will be a slow process even after blacks gain power.
Over the next few months, the ANC's desire for reconciliation with whites -
and the Afrikaners' pragmatism - will be put to the test as Pretoria forces
the abolition of white local councils in towns like Koppies. They are to be
replaced with multiracial councils (half white and half black) charged with
jointly administering the black and white neighbourhoods of each town ahead
of local government elections within 18 months.
Whatever the progress at national level - where parties could soon reach
agreement on a fairly liberal multi-racial constitution - the impending
battle of the tax base between white towns and their black townships will
loom largest in the minds of ordinary South Africans.
Mr Charl van der Merwe, deputy mayor of Koppies, says the town's 1,000
whites will refuse to subsidise the 15,000 residents of Kwakwatsi, which has
no paved roads, only communal water taps, corrugated iron shacks and bucket
toilets in many areas. The township must be upgraded - but central
government must pay.
In the end, though, numbers will triumph, and blacks will gain control of
the Koppies tax base. Mr van der Merwe knows that, Mr van der Schyff knows
it, and Mr Mayekiso too: chances are they will find a way to live with that
truth in peace. They have no choice.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Call for more competition in market
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday called for a loosening of the strong
ties between ministries and corporations and for a more transparent and
competitive market economy.
In a report entitled 'The market economy and the government's role', the
ministry says that while the bureaucrat-corporate links have helped Japan
become a economic power, they have prevented the development of competition
and transparency in financial markets and industries.
Japan's new reformist parties are blaming the country's bureaucrats for
inefficiency and higher prices and calling for a smaller government ahead of
tomorrow's election. The guiding hand of the government, which has nurtured
industries, is now seen as a barrier preventing foreign competition. At the
same time, 'the nation's consensus over priority to corporations is
deteriorating,' says the report.
The ministry says the spate of stock market scandals, involving compensation
by stockbrokers to favoured clients who incurred losses, was due to the lack
of competition and transparency caused by governmental protection.
In spite of its admissions that the powerful bureaucrats are now obstructing
further maturity of the country's economy, it remains to be seen whether the
Ministry of Finance is willing to follow its own recommendations.
After the plunge in the Tokyo stock market last August, the ministry was
criticised for supporting share prices by pumping in public pension and
insurance funds.
Investors' concern over the reregulation of the equity market has heightened
as the ministry and financial regulators tightened restrictions on
controversial stock futures trading.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Clinton begins to hit his stride
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER six months in the White House, President Bill Clinton has developed an
unfortunate reputation for repeatedly allowing himself to be sidetracked
from his primary policy goals.
But fresh from a success at the Group of Seven economic summit, Mr Clinton
is showing signs of hitting his stride.
He quickly and effectively took charge of relief efforts in the
flood-stricken upper Mississippi basin. Federal emergency operations appear
to have improved considerably after the criticism that followed last year's
Hurricane Andrew.
Back in Washington, however, Mr Clinton finds a Congress almost as
rebellious as the floodwaters of the Mississippi. Heading the congressional
agenda is the budget bill, with negotiations beginning in earnest next week
on a compromise between the different versions already passed by the House
and the Senate.
However, two two irksome side issues remain: a controversial appointment and
the issue of allowing gays to serve in the military.
The president has on several occasions annoyed some of his most faithful
supporters by abandoning black and female nominees in the face of Republican
opposition.
Dr Joycelyn Elders, his choice for surgeon general, is both black and
female. She is also, because of her outspoken and colourful advocacy of sex
education and abortion rights, anathema to right-wing politicians, who have
dubbed her 'the condom queen'.
Republican senators acknowledge they have little chance of blocking her
confirmation on these grounds alone, but hope they may have more success on
other grounds.
After backing away from Ms Lani Guinier, a prominent black lawyer who was
his original choice to head the civil rights division of the Justice
Department, Mr Clinton cannot afford another betrayal of the black caucus in
Congress.
Fellow Democrats are expected to back Mr Clinton on Dr Elders, but cannot be
counted on over the issue of gays in the armed forces.
Mr Les Aspin, the defence secretary, submitted to the White House on
Thursday a proposal to allow homosexuals who do not reveal their orientation
to continue to serve in the military.
The proposal has already been dubbed unacceptable by gay activist groups.
If Mr Clinton can succeed in juggling these issues, he appears to have some
chance of success with his main preoccupation, the budget bill.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Improvement in May US trade figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US merchandise trade deficit fell to Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in
May, a significant improvement after deficits in excess of Dollars 10bn in
both March and April. Most analysts expected a deficit of more than Dollars
9bn.
The improvement, announced by the Commerce Department yesterday, partly
reflected a recovery in exports, which rose 1.2 per cent from April and 4.4
per cent in the year to May. Imports fell 2.8 per cent from exceptionally
high levels in March and April but remained 10.8 per cent higher than in May
last year.
The Federal Reserve said industrial output fell 0.2 per cent last month.
Revised May figures showed zero growth rather than the 0.2 per cent rise
first reported.
For the second quarter, production grew at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent,
sharply down from 5.5 per cent in the first quarter.
The weakness in production last month was broadly based, with declines in
output of consumer goods, construction supplies and mining. Manufacturing
output fell 0.3 per cent.
Consumer confidence continued to fall early this month, according to an
index compiled by the University of Michigan which fell to 76.9 early this
month compared with 81.5 in June.
The weakness in consumer confidence is believed partly to reflect
uncertainty about the outcome of congressional wrangling over the White
House deficit cutting economic plan. After upward revisions to retail sales,
real consumer spending is estimated to have grown at an annual rate of about
3per cent in the second quarter.
The latest figures point to growth of gross domestic product at an annual
rate of about 2 per cent in the second quarter, an improvement from growth
of less than 1 per cent in the first quarter.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Cuba anxiously beckons the outside world: Damian Fraser on
efforts to lure foreign business to Havana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cuban government yesterday gave a red-carpet welcome in Havana to nearly
80 foreign businessmen, asking them to invest in its beaches, oil, gold,
bio-technology, and any other enterprise of possible interest.
They were enticed with lengthy presentations on the state of Cuba and
top-level meetings with officials of their choice, and entertained at an
official drinks party. Representatives from PepsiCo, Eastman Kodak, RJR
Nabisco, BFI International, the US Rice Council, and a host of tourist
developers, lawyers, investment bankers, and curious Cuban-Americans all
made the trip.
Most of the visitors were from the US, although US law prevents them from
doing business with Cuba or even spending money there. But sensing a slight
easing in US policy to Cuba, Cuban officials and backers hope the meetings
will generate opposition to the three-decade US trade embargo against the
island.
In the meantime Cuba is hoping non-US businessmen will prop up its faltering
economy with foreign capital. Cuba has found foreign partners in tourism,
mining, light industry, agro-business and electronics, and claims to have
attracted some Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) in foreign investment in the past
couple of years.
So far such investment has not stopped the economy's decline, provoked by
the collapse in trade with former Comecom countries. It is expected to have
halved since 1989, with imports down to Dollars 2.2bn from Dollars 8.1bn.
Eight-hour electricity blackouts are common, malnutrition is a problem for
the first time since the revolution, and trade in all but the most crucial
products has ground to a halt. 'You could sign fantastic letters of credit
for Dollars 1m of business tomorrow,' says Mr Sem Davies of Fisons, the UK
pharmaceutical company which has experience in Cuba, 'but you would never
get paid'.
The potential investors were briefed by earnest bureaucrats. Mr Raul Amado
Blanco, of the central bank, said Cuba would allow foreign banks to set up
branches in partnership with the government in Cuba. Cuba's need for credit,
trade guarantees, import and export financing, credit card operations and
more meant the country's financial sector was ripe for take off.
Mr Antonio de los Reyes, deputy minister of basic industry, said laws that
gave Cubans majority ownership of joint ventures could be 'negotiated'.
His department is to auction 11 oil fields to foreign investors - some 45
have shown interest - in August. Three foreign oil companies, most notably
Total of France, are already exploring in Cuba.
Mr Carlos Lage, Cuba's top economic official, said yesterday plans to allow
Cubans to hold and spend dollars were in the final stage. Mr Lage hoped the
measures would increase the amount of hard currency in Cuba, and suggested
the government was taking steps to reduce the amount of local currency in
circulation. The moves could bring transactions now conducted in the black
market to the formal market.
Unsurprisingly, the US businessmen who came along thought the US trade
embargo should be lifted. 'We have sent 55,000 people back in rubber bags
from Vietnam and we are doing business with them. Why not with Cuba?' said
the representative from BFI waste disposal company.
Despite the precarious state of the Cuban economy, many are enthusiastic
about the market's potential. 'The embargo could be lifted in three years,'
said the PepsiCo man. 'Then Cuba will be the largest (Kentucky fried)
chicken market in the Caribbean.'

FT  17 JUL 93 / Complex search for a 'gay gene'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE discovery announced this week by US scientists that homosexuality may be
inherited is only the latest success for a genetic research technique called
linkage analysis.
It is a method that combines modern technology with a Sherlock Holmes-like
devotion to deducing the possible. The human body is made up of cells. Each
cell has within it 46 chromosomes, half from each parent. The chromosomes
consist of millions of pairs of molecules in long chains, called DNA.
Humans have 99.9 per cent of their DNA in common. Linkage analysis, like the
genetic fingerprinting used by the police, concentrates on the remaining 0.1
per cent.
To determine if homosexuality is inherited, researchers at the US National
Institute of Health needed to compare the parts of the DNA of gay men which
ought to differ but perhaps did not.
The task was immense. Even 0.1 per cent of human DNA leaves many thousands
of points on chromosomes to examine and compare.
The solution came from figures on the incidence of homosexuality. The
researchers took a sample of gay men and found a 13.5 per cent chance that a
brother was gay too. They worked on the conservative assumption that the
male homosexuality rate is about 2 per cent.
Then they looked at close relatives and found that male relatives on the
mother's side were also more likely than the average population to be
homosexual, while those on the father's side were not.
This allowed them to eliminate all the chromosomes but one from their
search, the one exclusively inherited from the mother, the X-chromosome.
Then began the laborious process of comparing the DNA of gay siblings.
Even concentrating on the small proportion of DNA that ought to differ
between brothers, there are areas that may be in common, such as colour
blindness, inherited on the X-chromosome. But by comparing their findings
with those from other pairs of brothers, the scientists were able gradually
to eliminate the other variables.
By the time their study was completed they had identified a single area on
the X-chromosome common to most homosexual men with a one-in-10,000 chance
of being wrong.
The research also indicated a different genetic area connected with female
homosexuality.
The study is far from conclusive. Three quarters of men with this area of
genetic material associated with homosexuality are not gay. And a minority
of gay men seem, in the study, not to have the material.
In common with previous research that links behaviour with genetics, there
are grey areas which prevent rigid rules being applied.
Nevertheless, the same research technique has had striking successes in the
past. It identified the genes for for inherited diseases such as cystic
fibrosis and Huntingdon's chorea.

<TEXT>
LIKE many a Hollywood star, Mr Franz Schonhuber, Germany's most prominent
far-right party boss, seems to think bad publicity is better than none,
writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
Mr Schonhuber, who heads the nationalist Republican party, stepped into the
limelight this week when it was revealed he had been selling 5,000 illegal
telephone cards bearing his picture.
Postreklame, a subsidiary of the German state-owned telecoms group, said
yesterday it was considering suing the party organisation. Legal proceedings
have already been opened against Protar, the Berlin-based company which made
the cards.
Meanwhile, telephone card collectors have been rushing to find the cards
which show Mr Schonhuber's face against the red, black and gold colours of
the Republican party. The card, issued on Mr Schonhuber's 70th birthday,
gives the party's telephone number on the back.
Protar is believed to have bought the cards, worth DM12 (Pounds 4.60), from
post offices before changing their design. The new cards sold for DM70.
Postreklame was approached last year by an advertising agency and asked if
it would manufacture the cards. But the telecoms company, which has printed
similar cards for German mainstream parties, refused on political grounds.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Bonn denies European bank site picked: Monetary Institute is
main prize in the elaborate division of Euro-spoils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday firmly denied a report that European
Community leaders have reached a secret agreement to base the new European
Monetary Institute, the core of the future European central bank, in
Frankfurt.
'This report is too good to be true,' said a German government spokesman.
'There has been no such agreement yet. We do not yet have the agreement of
all our partners.'
German officials made it clear they believe that Britain remains the only EC
member state opposed to Frankfurt, but they also recognise the political
difficulty for Mr John Major, the British prime minister, should the bank be
sited there.
There was considerable embarrassment in Bonn yesterday over the report,
confidently published by Handelsblatt, Germany's business newspaper, that
Frankfurt had won the battle for the EMI. They fear that, by reviving the
question just as the British parliamentary debate on Maastricht is coming to
its climax, British capitulation will be less likely.
The decision of EC heads of government on the location of the Monetary
Institute, which is supposed to be in operation by next January 1, merely
requires a country to be chosen. It will then be up to the government of
that country to choose the precise site - taking into account the views of
all member states.
Britain has strongly resisted Germany's equally firm determination to
promote Frankfurt, on the grounds that it could undermine the city of
London's position as Europe's main financial centre. The Bonn government
believes that only by siting the bank in Frankfurt, home of the German
Bundesbank, will sceptics - especially Germans  - be reassured that the new
institution will be as independent and stability-conscious as the German
central bank.
In any case, it is clear that negotiations have reached an end-game.
The negotiations are part of an elaborate division of the Euro-spoils which
involves more than a dozen new agencies and institutions. Each brings the
promise of jobs, prestige and a hole in taxpayers' wallets.
The European central bank is the most valuable prize. Other agencies include
Europol, a mini-European FBI which would replace Interpol, a European
environmental office, a European trade-mark office, a European drugs agency
and a European plant and vegetable office.
After the recent upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism, and amid popular
doubts in Germany about giving up the D-Mark, the Bonn government's claims
have grown stronger.
Uncertainty over Maastricht ratification has damaged market confidence in
European monetary union. The Belgian presidency of the EC is therefore
pressing for a deal on the EMI, possibly at a special summit in the autumn.
This would allow stage two of EMU to start on schedule on January 1 1994.
Another factor appears to be the race to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Under an earlier deal, France won the EBRD presidency and the UK won
agreement to put the bank in London. The question now is whether Mr Attali's
high-rolling habits have made it impossible for a Frenchman to keep the
post.
Mr Henning Christopherson, EC commissioner for economics and a strong
candidate for the EBRD job, has let it be known there should be 'no more Sun
Kings'.
If the Danish-born Mr Christopherson wins the EBRD job, what will become of
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France and a rumoured
front-runner for the post? The French are not saying; but some believe the
de Larosiere candidacy is actually an elaborate bluff to increase leverage
in negotiations on who should be the president of the EMI.

FT  17 JUL 93 / UN aid agency warns of Bosnia'catastrophe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL aid officials warned yesterday of 'impending catastrophe' in
Bosnia-Hercegovina this winter and of a new wave of refugees seeking asylum
in western Europe.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told a
meeting of donor countries in Geneva that intensified fighting and
deliberate obstruction by all three warring parties were making the agency's
relief work impossible in many areas. Less than half the targeted tonnage
was getting through.
'If we are unable to alleviate the plight of thousands of victims now, I
fear the worst for the months to come, particularly when the autumn and
winter set in,' she said, warning of 'impending catastrophe if we have to go
through another winter of war'.
UNHCR officials point out that last year the death of up to 400,000 people
was averted by a massive international aid effort and an unexpectedly mild
winter. This year many more are without food reserves, fuel or shelter.
It was announced yesterday that the international mediators for
ex-Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, would meet Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman today in
Geneva to discuss solutions to the conflict, ahead of talks next week
involving all the parties.
However, Lord Owen said yesterday that even if there was a peace settlement
in the next two to six weeks all possible resources would be needed to avoid
'a humanitarian nightmare' that threatened hundreds of thousands in Bosnia
this winter.
The UNHCR called yesterday's meeting after coming dangerously close to
running out of funds, at a time when the agency must plan the purchase,
stockpiling and delivery of essential winter supplies before snow and ice
make roads impassable. Some 3.6m people, 2.3m of them in Bosnia, depend on
UN aid for survival.
Donors yesterday promised Dollars 113m (Pounds 75.3m) of fresh funds for the
UN assistance programme, including Dollars 63m for the UNHCR. The EC, which
has been under pressure to contribute more cash, pledged Dollars 41m. The
refugee agency still has a Dollars 137m shortfall on its estimated Dollars
420m cash needs for 1993, but Mrs Ogata said it now had enough to start
planning for the winter.
Earlier this week the International Committee of the Red Cross and the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies appealed
for more than Dollars 110m to continue their work in ex-Yugoslavia.
The UNHCR has also warned of a 'dramatic' increase in refugees seeking
shelter in western Europe because of lack of funds for assisting displaced
people within the region.
Mrs Ogata again called on European nations, most of which have now
introduced visa requirements for Bosnian nationals, to uphold the right of
asylum and offer temporary protection to those escaping war and persecution.
Mr Warren Zimmermann, head of refugee programmes in the US State Department,
said any easing of the fighting in Bosnia could spark a 'massive outpouring
of people to near and distant countries throughout Europe' as those now
trapped tried to flee.

FT  17 JUL 93 / BASF in Siberian venture: Polyethylene plant to use cheap
natural gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASF of Germany and Gazprom of Russia yesterday announced they would
construct a substantial ethylene and polyethylene complex in west Siberia,
costing between DM1.2bn and DM1.5bn (Pounds 580m).
The plant, to be located at Novyi Urengoi, will have a capacity of 340,000
tonnes of ethylene a year and 300,000 tonnes a year of low-density
polyethylene. Construction should start in 1995 and be completed two years
later. The announcement is a disappointment for Union Carbide of the US,
which had been tendering for the project.
The Russian complex will have a cost advantage because it will use cheap
natural gas for its raw material rather than the more expensive naphtha used
by most western polyethylene manufacturers.
The plant will also add significantly to overcapacity afflicting the west
European petrochemicals industry. BASF is due to start production at its
600,000 tonnes-a-year complex at Antwerp at the end of this year.
BASF insisted the production would be used to meet Russian domestic demand.
According to Gazprom, Russia consumes only 5kg per capita of polyethylene.
Financing for the project has yet to be decided. Mr Jurgen Strube, BASF
chairman, said BASF would own less than 50 per cent of the plant. The group
has been reluctant to be an equity partner in a project so far from Germany.
German engineering groups Linde and Salzgitter were named by BASF as
candidates for constructing the ethane cracker and LDPE plant respectively,
although Mr Strube said as much as possible would be conducted by Russian
sub-contractors.
BASF and Gazprom, which already have a joint venture in methanol at
Arkhangelsk in northern Russia, are also considering building a natural gas
pipeline from the Siberian peninsula of Yamal to western Europe. Analysts
believe the gas, marketed through BASF's Wintershall subsidiary, could be
used to pay for some of the German company's contribution to the project.

RUSSIAN Defence Minister Pavel Grachev warned yesterday, on a hastily
arranged visit to the Tajik capital of Dushanbe, that Russia would retaliate
against the Afghan mujahideen and Tajik opposition fighters who killed 25
Russian servicemen in a clash on the Tajik-Afghan border earlier this week.
Describing the fighting as 'an undeclared war against Russia', Gen Grachev
said that he could not allow it 'to pass without retaliation'.
The increasingly bitter struggle in Tajikistan is just one of many hot-spots
in the former Soviet republics which skirt Russia's borders in which ethnic
Russians and Russian soldiers are becoming em-broiled.
In addition to the conflicts in Central Asia and the Caucasus in the west,
Russia risks becoming entangled in Estonia, where ethnic Russians in the
north-eastern city of Narva yesterday held a referendum on greater local
autonomy.
Further south, tensions were high yesterday in the Ukrainian port of
Sevastopol, which the Russian parliament claimed last week as a Russian
city.
In response to a planned attempt by Russian members of parliament to elect a
rival city government, Ukraine beefed up its military presence in the port.
Anti-Russian demonstrations were held throughout the republic.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Ukraine begins to dismantle missiles

<TEXT>
UKRAINE, which has faced harsh international criticism because of its
increasingly vocal pro-nuclear lobby, yesterday took a quiet step in the
opposite direction when technicians began dismantling some of the strategic
nuclear missiles on its territory.
Officials in Kiev yesterday confirmed a report in the Moscow daily newspaper
Izvestia that they had this week begun dismantling 10 of the country's 176
inter-continental ballistic missiles.
The decision represents the first concrete step that Ukraine - which has
come under fierce diplomatic pressure for failing to ratify two key
international disarmament treaties - has taken to reduce its strategic
nuclear arsenal since becoming independent nearly two years ago.
In contrast with its often hostile reporting on Ukraine, Izvestia welcomed
the action as a signal that 'although one swallow does not make a summer, it
cannot be denied that the ice has been broken'.
However, the Ukrainian move did not deter the Russian Foreign Ministry from
issuing a tough statement condemning Kiev's decision earlier this month to
claim ownership over nuclear warheads on its territory.
In keeping with that decision, Ukrainian military officials said the
warheads from the disabled missiles would be temporarily stored in Ukraine.
At a press conference in Kiev Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma
defended the ownership claim, saying it was necessary to ensure Ukraine
received compensation for the valuable enriched uranium released when
warheads are dismantled.
But Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned
Ukraine against going a step further and declaring itself a nuclear power, a
move the Ukrainian prime minister and a large lobby in parliament favour as
a temporary measure.
'Is it not clear that making Ukraine a nuclear state is tantamount to
opening a Pandora's box, giving the go-ahead to the appearance of other
nuclear states, putting an end to the non-proliferation of nuclear arms and
saying No to nuclear disarmament?' Mr Yastrzhembsky asked.
Kiev's tentative step toward disarmament, taken with little fanfare or
attempt to win political credit from the west, does not rule out a future
attempt by Ukraine to become a nuclear power.
The 10 missiles which have been taken off military alert are
Russian-manufactured SS-18s.
Even Ukrainian hawks like Mr Kuchma support the dismantling of these
weapons. Their position is that Ukraine should, at least temporarily, keep
only the 46 SS-24 missiles on Ukrainian territory, which were made in
Ukraine and are serviced by a Ukrainian factory.

AMID fears of a new Serb-Croat war in Croatia, Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic is due to meet in Geneva today Mr Franjo Tudjman, his Croatian
counterpart, and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic for talks on ending the
16-month war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Peace talks have so far failed to stem violence in the republic. Croatian
radio said yesterday that parts of south-western Mostar were aflame,
including the town's industrial district.
The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) had seized key positions and pushed back
the mostly Moslem Bosnian army, the radio said.
The Serbian and Croatian presidents are set to discuss the ethnic division
of Bosnia on a 'confederal basis', Tanjug, the Serbian news agency,
reported. It did not mention whether Mr Milosevic would hold face-to-face
talks with Mr Izetbegovic, who has rejected the ethnic partition of Bosnia
in favour of a federal state.
Meanwhile, the Croatian president, in a statement yesterday, said the
re-opening of the strategic Maslenica bridge was a 'civil' matter which
should not lead to 'military conflict'. Croatian and Serbian radio reported
scattered artillery duels in Croatia as tensions escalated over the planned
re-building of the bridge, which joins mainland Croatia to its southern
Dalmatian coast.
Serb leaders from the self-styled state of Serbian Krajina, which has cut
Croatia in half, on Thursday signed an agreement, brokered by international
mediators, which reaffirmed calls for the withdrawal of Croatian army and
police from Maslenica bridge and the nearby Zemunik airport and for the
deployment of UN troops in the region.
Krajina leaders have vowed to stop the pontoon bridge from being put into
operation tomorrow. Serb artillery is within easy reach of the bridge.
The UN has appealed to Croatia to postpone plans.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Weighty dossier on EBRD cost over-run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST before midnight on Thursday the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development's audit committee delivered to the board of directors its report
on the bank's excessive spending.
It beat the deadline, set when the report was commissioned on May 10, by a
matter of seconds.
That was no mean feat - the report is two inches thick and had to address
some very delicate issues, notably the responsibility of Mr Jacques Attali,
who quit his job as EBRD president yesterday, for the bank's excesses.
On the Pounds 66m spent by the bank on fitting out its new headquarters at
No 1 Exchange Square, the report says: 'Substantial cost savings could have
been achieved if there had been better planning and control.'
It adds: 'The committee was particularly concerned that there were areas of
the fit-out where value for money was not the primary consideration.'
A detailed analysis carried out for the committee by consultants from
Coopers &amp; Lybrand says that the cost per square metre of the headquarters,
most of which was fitted out in 1992, was Pounds 1,524, compared with Pounds
650 for a typical UK public sector building, Pounds 1,150 for a UK
commercial operation and Pounds 1,260 for a UK financial institution.
However, the EBRD has a number of special facilities, such as a high-quality
auditorium for press conferences and an enormous boardroom, complete with
high-tech translation and video facilities.
The report also points out that fitting out costs at 'other international
financial institutions in North America and Europe have cost in the range of
Pounds 300 per square metre to Pounds 600 per square metre'.
Among the items identified by Coopers as contributing to the high fit-out
cost are marble cladding and flooring for Pounds 1.65m, a hi-tech suspended
ceiling for Pounds 5.7m and a specially dyed carpet for Pounds 1.31m.
The committee says that part of the reason for the excessive costs was that
'the normal chain of command was not used in this project' and that the
project was handled by an ad hoc team headed by Mr Pierre Pissaloux,
director of Mr Attali's cabinet.
It says Mr Attali has 'rejected suggestions that he was involved'. However,
the Coopers report says Mr Attali gave opinions when requested on design
options and had frequent meetings with one of the architects, Mr Jean-Louis
Berthet, at which, according to Mr Berthet, design matters were discussed.
Mr Berthet is a founder of Berthet et Pochy, which did much of the
architectural work on No 1 Exchange Square as part of the Anglo-French joint
venture, Berthet Pochy Sidell Gibson. Berthet et Pochy was first contacted
to do some work for the EBRD, on its previous headquarters, at the
suggestion of Mr Attali. The audit committee notes that 'the appointment of
the architects did not follow the banks' rules nor was it based on good
commercial practice: in fact the procurement procedure was not competitive.'
It continues: 'The total fees paid to BPSG (of Pounds 3.2m) are high and the
committee was not given sound reasons that can justify why BPSG were
chosen.'
The committee has also made recommendations designed to improve the bank's
budget controls in general:
That cost over-runs beyond pre-established thresholds should be reported to
the board and thoroughly justified;
That budget performance should be assessed by relating costs to the amount
of business which the bank is doing.
Separately it proposes a sweeping review of corporate governance, or the
management structure and responsibilities of executives and directors. It
suggests that the role of each vice-president be reconsidered and annotated
job descriptions be prepared, to prevent a recurrence of the management
vacuum on the headquarters project, for which no executive took overall
responsibility.
Finally the committee looked at the procedures for the control of
expenditure. It was particularly concerned by the Pounds 1.4m spent on
flights in private jets, most of them arranged by Mr Attali, and also the
FFr5m (Pounds 570,000) of French government funds given to the bank by the
French government to pay for a Paris office, whose existence was not
notified to the board.
Other concerns are the Pounds 358,611 spent on artwork, which might 'give an
impression of extravagance' and also the 'significant amounts of expenditure
of a private nature or for which no supporting invoices have been provided'
which were charged to Mr Attali's corporate credit card in 1992 and 1993.
Since June 1993 Mr Attali reimbursed expenses totalling Pounds 30,431 which
had been incurred since January 1992.
The committee says it is 'generally satisfied that the bank's system for
authorising and controlling routine expenditures is sound'. However, it is
concerned about the authorisation of expenditure incurred by Mr Attali and
some members of his office. It proposes reforming the procedure whereby the
expenses of the bank's president and members of the presidential office are
authorised by direct subordinates of the president.
It wants such expenditure to be authorised in future by the vice-president
in charge of finance.
However, the committee concludes that 'proper expenditure control requires
more than simply sound procedures, but a general ethos of prudence and
probity throughout the organisation. Responsibility for establishing this
ethos rests with the president and the board of directors'.

THE prospect of renewed fighting between Serbs and Croats for the recovery
of Croatian territory overshadowed the start of a two-day summit meeting
between central European leaders yesterday which is aimed at easing ethnic
conflicts and increasing regional co-operation, Anthony Robinson writes from
Budapest.
Serbia has been excluded from the Central European Initiative (CEI) summit,
which provides a forum for meetings between the prime ministers and foreign
ministers of Italy and eight central European countries. Today Macedonia is
due to join the CEI, which was launched in 1989 as a five-nation group
cutting across the divide between Nato and Warsaw Pact countries.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Portuguese condemn Renault plan
</HEADLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL'S trade minister, Mr Fernando Faria de Oliveira, has written a
harsh letter to his French counterpart, Mr Gerard Longuet, over Renault's
plan to dismiss more than 300 workers from the French car-manufacturing
plant at Setubal, south of Lisbon, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
'Foreign investment has always been welcomed in Portugal,' the letter says.
'But we don't want projects that set up here like Bedouins, that are nomad
by nature.'
Portugal contests Renault's economic argument for the dismissals, which will
reduce production at Setubal from 80,000 to 43,000 cars a year. Portugal
says this is disproportionate to Renault's 13.8 per cent drop in production
worldwide.
But Renault says half the production in Setubal is for export to Spain,
where sales have fallen 30 per cent.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Attali quits after damning report: EBRD president will
'waive termination allowance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES ATTALI yesterday resigned as president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, two months earlier than expected and only
hours after the completion of an official report highly critical of his
extravagant expenditure and management style.
In an emotive resignation letter, presented to an EBRD board meeting
yesterday morning, Mr Attali said he would 'waive the termination allowance
(of more than Pounds 147,000 tax-free) to which I am entitled under my
employment contract'. He said that the interests of the bank 'are now best
served if I leave my pos-ition as president immediately'. The board was also
shown the draft reply from Mrs Anne Wibble, Swedish finance minister and
chairman of the bank's governors. In it, she offered to waive any claims the
bank might have on him arising from its audit committee's inquiry into his
conduct and the bank's expenditure.
The terms of both letters need approval by the bank's governors, most of
whom are finance ministers, before the resignation takes formal effect. Not
all the governors support giving Mr Attali immunity against future claims
against him by the bank.
The audit committee has been working on its report since May 10, after the
Financial Times disclosed that the bank had spent Pounds 200m on fitting out
its new headquarters and other expenses, more than twice the amount it had
lent or invested in eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet
Union, whose economies it was set up to help.
The report is filled with what Mrs Wibble described yesterday as 'serious'
criticisms of Mr Attali. It highlights the Pounds 1.4m spent by the bank on
flights in private jets on 57 occasions. Of these flights, 48 were arranged
with a French-based company, Air Entreprise, and most were authorised by Mr
Attali's office.
The audit committee said: 'The Bank's frequent use of chartered aircraft for
travel to destinations well served by scheduled airlines is inappropriate
given its status as a publicly funded development institution.'
It continues: 'The selection of Air Entreprise as provider of most of the
charter flights taken before January 1993 did not result from a competitive
tendering process and was in nearly every case more expensive than other
charter airlines. This represents a regrettable deviation from acceptable
practice for a public sector institution.'
Mr Attali reimbursed the bank with a cheque for Pounds 41,377 relating to
seven flights in private jets in early 1992. His staff told the committee
that Mr Attali signed the cheque on or about February 10 1993, but it was
mislaid. The report said: 'The cheque was paid into the EBRD bank account on
May 4 1993, ie, after the start of the present inquiry.'
Despite several requests, it continued, the committee had not been provided
with 'adequate' evidence to establish whether these flights were wholly for
private purposes and whether the Pounds 41,377 cheque was genuinely mislaid
or whether it was drawn at a later date than February 10.
The report also attacked Mr Attali for taking possession of three different
company cars within a 10-week period beginning in March 1991. 'The large
number of cars used by the president in rapid succession creates an
impression of extravagance which is inappropriate for the head of a
development institution', it said.
Mr Attali was also criticised for having charged 'significant amounts of
expenditure of a private nature, or for which no supporting invoices have
been provided' to the bank on his corporate credit card in 1992 and 1993.
The report notes that it was 'only on June 22 1993, ie, since the start of
the present inquiry, that the president reimbursed expenses totalling Pounds
30,431 which had been incurred during 1992 and 1993'. It also said that fees
received by Mr Attali for making speeches 'appear to be inconsistent with
the Code of Conduct of the Bank'. Mr Attali had a contract with Asahi
Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, which paid him Dollars 20,000 a year for two
years plus Dollars 30,000 for making a speech in the spring of last year.
Mr Attali's responsibilities have been taken temporarily by Mr Ron Freeman,
first vice-president, pending the appointment of a permanent successor.

FT  17 JUL 93 / VW shares fall as conflict with GM intensifies

VOLKSWAGEN SHARES fell on the Frankfurt stock exchange yesterday as the
industrial espionage battle between VW and General Motors of the US
intensified and traders reacted to court evidence related to the
confrontation.
The tussle between the biggest volume carmakers in Europe and the US took a
new turn as GM confirmed that the US Justice Department was conducting an
investigation into the possible theft of GM documents by former employees.
No further details were given, although the probe is understood to involve
the group led by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was the head of
global purchasing at GM before joining VW as production director in March.
Meanwhile, it is understood that Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe,
was offered the chairmanship of VW on two occasions last spring.
In a statement this week, Mr Hughes referred to one approach and said he
made it clear he was not interested.
His statement came in response to earlier jibes from Mr Ferdinand Piech, the
current head of the German group. Mr Piech suggested in a newspaper
interview that GM's accusations against VW were inspired by pique over Mr
Hughes's not getting the VW job.
Despite upbeat forecasts from Mr Werner Schmidt, Volkswagen finance
director, the group's shares shed DM5.20 yesterday in a rising market,
closing at DM360.50.
According to Mr Schmidt, even if the car market does not improve, the
company expects to return to profit in 1994.
Traders said the VW price had been affected by evidence heard in a civil
case in Hamburg on Thursday in which the news magazine Der Spiegel attempted
to have lifted a gagging order preventing it printing further articles
containing allegations about Mr Lopez and the GM colleagues who followed him
to VW.
Witnesses, all GM employees, gave evidence which contradicted some of Mr
Lopez's formal statements and denials on the GM affair which Der Spiegel had
earlier been obliged to publish by the Hamburg court which issued the
gagging order.
It also emerged that Mr Hughes, head of Opel until last summer, was
approached last spring by Mr Carl Hahn, then VW chairman, who handed over to
Mr Piech when he retired in December.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Chancellor warns Tory sceptics on cliffhanger treaty vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET yesterday raised the temperature in its battle with Conservative
Euro-sceptics over the Maastricht treaty, with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, delivering a sharp rebuke to anyone threatening
to vote with the opposition in next week's crucial House of Commons vote on
the social chapter.
As Lord Rees-Mogg announced he would seek to open another front against
ratification of the treaty by seeking a judicial review in the High Court,
Mr John Major, the prime minister, again expressed confidence that the
government would win the vote on Thursday. He insisted that any question of
his resignation was 'merely hypothetical'.
An attempt to point the way beyond Maastricht wrangling came from Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, who set out the positive vision through which
the Conservatives could win back people's confidence once the treaty had
been ratified.
He said that some of the party's problems had been caused by the 'absence of
enemies', such as the Soviet Union and powerful trade union bosses, leaving
no option but positive campaigning on issues such as deregulation, improving
public services and sustaining economic recovery.
Mr Clarke did little to disguise ministers' anger over the behaviour of the
sceptics, as he admitted Thursday's vote would be a 'cliffhanger'.
The chancellor, who warned that Britain's prospects would look 'very bad' if
it failed to ratify the treaty, said Tory sceptics would be 'standing on
their heads' if they sought to wreck the treaty by voting against a UK
opt-out on the social chapter.
Further evidence of the tough line being taken by the Tory establishment
came from Sir Peter Hordern, chairman of the Tory backbench European affairs
committee. He hinted that if the government were defeated on Thursday, a
further debate, to enable ratification to go ahead, could be held in August.
With Mr Major's authority at stake in the vote, Mr Clarke said he expected
the number of Tory MPs willing to vote against the government would be fewer
than generally expected.
More than a dozen - enough to overturn Mr Major's majority  - have expressed
willingness to defy the cabinet. But Mr Clarke's words signalled the start
of five days of intense arm-twisting aimed at bringing them into line.
The Euro-sceptics' application for a judicial review is further evidence
that some remain defiant.
The government is already working on the basis of not proceeding to
ratification until the issue has been resolved.
Lord Rees-Mogg said Sir James Goldsmith, the financier, was among those
meeting the 'substantial' costs of the action.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Chicago banker to head NY Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM McDonough, a 59-year old native of Chicago and former commercial
banker, will take on one of the most important jobs in central banking on
Monday when he becomes president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Mr McDonough, whose appointment was announced only yesterday, takes over
from the forceful Mr Gerald Corrigan, president since 1985. As head of the
most important of the 12 US reserve banks, he will play a central role in
protecting the health of the country's financial system and determining
monetary policy.
Speaking after the appointment was announced, Mr McDonough listed the
pursuit of price stability as his main priority. He added, though, that
inflation in the US was at 'very acceptable levels' and that he expected
price rises for the rest of the year to level off at around the 3 per cent
level of the first half.
The appointment comes after a protracted search for a new head of the Fed
which has covered more than 50 possible candidates. Mr McDonough, who had
effectively been Mr Corrigan's number two for the past 18 months, had been
widely seen as the most likely successor.
Over a 22-year career at First Chicago, one of the country's biggest
commercial banks, Mr McDonough had built up a reputation as a pragmatic,
careful banker with a good command of detail. He rose to become chief
financial officer, before retiring six years ago.
As head of the Fed's financial markets group for the past 18 months, Mr
McDonough has held the most influential position in determining the
day-to-day conduct of monetary conditions in the US.
He has also been responsible for the handling of the Fed's foreign exchange
policy at a time when the dollar has risen sharply against other currencies.
During that period, he has won the support of economists on Wall Street, and
his appointment was widely welcomed yesterday.
Although Mr McDonough's appointment is likely to bring a change of style to
the leadership of the Fed after eight years under the dynamic Mr Corrigan,
it is generally not expected to make a significant difference to the conduct
of monetary policy in the US. The Fed president will also become
vice-chairman of the 12-member policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

FT  17 JUL 93 / MI5 chief moves out of shadows into spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS STELLA Rimington, director-general of Britain's internal Security
Service, posed under conditions of appropriate secrecy for her first
official photographs yesterday.
Press photographers, summoned to the Home Office for an undisclosed
assignment, were taken by minibus to the service's headquarters. The
curtains of Mrs Rimington's office were drawn to avoid identifying the
room's location within the building.
The photograph is a step forward for open government: Mrs Rimington is the
first director-general of the Security Service - still widely known by its
1916 title MI5 - to have been officially identified while in office. The
government also published yesterday a booklet on MI5 on staffing and fields
of operation.

MR WILLIAM McDonough was appointed yesterday as president of the Federal

from Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed since 1985.
As president of the most important of the US's 12 reserve banks, he will

The Fed president will also become vice-chairman of the policy-setting
Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC will next meet on August 17 when Mr
McDonough will cast his first vote on monetary policy matters.
Mr McDonough's succession gives no clues as to when the Fed may next begin
to tighten interest rate policy, said Mr Stephen Slifer, chief economist at
Lehman Brothers.
A father of six, Mr McDonough's close connections with his home town of
Chicago include numerous directorships of local bodies, including the
Chicago Historical Society.

FT  17 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency pressure excites
Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market pressure switched from the French franc to the Danish crown
yesterday, leaving Paris wary, and Copenhagen a little excited, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS offered conflicting views. Some observers believed that if the krone
were forced out of the ERM, the assault on the franc would be renewed with
added vigour. Others said that the franc will resist all attempts by
speculators to break the ERM, given the publicised support of the German and
other European monetary authorities.
The CAC-40 index ended 11.85 higher at 1,974.93, a week's gain of 0.5 per
cent, in turnover estimated at FFr2.5bn.
A strong rise was noted in Matra-Hachette, up FFr6.40 or 5 per cent at
FFr133.4, partly on rumours that the group had won a defence contract.
Elsewhere Michelin gained FFr5.10 to FFr173 and Peugeot by FFr10 to FFr630.
COPENHAGEN climbed higher on speculation about a possible devaluation of the
krone as the currency came under attack from speculators in the money
markets.
The KFX index closed up 0.55 at 90.62 in turnover of DKr430m.
Den Danske Bank closed up DKr6 at DKr327 while Unidanmark climbed DKr4 to
DKr184.
As options and futures contracts expired on the Deutsche Terminborse,
FRANKFURT expected selling from the DTB in an attempt to push the DAX index
down to 1,800. Instead, it got late buying from the same source, said Mr
Jurgen Rossa at B Metzler, and the DAX closed 5.80 higher at 1,813.46.
Turnover eased from DM8.4bn to DM7.7bn. There were contrasts in carmakers
where worries over the future of the Volkswagen director, Mr Iganacio Lopez,
sent the shares down DM5.20 to DM360.50 as Daimler rose DM5 to DM677.50.
DB Research yesterday reconfirmed the buy recommendation it made for Daimler
in mid June. That got into the post-bourse where Daimler was bid up to
DM693.50, more than DM100 ahead of its price on June 14. The Ibis-indicated
DAX responded with a rise to 1,829.43 in the afternoon.
AMSTERDAM rose on the expiry of options, the CBS Tendency index closing up
1.0 at 118.0, but off the day's high of 118.6. The index has gained 1 per
cent on the week.
Nedlloyd ended at a 12-month high on speculation that a US group was seeking
a merger with the shipping division. The shares put on Fl 1.50 to Fl 38.10.
KLM closed off 10 cents at Fl 33.30 after earlier seeing Fl 34.20 as it said
that it would match the fares of a US competitor on transatlantic routes.
Hoogovens rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 41.10 after Thursday's news that the city of
Amsterdam had sold its 5 per cent stake.
MILAN was pleased at the performance of the enlarged screen trading system
which came into operation yesterday. Most of the major stocks are now
available on the telematic, which accounts for some 80 per cent of total
market capitalisation.
The Comit index finished 1.84 higher at 556.41, a rise of 2 per cent on the
week, in good volume.
Telecommunications issues fell back after Thursday's news of delays in the
privatisation programme: Stet slipped L149 to L3,776 and Sip lost L74 to
L2,736.
However, losses in this sector were the exception with the other blue chips
picking up gains across the board. Fiat put on L134 to L6,604 and Pirelli
L80 to L1,589. Generali continued its rally and broke the L40,000 level with
a rise of L258 to L40,008.
Benetton, another popular stock at the moment, ended L302 higher at L20,562.
ZURICH saw most interest in special situations as the SMI index eased 2.7 to
2,396.4, 0.3 per cent down on the week after Wednesday's 1993 closing high
of 2,419.0. SMH, the watchmaker, fell SFr4 to SFr234 after SFr222, down
SFr31 on the week after a Goldman Sachs downgrade on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Saurer, the textile machinery and technology group, recovered
another SFr50 to SFr2,150 as Mr Vittorio Ghidella, who resigned as board
chairman on Thursday, handed himself over to Italian authorities, as the
group appointed the former Volkswagen chief, Mr Carl Hahn, to replace him
and as it forecast higher earnings for 1993.
STOCKHOLM closed higher for the ninth straight session on gains in selected
blue chips and in the forestry sector. This helped offset a decline in
Ericsson, which has led the market's rally this week, as its B shares lost
SKr3 to SKr380.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 3.1 to 1148.0, up 3 per cent on the
week. Turnover was SKr869m.
OSLO rose to a new 22-month high, led by strength in shipping stocks. The
All-share index rose 3.13 to 521.72 and the shipping index 15.82 to 571.99.
Bergesen put on NKr5.50 to NKr152. Hafslund Nycomed went against the trend,
losing NKr5.50 to NKr120 following downgrades of pharmaceutical shares in
the US on Thursday.
ISTANBUL closed the week on a positive note although some sporadic
profit-taking was noted throughout the day. The composite index gained 173.6
to 10,617, for a rise of 3.3 per cent on the week.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Kuwait MPs censure managers of KIO
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A KUWAITI parliamentary report has taken the Kuwait Investment Office's
management, both past and present, to task over actions taken since a
shake-up last year following the Dollars 5bn collapse of the KIO's
investments in Spain, Reuter reports from London.
The Kuwait finance and economics committee, which is scathing about former
managers, criticises the new team for its handling of investments, its
conduct in legal action, costs and use of advisers.
Accusing former senior officials of fraud and mismanagement, it calls for a
wider probe into management still in place in Britain, Spain and 'up the
scale of responsibility'.
The KIO's Spanish arm, Grupo Torras, went into receivership in December,
eight months after Mr Ali Rashaid Al Badr took over as president.
The KIO is now pursuing the unit's former president, Sheikh Fahad Al Sabah,
general manager Mr Fouad Jaffar, Spanish agent Mr Javier de la Rosa and
other former officials, seeking Dollars 1bn in criminal damages in Madrid
and Dollars 510m in civil damages in London.
Allegations of secret political payments for support after the 1990 Iraqi
invasion emerged in the report into Dollars 300m of Torras funds not yet
traced. Kuwait finance minister Mr Nasser Abdulla Al-Rodhan has denied the
allegations.
Former managers say they have been singled out, for political reasons, in a
power struggle in Kuwait, which Kuwaiti sources say is aimed mainly at Mr
Al-Rodhan's predecessor, Sheikh Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, a senior member of the
royal family close to the Emir.
On Friday a Madrid court threw out the Spanish case for the third time and
the British trial could take up to five years, costing up to Pounds 60m
(Dollars 90m), sources close to the KIO say.
The report asks why claims against all Torras directors, including those
still on the board, are not being made and says foreign investments should
be taken away from the KIO in London.

FT  16 JUL 93 / German businessmen look for backing from Russian premier:
Energy ventures await political support from Moscow
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN business community yesterday called on Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the Russian prime minister, to give top level political support to three
industrial joint ventures in Russia designed to modernise the republic's
energy infrastructure and bring in hard currency.
Meeting the Russian prime minister on the second day of his three-day visit
to Germany, the eastern trade committee of the German industry federation,
the BDI, said all three projects were ready to go ahead if financing could
be assured on the Russian side.
'The Russians tell us they want more investment. Now it is up to them to
deliver the necessary conditions for the investments to proceed,' said Mr
Victor Vogt, head of the foreign trade department at the Cologne chamber of
commerce and industry.
The largest project is a joint venture between Ruhrgas, Germany's largest
gas importer, and Purneftegaz, the gas producer in western Siberia. The
25-year venture plans to extract 6bn cubic metres of gas from the Siberian
oil fields each year.
Ruhrgas, which has been negotiating with its Russian partners for more than
a year, says the additional energy produced by the joint venture would
provide Russia with a steady flow of hard currency. This could be used to
repay debts incurred on the Russian side. The project requires an initial
investment of Dollars 1bn.
Other projects include the installation of gas turbines at at St Petersburg
power station by the German subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swiss-Scandinavian power equipment group.
Siemens, the German energy and engineering group, is also negotiating the
possibility of modernising a conventional power station in Konakova under a
contract worth DM120m (Dollars 70m).
German businessmen also called on the Russian delegation to clarify the
legal and financial framework for joint ventures in Russia. Top priorities
include the need to define clearly who on the Russian side - the company,
the regional authorities or the central government - has the real
decision-making power.
Worries were also voiced concerning the DM2bn owed to German enterprises
over the past two years which are not covered by state guarantees.
The German government has set its Hermes export guarantees at DM5bn and has,
on a project basis, allocated up to DM4bn of guarantees this year to east
German companies. But economics ministry officials say the government is
unwilling to extend such credit guarantees to west German concerns.
The Russian side has repeatedly called on Bonn to include west German
companies which are key participants in the energy sector.

The German business newspaper Handelsblatt reports in today's edition that
EC heads of government have decided to locate the European central bank in
Frankfurt. It said the decision would be announced at an autumn summit in
Brussels. The UK Treasury said last night: 'No decision has been made.' The
finance ministry in Bonn said it had nothing to add to finance minister Theo
Waigel's recent comment that most EC leaders favoured Frankfurt.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Arts: Lloyds Theatre Challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like babies to the font, the three severely disabled youths were carried
reverentially to the front of the stage and laid on cushions. They were
dressed in kimonos and greeted with oriental music. Their attendants wafted
Japanese fans over them; the youths stared wide-eyed with joy. One screeched
his pleasure. There was nothing patronising about the tableau: it was one of
the most moving examples of reverence for life observed on a stage.
And this was no prefabricated platform in a community arts centre. This was
the Olivier at the National Theatre in London. The participants came from
the Harlow College Community Arts group, which involves more than 30
under-19-year-olds, ranging from the able bodied to the most afflicted. They
were presenting Tower of Dreams, which through music, movement, and
spectacle, makes the case for the disabled to be allowed on to the raft of
life, represented as a fairground carousel.
It was part of the 1993 Lloyds Bank Theatre Challenge, the last such
Challenge. After five years and Pounds 1.2m, this investment in youth
theatre has ended. However, the National is already planning another
programme involving youth and is seeking a sponsor.
A great attraction of the Challenge is that the 10 groups which this year
caught the judge's eye from over 250 entries get the chance to strut for an
hour on the UK's most prestigious stage. The three-night festival lets an
audience see not so much new acting talent as the issues that excite youth.
Rather than take a received text, most of the contributions this year were
devised within the companies.
It is an inspiring experience and one which dispels doubts about the
importance of theatre in education. Of course there is an abundance of
youthful worthiness and idealism on display, but also a great deal of fun.
The level of acting assurance is amazing, almost frighteningly so.
At the opening night on Tuesday the Harlow spectacle contrasted with the
contributions of Redbridge College Performance Art Group and Burnley Youth
Theatre which were both built around issues. There is something galvanising
about plays involving teenagers which are devised and performed by
teenagers: the language is so much more credible than the second-hand
observations of older 'realist' playwrights.
Both works were loosely structured, with ideas running way beyond anything
so obvious as a plot, and they were inevitably a bit didactic. But from
Burnley, along with frighteningly confident performances, there was wit and
good nature and the ability to take a serious issue, contraception, light
heartedly. There was even room for romance, even if did lead to divorce.
Redbridge was an ensemble work, using mime and music to put over the
dispiriting message than men are bastards. Perhaps the girls do not really
believe it; perhaps they have been watching too much television.
But it was enthusiastically performed and had the saddest of endings. Sandy
Toksvig, the evening's presenter, announced that this would be Redbridge's
last performance. It was the victim of local authority spending cuts, an
unwelcome reminder of cruel and blinkered reality on an uplifting evening.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major hails new indications of
'recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN was coming out of recession and leading Europe into recovery, Mr
John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was also in buoyant mood when, while
stressing that the content of his November Budget had yet to be decided, he
sought to reassure Tory backbenchers alarmed by the possibility of increases
in income tax.
Both the prime minister and the chancellor emphasised the significance of
the continuing fall in unemployment, coupled with the lowest rate of
inflation for nearly 30 years.
Mr Major commented: 'Taken with the remarkable figures on Tuesday on
manufacturing output, I think we can now say with some certainty that there
is clear evidence of a recovery gathering pace.'
Reaffirming his determination to reduce the Pounds 50bn public sector
borrowing requirement, the chancellor said he shared the instincts of the
rightwing Tory MPs in the 92 Group that public expenditure restraints should
be the first consideration.
Mr Clarke described as 'slight' the additional revenue which would be raised
by increasing the 40p rate, and recalled that higher yields had resulted
from the cuts made in the 'extraordinary high levels' of taxation imposed by
the last Labour government.
He accused Labour MPs of always wanting to put up taxation 'on somebody or
other', while, as a Conservative chancellor, he was being reminded by
backbench colleagues of their party's commitment to continue to reduce
income tax 'when it is prudent to do so'.
Sir Peter Tapsell (C Lindsey East) said estimates like those which had
produced the figure of Pounds 50bn were notoriously unreliable.
Mr Clarke answered that he had 'never drunk of the pure milk of monetarism'.
But the PSBR did constitute a serious problem and the monthly figures were
running in line with the forecast, adding: 'If the PSBR falls faster than I
am expecting I can probably deal with any problems that may cause with
considerable ease.'

MR Norman Lamont discomforted the prime minister and delighted the
opposition benches yesterday by highlighting the success of the policies
with which he was associated as chancellor.
Mr Lamont cited 'the catalogue of good economic indicators' which was now
being enthusiastically trumpeted by his former cabinet colleagues.
With heavy irony Mr Lamont asked the prime minister to congratulate Mr
Kenneth Clarke, his successor as chancellor 'on the rapid success of his
policies'.
Mr Major replied: 'I know the chancellor will be most grateful for your
support of his policies'.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords force HK rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was last night considering whether to increase from 50,000 to
57,000 the number of Hong Kong citizens who will be offered full British
citizenship, after suffering an embarrassing defeat on the issue in the
Lords.
Peers voted by 60 to 48 to back a demand by Lord Bonham-Carter, a Liberal
Democrat, calling for full British citizenship for Hong Kong's non-Chinese
ethnic minorities in the run-up to the colony's handover to China in 1997.
This group, who number about 7,000 and are mainly of Indian origin, are
currently only eligible to apply for British Nationality (Overseas)
passports which do not confer a right of residence in the UK.
Under current proposals, about 3.3m Hong Kong citizens are eligible for the
BNO passports, with full citizenship restricted to 50,000 public servants
and entrepreneurs.
Though last night's vote has no legal force, the Home Office said it
intended to 'look at' the situation in the light of the Lords' opinion.
Lord Bonham-Carter, a former chairman of the Race Relations Board, said the
ethnic minorities covered by his demand would be rendered 'effectively
stateless' by the government's plans and deserved protection.
Lord Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the 50,000 limit on offers of full
citizenship struck a balance between maintaining confidence in Hong Kong and
limiting potential UK immigration.
He said that only half of those eligible for BNO passports had applied. The
government was setting cut-off dates for different age groups in a bid to
avoid 'a last-minute rush'. He denied BNO passport holders would have an
'inferior status'.

THE CONSERVATIVE party risks destroying itself, 'certainly for a few years',
if it brings down Mr John Major as prime minister, Baroness Chalker, the
foreign office minister, says in an interview today.
She says the 'old guard' who nominated Mr Major for the party leadership
'are letting him down . . . frankly if the party destroys him, it will
destroy itself'.
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister who led the Lords revolt on
Wednesday over the Maastricht Treaty, 'must be very lonely for real
friends', Lady Chalker says in Harpers &amp; Queen magazine.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWNING STREET caterer Ms Clare Latimer settled her libel action against
Scallywag magazine yesterday, leaving the prime minister to continue his
legal battle alone.
Scallywag immediately threw down the gauntlet and challenged Mr John Major
to a full-scale libel trial.
Mr David Price, the magazine's solicitor, said: 'The first law of libel is
that you should not start something you cannot finish. We will see if Mr
Major is prepared to meet my clients in court.'
Miss Latimer said the defendants could not bring themselves to apologise and
they had no means to meet any claims for damages or costs.
She added: 'In the circumstances, as they agreed to undertake to the court
not to repeat the allegations, I am content to have reached a settlement.'
Mr David Hooper, Mr Major's solicitor, confirmed that the prime minister's
action against the magazine was unaffected by the settlement with Miss
Latimer and was continuing.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): POSTScript
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a natural tendency for first-time investors to concentrate on the
UK equity market. But, as the figures show, over the past five years the
best returns have come from overseas.
The top-performing unit trust sector over the five years to July 1 was the
non-Japanese Far East. Investors earned, on average, nearly 145 per cent
over the period, with the best returns coming from the Gartmore Hong Kong
trust.
But investors would have done better in almost any international sector,
save Japan, than in the UK market. The devaluation of the pound is obviously
a factor here, but so is the length and depth of the UK recession.
Another noteworthy statistic is the strong display by bond funds. The boring
old UK gilt &amp; fixed interest sector actually did better than the supposedly
go-ahead UK growth sector. International fixed income produced higher
returns than international growth. Falling interest and inflation rates
around the world have been the key; those who believed the 1990s would be
the decade of the bond have yet to be proved wrong.
Looking at the one-year figures, what is encouraging for unit trust
investors is that every sector produced a positive return. Even allowing for
charges, all should have beaten the return from the building society over
the past year - a factor that is no doubt playing its part in the boom in
unit trust sales, which are running at pre-crash levels.
Among the investment trusts, the strong performance of Bankers stands out.
Not only is it top of the international general sector over five years, but
it is the best performer among the funds listed over two and 10 years and is
second over one year. The trust is managed by Michael Moule, of the newly
merged Henderson Touche Remnant; he also manages Law Debenture, the second
best performer over five years. The consequence of his success is that
Bankers' shares stand on a very narrow discount to net asset value, and that
Law Debenture's shares trade at a premium. Given that the figures reflect
share, and not NAV, performance, this limits the scope for returns to be
maintained at the previous level.
The UK income growth sector attracts more than its fair share of personal
equity plan money, and it is accordingly encouraging to see it producing
positive returns. The outlook for income funds changed dramatically with the
pound's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, and high-yielding stocks have
had a very good nine months since then. Investors in substantial trusts,
such as TR City of London, Murray Income and Merchants, have all doubled
their money over the past five years.

Tables show the value, as at July 1, of a Pounds 1,000 investment over
different periods. Unit trusts are given on an offer-to-bid basis with
net income reinvested. Investment trusts are on a mid-market basis with
net income reinvested. The order in which trusts are listed is based on
performance over five years, so that funds with less than five years'
performance are omitted.  Market statistics provided by HSW Ltd (0625

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): New issues
abound after interest rates fall - But first-time investors should not
overlook the big international general trusts, which have performed so well
over the long term / Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE INVESTMENT trust revival continues. The sector has been able to launch a
number of new funds this year, as investors have been attracted to equities
in the wake of the decline in interest rates.
Both John Govett and Kleinwort Benson have launched funds based on emerging
markets; Dunedin and Perpetual have issued Japanese trusts; a smaller
companies fund has been launched by a new group, CW Asset Management;
further trusts, aimed specifically at the private investor, were launched by
Ivory &amp; Sime and Johnson Fry (see below).
As well as new issues, a number of existing trusts have taken advantage of
their popularity to issue new shares.
While this is good news for the sector, investors should not automatically
assume that a new issue is the best way of buying shares in the trust. After
allowing for the costs of the issue, shares will almost always start trading
at a premium to net assets.
Although this may be an acceptable cost if the trust breaks new ground, or
if other trusts in the same field are also trading at premiums, private
investors should always look to see if there are comparable trusts which can
be bought at a discount to net assets.
There is also the danger that specialist trusts tend to be launched at a
time when the sector is in favour, which could be the top of the market.
The big international general trusts, which have served investors well over
the long term, should not be forgotten by first-time investors.
ISIS DEFIES THE CURRENT
THE LAUNCH of the Isis trust from Ivory &amp; Sime was an interesting
experiment. The trust attempted to turn the logic of most recent trust
issues on its head.
Rather than offer shares with a high yield, in order to attract
income-seeking investors, it offers investors shares with no yield at all.
If investors then sell sufficient shares each year, they can achieve the
desired level of income (7 per cent) in a tax-efficient manner, because
capital is taxed less harshly than income.
The idea is not new. Unit trust withdrawal plans used to be a regular
feature of the market. What caused their demise was the 1972-74 bear market.
With share prices steadily falling, each time investors sold units to get
income they took a bigger portion out of a smaller pot. Their starting
capital dwindled dramatically.
The same could happen to Isis if similar stock market conditions were to
prevail. (On the other hand, the comment also applies to some of the
high-yielding split-capital trusts).
Isis has come up with a partial solution to this problem. It has sold the
dividend income of the trust to the institutions, in the form of convertible
annuity shares. This gives an immediate uplift to the asset value of the
ordinary shares, because the annuities have a negligible claim on the
trust's assets. Thus the shares are in the unusual position of being issued
at a discount to net asset value.
However, there are plenty of critics of this structure. They point out that
dividend income is an important component of investment returns, and argue
that the uplift in asset value achieved for the ordinary shareholders
(around 10 per cent, after expenses) is too small to compensate for this
factor. Isis retorts that the structure gives it freedom to buy low-yielding
shares which have greater scope for capital growth.
A further potential problem, it has been suggested, is that there will be a
steady supply of investors who need to sell shares to meet their income
requirements. Unless there is equivalent demand to mop up these shares, the
trust is likely to fall to a wider and wider discount.
The Isis solution is to offer a savings scheme which rewards loyal investors
with free warrants. This, the trust hopes, will create the regular demand
for buying shares. It remains to be seen whether the balance can be struck
at the right point.
Isis certainly has an ingenious structure, and the aim of getting investors
to exploit the tax break of the annual Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax
allowance is a good one. The trust raised just Pounds 26m, and only time
will show whether the structure works to the advantage of all concerned or,
as critics maintain, is too clever by half.
INCOME FROM UTILITY STOCKS
THE FIRST investment trust to concentrate on utility stocks was launched by
Johnson Fry in June. It has a split-capital structure, with ordinary income
shares yielding 9 per cent gross and zero dividend preference shares,
rolling up at 9 per cent a year to the wind-up date in 2003.
To achieve that yield, the trust cannot concentrate solely on the utilities
such as water and electricity. Around 25 per cent of the portfolio will be
invested in fixed preference stocks to boost the revenue; in addition, the
trust will earn income by selling call options against part of its utility
holdings. The overall yield on the trust will be 7.7 per cent, falling to
6.75 per cent after charges.
The main appeal of the trust will be the income stream. The ordinary income
shares will need asset growth of 3.7 per cent a year to return the issue
price of 100p, and the large holding of preference stock will obviously make
this harder to achieve. Some capital growth may also be surrendered by the
sale of options.
THE HENDERSON-TR MERGER
THE MERGER of fund management groups Henderson and Touche Remnant has
brought together 17 trusts in one range. The names of the trusts will not
change, but the management group can now market the trusts together.
Those who want to use the combined group's savings scheme will pay a 1 per
cent transaction charge on purchases and sales. The minimum monthly
contribution is Pounds 25 per month, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum.
A special Pep scheme covers five of the group's trusts: Henderson Highland,
Witan, Lowland, TR High Income and TR City of London. The minimum monthly
contribution is Pounds 100, or Pounds 3,000 for a lump sum. There is a 3 per
cent initial charge, a 1.25 per cent annual management charge and a 1.25 per
cent transaction charge. Some trusts have separate Pep schemes.
The group also offers a free share-exchange facility for those wishing to
invest in its trusts. An investor with, say, BT shares can sell them without
paying dealing commissions provided the proceeds are invested in a Henderson
TR trust.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Tracker fund
with an insurance safety-net - L&amp;G's plan is more flexible than many
guaranteed investments, though investors would have to be pessimistic to pay
the steep charges / What's new?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GUARANTEES OF growth and promises of high income have remained favourite
features with managers launching new investments during the summer.
With Legal &amp; General's five-year Guaranteed Stockmarket Investment Plan, 4
per cent of the investor's money goes towards an insurance policy to cover
investment performance.
The balance of 96 per cent goes into the L&amp;G Stockmarket Trust, a unit trust
tracking the FT-SE 100 index, carrying an initial charge of 3 per cent and
an annual charge of 2 per cent.
The plan guarantees that investors will get back not less than 100 per cent
of their initial investment at the end of five years. The insurance policy
will make up any difference if the fund, including reinvested income, falls
short.
The minimum investment is Pounds 3,000. At the end of five years, L&amp;G pays
back 1.5 per cent of the initial investment as a loyalty bonus.
Investors would have to be very pessimistic about the five-year outlook to
consider paying L&amp;G's steep charges for the guarantee of doing no more than
break even, at worst. But the plan is more flexible than many guaranteed
investments, as investors can pick their own starting date for the five-year
term and there are no penalties for early withdrawal from the plan, apart
from the loss of the loyalty bonus.
YOUR MONEY BACK PLUS INTEREST EQUIVALENT TO FOOTSIE'S RISE
ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester building society's second five-year stockmarket bond
has no insurance component, despite the society's link with Scottish
Amicable, as an appointed agent.
Available until August 14 for investments between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds
500,000, the bond guarantees a payback of the capital at the end of five
years, plus interest equivalent to the full increase in the FT-SE-100 index
over that time, or the return of 120 per cent of the initial investment -
whichever is greater. Although past performance is not a reliable guide to
the future, the Footsie index rose by 56 per cent in the five years to June
30, 1993.
The bond has some severe restrictions, allowing no withdrawals at all during
the first year, though the society says it would treat dire emergencies on
merit and 'come to some arrangement'. Investors cashing in before the end of
five years receive reduced guaranteed amounts.
In the second year, the payback is the capital plus 70 per cent of any rise
in the index over the time the money has been invested, with no fallback
amount of interest. In the third year, investors cashing in get the greater
of 105 per cent of their initial investment or their investment plus 70 per
cent of the rise in the Footsie.
In the fourth year, the guaranteed alternative goes up to 110 per cent of
the initial investment, but investors withdrawing from the bond at that
stage would still receive a maximum of 70 per cent of the rise in the
Footsie on top of their original capital.
QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS WITH AN EXPECTED 8 PER CENT YIELD
LAZARD High Income Trust is a new investment trust aiming to provide a high
gross dividend yield and a chance of capital growth by investing mainly in
convertible securities .
The offer for subscription at a price of Pounds 1 per share, which calls for
a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000, closes on August 3, and the first day
of dealing is scheduled for August 10.
Nick Coombes, the investment manager, said the trust had been designed with
the second most simple structure possible (the simplest being a trust
consisting of ordinary shares only). It will draw 70 per cent of its money
from ordinary shares issued to the public and 30 per cent from a capped bank
loan. The trust will have a fixed life of six years, and has made a pledge
that there will be no rights issues during that time.
Mr Coombes, who has a long record in stockbroking and fund management, had
joined Grahams Rintoul last September and was already engaged in advanced
preparations for launching the High Income Trust, when the firm was taken
over by Lazard in May.
The launch was to have been a first foray into convertibles for GR, which
ran trusts specialising in small companies and North American oil and gas,
both poorly-performing sectors in the past few years.
The Lazard High Income Trust is expected to yield 8 per cent gross and will
pay dividends quarterly. But because the investment will be principally in
convertibles, which are regarded as equity derivatives, investors will not
be able to shelter the income from tax by holding the shares in a personal
equity plan (Pep).
ADVISER'S INCOME PEP WILL INVEST IN THREE UNIT TRUSTS
COUNTRYWIDE Independent Advisers, one of the largest networks of financial
advisers, has launched an income Pep, packaging its own choice of the unit
trusts already on the market.
Initially the Pep will be equally invested in three unit trusts: Newton
Income, Perpetual High Income and Capital House Income &amp; Growth. The initial
yield is approximately 4.5 per cent, but Peter Tamm, chief executive of
Countrywide, said that in managing the Pep he would not be setting a target
in terms of an income figure but would look at how unit trusts performed
against their peer groups, aiming to pick trusts which would achieve results
in the top two deciles of the performance tables.
Charges on the Countrywide income Pep are an initial 3.5 per cent and an
annual 1.75 per cent, with a fixed plan fee of Pounds 20. Mr Tann said that,
as there would be no double charging, investors would be buying all three
unit trusts more cheaply than if they went direct to the groups concerned.
The Capital House and Newton funds both have a 6 per cent initial charge,
while Perpetual's is 5.25 per cent. However, the Countrywide Pep's annual
charge is half a percentage point above the 1.25 per cent charged by all
three funds forming the original selection.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): 'Without
Lloyd's, all this would have gone' - Despite recent losses, a Scottish
landowner will continue to be a Name, as he struggles to keep up his family
home / Serious Riches
</HEADLINE>

WHERE THE river Girvan bends along the three-mile drive up to Blairquhan
castle in the Scottish Lowlands, you catch the first glimpse of the stone
Tudor mansion on its fern-green perch.
Sheep graze at the foot of the castle's drawing room, and, from inside the
calm of its Thai silk-covered walls, you watch the Girvan winding its way
between the gentle hills and into the woods.
The beauty is not entirely down to nature but to the energies of the Hunter
Blair family, which has lived in Ayrshire since the 12th century. Sir David
Hunter Blair commissioned both the construction of the neo-Tudor castle and
the diversion of the Girvan as part of a redesign of the landscape in the
early 1800s.
His great great grandson, Jamie Hunter Blair, estate manager, Lloyd's Name,
chairman of the Historic Houses Association in Scotland, vice-chairman of
the Scottish Historic Buildings Trust, former Christie's agent and 'eligible
bachelor', has inherited this 'pile', which is the source of his wealth yet
also threatens to sap it.
Like many of those who still retain their family seat, he feels like one of
an endangered species. 'To keep a place like this, you have to be seriously
rich, and most people are not; which is why these historic houses are going
at such a rate,' says Hunter Blair.
Four of the eight most important historic houses in south Ayrshire are for
sale, he says, and have been on the market for at least a year while their
condition deteriorates. 'The HHA (this month) is publishing a survey of
what's happened in the last three years to all the houses that have been
sold and it's very depressing reading, because once they have been sold, and
fall out of the family's hands, they tend to get sold again and again.'
Hunter Blair's inheritance includes a maintenance fund for Blairquhan castle
and its 500 acres of parkland. The fund was valued at over Pounds 390,000
after the death of his father, Sir James Hunter Blair, in 1985.
'The income is barely enough to keep one gardener going, and so far we've
resisted the temptation to use the capital,' says Hunter Blair, who believes
the government is short-sighted in its policy towards preserving Britain's
historic homes.
Maintenance funds are trust funds dedicated to the benefit of, and repairs
to, a heritage property. Although they are free of inheritance tax, they
attract income and capital gains tax. For several years, the HHA has argued
that they should be exempt from both.
Sir David acquired the original castle and land as a result of his father's
successful Edinburgh banking career and fortuitous marriage. Hunter Blair's
own flirtation with banking was not a success. After taking a degree in
history at Oxford, he went, at his father's suggestion, to what is now Hill
Samuel. After two years, the bank called him in and asked him whether he
really thought his future was in banking.
He then went to learn about estate management on an estate owned by the Duke
of Buccleuch, Britain's largest landowner, and has been involved in managing
the family estate ever since.
Hunter Blair estimates that it costs roughly Pounds 100,000 to keep the
house going every year. The maintenance trust is one way of helping towards
the costs, but the traditional activities of farming, forestry and letting
farms are no longer the solution. Hunter Blair 'lost more money than you
would believe' in farming. 'All that was left was the chance to have income
from visitors,' he says.
The estate has six holiday cottages, which are booked for up to six months
in advance. From such small but encouraging signs, the decision was made to
hire out the castle itself for income. There has been a shift away from
chasing rich Americans towards corporate hospitality, which Hunter Blair has
found to be a more reliable form of income.
Companies which use the house for conferences include Scottish Enterprise,
Caledonian Paper and BPCC, the printing company. Under the terms of the
maintenance fund, the house is open to the public for 25 days a year, but
the amount raised is tiny - only Pounds 2,846 last year - while the income
from hiring out the house last year was Pounds 66,418.
How is the shortfall made up? 'In the past, Lloyd's has been a very great
help in bridging the gap between income and expenditure,' said Hunter Blair,
who has been a Name since 1959. 'In the good old days we were doing very
well.'
Lloyd's provided a reliable and valuable flow of income - Pounds 17,000 in
1971, Pounds 26,000 in 1980 and Pounds 56,000 in 1989. However, Hunter Blair
suffered losses of Pounds 71,000 in 1991 and Pounds 56,000 last year, and he
expects his reserves to be cleared out this year.
He is far from bitter, and has no intention of leaving Lloyd's. 'I'm still
very grateful to Lloyd's, and I believe my agents when they say things are
going to improve. Without Lloyd's this place would have gone,' he said.
The losses have had an impact on his own portfolio, managed by Murray
Johnstone. Three to four years ago, the portfolio stood at Pounds 350,000;
it is now down to Pounds 225,000, of which the Lloyd's deposit element is
Pounds 175,000. Murray Johnstone has put the maximum investment each year
into personal equity plans, which it runs as an integral part of the
portfolio. The Pep portfolio itself stands at Pounds 50,000.
Hunter Blair, who says he has never had much aptitude for, or interest in,
money, has been happy to leave investment decisions to Murray Johnstone. The
only time he intervened was to suggest buying shares in Christie's, the
auction house, for which he used to be the Ayrshire representative for many
years. 'It's the only time I've suggested anything to them. They kept saying
they aren't low enough, but since they've bought them, they've done very
well,' he says.
'The other thing I've got is that my grandmother very kindly left me a big
trust,' says Hunter Blair, who is the life income tenant of the trust, which
is also managed by Murray Johnstone and is worth about Pounds 500,000.
It is invested in blue-chip companies such as General Electric, British
Aerospace, BTR and British Gas. Three or four years ago a small percentage
of the fund was put into the income shares of split-capital investment
trusts, such as Jos Holdings, to meet the need for additional income. Most
of the fund is invested in the UK, though there is a holding in the Pacific
rim through Murray Johnstone's own Scottish Asian fund.
Hunter Blair shared his father's love of art, and the two built up a
collection over 30 years of Scottish colourists, including works by Cadell
and Peploe.
Some of the paintings have increased 100-fold in value. 'They were bought
because we liked them, and the capital appreciation has been an unlooked for
bonus,' says Hunter Blair.
Other investments included a number of with-profits endowment policies from
Equitable Life, which matured two years ago when Hunter Blair was 65 years
old. There are debts: the estate has run up an overdraft over the years of
Pounds 190,000. 'You'll never really get enough for a place like this. But
you just have to keep trying.'
He has some life insurance but no pension to speak of since, as he readily
admits, he does not need one thanks to his grandmother's trust:
'If I didn't have this place, I'd be frightfully well-off, wouldn't I?'

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Enjoy full tax
relief as you save to top up your retirement income - But remember that you
will not be able to get your hands on these additional investments until you
stop work. So a Pep or a Tessa could be an alternative / AVCs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ONLY ONE employee in 10 currently manages to build up a full company
pension, and as the trend towards more flexible career patterns and early
retirement continues, top-up provision is increasingly important.
Before looking at top-up arrangements it is essential to understand how your
company pension is calculated, and where a shortfall might arise.
Under a typical 'final salary' scheme, your pension builds at the rate of
1/60th of final salary for each year of service, up to a maximum of 40/60ths
or two-thirds of final salary. (Higher earners may be subject to a cap on
the maximum pension they can take into account for pension purposes.)
Pension gaps arise for various reasons. Many employees do not expect to work
a full 40 years, or they may be in a less generous scheme - for example, one
that builds up at a rate of 1/80th of final salary for each year of service.
Some employees receive a significant chunk of earnings as bonuses or
overtime, which may not be taken into consideration for the main scheme
contributions.
Women often end up with gaps in provision, usually due to career breaks to
raise a family, after which they tend to spend a further period in
part-time, non-pensionable employment. Job-changers who transfer their
pensions also suffer a shortfall, often finding that the 10 'years' they had
built up in the former scheme are worth only five 'years' in the new one.
This is due partly to the higher salary to which the new pension relates,
but also to the low assumptions used in the transfer-value calculation.
Finally, employees hoping to retire early must provide for the shortfall,
since in most cases they can expect a reduced pension if they leave before
the company scheme's normal pension age.
Once you have identified a gap, it is time to look at top up arrangements.
There are two main pension options: additional voluntary contributions
(AVCs), which form part of the main company scheme; and free-standing AVCs
(FSAVCs) which are sold independently on an individual basis by the life
offices and several unit trust groups.
AVCs and FSAVCs are the most tax-efficient method of boosting your company
pension, because they attract full tax relief on contributions. The fund
also enjoys tax-free growth, and, for those who started an AVC before 1987,
it may be possible to take part or all of the fund as tax-free cash.
But it is important to remember that you will not be able to get your hands
on these investments until you retire. If you want a more flexible
investment, you might consider a tax-exempt special savings account (Tessa)
or personal equity plan (Pep), both of which offer more limited tax
advantages but do not lock your money away until retirement.
AVCs and FSAVCs can only be taken out by employees who are members of an
occupational pension scheme. The self-employed and those in non-pensionable
employment can invest in personal pensions.
Employees can contribute up to 15 per cent of salary to their main pension
and AVC scheme combined. Since most schemes require a contribution of about
5 per cent, this leaves plenty of scope for topping up. Employers cannot
contribute to your AVC.
Life offices dominate the market for both company AVCs and FSAVCs. However,
as a general rule of thumb, the company AVC scheme is likely to prove
simpler to operate and offer better value. This is because the employer
handles all the administration and usually covers some, if not all, of the
charges made by the provider.
Moreover, tax relief is awarded immediately at the individual's highest
rate, whereas, under an FSAVC, basic-rate relief is awarded at source but
higher-rate relief must be claimed through the individual's end-of-year tax
return.
Most company AVCs are run on a money-purchase basis - that is, your
contributions build up in a fund which is used to buy an annuity. Some
companies - particularly those in the public sector - provide 'added years'
to the main company pension.
Since April 1987, there have been no minimum requirements on the length of
time you have to contribute to an AVC scheme and, since 1989, any excess
contributions above your maximum permitted pension have been refunded less a
tax charge.
In the past, AVCs could be taken as tax-free cash, provided this did not
exceed the Inland Revenue maximum. However, where contributions started
after April 6, 1987, this option ceased to apply, and the AVC fund must be
used to purchase an annuity.
Free-standing AVCs were introduced in October 1987, and offer most of the
features of a company AVC scheme but with several important differences. In
particular, since the contract is between the employee and the provider, the
individual has to bear all the provider's charges. However, provided
contributions do not exceed Pounds 2,400 per annum, the employer does not
need to know you are paying FSAVCs - a feature that might be attractive if
you are discreetly funding for early retirement and don't want your boss to
know.
But undoubtedly the most attractive aspect of FSAVCs is investment choice.
Most company schemes offer just one or two AVC investment options - usually
a building society deposit fund and a with-profits fund. Yet there are about
100 providers of FSAVCs, offering a range of about 250 funds in total.
If you decide to opt for an FSAVC, do make sure the policy is flexible. For
example, you may need to reduce or stop contributions for a while if money
gets tight, so it is important to check there are no hidden penalties on
changes to contribution frequency or amount.
Finally, always ask what will happen to the policy if you leave your job and
become self-employed or go to a company where there is no employer sponsored
scheme. A good contract will allow you to switch to a personal pension plan
without charge.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Charges have a
big impact on returns - Research reveals that, over the long term, you
actually pay more in commission if you opt for a series of single premium
payments, rather than a regular-premium plan / How to buy it?
</HEADLINE>

MOST INVESTORS automatically take a hard look at a provider's performance
record before parting with their cash, but it is now widely recognised that
life office management charges and commission paid to advisers also have a
significant impact on the overall return.
Unfortunately, with most personal pension plans it is not easy to work out
what you are being charged. Much will depend on the way you pay for your
advice and the choice of premium arrangement.
Advisers come in various guises, but the majority still work on a commission
basis whereby they are remunerated by the provider on the sale of a product.
The amount of the commission will depend on the product type, the investment
term, the level of contribution, and whether this is paid on a regular basis
or as a single premium.
Commission rates have gone up by between 30 per cent and 50 per cent since
1989 when the Maximum Commissions Agreement (MCA) was abandoned. The MCA was
an agreement between providers to set a maximum ceiling for commission to
independent advisers, to encourage them to select products on merit rather
than on remuneration.
Since the MCA's demise in 1989, many life offices have also abandoned the
10-year limit on renewal commission and now pay this throughout the entire
term. Renewal commission is relatively modest compared with initial
commission, but nevertheless adds to your total costs.
Regular premiums - whether monthly or annual - make good sense, because they
establish a savings discipline for those with regular earnings. However,
once agreed, the premium level must be adhered to, otherwise you might face
penalties.
Single premiums suit the self-employed or those with erratic earnings who do
not want to lock into a regular payment commitment.
One of the common mistakes investors make is to assume that it is always
'cheaper' to pay single premiums, since these contributions attract a
commission rate of 5.2 per cent. But it is important to remember that this
deduction is made on every premium, whereas the commission costs of regular
plans only appear higher because the bulk of the payment for the entire term
is paid up-front and therefore has a dramatic affect on your early
contributions.
The commission on a regular-premium plan, whether monthly or annual, is
usually paid to the adviser as a lump sum when the sale is made. The
provider then recoups this amount from your premiums during an 'initial'
period of up to 27 months on long-term pension plans. Typically, this can
account for 60 per cent or more of premiums paid during this period; which
is why, if you terminate your plan early, the pot is virtually empty.
However, after the initial period, ongoing costs should be very modest.
Research by Professional Life reveals that, over the long term, you will
actually pay more in commission if you opt for a series of single premium
payments. Take, for example, a Pounds 100 per month or Pounds 1,200 a year
regular-premium plan, and compare it with a series of single premiums of
Pounds 1,200 a year. All result in a total investment of Pounds 48,000 after
40 years.
For the regular-premium method, the total commission after 40 years is
Pounds 2,010, whereas the single-premium route pays total commission of
Pounds 2,496 after this period. As a percentage of your total investment,
the single-premium commission works out at 5.2 per cent, while the
regular-premium commission works out at approximately 4.2 per cent.
So, if you intend to stick with a personal pension plan, don't automatically
assume it is better value to go the single-premium route. However, what you
have to remember about the regular-premium plan is that, for any given term,
you actually pay most of the total commission during the 'initial period',
so your initial deductions are very high.
Jim Roberts, general manager at Professional Life, suggested that investors
should make their decisions in two separate stages:
'First, you need to decide how you want to invest. For example, do you need
the discipline of regular premiums, or would a series of single premiums
suit you better? Only when you have made that decision should you consider
how you are going to pay for the advice and look at how to achieve the best
value.'
For the average investor, Mr Roberts reckons regular monthly premium
arrangements are the safer approach. He explained:
'The important benefit of regular plans is what's known as 'pound cost
averaging'. Since your premiums continue to be invested when unit prices are
low, you benefit from the cheaper costs, and this helps offset the higher
price of units when the stock market is booming. Single-premium payments
must be timed carefully, to avoid the common mistake of only investing when
the stock market is doing well.'
Once you have decided the frequency with which you want to pay your
premiums, you can look at the various ways of paying for your advice. Each
method has its drawbacks and should be discussed in full with your adviser.
Fee-based advice is growing in popularity, because it separates the giving
of advice from the sale of a product. However, fees usually attract a VAT
charge, while commission does not. Also, since commission is deducted from
your premiums, it benefits from the tax relief awarded to all contributions
to approved pension plans. Clearly there is no tax relief on fees. A
minority of providers, like Professional Life, allow the adviser and client
to determine a fee and then deduct this in the form of commission to avoid
the VAT and tax-relief problems.
Some advisers are prepared to rebate part of the commission paid by the
provider. However, these payments can cause tax problems, and many advisers
recommend that their client reinvests the commission they have agreed to
forego, to avoid this complication.
Of course, the commission to the adviser is only one of your costs when you
sign up for a personal pension. Life office charges can be considerable, and
unfortunately in most cases are virtually impossible to assess. Clive
Grimley, senior manager at actuaries and fee based advisers Gissings, said:
'There is a whole range of charges to take into account. For example, the
bid/offer spread which knocks about 5 per cent off your fund. Then there are
'initial', or 'capital', units, which account for the first few years'
premiums and on which higher charges are levied throughout the term of the
policy. On top of that, there are annual management charges, policy charges,
membership charges, fund management charges . . . the list goes on and on.'
So what can the consumer do to avoid the worst excesses of the system? The
most important point is to get expert advice, to help you select a policy
that is good value as well as flexible when it comes to early retirement
without penalty, for example.
Above all, however you plan to pay for your advice, make sure your adviser
is truly independent and has enough expertise to conduct research on all the
top providers. The adviser should be conversant with each provider's
charging structure and should be able to strike up a deal to offset some of
the charges and, where appropriate, to reinvest commission or arrange
non-commission terms.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): The last lap
is the toughest - Eventually everyone who has contributed for a personal
pension must make the crucial decision: where, on the open market, to buy
the annuity that will provide them with the best possible income / Options
at retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE CRUCIAL time for an investor saving for retirement through a personal
pension comes not at the outset or during the savings period, but when the
benefits are due.
For it is then that he or she must decide in what form to take them. And
since flexibility is one of the key features of personal pensions, a variety
of choices is available.
There are two types of personal pension which investors may hold: the
new-style personal pensions; and the old-style retirement annuity contracts
(also known as Section 226 contracts).
Retirement annuity contracts ceased to be marketed in 1988, when the new
personal pensions came on the market. But investors holding them can still
pay contributions into the contract and take the benefits. And it is
important for holders to understand the differences in benefit between the
old- and new-style personal pensions.
Basically, with new-style personal pensions, benefits can be taken at any
time between the investor's 50th and 75th birthdays (both dates inclusive).
Up to 25 per cent of the value of the benefits can be taken as a tax-free
cash sum; the remainder must be used to buy a pension annuity from a life
company.
With a retirement annuity contract, the benefits can be taken between the
investor's 60th and 75th birthdays (again, both dates inclusive). The
maximum that can be taken as a tax-free cash sum is based on a complicated
formula - it must not exceed three times the remaining annual amount of the
annuity. If a represents the annuity rate per unit of investment, then the
maximum proportion of the benefits that can be taken as a cash sum (c) may
be expressed algebraically as c = 3a/(1+3a).
Thus, the higher the value of the annuity, the greater the proportion of the
benefits that can be taken as a tax-free cash sum. Since annuity rates
increase with the age of the investor, the later the investor takes the
benefits, the greater the proportion that can be taken in cash.
On the current annuity rates from Equitable Life, for a Pounds 100,000
value, the proportions that can be taken in cash by a man are: 26 per cent
at age 60; 28 per cent at age 65; 31 per cent at age 70; and 35 per cent at
age 75. These are higher than the 25 per cent available under a personal
pension, and investors have every incentive to defer cashing-in as long as
possible.
For women, the proportions are lower. Indeed, for a women aged 60, the
proportion is 23.8 per cent - below that for a personal pension. In such
cases, the investor converts from a retirement annuity contract to a
personal pension, and then cashes in.
Also, if investors wish to take their benefits before their 60th birthday,
they can always switch their retirement annuity contract into a personal
pension. But the switch cannot be reversed.
This leads to the next choice for investors, known as the 'open market
option'. When the investor cashes in his contract, he can take the value and
buy his annuity from any life company he wishes. He does not have to buy it
from the life company with which he originally took out the personal
pension.
As may be seen from the annuity tables published regularly in the FT, the
amount of annuity secured by a given cash sum varies considerably between
life companies.
Since every investor, in theory at least, wishes to secure as much income as
possible from the accumulated value of his personal pension, one would
expect the open-market option to be exercised every time an investor
cashes-in the contract. In practice, it is exercised in only a minority of
cases, despite the fact that it is comparatively easy to find out which life
companies are currently offering the highest annuity rates.
One reason is ignorance of the option's existence. Tied agents, representing
just one life company, cannot deal in any product of another life company,
so they cannot help their clients to exercise the option, only point out
that it exists.
But even when investors are made aware of the option, all too often they are
too apathetic to exercise it. They want to deal with the life company with
which they have been saving for years, and are wary of dealing with another,
even if it may be financially advantageous.
But there is a more practical reason why so many investors are not
exercising the open-market option.
With new-style personal pensions, there is no problem in exercising it
However, most investors currently taking benefits are doing so from
retirement annuity contracts, and the Inland Revenue has made it
impracticable for most of them to exercise the option.
If the investor takes the value on a retirement annuity contract and buys an
annuity from a life company other than the one which issued the contract,
the Revenue deems that the investor has transferred his retirement annuity
contract to a new-style personal pension with the other life company, and so
the tax free cash sum is limited to 25 per cent.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): Keep your
nerve when bonuses fall - Some advisers favour the unit-linked alternative.
Others say that, in a period of low inflation, returns are bound to drop /
With-profits plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH-PROFITS funds historically have formed the backbone of the individual
pensions market, but recent concerns over the risk profile of these
products, bonus cuts, and the heavy-handed use of early-termination
penalties, have prompted some advisers to recommend alternative
arrangements, particularly to new investors.
The original concept of the with-profits fund, which is invested primarily
in equities, property and fixed interest, is to smooth returns by holding
back some of the profits during the years of plenty to maintain a reasonable
rate of return during the lean years.
Premiums invested secure a modest but guaranteed fund - the 'sum assured' -
which is paid when the policy matures. On top of this sum assured, profits
are distributed to policyholders through the bonus system.
Annual or 'reversionary' bonuses, once allocated, are also guaranteed, and
for many years the combination of these bonuses plus the sum assured formed
the bulk of the final pay-out, when the investor's fund is used to buy an
annuity which in turn provides the pension payments.
On top of these two elements, there is a final or 'terminal' bonus, which is
completely discretionary and reflects the long-term capital appreciation of
the with-profits fund not previously passed on through annual bonuses.
In this respect, the terminal bonus is more akin to the unit-linked concept,
where the return to the investor is directly linked to the performance of
the underlying fund. Originally the terminal bonus represented the icing on
the cake for with-profits policies, but today typically this element
accounts for over 50 per cent of the total pay-out. Clearly, this is a major
change to the risk profile of with-profits products.
Moreover, following a period of excessively high bonus declarations during
the late 1980s, many providers have started to cut bonus rates dramatically.
This is one reason why consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow are not recommending
with-profits to new investors for the next few years. Bacon &amp; Woodrow also
believes that with-profits plans are not sufficiently flexible in terms of
early retirement, for example, and that these products do not offer
competitive charging structures.
Another important trend of recent years has been the introduction of
'unitised' with-profits plans. The unitised plan does not offer a basic sum
assured with a guaranteed minimum return to maturity. Instead, the product
offers a guaranteed return for each 12-month period, thus diluting the
long-term guarantees traditionally associated with this product, while
simultaneously reducing the pressure on life office reserves.
One of the main problems with the unitised plan is the notorious 'market
value adjuster'. This device is meant to protect the provider in the event
of a run on funds following a downturn in the markets. But in practice it
gives providers a free hand to reduce the value of funds when a contract is
terminated early.
Roy Brimblecombe, partner in charge of the insurance practice at consultants
Clay &amp; Partners, warned investors to check carefully the likely impact of
the market value adjuster on early retirement. 'It's vital that providers
make their policy clear on this point. At present their approach is very
subjective,' he said.
Investors worried about these trends in the with-profits market should avoid
making any panic decisions. Mr Brimblecombe stressed that it was important
not to assume all providers would be equally badly hit by bonus cuts. 'Each
provider should be examined in detail, and its bonus declaration should be
compared with its return on the underlying assets,' he said.
Angela Cooper, manager, technical research, at consultants Noble Lowndes,
added: 'The important point is to look at the real rate of return provided
by with-profits policies. Unlike the 1980s, we are in a period of low
inflation, and returns will drop accordingly. In the short term, despite the
bonus cuts, with-profits might still provide a satisfactory rate of real
return, particularly when compared with the low-risk alternatives such as
cash and fixed interest.'
Clive Grimley, senior manager with consultants Gissings, stressed that
existing investors should maintain their with-profits plans. 'Certainly, if
you have had a with-profits plan for some years, you should maintain it, and
it may even be appropriate to increase premiums. However, those thinking of
making new investments, particularly if it is in the run up to retirement,
should consider alternative arrangements.'
Mr Grimley highlighted the importance of seeking expert help on the choice
of funds under unit-linked plans. Most advisers tend to recommend managed
funds, but a closer comparison with the risk profile of the with-profits
funds can be found elsewhere.
He said: 'For short-term, low-risk pension investment, we might recommend
the following allocation to unit linked funds: 20 per cent in property, 20
per cent in deposit and 60 per cent in a range of gilts, fixed interest,
index-linked and convertibles.'
Finally, Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of Bacon &amp; Woodrow's partnership
pensions section, outlined his investment philosophy: 'We take the view that
equities will be the best performing asset class in the long term. The
property and fixed-interest elements of with-profits funds are therefore
likely to act as a drag on performance. Consequently, investment in well
managed, equity-based unit-linked funds is likely to produce returns
superior to most with-profits funds in the long term.'
B&amp;W's own research concluded that there were four managed unit-linked
personal pension providers currently offering the best combination of
performance, good administration, sound financial strength and a low
charging structure free of hidden penalties. These were: Rothschild Asset
Management (a unit trust product), Standard Life, National Mutual and
Scottish Widows.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Now the early
leaver has a chance to take it with him - The choice may lie between the
guaranteed benefits of an old company scheme and the unknown ones of a life
company contract / Transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NO ASPECT of pensions has caused more problems, or aroused greater
controversy, than transfers out of a company final-salary scheme into a
life-company contract, whether a protected-rights personal pension or a
Section 32 buy-out contract.
Most people who change jobs, or leave their employer for a variety of
reasons, including redundancy, face the decision of whether or not to
transfer. This is the so-called 'early leaver problem'.
Until a few years ago, someone leaving an employer was treated rather
harshly. No allowance was made for the effect of inflation on the deferred
pension, and the transfer-value calculation was stringent.
But, following legislation, the position of the early leaver has improved.
He now has the choice of either leaving benefits in the old scheme, or
taking the cash equivalent of his deferred pension (known as the transfer
value) and investing it in another pension arrangement.
If he chooses the first option, the benefits take the form of a deferred
pension, plus a spouse's pension, payable from the scheme's normal pension
age.
The initial value of a deferred pension is based on the employee's salary
and his years of membership of the scheme at the time of leaving. But each
year up to the retirement date, it is revalued in line with the rise in the
retail price index, up to a maximum of 5 per cent a year. Once the pension
becomes payable, the usual increases applicable to the scheme will be paid.
A spouse's benefit would also be payable.
If the latter alternative is chosen, the employee can take the transfer
value and invest it in - either his new employer's scheme (if there is one),
or in a pension contract from a life company - either a protected-rights
personal pension or a section 32 buy-out.
The choice is the employee's, and it is not an easy one. To start with, many
people do not understand the situation, and company schemes often fail to
provide a simple explanation, as is confirmed by the experience of the
Occupational Pensions Advisory Service.
Pension scheme administrators are wary of providing more than very broad
general advice, in case they contravene the Financial Services Act.
Consequently, employees need expert, impartial advice. This must come from
the life assurance intermediaries, including independent financial advisers,
tied agents and direct sales forces. There is no shortage of such advice,
but much of it is neither expert nor unbiased.
Essentially, the employee has to decide between: the guaranteed benefits
provided by his old company scheme; and the unknown, but possibly higher,
benefits provided by a life company contract, which depend very much on the
underlying investment performance and annuity rates at the time of
retirement.
In reaching his decision, he must also assess how secure the company scheme
is. Recent events have shown that many, wound up because a company has gone
into liquidation, are under-funded. And deferred pensions are at the end of
the queue when benefits are allocated from limited resources. The benefits
from a company scheme may not be as guaranteed as they appear.
Certain life companies will quote, on certain assumptions, the investment
return needed, so that the benefits of the personal pension match the
company pension scheme benefits. But employees and their advisers have to
decide whether the life company can achieve a higher return, perhaps over
several years. Illustrations on transfer values provided by Lautro, the
regulatory body, are liable to mislead the layman.
Whatever selection is made, the employee is taking a risk with his transfer,
so that one task for the intermediary should be to ensure that he
understands these risks and is prepared to accept them.
Both Lautro and Fimbra have issued guidance notes to their members, to be
followed when advising on transfers, but these may not always be adhered to.
In particular, intermediaries tend to gloss over the positive aspects of
leaving the benefits in the company scheme, while highlighting the dangers.
Maxwell was the best sales aid for an intermediary who wants to push
transfers - as was seen when intermediaries persuaded redundant miners to
transfer from the British Coal pension scheme - one of the most secure,
providing very favourable deferred pensions - to the insecurity of a life
company pension contract.
However, employees do not have to make up their minds at the time of leaving
an employer. They can leave their benefits in the old scheme and transfer
later, at any time up to a year before normal pension age. So there is no
need to be rushed by enthusiastic, commission-hunting intermediaries.
But delay can mean that, if the employee does eventually invest in a life
company pension contract, there is less time for the underlying fund to
grow. And although this should be offset by increases in the transfer value,
as pension age approaches, the value is also subject to short-term
fluctuations.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Not everyone
can win in the real world - A scheme to allow retirement benefits to be
taken in stages is exciting salesmen. However, the drawbacks need to be
clearly understood / Staggered vesting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STAGGERED VESTING, or phased annuities, is sweeping through the personal
pension field. Every life company and intermediary is taking advantage of
this latest fashion, to boost new business and secure commissions well into
the future, when other sources of business are drying up.
The concept has been developed from the original idea of using the
flexibility of personal pensions to phase in an individual's retirement. As
such, the concept is attractive, but it needs to be correctly applied, and
the drawbacks understood.
But salesmen's hype in promoting staggered vesting is presenting it as a
'win-win situation' all round - a condition that rarely exists in the real
world.
When an individual takes his benefits under a personal pension contract, the
usual procedure is to take the maximum cash and buy an annuity with the
balance. If he is looking beyond the value of the first month's payment, the
annuity will be an increasing annuity with a 50 per cent spouse's pension,
and with payments guaranteed for five years.
The individual will be forced to accept the level of annuity rates at the
time of taking the benefits - currently low, because interest rates are low.
In addition, only the lump-sum element is available to pass on to the next
generation.
This is a very rigid approach, and does not use the flexibility of benefits
available with personal pensions. But staggered vesting makes maximum use of
it, by taking the benefits bit by bit over a number of years, leaving the
balance of the fund to continue to grow.
The table shows how this concept works for a man aged 60.
A target income is set for the first year. This can be any value the
individual desires, but in presentations it is the annuity secured by the
full fund at age 60. The annuity payments increase at a certain rate, are
guaranteed for a minimum period and contain a spouse's pension.
This target income is secured by cashing in sufficient of the contract, so
that the tax-free cash sum plus the net amount from the annuity equals the
net target income. The amount to be cashed in can be ascertained by solving
a straightforward equation.
The annuity bought is usually a level one on the life of the individual,
though ideally it ought to be an increasing one. But usually no spouse's
benefit is provided.
The balance of the contract continues to accumulate.
The process is repeated in the second and subsequent years - the existing
net annuities, plus the tax-free cash sum and the new net annuity, equals
the net target income.
At age 75, the remaining value of the contract has to be cashed in - the
maximum cash sum is taken, and an annuity bought with the balance. This
annuity would contain a spouse's benefit, if required. If the investment
performance is sufficiently high, the fund should drop for six successive
years, and then start to climb again until age 75, as seen from table 1.
Under these circumstances, the investor has won hands-down from staggered
vesting. He has had the same net income up to age 75 as would have been
purchased at outset, and a higher income thereafter plus a cash sum. Had he
died before age 75, the balance of the fund would have been available for a
spouse's pension or passed on to the next generation.
However, if the investment performance is dull, there is a danger that the
fund will just continue to fall and be used up before age 75.
The tables are prepared on the Lautro illustration basis, using the higher
investment rate of 13 per cent and the lower rate of 8.5 per cent. At 8.5
per cent, in Table 2, the fund just reaches age 75 - making 8.5 per cent the
break-even rate.
In September, the Lautro illustration basis will be changed to 6 per cent
and 12 per cent. On this new basis, a more realistic picture will be
presented to investors.
At 6 per cent return on the fund, it will be used up before age 75, and a
different picture will emerge.
This highlights the crucial factors in a staggered vesting operation - the
fund return, and the levels of annuity rates.
The illustrations assume a steady, constant investment return each year. But
life is not like that. Investment returns vary considerably from year to
year, and pound-cost-averaging works against the investor when cashing-in
units.
Indeed, if investment returns are negative in a year, the number of units
that have to be cashed-in rises considerably, eating deeply into the fund.
This does not mean that an individual should not phase out his cash-ins by
staggered vesting, but that it cannot be pre-planned for several years
ahead. The individual must be flexible in his planning, particularly in the
underlying investments. Some of the units should be held in cash, to cover
those negative returns. These points tend to be glossed over by
intermediaries.
So each plan should be tailor-made to the individual's own requirements and
reviewed each year, when it can be decided how much income is needed for the

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): At last the
tide is turning for ex-wives - Two legal cases and a government study group
offer new hope for women who face retirement in the wake of a broken
marriage / Divorce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN

<TEXT>
THE PENSIONS industry, assisted by the legal profession, has come to grips
with what too many divorcees realise only too late: that a pension, too, is
an asset accumulated during a marriage, and that both parties have a claim
on it.
Unfortunately, many wives have found themselves past retirement age with
nothing but minimum state benefits and whatever wealth they were able to
garner from a broken marriage.
There is general agreement that the status quo has been radically unfair to
many homemakers who had relied on their husband's income for support, and
counted on it into retirement.
But because of the ambiguities of the law - and perhaps through failure to
recognise a pension for what it really is - divorce lawyers have rarely
sought to divide pension entitlements when a marriage has come to an end.
Hence the shock-waves earlier this year from a case brought by the widow of
the former Tory MP, Sir Eldon Griffiths, who was left to face old age with
maintenance of just 5p a year. She successfully sued her lawyers for failing
to ensure that her husband's pension entitlement, built up over a 30-year
marriage, was divided between them. The Court agreed with Mrs Griffiths, and
awarded her a one-off Pounds 21,802 payment.
Another sign that the legal tide is turning in favour of ex-wives was
contained in a ruling a few weeks later, in a case identified only as B v B.
In this case, Mr Justice Ewbank, in the High Court, upheld a decision by a
district judge to alter the terms of a husband's pension, to give his former
wife an immediate annuity and a pension.
The case involved a 60-year-old man, who was entitled to receive his
pension, and his 50-year-old wife. The man held a 52 per cent stake in the
company he worked for, and pensions lawyers said the ruling had particular
implications for self-administered schemes in small companies, which may now
have to pay out annuities and pensions to wives when employees become
divorced.
But even if neither B v B nor Mrs Griffiths' settlement prompts a sea-change
in legal opinion, a landmark document on the subject certainly will.
In May, the Pensions Management Institute and the Law Society, after 15
months of laborious deliberation, produced a paper suggesting legal changes
which would confirm that pension entitlement accumulated during a marriage
is indeed jointly owned, just like any other long-term savings or
investment. They suggest four possible ways of dividing pension entitlement
which, among other things, would allow pension fund trustees, for the first
time, to direct payments to someone other than the scheme member.
The division of pension rights after a divorce is also one of 81 questions
under consideration by a government advisory panel on pension reform,
chaired by Professor Roy Goode. Pensions lawyers expect the PMI/Law Society
recommendations to be incorporated into the Goode Committee's final
recommendations.
The report of the PMI and the Law Society offers four possible scenarios for
the division of pension rights following divorce. The advantages of each
would depend on the circumstances of the divorcing couple:
Pension rights might continue undisturbed, but their value be taken into
account. Any reallocation of resources between the couple would be made by
adjustment of non-pension assets.
Pension rights might be 'earmarked', so that they continue undisturbed
during the working spouse's employment, but, once the payment date becomes
effective, a portion of the benefit would be automatically directed to the
other spouse.
Pension benefits might be split within a scheme, so that the scheme member's
rights are reduced by a specified amount and resources from the scheme
released to provide, within the scheme, a package of benefit rights for the
former spouse, as though she or he had been a full scheme member as well.
Through the use of pension transfers, a scheme member's pension rights might
be reduced, and the difference used to provide a transfer value to be
shifted to an alternative scheme on behalf of the former spouse.
The study group recommends the last method as the most attractive, because
it leaves room for a clean-break divorce settlement and imposes relatively
little administrative expense on pension schemes.
The first method is currently in use in Scotland, where the courts have
already come to grips with the concept that pension entitlement accrued
during a marriage is a jointly-held asset. However, there are difficulties
associated with reliance on this method alone.
The solution is only workable where there are sufficient assets other than
pension entitlement. In cases where there are substantial jointly held
savings or investments, for instance, a husband may surrender a portion of
the investment which he is entitled to, in lieu of a wife's agreement to
forego pension benefits of equivalent value.
But when other assets are not available - or where they may be illiquid,
such as a family home in which an ex-wife and dependent children are living
 -this form of pension settlement is less satisfactory.
Of all the pension issues facing the lawmakers, the division of pensions
upon divorce is hardly the thorniest nor the most commercially sensitive.
Yet it is among the areas of greatest concern to one of society's most
vulnerable groups, elderly women.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Costs and
salesmen under scrutiny - The product has a place in government strategy,
but a way needs to be found to protect accrued benefits from a collapse in
the value of equities at the moment of retirement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PERSONAL PENSIONS, with over 5m plan holders, have helped Britain's
insurance industry through a recession that has seen a sharp drop in sales
of other long-term savings products.
More significantly, they have become a critical part of long-term government
strategy - an alternative to expensive social security provision. Options
under consideration include tax incentives to encourage individuals to opt
out of the state basic pension scheme in favour of personal plans. Ministers
are also said to have quietly discussed the possibility of replacing the
earnings-related elements of state social security provision with personal
pension-type arrangements, producing a lump sum on retirement.
On the other hand, the government seems to be restructuring tax advantages
for pensions in other ways. For instance, for the current fiscal year it has
frozen the maximum amount that high earners can contribute towards their
pension each year. It has also reduced the amount of advance corporation tax
paid on dividends, which occupational schemes are allowed to reclaim from
the Treasury.
Other European governments continue to envy Britain the success of her
personal pensions industry, and are adapting versions of it in their battle
to hold down social security costs. Yet at home, the virtues of personal
pensions have undergone close scrutiny from regulators, the financial press
and public policy think-tanks. The question is whether this will slow the
pace of sales, or force the industry to rethink the way it has designed the
product.
The antics of salesmen, who profited by persuading redundant coal miners to
opt out of their attractive occupational scheme and into a less beneficial
personal pension, for instance, have put pressure on financial services
regulators to get tough. Paul Trickett, secretary to the Mineworkers Pension
Scheme, said that over Pounds 400m had been transferred out of the scheme
and into personal pensions in the past two years: 'We estimate that sales
agents have earned some Pounds 20m in commissions from coal miners (in that
time).'
Such reports have prompted regulators to issue guidelines on the sale of
personal pensions, under which occupational scheme members are for the most
part off-limits.
Meanwhile, the costs of personal pensions have also come under public
examination. A report by the left-of-centre Institute for Public Policy
Research, for instance, recently showed that the cost of administering
schemes was roughly four times the figure for state schemes - a level
sufficiently high to discourage reliance on personal schemes as an
alternative to state benefit.
Even the Department of Social Security, which has championed personal
pensions, is concerned. Earlier this year, it told the the self-regulatory
bodies that oversee the sale of personal pensions to ensure that firms
properly advise policyholders of the effects of changes to tax law. The
changes, which will curtail the National Insurance rebates offered to
personal pension holders who opt out of the State Earnings-related Pension
Scheme (Serps), could cause many of those clients to discontinue or abandon
their contributions, cutting profits for life insurance companies.
Also, industry data suggest that as much as a half to two-thirds of personal
pension plans in Britain are 'rebate only'. This means that the only
contribution made into them is the NI rebate, and implies that little
additional long-term saving has been prompted by the government's massive
expenditure. Anne Widdecombe, pensions minister until the Cabinet reshuffle
in May, admits that the data are causing unease in government circles.
Moreover, the government has curbed some of the tax advantages to those who
opt out of Serps via a personal pension from this April, and has said that
it will overhaul the system from April 1996.
Miss Widdecombe has said that the government plans a system of age-related
rebates of NI contributions, in place of the current flat-rate rebate
system. At the moment, relatively large rebates to young people enable them
to buy more benefits for themselves with a private pension than they could
if they remained in Serps. But by the time individuals reach their mid-40s
the rebates are too small to be attractive, and policyholders would be well
advised to opt back into Serps, curbing the cost savings to the taxpayer.
Earlier this year, the government's own actuary produced figures showing
that rebates will have to fall steadily during the next decade; so that, by
early in the new century, NI rebates will be too small to encourage any but
those under 30 years of age to opt out of Serps.
The prospect of changes in tax structure could force the industry to abandon
sales efforts aimed at younger people, and concentrate on older workers, who
will have a much larger tax allowance to invest in a personal pension
scheme.
The rethinking of sales tactics is but one of the challenges facing the
industry. 'The greatest shortcoming in personal pensions is the volatility
in the final value of the pension,' said Stewart Ritchie, pensions director
at Scottish Equitable. These values generally rise and fall with stock
market prices, and those who retire in a bear market may be badly off.
High on the agenda is the need to devise an investment strategy that
protects accrued benefits from a collapse in the value of equities - the
largest asset sector - shortly before an individual's retirement date.
'Consider two people whose retirement is separated by Black Monday of
October 1987,' said Ron Spill, director of pensions at Legal and General.
'The difference in the value of their pensions is 20 per cent.'
If personal pensions, or other individual provision, are to become the
bedrock of government social security policy, then those who sponsor the
plans will have to find ways to build in the kind of security offered by
employers' defined-benefit schemes.
Indeed, Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, has called for
personal pensions to guarantee a minimum level of benefit on retirement.
Such a guarantee would require a re-think of both pricing and investment
strategy.
Meanwhile, providers will have to consider the effects on the annuities
market of a ruling, shortly to be issued by the European Court of Justice,
on equal benefits in occupational schemes. The test case, brought by male
and female pension scheme members of Coloroll, the home furnishings company
now in liquidation, has already prompted the ECJ's advocate general to
comment that employers may not buy annuities for men which make monthly
payments higher than those to women. Since women tend to live longer,
current sex-based annuity rates mean they can expect to receive less each
month for an annuity purchased for the same amount.
While the ruling says nothing about personal pensions, it could force
Britain's insurance industry to abandon sex-related annuity rates
altogether, as has happened in the US following a similar Supreme Court
ruling. Such a move could lead to a rethink of personal pension contribution
rates as well as product design.
The industry, created by a government determined to see its social security
expenditure curbed, and nurtured by insurers anxious for new products, is at
a crossroads. While it has firmly fixed itself in the minds of policymakers
and the public as a suitable means of retirement provision, it remains to be
seen whether it will become the bedrock of old-age income.
The question is whether the personal pensions industry can respond swiftly
to the public clamour for changes in sales tactics, cost structure and
product design.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Famous faces
sparkle at the stroke of a pen - Corporate enthusiasts set the pace in the
market for signed photographs, but an interesting collection can still be
established for less than Pounds 1,000 / Alternative Investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AUTOGRAPHS HAVE long been one of the most popular fields of collection. Last
year it was estimated that there were 3 million enthusiasts in the US, and
there are probably as many in Europe.
Meanwhile, the past 25 years have seen the growth of an enormous parallel
market: the collection of photographs signed by the subject. Notable
collectors have included Luciano Pavarotti, Gore Vidal and Robert Woodruff,
the Coca-Cola magnate.
A watershed in the market occurred in 1972, with the sale in New York of the
collection belonging to the Rev Cornelius Greenway, a pastor and teacher who
had collected signed photos of a wide range of leading figures of the
century to inspire his pupils.
Widespread interest in signed photographs followed, and in 1980 the
collection of RED Rawlings, an eminent British enthusiast (ex-Indian Army
officer and son of a diplomat) was sold at Sotheby's.
The ensuing decade saw the arrival of the first big corporate collectors of
signed photos and related memorabilia, notably the Hard Rock Cafe. A number
of other companies, especially theme restaurant chains, have since entered
the market, the most notable recent arrival being Planet Hollywood.
The market for the collector of signed images is broad. An interesting
collection can still be established for an outlay of less than Pounds 1,000,
while many have been built from material which has not appeared at auction.
Most collectors select a personal theme - for example, film stars, royalty
or sport.
The portrait need not necessarily be a photograph. The earliest known signed
images, from the 1830s, are engravings or lithographs, which have a rarity
value in their own right because few have survived. The earliest readily
available signed photographs are cartes-de-visites and cabinet photographs,
dating from the 1840s. Many major subjects, including Dickens, Queen
Victoria, Lincoln and Ibsen, signed such items.
For a signed image of a leading subject, a collector will expect to pay from
Pounds 100 to over Pounds 2,000 at auction, especially if the item is by a
notable photographer. A signed Tennyson by Julia Margaret Cameron, for
example, would cost over Pounds 1,200.
Job lots of signed photographs or postcards are still available for as
little as Pounds 30 at auction. While these may be useful starters, such
things as made-up cards (where a cut-out picture is pasted down and signed)
and images with heavy adhesive marks to the reverse should be avoided.
Colour images are also avoided by some, because they can fade.
The most common images are those invented after 1910 - the publicity shot.
Rarely are these anything but straight portraits; the candid image only
arrived in the 1930s. Recent research has revealed masters of the stock
portrait, such as Hollywood photographer Clarence Sinclair Bull. His work
was featured last October in Bonham's pioneering sale, Hollywood Glamour.
Fine signed photographs of stars by such masters sell for between Pounds 80
and Pounds 1000.
From the 1950s, most images were produced by freelancers, rather than
studios. For example, McBean's image of Katherine Hepburn sells for between
Pounds 40 and Pounds 350 at auction.
All the major salerooms, and a number of provincial auctioneers offer signed
photographs amongst ephemera. The latter include T Vennett-Smith, of
Nottingham, and Strides in Chichester. There are also a number of specialist
dealers.
Certain details add value to the signed photograph. An inscription of
biographical or historical significance is one. Extremely rare examples of
Einstein, Lenin, Martin Luther King and Tsar Nicholas II exist, and would
command up to 100 times usual prices.
Dates are also important, and can invest an image with particular
significance. Early images of the likes of Clara Bow or Marlon Brando are
sought after, as they embody a particular era. There are exceptions, such as
Einstein, where our accepted image is fixed as that of an older man.
Churchill is a notable variant, photographs from any period are much sought
after (ranging from Pounds 250 to Pounds 1,100 ).
Provenance is another aspect of collection. Marilyn Monroe's photograph
dedicated to Sammy Davis Junior sold for over Dollars 5,000 in 1991. Group
signed photographs are also at a premium, and recent examples at auction
have included Russian cosmonauts, sold for Pounds 650 by T Vennett-Smith;
and Buddy Holly and the Crickets, sold by Phillips in April 1990 for Pounds
1,650. The huge popularity of some subjects prompted the issue of
photographs with secretarial, facsimile, rubber-stamp or autopen signatures.
Jean Harlow, Eisenhower, John Kennedy and the Beatles are well-known
examples.
All reputable dealers and auction houses will advise on provenance and
authenticity. Standard references, such as Harrison's Autographs, can help,
as can past sales catalogues. Other published sources include the
photographer Eisenstadt's Daybook, which his famous subjects signed after a
session.
The number of deliberate fakes or forgeries is low. But where larger sums
are involved, always seek expert advice. The quality of the photograph or
postcard can vary, and there will be a price differential between a signed
postcard and a signed original photograph. The difference for Chaplin, for
example is between 20 and 40 per cent.
Events, too, can significantly change values. Rare pictures of Ceaucescu,
the Romanian dictator, could be obtained for Pounds 1 before December 1989,
but the price has since reached Pounds 80 or more. Charles-and-Diana joint
signatures, valued at Pounds 210 in 1990, are worth looking out for.
Experience will reveal that rarities are sold quite often, because a
collector usually keeps only one image of a subject; so do not be tempted to
pay too much over the odds.
Film and pop personalities remain the most popular and collected subjects.
New film releases, or annual events such as the Oscar ceremonies, give
regular boosts to the market. Television never has quite the same appeal,
lacking the international market base given to film stars.
Among the up and coming areas are sport, opera and 20th century politics.
Sporting items have appeared in specialist sales for some time, and the
price of a leading subject, such as Rocky Marciano, has risen from Pounds
100 in 1989 to Pounds 350 in 1993. Fair sums have been paid in recent years
for political photographs - Gorbachev (Pounds 360), Khomeini (Pounds 1,100)
and Saddam Hussein (Pounds 305).
Among areas out of favour are 19th century worthies and music hall:
extensive collections can be bought for below Pounds 50, even where the
quality of the photographs may be very good.
Most people's collections still begin outside the saleroom, often built up
slowly from childhood by writing to famous people (who now appreciate a
stamped addressed envelope), or by encountering the famous in person. The
latter route is now rarer, particularly since John Lennon was murdered
shortly after signing an autograph for his assassin.
Many signed photographs are still kept in photo or autograph albums.
However, some modern plastic sleeves or self-adhesive sheets can do untold
damage to the image and lift off some signatures altogether. If not framed
and displayed away from direct sunlight, they are ideally kept singly in
acid-free envelopes in a dry, dark, relatively cool place. From time to time
they should be aired.
Where possible, signed mounts should not be separated from the image, and
photographs should not be handled except from the edges. Kept in good
condition, a collection can prove an excellent and interesting investment.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Far East is
favoured as US and UK look pricey - And the consensus is that Europe should
be avoided, except for safe havens like Switzerland / The Professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DEEP ECONOMIC troubles in Germany and pallid recovery in the US and Japan
have left our professionals tinkering in the mainstream markets, and putting
increasing faith in 'exotics' - like the markets of south-east Asia, and
even Mexico.
Recent, more confident, interest-rate cuts in Germany may mark a turn for
the better in Europe, but there can be no underestimating the trough that
leading economies such as Germany and France have dug themselves into. As
Howard Beaufort notes: 'Germany is in a dreadful mess. It is a capital goods
producer which has completely lost its competitiveness, whilst still
clinging to a pre-Thatcher style of labour organisation and social welfare.'
He and his fellow professionals will nevertheless be encouraged by belated
interest rate cuts. 'Only with low interest rates can Europe cure
Eurosclerosis, the vicious circle of under-investment, mass unemployment,
growing subsidies and exploding budget deficits,' comments Mr Beaufort.
The consensus appears to be that share prices in the UK and the US are
expensive, or at least fully valued; that the markets of continental Europe
should be avoided, except for 'safe havens' like Switzerland and the
Netherlands; that Japan remains expensive, with yen strength likely to hurt
company profits in the year ahead; and that the fundamental strength of the
markets of east and south-east Asia makes it essential to place a good share
of the portfolio there. Bonds are cautiously backed, but cash can play no
role.
At Baillie Gifford, Douglas McDougall has prospered by holding a quarter of
his portfolio in the markets of south-east Asia over the past half year. He
plans, this quarter, to trim this stake by 2 1/2 per cent to 22 1/2 per cent
 -'only reducing a sector of the portfolio where we are very overweight, and
which has done very well.' The sales are likely in Hong Kong, rather than
Malaysia or Singapore, 'in view of inflationary problems in China.'
The only other change in the portfolio is to boost his holding of long UK
government bonds from 7 1/2 to 10 per cent.
While he sees recovery well on the way in the UK, he feels share prices are
fully valued. In spite of 'grim' circumstances across Europe, he plans to
retain his 15 per cent stake, mainly in France, 'in deference to this
picture of falling interest rates and the still-ample levels of domestic
institutional and individual liquidity.'
Gartmore's Paul Myners is putting his faith in small companies, and is
shifting away from consumer stocks, which are now 'clearly under threat'. He
is shifting over to cyclical and industrial stocks in the principal markets
of the US, the UK and continental Europe. These 'are only just beginning to
rebuild volumes and margins after several years of decline,' he says.
He is maintaining his UK equity holdings, convinced that it is 'too late to
lose faith in UK stocks after recent consolidation', but is selling 5 per
cent out of the 15 per cent held in the US to buy Mexican shares - 'one new
investment idea' in a market that has fallen significantly in the past year,
which is very cheap (with price/earnings ratios as low as 9-times) and which
offers 'significant upside on the 12-month view.'
He feels his normally bearish view of gilts 'becomes harder to justify' as
real returns rise, and he shares with Baillie Gifford and Newton a
preference for UK gilts, and so is swapping a 4 per cent holding in French
bonds for gilts 'to repatriate some of our bond money, on risk grounds.'
At Newton, Howard Beaufort remains frustrated that recovery across Europe is
being held back by Germany's tight money policies, and concerned about
Britain's public sector borrowing needs - a 'colossus' which is not
sustainable: 'In this environment, we will continue to concentrate on a
relatively small universe of stocks able to deliver a reliable and
consistent stream of earnings and dividend increases.'
He nevertheless maintains a fundamental caution over equities at current
price levels: 'When p/e s reach the 20s and above on a global basis, and
equity yields fall below the 3 per cent level, equity investors have
historically caught a very bad cold - even pneumonia]'
The one exception remains east Asia, where 'medium to long term, one must
have a good proportion of one's assets.' In the US, where the economy is
moving ahead 'at a snail's pace', he shares with Paul Myners a preference
for the capital goods sector - 'the place to be on Wall Street'.
As a result of this caution over equities, he is 'taking out plenty of bond
insurance', where he says real yields of 5 per cent are achievable. He has
boosted his bond holdings from 15 per cent of the portfolio to 21 per cent,
purchasing new bonds in Japan and the UK.
Tim Howe, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, has shaved 2 per cent of his US equity
holding, essentially cashing in on the strength of the dollar, and plans
further disposals in the near future. He has added a cautious 1 per cent to
his European equity holdings, on hopes that the markets should gain from the
monetary stimulus that will come from lower interest rates.
He appears more confident about the UK market, which he says is 'comfortably
underpinned', and is planning to apply for many of the new issues likely to
come to the market in coming months. Otherwise, he favours economies 'with
dynamic growth' - that is, the Far East.
As the scope for interest-rate cuts evaporates in the US and the UK, he has
sold his US bonds. Instead, he has bought some peseta bonds: 'Although
further devaluations are quite likely, investors should see a satisfactory
return over the medium term.'
This feature is not a competition but an allocation exercise, to see how
four professional fund managers handle a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf
of a hypothetical client of their choice. The clients are assumed to be
either wealthy individuals or small self-administered pension funds.
The fund managers emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10
years or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started at the
beginning of October 1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up at the
beginning of this month, and will be reviewed at the end of September.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Low inflation
fosters long-dated attitudes - Several countries have pushed their PSBR to
the limit without obvious success. Unemployment continues to grow, and the
solution is to cut rates and stimulate growth / Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW years ago, the goal of every investor was bricks and mortar, and the
mantra was 'location, location, location'.
Now that building societies offer gross returns of around 5 per cent, many
more people are moving money to government bonds and the cry is 'duration,
duration, duration'.
With confidence in long-lasting low inflation growing, the perceived risk of
holding long-dated bonds declines, and investors are happier to roll their
holdings out to the long-dated maturities, which offer higher rewards when
interest rates fall, as they have been doing steadily in Europe for some
months.
The high-yielding European markets - Italy, Spain, Denmark and Portugal -
rallied sharply early last year. Investors were wooed by the convergence
argument, whereby interest rates in these countries were to come down
towards German levels. However, when the Danes voted against Maastricht on
June 2 last year, there was havoc in the bond markets. Investors piled into
D-Mark bonds and out of Italy and Spain.
Then, last September, the UK and Italy suspended their currencies from the
ERM. The UK cut rates aggressively and gilts returned to favour. Also,
Maastricht worries began to fade and the high-yielders returned to favour.
So far, no other country has removed its currency from the ERM, but the
tradition of following Germany's lead has come under pressure. In late June,
France cut short-term floor rates below those of Germany for the first time
in 26 years.
France is considered the only strong-currency nation within the ERM whose
currency is not tied to the D-Mark, and the spread between 10-year French
government bond and German Bund yields - the market's view of long-term
inflationary trends - has tumbled from almost a percentage point at the
beginning of the year to around 10 basis points.
Many economists have been waiting for French 10-year yields to fall below
their German equivalent. If that happens and the move is seen to be
sustainable, some argue that it will be a strong pointer to France replacing
Germany as the financial anchor within the European exchange rate mechanism.
After tense days of heated exchanges between the two nations, Germany cut
its key interest rates, reducing its upper limit Lombard rate by 0.25 point
to 8.25 per cent and its official floor rate by 0.5 point to 6.75 per cent.
That prompted a rash of monetary easing throughout mainland Europe.
The increasing trend to cut rates can be seen as a reflection of government
failures to lift their countries out of recession. Several countries,
notably the UK, have pushed their public sector borrowing requirements to
the limit without obvious success. Unemployment continues to grow and the
solution is to cut rates and stimulate growth.
Mr Philip Saunders, global bond fund manager at Guinness Flight, says:
'Countries have used up all their fiscal bullets on the charging rhino of
recession and failed to stop it. Now they have to resort to some fairly
heavy monetary artillery.'
Guinness Flight is concentrating its global bond investment on Europe, which
it gives a 70 per cent weighting. Almost half of that weighting goes to the
high-yielding markets in Spain and Italy, and 15 per cent goes to gilts.
Outside Europe, Guinness favours yen bonds over US Treasuries, which it sees
as carrying too high a risk except for the 30-year maturities which have
further room to fall.
On the other hand, Mercury Asset Management, which runs a Pounds 250m global
bond fund, the biggest in the UK, is a big fan of the UK, and has a quarter
of its allocation in gilts.
The UK offers especially attractive bond prospects. It is a very liquid
market, with the longest dated easily-tradeable maturities in Europe. The
traditional bogey remains of boom-bust economics and the accompanying sharp
inflationary spirals, but there is a belief that the situation may have
changed. Many feel that, although the UK is out of the ERM again, it is
effectively linked to European performance and that the low inflationary
trend is here to stay.
MAM's managing director, Mr David Rosier says: 'The government is not having
so much difficulty with its deficit as people think. Ten-year maturities are
yielding 8 per cent, and core inflation is around 3.5 per cent, so the real
yield is just under 5 per cent which is quite attractive.'
Elsewhere, MAM is keen on the US, not for the benefits of Treasury bonds but
for the attractions of the currency, and it has 16 per cent of its fund in
high-yielding Spanish bonds.
Fidelity, which has a Dollars 100m bond fund based in Luxembourg, as well as
a Pounds 37m UK-based bond fund, is also concentrating on Europe where it
has 52 per cent of its allocation. However, it has a relatively small
exposure to the UK, where it believes the rally is about to peak. It has a
much larger exposure to the US, about a third of the funds, on the basis of
a rising dollar.
In fact, the US has provided disturbing signals for the global bond
investor. Some specialists have interpreted recent inflationary flickers as
a sign that the bull run is about to flag and the world economy is stirring
into life again.
Those stirrings were dealt a blow by the OECD at the beginning of June, when
it cut its current year growth forecast for the 24 nations it covers by 0.7
per cent to 1.2 per cent.
Kemper Investment Management, which looks at the performance of 21 national
bond markets, says: 'Such a revision could only reinforce the near
three-year bull market in bonds.'

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Royal Jelly
looked tempting but the cautious investor said no - EIS at 375p and Allied
Colloids at 215p are the latest additions, as total return reaches 67 per
cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVEN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Review in January last year, I mentioned that I had considered the
portfolio taking a risky, quick in-and-out gamble on shares in Regina, the
Royal Jelly firm. It looks as if the company had made a turn-around in its
trading and financial position, yet at that time Regina shares were only
1.75p.
The portfolio had sufficient cash to buy 500,000 Regina shares. If it had
done so, it could, theoretically, have turned that Pounds 8,750 investment
into Pounds 45,000 by selling the shares earlier this year, when Regina
reached a high of 9p.
In reality, due to wide dealing spreads, the purchase price per share for
such a large number of shares might have been around 2.5p, instead of 1.75p;
and the price per share gained from selling them might only have been 8p.
Even so, a large profit would have been made in a relatively short time.
However, the portfolio, as mentioned in January 1992, cannot be too
speculative, and so did not buy any Regina shares.
In April this year, Regina reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 143,000 for
the six months to February 28, compared with a loss of Pounds 457,000 for
that period last year. Although Regina shares are now around 5.5p, I still
feel they are not for the cautious.
In the Review in April, I included William Ransom in the portfolio at 52p.
But on the Friday of publication they jumped 8p to 60p. As a matter of
record, my personal pension scheme first bought shares in that company in
March 1991, paying 40p per share.
My pension scheme did not sell a single Ransom share, even when the price
rose to 67p, nor when the shares fell back again. Indeed, the scheme still
retains its Ransom shares, as I believe the company has good prospects with
its pharmaceutical and plant extract activities.
I believe in moral responsibility. I mentioned in my quarterly article that
the scheme held Ransom shares, and I will always reveal in my articles any
position I may hold in any shares mentioned. For example, my pension scheme
currently includes holdings in Burlington, Norcros and Pentland. My dealings
in such shares are restricted to such times as it can be seen that any
profits made have not been purely as a result of mentioning the shares in an
article.
I could, of course, have decided not to include in the portfolio any shares
in companies in which I have an interest - but that so severely limits my
choice that the quarterly portfolio's performance would suffer. I am also
aware of the view that, if I find some interesting share situations, it
seems rather selfish not to mention some of them in my articles. But be
warned: I do not promise profits. No one is infallible. Any of the shares
mentioned in my articles could fall.
Indeed, just look what happened to Norcros. In the Review in April, the
portfolio 'bought' 3,000 Norcros shares for 158p each. The company's share
price rose, partly as the date of its announcement of full year figures drew
nearer. But when the figures were announced on June 3, it was accompanied by
details of a proposed 2-for-7 rights issue at 132p per share. The share
price of Norcros then started to decline. Unfortunately, the portfolio has
insufficient cash to take up its rights entitlement, so the nil paid were
sold at 17.5p, although I still feel that Norcros has takeover potential.
One of its subsidiaries, Norprint International, is one of Europe's most
successful suppliers of labelling systems. Important customers for its
magnetic tickets include British Rail, British Airways and the Milan Metro.
This division ought to have considerable growth potential.
Norcros has a whole host of other activities - from ceramic tiles to
Crittall windows and Triton showers. The portfolio will set a stop-loss
limit of around 135-138p, although anyone following this portfolio could
consider an even more cautious stop-loss level of around 142p.
Last time, I said the portfolio would buy 750 shares in the engineering
company EIS Group, if they fell back to 400p. However, by the time the
article was published, the shares had already fallen to 375p, and so it was
at this price that the portfolio acquired the shares.
One of the reasons for the fall in the price of EIS was its announcement, on
April 20, of a 1-for-5 rights issue at 340p.
For the full year to December 31, 1992, EIS's results were encouraging,
especially in these difficult times for engineering companies: pre-tax
profits were up from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 15.1m.
The company has a wide spread of engineering interests around the world  -
from power transmission couplings and fluid seals to process equipment and
aircraft and precision engineering. Exports and overseas activities account
for well over half the company's turnover. EIS has increased its pre-tax
profits, dividends per share and shareholders' funds every successive year
for 22 years. I hope this track record will continue. But, bearing in mind
the portfolio's cautious stance, I will set a stop-loss limit of 335-340p.
Also in the last Review, when shares in Allied Colloids were 226p, I said
the portfolio would buy 1,000 of them if they fell to around 215p. The
shares reached that level on May 28, and so the portfolio made its
'purchase'. The company produces speciality chemicals, and more than 80 per
cent of its sales are to overseas customers. So, hopefully, its prospects
are better than those of companies dependent on one territory or market. The
portfolio will set a stop-loss level of 200-205p.
The portfolio retains its interests in Burlington and Pentland. If
Burlington shares fall back to around the 20p level, then the portfolio
would contemplate selling the shares - especially if it looked as if they
could fall further. So far this year they have traded in the 15p-27.5p
range. If the shares fell below 16p, then the portfolio would consider
buying up to 15,000 of them, assuming the reason for their fall was not due
to really bad news but was as a result of a general market downturn or just
lack of interest in the company. I am still hoping that Burlington will
receive a takeover approach. Even at 25.5p the company's market
capitalisation is only Pounds 3.77m.
Pentland is regarded as a long-term hold for the portfolio. Its 22.6 per
cent holding in Authentic Fitness Corporation is now worth considerably more
than the company's original Dollars 10m investment in 1990, as AFC was
floated on the New York stock exchange in July last year. This appears to
have been overlooked by the market and I feel that Pentland is currently
underrated and, despite intense competition in the sports footwear industry,
still has considerable potential with all its varied interests.
Another company with which I remain impressed is Meggitt. But the shares
have still not fallen to the portfolio's target purchase price of 75-80p
and, as very little cash is now available (unless one of its investments
falls to its stop loss level), much as I would like to acquire Meggitt
shares, the portfolio is unable to do so.
Meanwhile, it is important to note, that if it looked as if there would be a
sudden, sharp, downturn in the market, the portfolio might 'dash for cash'
and sell everything, even if it had not reached the stop-loss limits.
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The opinions expressed are his own.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Volkswagen
works wonders while the D-Mark loses its magic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND quarter of 1993 shook the foundations of European equity market
sentiment. Little was lost in aggregate share price terms; much was
threatened.
Prospects for fiscal easing, and eventual economic recovery in Germany had
been at the core of investors' calculations. But the prospect retreated as
the Deutschmark lost its magic, falling by 5.1 per cent in trade-weighted
terms over the quarter.
Smith New Court, the London stockbrokers, reckoned that the closest parallel
was with 1981/82 when serious D-Mark weakness versus the dollar held up a
major decline in German short interest rates for roughly six months.
Recession, massive job losses, poverty and social unrest weighed on
Frankfurt equities. By June 30, they had not seen a key interest rate cut
since April 22 (although the Bundesbank finally cut both discount and
Lombard rates on July 1) NB there's some text missing in this para, I was
using insert function inancial stocks, popular in the first quarter, had
diminished.
Elsewhere, bourses moved, or seemed to move on their home currency's ability
to decouple from the D-Mark. Fiscal rectitude was not rewarded; as measured
by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the Belgian, French and German equity
markets showed falls on the quarter, in sterling terms, of 3.1, 6.4 and 4.6
per cent respectively.
The best gains of the three-month period were produced by post-devaluation
countries like Finland and Italy, up by 20.3 and 23.1 per cent, with Italy
torn also between speculation in privatisation prospects, and depression
over individual corporate disasters.
The international dichotomy was something new. Bourses had done well in the
winter quarters of 1992/93, Europe excluding the UK gaining 9.5 per cent in
the first three months of 1993 after a 9.3 per cent rise in October/December
of last year.
But the healthier impetus for these gains - arising from the economic
recovery in the US, and from the slow relaxation of Bundesbank policy - had
run out of steam. April/June provided more opportunities in Europe for the
trader than for the investor, and fleetness of foot was at a premium.
However, the phenomenon of the quarter and, indeed, of the first six months
of 1993 was the rise and rise of Volkswagen, climbing from sorry status as a
cyclical stock entering a severe economic depression to a pedestal position
as a 'concept' stock. Volkswagen gained 21 per cent in local terms in the
second quarter of 1993, and 52 per cent in the first six months, on the
promise of draconian cost saving measures. Its experience was mirrored, less
starkly, by other cyclicals and, in domestic currency terms, Germany's
decline was mitigated by a recovery in June: this lifted the market by 3.2
per cent in local currency terms, as it fell by 5.3 per cent in terms of the
dollar.
France eventually decoupled from the D-Mark. Smith New Court said in London
recently that French interest rates had fallen sharply, and would continue
to fall: 'French short term rates are already. . . .below German rates,'
they said in June, 'and this phenomenon will extend to long term rates as
long as the D-Mark remains under pressure against the US dollar.' The
'strength' of the dollar, rarely expressed in equity markets as the weakness
of the D-Mark, brought both domestic and foreign investors into cyclical
stocks in Europe, particularly those in the embattled automotive industry.
This left some analysts shaking their heads, and saying that there had been
an element of window-dressing about the 'recovery'.
Among the devaluation beneficiaries, there is more than a measure of support
for Finland analysts saying that the scale of devaluation and its effect on
depressed company operating profits should bring high rewards.
Italy, says Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, is 'an A1 mess'. It boasts the top five performers in the FT-SE
Eurotrack 100 index in April/June, and the resounding bottom performer in
the month in the debt-laden Montedison, down 30.75 per cent in sterling
terms, and representing its similarly afflicted parent, Ferruzzi group.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Japan's royal
wedding fails to rekindle consumer confidence

FOR THOSE who already hold Japanese stocks, the recent rise in the yen,
coupled with uncertainty over an economic recovery and the political
situation, may pose a strong reason to liquidate.
The Nikkei average, which rose 9.8 per cent during the first quarter of the
year, has stumbled around the 19,500 level since investors became
increasingly wary of the sharp advance during March. Thanks to the strong
performance in April, the leading index of 225 stocks managed to rise 5.4
per cent during the three months to the end of June; however, the 20,000
level has proved difficult to pass.
Strong foreign buying, together with continued help from the government's
public fund purchase operation, supported the index above the 20,000 level
during April, pushing the p/e ratio close to 80. However, the corporate
results season in May revealed that Japanese companies would post a 30 per
cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year ending next March, prompting some
investors to ponder the high valuation figures.
Consumer confidence failed to be spurred, in spite of hopes that the royal
wedding in June between Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako, the
former career diplomat, would trigger a recovery in retail demand as some
economists had predicted. It only produced a slight uptick in sales of the
princess's car, the Toyota Corolla, and pearls, which are favoured by the
Japanese royal family.
Even the yen, which has risen to record levels as US trade negotiators have
tried to talk the currency up on the back of Japan's mounting trade surplus,
threatened to undermine the fragile recovery in the manufacturing sector.
The political upheaval, as reformist groups split away from the ruling
Liberal Democratic party, forcing Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to
dissolve parliament, and uncertainty over another bribery scandal have given
investors an excuse to remain on the sidelines until the July 18 elections
are over.
While caution over the political situation caused a temporary sell-off of
shares, most analysts reckon the end of the LDP's 38-year rule should not
threaten investors. Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Barings Securities in
Tokyo, says that, although a weak LDP may mean difficulty in making
unpopular but necessary decisions, such as tax reform or liberalisation of
markets under pressure from the US, prospects for economic recovery should
be the dominant factor for stock investors.
For the next three months, investors are unlikely to see much action on the
Tokyo stock market, with the Nikkei index fluctuating amid thin volume, as
institutional investment historically dries up. However, while summers have
been unkind to share prices in recent years, the market is still receiving
underlying help from the government's fund support, which may prevent the
Nikkei from falling below 18,500.
Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Pacific region, the Hong Kong stock market,
which gained 11.1 per cent on the quarter, lost steam towards the end of
June, suffering from a gradual outflow of liquidity.
Andrew Hunt, at Thornton Management, which specialises in Asian funds, says
the market will not experience the performance seen over the past nine
months. Capital inflow from China, which has supported asset prices during
that period, is once again flowing back as China's liquidity is squeezed due
to surging inflation.
The rise in the Malaysian stock market, which advanced a marginal 0.2 per
cent over the past quarter, has slowed as the country's government has
tightened its grip on interest rates. However, there seems to be a case for
remaining bullish over Indonesia, which gained 15.9 per cent and is still
supported by competitive export prices and a steady inflow of capital.
Seoul, which rose 12.3 per cent on the quarter, is also expected to continue
its climb, as sluggish domestic demand suggests that there is still room for
interest rates to fall.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Bears in
charge, as low interest rates oblige US investors to buy stocks

AN ECONOMY that continues to struggle, concern about President Clinton's
plans to raise taxes and uncertainty about other elements of his economic
policy, mixed expectations of future corporate earnings and a temporary
outbreak of inflation fever combined to keep US stock markets trapped in a
relatively narrow trading range during the second quarter of 1993.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 81 points, or 2.4 per cent, to end
the three months at 3,516.08. The Dow did, however, set several new record
highs during the quarter, peaking at 3,554.83 on May 27.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a broader measure of market performance, stood
still between April and June, ending just 1.14 points lower at 450.53. The
Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks gained 2 per cent to end at
690.14.
The fundamentals of the equity markets were predominantly bearish throughout
the three months - economic growth continued to lag expectations, many
companies issued warnings about future earnings, and stocks remained
expensive, with p/e ratios at historically high levels.
That prices managed to hold their ground against such an unpromising
background was the result of two factors. First, interest rates stayed low
throughout the period, and despite a brief scare in May when it looked as if
the Federal Reserve might have to raise rates to curb what appeared to be a
revival of inflation, monetary policy remained unchanged.
Second, vast sums of investors money continued to pour into stocks, much of
it via the booming mutual fund industry. Once again, pitifully low interest
returns on short-term assets forced investors to switch their funds into
equities (and bonds) in search of better yields.
Although fund managers stored some of the new money as cash to hedge against
a market downturn, they put the bulk of it into stocks, providing a crucial
support for prices in the process.
In essence, the quarter was one good month sandwiched between two bad
months. In April, the markets went nowhere, and the main feature was heavy
selling of consumer brand stocks such as Heinz, Kellogg and Procter &amp;
Gamble, sparked by Philip Morris's surprise decision to launch a cigarette
price war to revive sales of Marlboro, its ailing top brand.
In May, stocks surged as inflation fears, which had been fuelled by several
months of worrying high consumer and producer price rises, abated. A
temporary break in the gold rally, which had also fanned the inflation
fires, further buoyed sentiment, as did the passage of President Clinton's
deficit-reduction package through the House of Representatives.
June, however, saw the markets come back down to earth, even though the
inflation numbers again proved better than anticipated. The main culprit was
a string of profits warnings from big companies (including Kmart, Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing and Apple Computer), which forced investors to
downgrade their expectations for second-quarter earnings.
The quarter ended, however, on something of a high note, with bond yields
dropping to new historic lows. Yet, the economic outlook remained gloomy,
with consumer confidence and spending apparently handcuffed by fears of
rising taxes and unemployment.
In Canada, confidence in the burgeoning economic revival, and low interest
rates, provided stocks with a considerable boost. On the corporate front,
leading companies continued to restructure, while the big political news was
the election by the ruling Conservative party of its first woman leader, and
prime minister, Kim Campbell. During the quarter the TSE 300 Composite index
jumped 370 points, or more than 10 per cent, to end at 3,966.37.
In Mexico, the stock markets stuttered, with the Prices and Quotations Index
losing more than 100 points, or 5.7 per cent, to end at 1,670.29. Sluggish
economic growth, worries about corporate earnings and fresh fears about
another delay to implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement
were the main factors behind Mexico's poor performance.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): The search is

evidence for this has yet to come through

INVESTORS MADE money in the second quarter, based on the FT-Actuaries World
Index. But stock and sector selection was critical, and overall the
important Wall Street and London markets just about marked time, with total
investment returns even under-performing money market rates.
The World Index overall gave sterling-based investors a 6.7 per cent return,
against 9.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.
Japan again compensated for some poor performances elsewhere, notably in
Europe where France and Germany ended the quarter in negative territory.
Tokyo produced a total return of 19 per cent in sterling terms, following a
January-March positive outcome of 19.5 per cent. Part of this gain was in
the currency, and Japan has yet to get back to the heady days of 1991. But
fund managers late into Tokyo have done very nicely.
The second quarter showed that country selection can be a funny old
business. Italy has been rocked by political scandals, and some big-name
companies, such as Ferruzzi, are in trouble. Yet the Italian market for
local investors rose by a fifth, and higher still in sterling terms. The
uncertain investment rationale there would appear to be that things can only
get better.
Some other markets, which had performed well towards the end of 1992 and in
the first quarter of this year, had setbacks, notably Mexico, Spain and
Australia; but Switzerland, with a close-on 6 per cent return for sterling
investors in the first quarter, pushed ahead to yield almost 50 per cent
better in the April-June period, the solid Swiss franc taking over the
secure European currency role from the D-Mark. Austria, another semi-hedge
against a weakening German currency, managed a return of around 4 per cent.
All of the geographical regions that make up the World Index ended the
quarter in positive territory. The Pacific area overall produced a return of
almost 18 per cent, though less than half that if Japan is excluded. Hong
Kong had another heady quarter, but in often volatile trading, the market
consensus being that the colony and China will somehow work out an amicable
post-1997 arrangement. But in the meantime there are bound to be major
investment scares.
Geographical section was important for fund managers in the second quarter,
but sector-picking was even more important. Investors sensed some economic
recovery in the US and Britain and a bottoming out in Japan, but continental
Europe is still faltering. Low world interest rates are driving more money
into equities, especially in the US where a growing number of mutual funds
are looking at investment opportunities outside their domestic market, and
increasingly at index-tracker instruments.
The search is now on for recovery stocks, rather than secure
recession-proofed holdings. Cyclical stocks are in demand, although not as
yet in the consumer area where spending remains erratic.
The World Index consumer goods and services sector showed a return of less
than 2 per cent in the quarter; but banks and other financial institutions
were some 17 per cent ahead, while electronics and heavy engineering had
returns at or near the mid-teens. Utilities came in at about 7 per cent; the
retail sector had a negative return compared with some 3.5 per cent last
time.
And what is the outlook for the remainder of this year? Most fund managers
are sitting on tidy profits and will want to nurture them. The problem is
that there is no real return to be made on the money markets, unless they
take a punt on currencies, and US long bond yields are at or near historic
lows.
Everyone is looking for recovery stocks, particularly in the medium-size
corporate sector, and selecting successfully there requires a lot of local
market knowledge. No doubt the third quarter will produce Italian-style
performances, but the major markets may well be in sideways mode, although
many analysts are already upgrading their earnings forecasts for this year
in both the US and the UK. The hard evidence for this has yet to come
through.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): London's
misplaced optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market paid the price in the second quarter for what now
looks like over-optimism over both global and national economic prospects in
the earlier part of the year.
At home, expectations that the effective devaluation of sterling after
September 1992 would herald a significant recovery in the UK economy were
damped down by a notable absence of improvement in company profits. On the
international front, successive cuts in interest rates in Europe merely
signalled recessionary pressures.
By the end of June, continued dissatisfaction with the progress of the
domestic economy had been translated into political drama in the House of
Commons, adding a new dimension to the uncertain mood holding the stock
market in thrall.
The FT-SE 100 index, the stock market's favourite, if somewhat limited,
measuring rod, finally retained only a few points of its gain from the end
of the previous quarter - a gain which never moved above 1 per cent.
There are signs, however, that the Footsie was not an entirely reliable
guide to performance in the second quarter. It is heavily weighted in terms
of UK companies with markets and profits in Germany and the other European
countries which appeared to be moving deeper into recession over the
quarter. It also includes many pharmaceutical companies, which have been
losers on a global market scale because US investors feared that the Clinton
administration would cut healthcare costs savagely.
The market's performance looks a little better on some of the broader
measuring scales. The FT-A All-Share index, covering the full range of UK
stocks, added 1.7 per cent over the three month period.
The picture brightens even more if the market is measured in terms of the
FT-SE Mid 250 share index, which closed on June 30 some 4 per cent higher
than at the end of March. The Mid 250 index, by definition, reaches further
down the list of domestic stocks that have continued to respond to such
recovery in the UK economy as has so far been registered. At the same time,
it avoids some of the international pressures.
As the second quarter ended, there were signs that the market was fighting
its way into a new, higher trading range, and that its faith in economic
recovery was resilient. Much of this faith appeared to be rooted in belief
that impending cuts in German rates would open the way for further interest
rate reductions in the UK - although precisely why a final one-point cut in
base rates should achieve what has not been achieved by so many previous
reductions has yet to be made clear.
But even if it is regaining its confidence, the London market may still face
further uncertainty before economic recovery is established. The reshuffle
of John Major's government was highlighted by the appointment of a new
chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, who has to make important
decisions about government spending and on taxation policies later this
year. He may put interest rate decisions aside until then.
Having survived the ICI/Zeneca demerger, with all its import for core
investment portfolios, the financial markets still have to survive the
Pounds 5bn sale of the government's shares in BT, and also a state funding
programme of an estimated Pounds 1bn a week for the rest of the year.
All these considerations continue to restrain a stock market which,
nevertheless, retains its faith in economic recovery in the UK, a nation now
identified as a low-inflation, low-cost manufacturer. Such faith will now
have to wait for the round of third-quarter trading results from British
companies.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): A change of
climate for the rainy-day money - John is dismayed by low building society
interest rates, and Alison disregards the opinion of Mr Stagge / The
Plowshares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BEVERLY CHANDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN IS in his study, perusing the six-monthly interest statement from his
wife's building society account. He is appalled to see just how little the
return on their rainy-day money has become.
Pushing aside piles of papers, he eventually finds a calculator. After a
fair amount of cursing and scribbling on the back of an envelope, he
discovers that the Pounds 22,000 which the couple prudently left in the
building society (in Alison's name, for tax purposes) is now getting
interest at only half the percentage rate that was applicable when they put
the money into the account two years ago.
Further digging in John's desk produces the statements on the family's
portfolio of unit trusts and returns on its personal equity plan holdings.
Things look decidedly brighter on this front, where the unit trust portfolio
is up more than 30 per cent over the past year, thanks to the kind attention
of Mr Stagge, of stockbrokers Stagge &amp; Hoppit; and their Pep holdings are
worth Pounds 31,000.
It seems to John that the time may be right for a little portfolio updating.
Later that evening, he and Alison are eating supper and discussing life in
general. John is certain that he has spotted the tiniest, most insubstantial
green shoot of recovery at work - a middling-to-large project having arrived
at his firm's door, requiring it to take on a new member of staff.
Better news on the work front has made him quietly confident that things may
be improving generally. He tells Alison:
'I've been thinking about our rainy-day building society money. We've got
over Pounds 20,000 which is only earning 6 per cent interest at the moment,
while our equity investments through unit trusts made just over 30 per cent
last year.
'I think that we should move some of the savings money over to equities.
History shows that equities have always outperformed simple savings accounts
over the long term.'
Alison rather enjoys the fact that she has something of a proprietary hold
over the building society money, because it is in her name and she is wary
of giving this up. So her response to John is to suggest that they look into
other options for their savings very thoroughly, rather than just stuff it
into the unit trust portfolio.
'The rainy-day money isn't supposed to be exposed to any risk,' she reminds
John. 'Remember that we are always supposed to be able to get at it in an
emergency.'
The next day, as the Plowshares devour the Sunday papers, John finds an
advertisement for a 'guaranteed stockmarket bond'. At first glance, this is
a product made in heaven, specifically for them.
With this type of product, held over a fixed period of five years, an
investment earns a high proportion of the growth of, in this case, the FT-SE
100 share index over that period, while enjoying a full money-back guarantee
against the original investment.
Even Alison is hard put to find any problems with this concept, and the
Plowshares send off for more information. When the brochure arrives, they
sit down and pay particular attention to the fine print.
The bond, it turns out, offers two types of return. In either case, the
investor gets back all his investment after five years if the stockmarket
does not grow at all. However, he can choose either to accept returns based
on 98 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 index, or to go for a lock-in
option. In the latter case, returns are based on 90 per cent of the rise in
the Footsie index, with growth locked in when the market achieves 20, 30, 40
and 50 per cent more than its current level.
It is clear to the Plowshares that the second option lowers the amount of
risk - but it also lowers the return. And the amount by which the return is
lowered is effectively a front-end charge on the product - of either 2 per
cent or 10 per cent, depending on which variation is chosen.
A much greater charge on the product, however, results from the lack of a
dividend yield. Were an investor actually to buy all the shares in the FT-SE
100 index, he or she would earn a dividend yield of 4-5 per cent a year, an
overall return of 20 per cent plus over five years. Most guaranteed bonds do
not give investors the benefit of the dividend yield.
Of course, if the stockmarket were to remain completely flat for five years,
there would be no charge on the product, and John likes the idea that they
are guaranteed to get 100 per cent of their money back.
Alison points out that this is not as good as it sounds. If the guarantee
has to be used, they will have lost out on five years of interest payments,
and their capital will have been eaten away by inflation.
The tax structure of the bond is reasonably simple. Gains are paid net of
income tax at the basic rate. On some products, sold by insurance companies,
this tax cannot be reclaimed. When sold by building societies, however,
returns can be received gross.
For most taxpayers, though, this is not a particularly tax-efficient way of
investing in equities. Most of the return on a unit trust, for example, is
in the form of capital gain. Since few investors use up their annual CGT
allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1993-94), such returns are effectively tax-free.
The Plowshares' decide to take their findings to their stockbroker. Alison
has insisted upon this concession, on the grounds that, once in a
stockmarket bond, the investor ought to stay, because there are quite hefty
penalties if you come out early.
'This is supposed to be rainy-day emergency money,' she reminds John again.
'We shouldn't tie it up.'
When consulted, Mr Stagge agrees with the Plowshares that too large a chunk
of their money is sitting on cash deposit.
'The growth of your unit trust portfolio and Pep,' he observes, 'is such
that you have enough of a cushion to cover all emergencies. I would
recommend that one of you take your maximum capital gain, of Pounds 5,800,
out of your unit trust portfolio, top this up and put Pounds 6,000 into one
more Pep.'
Mr Stagge says that a good general rule is that, 'if you believe the markets
are going to go up, buy an indexed unit trust; if you don't believe the
market is going to go up, don't buy equities in the first place.'
Nevertheless, Alison, having heard the arguments against the product, agrees
with John that they should invest Pounds 10,000 in the bond, for one
over-riding reason - security. 'I know that we are paying for the comfort of
a guarantee,' she says, 'but I must admit to being fond of comfort.'
Help in compiling this feature was provided by SM Searle, from Gerrard
Vivian Gray, who put together the portfolio, and David Oldridge, of Hill
Oldridge, who supplied financial advice.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): How a world
market caught spring fever - After the carefully concocted campaign by two
high-profile financiers, which sent the price of the precious metal soaring,
analysts are divided over where it goes from here / Gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GOLD'S PRICE in US dollars slumped to its lowest level for seven years in
London on the first trading day of 1993. Long-term gold bulls wondered,
despairingly, what on earth it would take to reverse the steady downward
trend.
Stock market crashes in 1987 had failed to do the trick; nor had the Gulf
war, with its horrific implications for oil supplies and inflation, revived
North American and European investor interest in the gold market. The
collapse of the Soviet Union, a big producer, and political upheavals in
South Africa, the biggest, were also ignored.
But in April, a carefully concocted campaign by two high-profile
international financiers, Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros, sent the
price soaring; and for a while gold became the hottest investment game in
town.
Mr Soros, whose US-based funds have Dollars 7bn invested, was in the mood to
buy gold shares. Sir James had been wanting to reduce his holding in Newmont
Mining, the biggest North American gold producer, and agreed to sell Mr
Soros about 10m Newmont shares from his own investment vehicle, General
Oriental, and funds managed by his friend, Lord (Jacob) Rothschild.
Some analysts suggest that Mr Soros had bigger fish to fry. The rumour mill
says his funds had been shorting the US bond market (that is, selling bonds
they did not own in the hope that they could pick them up later at a lower
price). The gold price tends to move up and down with the yield in bonds,
reflecting the market's expectations of inflation. A rise in the gold price,
of the kind which followed the deal with Sir James, gave a signal the bond
market could not ignore. Bond prices followed the usual pattern and fell as
gold rose. If the Soros funds had been shorting the bond market, they would
have made a hefty profit.
As for Sir James, apparently tired of waiting for the world's banking and
financial system to collapse (a phenomenon he predicted at the time in 1990
when he took the plunge into gold shares via the Newmont purchase), he
decided to give the gold price a lift. He did this by buying call options -
a huge number of call options which give the right (but not the obligation)
to buy gold at agreed prices and within an agreed time frame. Market rumours
suggest he took options on between 700,000 and 1m troy ounces of gold.
People who grant options usually buy some gold, just in case the call
options are exercised and they have to deliver. If someone buys enough
options, there is a lot of gold-buying and the price goes up. As the price
goes up, the chances that the option writers must deliver gold increase, so
they have to buy more gold.
To make sure the market got the message, Sir James arranged maximum
publicity for his deals. While Sir James's previous attempts to talk up the
gold price had little impact, news that Mr Soros was now betting that the
gold price would rise had a massive impact, because his funds are reputed to
have made Dollars 1bn in the currency markets last September by betting the
UK and Italian governments would not be able to keep their currencies within
the European exchange rate mechanism.
As other New York investment funds followed the Soros lead, gold's price
rose rapidly and attracted even more players to the game. The activity
boosted interest in gold-company shares and even the gold coin market picked
up from exceedingly depressed levels.
Analysts are divided about where gold goes from here. Some point out that
nothing fundamentally has changed in the gold market since the price hit its
seven-year low in January; that producers are still likely to put a 'cap' on
price rises by selling, so as to guarantee themselves a profit; that central
banks, which hold 34,000 tonnes of gold, equivalent to 17 years supply from
mines, are likely to be net sellers; and that demand in those parts of the
world where gold is in favour, because the local banking system does not
work well or there is rampant inflation, simply disappears when the price
rises substantially.
Others liken the gold market's performance to a pendulum which swings one
way until it can go no further before swinging back in the other direction.
They suggest the Dollars 326 an ounce which gold touched early this year was
the outer limit of one swing, and that now the pendulum is swinging in the
other direction. But how far before it reaches the other outer limit?
Julian Baring, who manages the Mercury Gold and General fund, suggests that,
even if you think of gold merely as another commodity, 'it is by no means
unusual for commodity prices to double from the bottom to the top of a
cycle. But that does not happen in six months.'
So there is still time for those investors who agree with Mr Baring's view
of the market to profit from potential price rises.
But it is not easy for the UK private investor to buy gold bullion today.
Unlike jewellery, which in the UK typically would have a mark-up of more
than 3,000 per cent on the gold content, gold bars and coins carry small
premiums, typically between 3 and 7 per cent, but the big bullion houses
have stopped selling small quantities of gold. However, Spinks and Gold
Investments are still in the business.
In the UK, gold attracts value added tax, currently 17.5 per cent, but both
organisations have schemes which legally avoid VAT. As long as gold
sovereigns are more than 100 years old, Spinks can sell them at a premium of
only 4 per cent above the value of the gold content; while Gold Investments
puts together private buyers and sellers, taking a small commission for this
service.
Investment in gold bullion means giving up interest payments, and there is a
charge for insurance and storage - Gold Investments would ask for about 1
per cent of the gold's value a year. There is also a currency risk, because
gold's price is denominated in dollars, and gains on its price will often be
offset by losses on the dollar.
Investment in gold-company shares, as a proxy for the metal, also usually
involves exposure to currency fluctuations, because there are only a very
limited number of UK-based gold producers and the big companies are in North
America and South Africa.
For those who are willing to pay someone else to make the investment
decisions, there are several gold-related funds listed in Money Management,
a Financial Times magazine, the biggest of which seems to be Mr Baring's
Mercury Gold and General.
Gold bullion has lost 60 per cent of its value in terms of dollars since
1980, and 80 per cent in Japanese yen. When insurance and interest foregone
is taken into account, anyone who has held the metal since then has seen
about 90 per cent of the value disappear.
Mr Baring points out that gold shares have also been 'a pretty dismal
long-term investment'. However, his fund appreciated by 35 per cent in May,
and by mid-June was up 134 per cent since the begining of this year; and he
suggests:
'These shares are one of the most exciting means of accumulating wealth over
shorter periods, as we have recently discovered.'

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Nine selections
from a global field of 1,400 - Two of this quarter's advisers see growth
potential in the Pacific, and two pick Perpetual funds for total return /
The experts' panel, Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT TRUSTS are often cited as an easy way for investors to own shares - but
where does the beginner start? There are over 1,400 trusts to choose from.
So we asked advisers to choose three unit trusts - one for income, one for
capital growth and one for total return. They had complete freedom as to
whether they opted for UK or overseas stock markets.
Graeme Farquharson, of Hill Martin (Asset Management), says: 'Our approach
to unit trust selection is 'top down'. We look at the providers first. How
big are they? How long have they been managing funds? What is their overall
performance? Only when it has satisfied our criteria does a management house
go on our selected list.
'When we examine individual funds, we look at a number of factors in
addition to performance: size, charging structure, the record of the
indiviual manager, the investment philosophy. When performance is analysed,
it should be on a offer-to-bid basis, and should be based on consistency
over at least five years.
'Using the above criteria, my recommendations are:
GROWTH: the Govett Pacific Strategy fund. 'We believe that the geographic
area most likely to produce above-average growth in the medium to long term
is the Far East, and we have selected a fund which can include investments
in Japan.
'The Pacific Strategy fund was formed in 1987 and has been managed for the
past three years by Peter Robson. The investment policy is 'top down', in
that the asset allocation is decided first, based on information received
from Govett's Singapore office, together with views gathered from brokers
worldwide and its own research department.
'Performance has been splendid, the fund having produced just short of 140
per cent for the five years to January 1, 1993, and just under 40 per cent
for one year to the same date.
TOTAL RETURN: Buckmaster Income. 'While the Buckmaster Income fund is
categorised as an income fund, its yield is relatively low at 4.25 per cent.
This allows for both future income growth and a very real prospect of
underlying capital growth. The fund has been managed for the past 3 1/2
years by Tim Gregory.
'The investment policy is 'top down', in that the macro strategy for a
rolling five years is first agreed. Income funds have had considerable
difficulty maintaining a high yield, due to the trend of dividend cuts and
the effects of the recent changes in Advance Corporation Tax. This fund,
however, achieves its core income from convertible preference shares, and is
then free to make investments in lower-income, good-quality stocks.
'Performance has been good, with returns being 81 per cent for the five
years to January 1, 1993 and 21.6 per cent for one year to the same date.
INCOME: Perpetual High Income fund. 'Perpetual has built up a quite
remarkable investment performance and won numerous industry awards. The High
Income fund was formed in 1988, and is managed by Neil Woodford. It is
invested to achieve a high income from a spread of international securities,
with at least 50 per cent in the UK or EC. The current estimated gross yield
is 5.13 per cent per annum.
Past performance has been impressive, with growth of 38.5 per cent for the
three years to January 1993.'
Peter Tonkin, investment director of Towry Law, chooses:
INCOME: GT Smaller Companies Dividend fund. 'In searching for a recommended
income unit trust, I decided on an equity income fund, because of my wish to
see a growing income. I choose a fund investing in UK companies, because the
yields available are more attractive than those from most other markets.
'GT Smaller Companies Dividend fund, managed by Doug Hunter, was launched in
September 1989, and is one of a handful of unit trusts seeking an
above-average level of income from a portfolio of shares of smaller UK
companies.
'The main investment theme of the fund is to choose companies which have
good, solid businesses and sound managements but which are currently ignored
by the stock market. These companies must have the potential, over the
medium term, to grow their dividends, so that the fund can deliver income
growth to investors.
'In June, the gross yield was just over 6 per cent - about 50 per cent
higher than the average yield from UK equities.
GROWTH: Schroder UK Enterprise Fund. 'I stay with the UK market in my
selection of a growth fund. Looking ahead to further recovery in the
economy, I pass over funds investing in our larger (and therefore more
defensive) companies, searching instead for a fund which will move swiftly
into those companies that are going to show above-average growth, and
hopefully above-average share price rises, as economic conditions change.
'The Schroder UK Enterprise Fund, managed by Jim Cox, is my choice here. It
is primarily a stock-picking fund.
It has had an excellent performance since launch in August 1988, by focusing
the portfolio on 40-45 stocks.
TOTAL RETURN: Perpetual Global Bond fund. 'Now is the time for me to
recommend exposure to overseas economies (and currencies) through bonds or
fixed-interest investments via the Perpetual Global Bond fund. Perpetual
appointed Alpha Global Fixed Income Managers as advisers to their fund. In
June, the quoted gross yield was just under 6 1/2 per cent and the total
return since launch in April 1992 had been more than 25 per cent - making it
the top-performing fund in its sector over that period.'
John Edwards, consultant, Berry Birch &amp; Noble, says:
'Recommending individual unit trusts is a mug's game. As the statutory
warning says: past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future.
Yesterday's winner often turns out to be tomorrow's loser. Unfortunately the
contrarian theory, that poorly performing funds stand the best chance of
moving to the top of the table, is not proven. Some unit trusts consistently
lose value year after year.
'However, there are various basic criteria to be considered. First, there is
the risk/reward ratio. Can the investor afford to lose in hopes of a big
gain, or would he prefer something a bit safer with less potential reward?
'Unit trusts are essentially long-term investments, partly because it takes
time to recoup dealing charges. But it depends on what is meant by
long-term. It is no good simply selecting unit trusts or sectors which are
currently flavour of the month. Things can change pretty quickly, and it is
easy to ramp up short-term performance. For the long-term investor, it is
important to take into account the record and pedigree of the companies
offering unit trusts.
'For example, banks over the years have a dismal performance record, with
few exceptions. Insurance companies may have other fish to fry, and not be
too concerned about their unit trusts.
'So there is a case for picking unit trusts run by independently-owned
investment houses with a long-term record.
INCOME: Fidelity High Income. 'A few years ago, it would have been
unthinkable not automatically to include M&amp;G and Fidelity in any list of
unit trust recommendations. However, both groups have suffered considerable
setbacks in their performance in the last few years, although they appear to
have been recovering ground more recently.
'In fact, if income is required the recently launched Fidelity High Income
trust is not a bad choice. It invests in a mixture of equities and
fixed-interest securities. This helps to provide an above-average yield,
stability in the event of a stock market crash, and the prospect of limited
capital growth. It is an ideal vehicle for Pep investors wanting tax-free
income.
'Newton Income has had a tremendous performance over the past five years.
But there must be doubts as to whether this can be maintained following its
transition from a small to large fund as the result of a big inflow of
money.
GROWTH: Schroder Pacific Growth. 'For capital growth, the best prospects for
long-term capital growth appear to be offered by the Pacific Basin and Far
East markets, including China but excluding Japan. Schroder has always been
strong in that area, and its Pacific Growth fund has a consistently good
record.
TOTAL RETURN: Perpetual High Income. 'No one looking at unit trusts can
ignore the all-round performance achieved by Perpetual in recent years. It
has a cluster of top-performing trusts in several sectors. One could almost
choose any of their funds. For total return, I would favour the Perpetual
High Income fund, which not only has a reasonable yield but also a good
growth record.'

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Do some
homework before you make a bid - There are bargains, but a cheap property is
not necessarily a good buy. Many will have been repossessed - and empty
houses can deteriorate / Buying your house 3, At auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEARS AGO, my grandmother went to a Cardiff auction intending to buy a
rocking horse. To my mother's disappointment, she returned with no horse,
but a house instead.
Can buying a house at auction still be approached so lightly? Perhaps not
quite, but auctioneers are doing their best to catch the recent wave of
public enthusiasm for property auctions by making the whole process as
user-friendly as possible.
The option of buying at auction was almost forgotten during the estate
agents' boom of the 1980s, leaving the field clear for property developers
and speculators. Since the housing market collapsed, however, the
established auction houses have encouraged private buyers back.
A recent newcomer to the UK is the American auction company Kennedy-Wilson,
which aims entirely at private buyers. It takes on whole developments of new
flats or houses, often where the builder has gone bust or the properties
have failed to sell, and carries out an intense marketing campaign leading
up to an auction.
Much of the current interest in auctions is due to large numbers of
repossessed houses being sold for apparently ridiculously low prices: Pounds
10,000 for a house sounds like a bargain to most people. But the prices that
make the headlines are by their nature unusual.
'Historically, properties sold at auction are always sold at a bit of a
discount,' says Robin Cripp, director of auctions at Barnard Marcus. This is
because the speed of the sale can save the seller money. Whether or not you
get a real bargain can depend on how well-attended the sale is, and how much
interest there is in a particular property.
Also, remember that a cheap house is not necessarily a good buy. Many
properties sold at auction are empty, because they have been repossessed or
are being sold by the executors of an estate. Empty property deteriorates
fast, and disillusioned home-owners facing repossession often vent their
frustration by ripping out the fittings and smashing up the house. Repairing
the damage, whether caused by neglect or intent, can add considerably to the
price.
This is why most auctioneers recommend that you inspect the property
thoroughly, and, if in any doubt at all about its condition, arrange a
survey before the auction. It means that you pay in advance for a report on
a property for which you could be outbid, but the price of a survey is small
compared with the cost of dealing with, say, massive subsidence.
'Do your homework,' is one piece of advice given by everyone involved in the
auction business. Unless you or your solicitor check legal documents and
local authority searches before the auction, you could buy a house only to
find that it has a sitting tenant, is subject to a listed building
preservation order, or has only a few years of a lease to run. The
auctioneers usually have copies of legal documents and search reports
available for inspection, and onerous conditions should be pointed out in
the sale catalogue, but it is safer to make your own checks as well.
If you are particularly keen on a property, it can be worth making an offer
before the sale, to avoid being outbid. If your offer is above the reserve,
and the auctioneers are not expecting the sale to be very well attended, it
may be accepted. Some auctioneers, however, discourage buying before the
sale, on the grounds that it removes the seller's chance of a better price.
But, since this can happen, check whether your chosen house is still for
sale before you go along to the auction.
A large proportion of property auctions are held in London, even if the
houses for sale are scattered around the country. Watch out for
advertisements in the national press or your local paper. If you cannot
attend the sale in person, you can usually arrange to bid by proxy or over
the telephone.
Stickley &amp; Kent is one company that is trying to demystify the subject for
first-time property auction attenders. First, it set up a premium rate
advice line; now it has launched a video. For Pounds 9.95, the
professionally produced video guides potential buyers through every step of
buying a house at auction, from ringing up for a catalogue to dealing with
the paperwork after a successful bid.
Other auction houses offer the same advice free. Most are happy to arrange a
chat about procedure and what preparation is needed. Kennedy-Wilson runs
'how to' seminars in the run-up to its sales around the country, where
interested buyers can voice commonly-held worries, such as whether
scratching an itchy nose can be mistaken for a bid. In fact, at
Kennedy-Wilson's auctions, bidders must register in advance and are given
numbered cards with which to signal a bid. At other auction houses, waving
the catalogue is recommended as an unambiguous way to attract the
auctioneer's attention.
Once the hammer comes down on your bid, that is it. There is no threat of a
gazumper emerging to snatch a prized Georgian townhouse from your grasp; but
then again, there is no room for second thoughts over the charmingly
dilapidated cottage with no running water. You must have a cheque, banker's
draft or cash for the deposit, usually 10 per cent, ready to hand over at
the auction. If for any reason you pull out, you lose the deposit and could
face legal action for further costs.
The balance of the purchase price is usually due 28 days after the auction.
This is faster than many mortgage lenders are used to moving. So, unless you
are a cash buyer, you need to start arranging finance well before the day of
the auction. Building societies can withhold part of the mortgage until the
property is in a good state of repair, so, if you are buying a repossessed
wreck, take this into account in your calculations, or you could find
yourself with a shortfall when the 28 days are up.
Finally, two obvious but crucial points. First, know your price limit and
stick to it. It is less easy to get carried away when you are dealing with
thousands rather than tens of pounds, but it can be tempting to go just that
little bit further when a house you have fallen in love with is at stake.
And second, check, double-check and memorise the lot number of the property
you have your eye on. People have been known to buy the wrong house by
mistake.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Old ways may
not suit frequent movers - Repayment mortgages may make the process simple,
but the alternative interest-only method can offer greater flexibility /
Buying your house 2, The loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW SHOULD you finance your house purchase? Despite the plethora of products
on offer, the matter can be boiled down to two straightforward decisions.
First: how to pay back the amount borrowed? The choice is broadly between a
repayment or an interest-only mortgage.
Second: now that mortgage rates are historically low, buyers should consider
whether to fix the rate of interest.
PAYING BACK THE MORTGAGE
Lenders offer a variety of ways in which the money can be repaid which rely
on the two constituent parts of the mortgage: the capital sum and the
interest payments on this amount.
Repayment: Until the 1980s, the most popular mortgage was the repayment
type, where the homeowner's monthly payments include both interest and
capital. The advantage is that there is no commission, because
insurance-related products are not involved (although it is prudent to take
out life assurance to cover the mortgage, and most lenders will insist on
this) and the mortgage will be paid off at the end of its term.
The main argument against this method is that you will usually be paying off
more in interest than capital in the early years of the mortgage; so, if you
move frequently, you could find that your payments are mostly interest, with
little progress in paying off the capital.
Another argument is that, since tax relief is available on the first Pounds
30,000 of the loan, it is more tax-efficient to pay interest than make
capital repayments. To get around this problem, the mortgage holder could
try to switch to an interest-only mortgage once the capital sum gets down to
Pounds 30,000. But they have to judge whether they will be better off
getting tax relief on interest payments (restricted solely to 20 per cent
from 1994-95), or making lower interest payments as a result of a smaller
loan.
Interest-only: The alternative to repayment mortgages is the interest-only
mortgage, where you make interest payments on the capital sum throughout the
term of the loan, and have a separate savings plan to pay off the capital
sum at the end of the mortgage term.
The choice of savings methods is wide, though you would not think so judging
by the statistics, which show that endowment mortgages - where a premium is
paid to an insurance company which invests the money on your behalf and
throws in some life assurance - dominate the market.
Sales of endowment mortgages overtook those of the repayment mortgage in the
mid-1980s. At their peak, in 1988, they accounted for 84 per cent of new
mortgages, compared with just 20 per cent in the early 1980s. This
extraordinary growth cannot be entirely separated from the hearty
recommendations of lenders, who earn commission from the life companies for
each policy sold.
But endowments fell to 68 per cent of new mortgage sales in the last quarter
of 1992. Criticism has focused on the high proportion of early redemptions,
which make the policies extremely poor value. Unless you are committed to
holding the endowment for 25 years, it will be better to consider other
savings options.
The most tax-efficient is a pension mortgage, where contributions to a
pension scheme obtain tax relief at the holder's marginal rate and are paid
into a fund which pays no tax. Part of the tax-free lump sum paid on
retirement is used to pay off the mortgage.
The disadvantage is that there will be less left over after paying off the
mortgage to invest for your retirement - an idea which deters many people.
Moreover, if you are too young, you will be making interest payments for
more than 25 years, which can wipe out the tax advantages.
Mortgages linked to personal equity plans (Peps) are a relatively new
innovation. A Pep is free of income and capital gains tax, and is more
flexible than either an endowment or a pension mortgage, because you can
stop making payments into it without penalty and can use it to pay off the
mortgage whenever it grows to the amount needed. The main drawback is that
it is at the mercy of stock market fluctuations, and you have to pay a Pep
manager plan fees, which may reduce or even eliminate the tax benefits.
Some lenders will agree to give you an interest-only loan without tying it
to a particular savings method. You are then free to repay the capital
however you wish, but this is for the disciplined only, or for those who
believe in relying on inflation to erode the value of the capital.
If you move frequently, interest-only mortgages can be less cumbersome than
a repayment mortgage, because they do not have to be redeemed each time.
TO FIX OR NOT TO FIX?
With mortgage rates at a 20-year low, it is not surprising that so many
people have flocked to fix their mortgage, in order to have the security of
knowing what their monthly payments will be. Lenders have signalled that a
further one point cut in base rates will only be mirrored by a fractional
drop in mortgage rates, so these appear to be at or near the bottom.
You will have to pay a booking or administration fee, likely to be about
Pounds 200-Pounds 300, and you should watch out for product tie-ins. There
will also be early redemption penalties - the fee for early repayment of
part or all of the loan.
Choosing a short-term fix of, say, three years or less, leaves you exposed
to the risk that the fix ends just as interest rates rise again. But
longer-term fixed-rate offers are higher than the standard variable rate of
7.99 per cent that prevailed last month.
For example, Lloyds bank this year launched a 25-year fixed rate of 9.75 per
cent (on endowment or pension mortgages only). How good or bad a deal it is
depends on what interest rates end up doing over the period - but some
borrowers may be willing to pay a little more in order to have certainty.

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Regard it as a
roof, not an investment - Prices may well have bottomed, making this the
buyer's year. But don't expect your home to outperform equities - Buying
your house 1, Is this the right time?

THE RELENTLESS search for the bottom of the housing market has been on for
several years, but every time that new house-price lows appear to have been
hit, the next set of indices shows further falls.
The many false dawns, since the collapse of prices in 1989, have made
analysts increasingly circumspect about predicting the timing or strength of
the recovery.
Many of the right ingredients have been in place for some time. Base rates
have dropped from 10 to 6 per cent since the UK left the exchange rate
mechanism last September, and the standard variable mortgage rate of 7.99
per cent (prevailing at the beginning of July) is the lowest for over 20
years. If there is another base rate cut this year, mortgage rates should
drop further.
The effect on affordability is marked. The main graph shows that, with
mortgage rates of 7.99 per cent, servicing the loan on an average-priced
house now takes 18.9 per cent of average gross income, compared with 44.4
per cent in 1990 when base rates were 15 per cent. This affordability ratio,
which is calculated by dividing average monthly earnings by the amount
needed to finance an 80 per cent mortgage for the average-priced house at
prevailing interest rates, is now close to 1972 levels of 17.4 per cent.
Prevailing tax reliefs are taken into account.
Mortgage rates and house prices are two of the factors that have come
together to convince analysts that this is the year that the market touches
its low point before a slow, if halting, recovery.
Gary Marsh, house price specialist at the Halifax building society, the
largest lender, which accounts for about one in five mortgages sold, says
that, although prices have not stabilised, they have bottomed out. Since
last September, the monthly Halifax house price index, which reached a peak
of 228.5 in July 1989, has hovered around 200. It has been marked by dips
and rises since September, and Marsh says this pattern can be expected to
continue, with the result that house prices will end the year at much the
same level as they began. He expects prices to rise by 5 per cent at the end
of next year.
John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS, also doubts whether
there will be price rises this year, and foresees a gradual rise next year.
Prices are not expected to rise quickly, because of the continuing
availability of empty property.
Repossessions fell from their 1991 peak of 75,540 to 68,540 last year,
according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, but Wriglesworth expects a
total of 70,000 repossessions this year, which will continue to act as a
drag on prices. He points to a situation in which there is now an oversupply
of property which people do not want - the repossessions - and an
undersupply of good-quality housing at low prices.
Traditionally, the market has depended for its movement on those at the
bottom end of the market selling their homes and 'trading up'. If
repossessions act to keep prices low, the problem of negative equity is
compounded for those who first entered the market in the late 1980s. Their
homes are worth less than the value of their mortgages, so they cannot
afford to sell and trade up.
However, Halifax's Gary Marsh says that this problem is being overcome,
because the fall in house prices has enabled today's first-time buyers to
enter the housing market at a higher level and to step over the heads of
those who are stuck at the bottom of the housing rung.
If we are bumping along the bottom, then this is as good a time to buy as
any in the past six months or so, and it should remain a good time into next
year. This appears to be borne out by the increase in levels of transactions
this year, which also suggests higher levels of confidence on the part of
buyers.
The Adams Residential Property Index, which is compiled by James R Adams, a
market research consultancy, and which monitors housing completions made by
solicitors, shows that the number of completions in May exceeded 100,000,
from a low of just under 60,000 in February. The May figure is the highest
since last August (when stamp duty on homes worth under Pounds 250,000 was
reimposed) and is also 6 per cent up on the same time last year, though it
is down on the same month in the previous years back to 1988.
James R Adams is predicting that monthly completions will hover around the
100,000 level for the remainder of the year. Potential buyers have also
benefited since the Budget, from the removal of 1 per cent stamp duty on
house purchases costing between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 60,000, and it is
possible that the gradual falls in unemployment since February have helped
confidence.
But if you are choosing your moment in order to buy property as an
investment, rather than as a roof over your head, you are embarking on a
risky course.
House prices tend to be less volatile than equities, but property is not
consistently the best performing investment. The lower chart compares the
performance of the FT-All Share (without income re-invested) with that of
property prices, both in real terms since the end of 1965 to date. During
this period, houses have outperformed equities.
However, if we had taken 1973 as our base year, or any subsequent year, the
return from equities would have been better to date, despite the 1974 and
1987 stock market crashes and the housing market booms of the late 1970s and
the 1980s.
There are few indications of another strong increase in house prices in the
near future. Although prices may have bottomed, a strong recovery depends on
the strength of the economic recovery as well as supply and demand in the
market.
The housing market price booms of the 1970s and the late 1980s were a legacy
of inflation. House prices rose faster than interest rates, and mortgage
debt was eroded in real terms, so that homeowners made profits out of
borrowing. But expectations now are of slow economic recovery within a low
inflation environment.
Demand is also not expected to be as robust in the 1990s as it was in the
1980s. Demographic changes indicate that there will be a decline in the
first-time buyer age group of 25-30 years as the baby-boomers of the 1960s
get older. Pressure on prices will be maintained, according to Marsh, by
shortages of land for house building; but, despite this, he does not
envisage house prices rising faster than earnings over the next five years,
unless the economy over-inflates.
In the cautious words of one analyst: 'With hindsight, we will be able to
say that the recovery began in 1993.'

FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Blue-chip
runners display feet of lead - The punters are piling into unit trusts. Will
they avoid getting stuck in the Footsie rut? / Keynote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE HOT Derby favourite came nowhere last month, and in the financial
markets, too, the long-odds gamblers have had a better time of it.
During the second quarter of the year the underlying theme was risk: accept
it, and you stood a chance of making some money; avoid it, and you probably
showed a loss.
It seems that gamblers themselves have started to become celebrities.
Wherever you saw ripples on the calm surface of the financial markets in the
April-June quarter, it appeared to be because the arch speculator George
Soros was throwing some rocks in.
His deal with Sir James Goldsmith in April over shares in Newmont, the
American gold producer (see page 9 of this Review), set the mining sector
and the bullion market temporarily alight. His entry into the UK commercial
property market, via a joint arrangement early in June with British Land,
promptly sent property shares jumping. Finally, a few days later he
proclaimed that the D-Mark was heading for a nasty fall, and it duly began
to slide.
But whenever Soros was not making waves, the markets seemed oddly quiet,
even though there was plenty going on. For example, a new chancellor,
Kenneth Clarke, was driving into Downing Street, while his predecessor
Norman Lamont was storming off to condemn the government's short-termism.
Meanwhile, the British economy started to recover quite convincingly, with a
decent pickup in manufacturing output and a steady fall in unemployment.
Inflation continued to track downwards, and sterling began to look quite
strong, at any rate against other European currencies, including a
distinctly off-colour D-Mark.
The disappointment for the stock market, perhaps, was that the next cut in
short-term interest rates failed to appear. Kenneth Clarke's arrival at the
Treasury at the end of May raised hopes of a change of emphasis in economic
policy, but they proved misguided, or at any rate premature.
Significantly, however, long-term interest rates continued to edge
downwards. By the end of the quarter, long-dated gilt-edged were yielding no
more than 8.11 per cent (compared with 9 per cent as recently as
mid-January). As in the January-March quarter, long gilts significantly
outperformed blue-chip equities, the ones included in the FT-SE 100 Index.
The Footsie has been stuck in a rut all year so far. It rose in the second
quarter, but by less than 1 per cent, and the trading range was a mere 2 per
cent either side of 2850. Share prices on Wall Street have become similarly
becalmed. No wonder George Soros has had to go into gold to find some
action.
Outside the boring top 100 stocks, however, there was quite a bit more to go
for in London equities. The FT-Actuaries SmallCap Index, which tracks the
fortunes of the smallest 450 shares in the All-Share Index, rose by a decent
6 per cent. That was not as good as in the first quarter, but after six
months of the year the SmallCap was up by a fifth, so a very reasonable bull
market has been taking place among the minnows.
The basic reason for this is that little matter of risk. Investors have been
encouraged to accept a little more risk this year, both because of the
evidence of economic recovery, and because the small companies that remain
in business at the end of the recession look like tough survivors. In
contrast, many industrial giants are still in the process of downsizing.
In 1991 and 1992 investors plunged headlong into the big, boring companies
which looked recession-proof. Now, many of those stocks are languishing: in
the second quarter, the food retailing, breweries, food manufacturing and
water sectors propped up the rest of the leaders and laggards table. To hit
the top, you had to go for speculative aerospace  - where British Aerospace
was the quarter's big individual winner - and crumbling construction, where
hope generally continued to triumph over experience (although sales of new
houses have begun to recover).
High risk has been the global theme, too. The best national stock market
during April-June was that of Italy. The country's economic and political
problems may still look daunting, but investors have become ready to gamble
that political reforms will provide a way of avoiding the crippling
financial crisis that has otherwise seemed inevitable.
Japan was the other market where returns to sterling-based investors were
close to 20 per cent for the quarter. The strength of the yen played a big
part here; otherwise, the Toyko market has seemed to offer recovery
potential, being still at only about half its all-time peak.
But there are big risks here, too, because the fundamental value in Japanese
stocks is often very poor, not least because the strength of the yen is
putting great pressure on profitability. Moreover, the political crisis that
blew up in June and triggered a snap election took the shine off the
quarter's gains towards the end of June.
British investors did not, however, have to punt in Tokyo or Milan to make
reasonable returns during the second quarter. The rule that return went hand
in hand with risk did not apply in the UK Government securities market
where, despite the overhanging threat of a huge borrowing requirement,
gilt-edged prices moved ahead.
Take an investor who bought stock in the Bank of England's auction of
Treasury 8 per cent, dated 2013, on March 31. By the end of June he was
showing capital appreciation of nearly 5 per cent.
The Bank of England has begun promoting gilts more actively to private
investors, issuing explanatory brochures and advertising the auctions in the
Saturday papers. Certainly savers have been taking increasing note of the
paucity of returns on bank and building society savings deposits.
But the main effect of cheaper money so far appears to have been a rush of
savings into unit trusts, which are predominantly invested in equities. In
both April and May, net sales of units topped Pounds 900m, and assuming June
sales (not yet reported) remained strong the quarter should have been the
best for the unit trust industry since the third quarter of 1987.
But will this flood of money go into the more promising sectors, or will
unit trust investors get stuck in the Footsie rut? Blue-chip income stocks
do not appear to be the right selections for current market conditions.
The name of Tenby, the red-hot favourite for the Derby has disappeared into
Epsom oblivion. In the stock market, too, the odds-on runners like Glaxo and
Unilever have been displaying feet of lead. There is more value these days
in the outsiders, and if you don't have the stomach for risky longshots,
perhaps you should try gilts instead.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Banks 'break code' on disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR BRYAN Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, yesterday accused
banks of breaking their own code of practice by evading requirements to gain
customers' consent before disclosing account information internally.
Sir Bryan said the 'spirit and perahaps even the letter' of the code was
being broken by banks when they required customers to give consent for
internal disclosure of information if they wanted to receive services.
He said the review committee under Sir George Blunden which is considering
alterations to the code from next March should recommend 'appropriately
strong action' to prevent banks from interpreting the code requirements
differently.
Banks have been keen to gain customer consent to disclose account details to
subsidiaries, such as insurance sales arms, because they are trying to
increase 'cross-selling' of other financial services to existing customers.
Sir Bryan listed different attitudes to the requirement that banks should
not disclose customer information except in cases 'where the disclosure is
made at the request, or with the consent, of the customer'.
These included a bank (thought to be Lloyds) that requires express consent,
and a bank that relies on 'negative consent' (thought to be a reference to
Midland's requirement that customers not wanting disclosure should tick a
box).
He also referred to a bank that 'insists on customers providing access'.
This is thought to be a reference to Barclays, which now tells customers
applying for a variety of financial products that an application implies
consent.
Finally, Sir Bryan said one bank had made its life insurance sales force
employees of the bank 'thereby giving them free access to customers'
accounts'. This is thought to be a reference to National Westminster.
In his submission to Sir George's review committee, Sir Bryan also called
for banks to be required to give 'best advice' on the choice of mortgages.
This would mean giving impartial advice between endowment and repayment
mortgages.
The Office of Fair Trading is thought to be concerned that the current code
of banking practice, introduced as a voluntary alternative to legislation in
March 1992, does not cover the growing range of financial services.
Sir Bryan also said the code should be extended to cover small businesses.

FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Stubborn FT-SE confounds investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market's dogged refusal to respond to the recent series of
positive data on the domestic economy continued to confound and confuse the
investment community yesterday.
Some dealers again took the view that the big international institutions
have been quietly shifting funds from the UK market to other European
centres, notably Frankfurt. There were more stories circulating yesterday
that one of the large European banks had taken out more big put options on
the FT-SE 100.
Market operators spoke of a Pounds 250m Footsie put option being taken out
on Wednesday. Others said the market would remain becalmed until the
international and retail tender part of BT3 closed later today. Another view
was that there was no real value in UK stocks.
At the close of another diff-icult trading session in London, the FT-SE 100
was 0.6 down on balance at 2,831.7, its fourth decline in the past five
trading sessions.
Without the support of a handful of strong performances, notably from Great
Universal Stores, Lloyds Bank and BAT Industries, the FT-SE 100 would have
been around four points lower yesterday.
There was some measure of consolation for investors, however, in the
performance of the market's second-line issues, with the FT-SE Mid 250 index
managing to stay in positive territory throughout the day and closing a net
three points higher at 3,225.5.
The session began on a bright note, with the market opening two points
firmer, with the initial rise entirely due to the upsurge in GUS shares as
the retailing group comfirmed recent market rumours that it was to
enfranchise its 'A' non-voting shares and reduce the post-enfranchised
shares via a scrip issue. The moves accompanied an increase in preliminary
profits and a bullish view of current trading.
GUS's move prompted keen interest in other stocks with similar voting
structures, such as WH Smith, Securicor, Whitbread and Hammerson.
After the initial burst of enthusiasm caused by GUS, the market calmed down
and thereafter moved in a narrow range, in spite of a series of positive
economic and corporate news items.
The retailing sector, already in good form, picked up further as Marks and
Spencer's chairman told the group's annual meeting that the company had made
a good start to the year. Much of the proceeds of Wednesday's big placing in
Abbey National was reinvested in Lloyds Bank and Prudential, while Morgan
Stanley's buy recommendation triggered some big US-sourced buying of BAT.
News of yet another reduction in unemployment in the UK, the fifth
successive decline, and a sharp fall in UK unit wage costs, saw the Footsie
edge higher.
Thereafter, the market did little more than drift back in idle trading, with
sentiment given a slight knock when Wall Street came in lower and continued
to lose ground.
Traders took encouragement from the level of turnover in the market. Some
611m shares changed hands yesterday, well up from recent levels.
Stock Exchange figures revealed that the value of customer business in the
market on Wendesday was a healthy Pounds 1.39bn.
Activity was boosted by a series of sizeable placings.

FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent buoyancy in the property sector swelled into a wave of support as
investors vied to take advantage of attractive yield rates and a shortage of
stock pushed up prices. As gilts have strengthened and their yields have
fallen back, the appeal of property has increased and share prices were
boosted as big investors crowded into an area with few sellers.
More upbeat signals moved the sector, with Savills, the chartered surveyors,
predicting that there will be a shortage of office space in London in three
years. And yet another successful rights issue further stressed the interest
in property shares. The wave of excitement also triggered a resurgence of a
number of bid rumours in the market.
One trader commented that the optimism was likely to last: 'There has been a
lot of good news but the sector is also very strongly underpinned.'
Trading began very briskly in property stocks, although it trailed off a
little towards the end of the day. British Land added 2 at 343p and Brixton
Estates put on 8 at 210p. Great Portland Estates firmed 6 to 183p, while
Frogmore Estates gained 10 at 394p as hopes rose that its recent rights
issue would be a success. Burford, which announced a 98.7 per cent take-up
of its rights offer, went up 2 to 69p.
Peel Holdings, which plans to buy a minority stake in Manchester Ship Canal,
climbed 11 to 244p. The latter was 5 higher at 26 1/2 p.
Norcros hardened 2 to 154p after SG Warburg and NatWest Securities placed
the rump of the recent rights issue. The two securities houses placed 38.8m
shares at 151p.
Heavy turnover in Cray Electronics left the shares 5 adrift at 149 1/2 p as
one large shareholder sold a block of 7.6m shares - just under 4 per cent of
the issued equity - to SG Warburg at 44p, the broking house selling the
stock on at 46p.
A shortage of stock early in the session drove Standard Chartered sharply
forward for the second day in a row, the shares adding 16 at 843p in the
first hour of trading. However, profit-taking later in the day saw most of
the gain surrendered and the shares finished 6 up on balance at 833p.
Lloyds Bank moved ahead 13 to 588p amid reports that some of the proceeds of
Wednesday's big agency cross in Abbey National had been used to buy Lloyds
shares. Volume was 4.3m at the close. Abbey finished 5 lower at 404p. TSB
ended the session 3 firmer at 198p, with Swiss Bank Corporation said to be
positive following a visit to the group.
Wednesday's announcement of a new chairman at Simon Engineering continued to
cheer the market and the shares climbed 6 to 50p. TT Group gave up 7 to 286p
after announcing a Pounds 51m rights issue to help fund the company's
expansion. BICC was in demand ahead of next month's figures and the shares
appreciated 10 to 411p.
Among motor issues, general profit-taking in Lookers saw the shares
relinquish 11 to 143p. ERF Holdings continued to be powered by a
recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing and the stock jumped a further 21
to 281p.
General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange retreated after Goldman Sachs,
the US investment bank, reiterated its negative stance. Mr Graham Warren at
the bank believes the earnings recovery will not be as fast or as
sustainable as that predicted by many. In addition, he said: 'There is
likely to be tougher competition from European companies in due course.'
General Accident closed 7 cheaper at 617p, while GRE receded 3 to 199p.
However, Goldman favours Commercial Union, 3 easier at 616p, and Royal
Insurance, which shed 2 to 319p.
International trading group BAT Industries continued to attract attention
following Wednesday's 'buy' recommendation from Morgan Stanley. Volume rose
to a hefty 14m, with most of that total said to have been a result of strong
overnight US buying. The shares rose 9 to 427p, with NatWest Securities also
said to have shown a keen interest in the stock.
US buying of shares in transport rental company Tiphook reversed an earlier
decline. At the day's worst the shares were down 15 at 244p, before
recovering to end just a penny off at 258p.
Positive trading news from Marks and Spencer added strength to a strong
stores sector. M&amp;S gained 5 at 337p. Elsewhere, Kingfisher put on 9 at 583p,
with Goldman Sachs said to be positive, while Boots climbed 5 to 422p.
Coats Viyella, which is a main supplier of fabrics and soft furnishings to
Marks and Spencer, moved up 6 to 234p.
Forminster, the clothing manufacturer, advanced 25 to 538p in a thin market.
Sherwood Group staged a rally after the previous day's fall, improving 9 to
144p. NatWest Securities, its broker, switched its stance from hold to buy.
Welsh Water moved forward 9 to 562p after better than expected figures.

FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A roller coaster ride in Rank Organisation saw the shares move through a
45-point spread, ending the day 20 lower at 747p. Turnover was a hefty 5.1m.
The stock had opened with a healthy 20p advance as investors seemed to
welcome the leisure group's plans to bring the final dividend payment
forward to the half-year stage and to make an enhanced scrip issue.
However, a dull analysts' meeting with the group's management set the tone
for a steep slide in the shares. Disappointment that trading was showing few
signs of improvement was allied with a lack of news on Rank's disposal
programme.
Analysts returned to largely downgrade the group, moving from the Pounds
270m to Pounds 280m range to Pounds 255m to Pounds 265m. The negative market
tone was fuelled by the feeling of some large shareholders - in particular
income funds - that the new dividend arrangements would mean a gap in
payment of 12 months.

FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vote move boost for GUS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS from Great Universal Stores that it is to enfranchise its
non-voting stock sent the 'A' and the ordinary shares shooting forward,
exciting other stocks with dual voting structures on the way. It also
prompted a welter of speculation over the future of one of the most
secretive retailing empires, with analysts divided as to whether the move
could make GUS ripe for break-up - or whether it might prompt it to become
more acquisitive.
Spice was added to the rumours by the appointment of Lord Wolfson of
Sunningdale, the chairman of Next, to the GUS board yesterday, with some
speculation that the two groups could be planning closer ties.
The share-change announcement was made with the group's results, which came
in line with market forecasts but with a higher than expected dividend.
The shares jumped on news of the enfranchisement. The ordinary finished 100
ahead at 3438p, after touching 3600p, while the 'A' added 110 at 1875p,
after 1920p. Turnover was 3.3m, the heaviest ever recorded for the stock.
Other dual voting stocks were put in the spotlight. However, analysts were
mostly sceptical that other companies would follow suit in the near term,
although they conceded that the investor enthusiasm that had greeted the GUS
move could have a longer term effect.
In the case of Whitbread, drinks analysts pointed out that the cost of
dilution to compensate the current voting shareholders might far outweigh
any other benefits. Such consideration took the shine off the non-voting 'A'
shares, which ended just 2 up at 481p, while the 'B' shares fell back to
finish level at 998p.
Other stocks were seen as more likely candidates. Hammerson ordinary climbed
16 to 353p and the 'A' 15 to 322p as takeover rumours also circulated. WH
Smith 'A' gained 9 at 447p and the 'B' 2 1/2 at 88p.

FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEARTH of economic indicators left dealers in stock index futures
suffering from a lack of direction and hampered movement in the September
FT-SE 100 contract, Christine Buckley writes.
While there had been some hopes circulating the previous day of a cut in
German interest rates, they had all but faded by yesterday morning, and the
announcement of no change had little effect on trading.
The flagging performance of futures was also blamed by one trader on a
continued switching of investor interest from the UK to Germany and France.
Trading was restricted to a very tight range. The contract opened at 2,841,
and a reasonable early morning take-up pushed it to the day's high of 2,849.
It then eased gradually, touching a low for the session of 2,837 after
lunchtime. But that nadir was brief and supportive buying kept the future
bobbing around the 2,840 mark, at which it closed with volume of 7,287
contracts recorded.
The September contract finished on a par with its fair value premium to
cash, which is taken as 7 points.
Turnover in traded options notched ahead of the previous day with a total of
28,814 lots traded, against 26,932. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was
5,375, while the Euro FT-SE 100 option continued to see lively trading ahead
of today's expiry of its July contract.

FT  16 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Drug shares decline on
downgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A LATE burst of buying allowed US stock markets to recover from early losses
and big declines in drug issues and finish the day little changed and still
close to record highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.38 at 3,550.93,
within four points of the all-time high set in late May. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.86 softer at 449.22, although the
Nasdaq composite was down 3.80 at 708.69 after the previous day's record
peak. Trading volume on the New York SE was 278m shares.
Following Wednesday's gains, when stocks neared, or broke through, record
highs, market observers were not surprised when prices fell from the start
amid some early profit-taking. It was not until the last hour of trading
that prices rallied from their lows amid late buying. The day's economic
news was mixed: a smaller than expected rise in weekly jobless claims and a
sharp drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's July index of local
business activity.
Although corporate earnings came in quickly, the day's main story was the
drugs sector. Prices tumbled in busy trading after Ms Christina Heuer, the
sector analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, downgraded her investment
rating on the pharmaceuticals group as a whole from 'neutral' to
'underperform'.
Ms Heuer said she believed that some of the big drug companies will cut
their dividends to preserve cash, and that equity prices could fall by a
further 20 to 30 per cent in the short term.
Almost every major drug stock fell sharply on the downgrade. Pfizer shed
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Merck Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 3/4 ,
Schering-Plough Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 66 1/8 , American Home Products
Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 5/8 , Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
58, Warner-Lambert Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 and Eli Lilly Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 .
Another stock to be hit by a downgrade, and disappointing second-quarter
results, was Storage Technology, which plummeted Dollars 7 7/8 to Dollars 33
1/4 after Lehman Brothers and Kemper Securities lowered their ratings on the
stock and cut 1993 earnings forecasts.
Time Warner dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 1/8 after posting a
second-quarter loss, although underlying operating earnings were up by 10
per cent.
On the Nasdaq market, Scitex plunged Dollars 9 5/8 to Dollars 28 3/8 on a
profits warning, and SynOptics Communications slid Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars
31 3/4 on disappointing second-quarter earnings.
Canada
TORONTO ended on a mildly easier note after heavy trading. The TSE 300 index
lost 10.4 at 3,931.3 and declining issues outscored rises by 397 to 328.
Volume amounted to 65m shares valued at CDollars 732m.
Eight of the 14 sub-group indices were lower, with mining down 1.7 per cent
and leading the way.
American Barrick, CDollars  1/8 up at CDollars 31 1/8 , reported sharply
higher second-quarter and six-month earnings and revenues.

FT  16 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stands firm on
hopes of support for economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BROADLY BASED buying prompted by hopes of fiscal and monetary support for
the economy lifted share prices, but late afternoon profit-taking by dealers
and arbitrageurs wiped out most of the gains, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 18.91 up at 20,158.02 after a day's high of
20,394.64 set in the early afternoon which reflected buying by overseas
investors, domestic institutions, individuals and dealers. However,
arbitrage-related selling towards the close, after a fall in the futures
index, pushed the Nikkei to a day's low of 20,144.21.
Volume rose to 400m shares from 308m. Advances outnumbered declines by 678
to 321, with 168 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 8.10 at 1,639.68, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended
3.30 firmer at 1,245.18.
Traders said opinion polls which suggested that the ruling Liberal
Democratic party could retain its pre-election strength also encouraged
index sentiment. 'There is a gradual recovery in confidence as some of the
initial uncertainties are starting to be removed,' one trader remarked.
Cosmo Oil, the day's most active issue, climbed Y13 to Y880 on reports that
it was participating in an oil field development project in Vietnam. Nippon
Kayaku, a chemicals group which trailed Cosmo in volume, jumped Y32 to Y866.
Buying orders came in on speculation that it would gain a large share in the
epoxy resin market, after an explosion at Sumitomo Chemical's epoxy resin
plant earlier this month.
Kirin Brewery, the country's largest brewer, receded Y20 to Y1,260. Company
executives were arrested on Wednesday on charges of paying about Y33m to
racketeers.
Gajoen Kanko, whose top shareholder, Dream, filed for court protection,
dropped by its daily limit of Y80 to Y143 after Wednesday's trading
suspension.
Kyocera, the leading maker of semiconductor ceramic packages, put on Y230 at
Y6,230 on hopes of firm profits due to a recovery in the semiconductor
industry. Speculation that Daini Denden, in which Kyocera has a 25 per cent
stake, would apply for listing also supported sentiment.
Banks were stronger on hopes of lower interest rates. Industrial Bank of
Japan rose Y50 to Y3,180 and Sakura Bank Y10 to Y1,650. Brokers were also
higher, with Nomura Securities up Y10 to Y2,060.
In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 131.34 to 22,288.77 in volume of 32.2m
shares.
Roundup
THE overnight advance on Wall Street supported some of the region's markets
yesterday.
HONG KONG rose on active trading in Tsingtao Brewery - the first Chinese
company to be listed in Hong Kong - and in other China-related stocks.
The Hang Seng index gained 23.04 at 6,978.54 in turnover up from HKDollars
3.34bn to HKDollars 3.77bn. Tsingtao ended at HKDollars 3.625, against its
offer price of HKDollars 2.80. A total of 173.6m shares in the brewery,
worth HKDollars 623.9m, were traded.
Among other China-related issues, Tung Wing Steel rose 65 cents, or 12 per
cent, to HKDollars 6.
SINGAPORE's shipyard stocks took the heaviest falls as the Straits Times
Industrial index shed 12.16 to 1,762.95 in volume of 99.4m shares.
Neptune Orient Lines dipped 8 cents to SDollars 1.55 amid uncertainty over
the exercise price for converting the company's 13.2m preference shares into
ordinary stock. Brokers said the authorities were investigating a sharp fall
in Neptune shares on Monday over possible price manipulation.
TAIWAN reported selling of financial shares as the weighted index slipped
53.30, or 1.3 per cent, to 3,969.17. Turnover was a thin TDollars 14.4bn,
against TDollars 15.3bn.
Leading banks, which had performed well after announcing an average 80 per
cent growth in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year ended June 30, retreated
yesterday. Chang Hwa Bank relinquished TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 123, First
Bank TDollars 4.50 to TDollars 145.50 and Hua Nan Bank TDollars 3 to
TDollars 133.50.
MANILA was supported by Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which added 5
pesos at 1,005 pesos. The composite index gained 7.09 at 1,624.07. Turnover
was 415.6m pesos.
NEW ZEALAND's Lion Nathan moved forward 6 cents to NZDollars 3.36 following
its share placing on Wednesday. The NZSE-40 index rose 4.83 to 1,711.45 in
turnover of NZDollars 44m.
BOMBAY lost ground in a session limited to just one hour of trading. The BSE
index closed 25.31 down at 2,159.93. KARACHI moved higher after a government
announcement of incentives to boost exports. The KSE index finished 4.49
firmer at 1,268.20.

FT  16 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Pressure on franc contributes
to weaker Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to hold interest rates seemed to have little
effect on bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was slightly disappointed by the Bundesbank decision. Pressure on the
franc continued in the money markets, sending the currency even closer to
its ERM floor. Nevertheless, said brokers, the recent show of unity between
French and German politicians, as well as frequent intervention by central
banks to support the franc, suggests that the currency will weather the
present storm.
The CAC-40 index lost 28.07 or 1.4 per cent to 1,963.08 in turnover of some
FFr3.2bn. Weakness in the bond market contributed to the fall in equities,
while some profit-taking was also in evidence after last week's gains as
speculation had intensified that devaluation might be imminent.
Lyonnaise-Dumez weakened after a negative analysts meeting and news that one
of its divisions had suspended payments. The shares lost FFr19.80, or 4 per
cent to FFr462.10. Generale des Eaux initially gained from some switching
out of Lyonnaise, but as speculation that it might sell its Cie Immobiliere
Phenix fizzled out the shares lost ground, closing down FFr11 at FFr2,114.
FRANKFURT, barely moved by the Bundesbank's lack of action on interest
rates, saw the DAX index slip 3.99 to 1,807.66 as the arguments continued
over its prospects.
Merrill Lynch said that the enthusiasm over recovery prospects in German
cyclicals is misplaced: 'The present euphoria is likely to evaporate as
concerns over potential recovery in 1994 arise and further cuts in interest
rates are seen to be grudgingly low'.
In Frankfurt, Mr Patrick Bettscheider, equity dealing head at Bank Julius
Bar, said that the bank's UK-based clients were heavily underweight, and
waiting for a correction to 1,750. He thought that there would be big buying
if the DAX gets down to 1,780.
Turnover fell from DM9.6bn to DM8.4bn. BASF rose by DM2 to DM252.20; Bank
Julius Bar said that BASF has a gas pipeline which will break the Ruhrgas
monopoly in Germany and add DM5 a share to BASF earnings from 1995.
ZURICH fell on profit-taking, the SMI index losing 11.8 to 2,399.1. Sandoz
ended SFr25 lower at SFr3,340 on interim results which, said Ms Birgit
Kulhoff, pharmaceuticals analyst at Swiss Volksbank, took in lower than
expected turnover, and higher earnings.
Meanwhile, SMH dropped SFr14 to SFr238 as Mr Martin Newson, at Goldman Sachs
in London, took it off his buy list. Mr Newson said that he had been a long
time bull of the stock and that, indeed, he had just upgraded his earnings
forecast for the watchmaker; but the share price, he said, had gone high
enough.
MILAN was unsettled by news of further delays in the privatisation
programme, particularly in the telecommunications sector. Hopes that the
privatisation of Stet would go ahead speedily following the announcement on
Wednesday that Italcable and Sip were to be merged, evaporated as quickly
yesterday. The government said yesterday that the privatisation of Stet will
only take place after the sector is reorganised, with most analysts setting
a date sometime in the latter half of 1994.
Stet shed L20 to L3,905 at the close, before going to L3,890 on the kerb.
Italcable lost L316 to L7,574. The Comit index inched 0.91 ahead to 554.57.
There was news of another delay in the privatisation programme, this time of
two weeks, in the sale of Sme, the state food group. Bureaucratic delays
were blamed as the shares lost L107 to L5,962.
Among insurers, Generali briefly broke the L40,000 resistance level on
strong overseas buying, before closing L960 higher at L39,750. Brokers
commented that there was also steady activity in second line insurers.
AMSTERDAM was attracted to KLM on the cyclical recovery theme as the shares
rose Fl 2 .40 to Fl 33.40, mainly on overseas interest. Since the start of
the month the shares have risen by some 27 per cent.
The CBS Tendency index lost 0.1 to 117.0. DSM, another cyclical favourite,
fell back Fl 1.00 to Fl 97.30 after recent strong gains and an 11 per cent
rise since July 1. Kleinwort Benson issued a sell recommendation yesterday
in anticipation of disappointing second quarter results due later this month
and downgraded its 1993 profits forecast to Fl 7m from Fl 246m in 1992.
STOCKHOLM showed continued strength in Ericsson which has been attracting
substantial overseas buying this week, the B shares adding another SKr17 to
SKr383. The Affarsvarlden index put on 5.10 to 1,14490.90. Shipping stocks
were behind the gains in OSLO as the All share index improved 2.87 to
518.59, a 22 month high.
MADRID continued its pattern of little movement in thin trading, the general
index losing 0.73 to 259.31 as the peseta fluctuated in the foreign exchange
market. Construction stocks saw the worst of the declines, with Uralita down
Pta24 to Pta822 in spite of a Nomura buy recommendation.
TEL AVIV continued its up and down career, the blue chip index recovering
4.11 to 195.95 in anticipation of a slowdown in inflation which was
confirmed after hours.

FT  16 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Italy leads June turnover recovery -
But Switzerland showed the real strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far from selling in May and going away, investors came back to European
bourses in June as the FT-Actuaries Europe index rose by 3 per cent in local
currency terms.
After month-on-month falls of 25 per cent in April, as political and
economic worries took their toll, and 2.3 per cent in an indecisive May,
aggregate turnover in Europe's eight biggest equity markets increased by 20
per cent over the month.
There were signs that domestic investors were returning to their markets,
says Mr James Cornish, a strategist with NatWest Securities, which produces
the figures. Seaq International, the London-based screen trading system,
showed a rise of 8.9 per cent on the month, indicating that international
investors were relatively quiet.
Recording the greatest turnover increase for the month was Italy, a rise of
56.9 per cent taking it back to the levels it enjoyed in March and April.
This was no small thing. Turnover of upwards of L30,000bn a month in Italy
takes it to three or four times the level it averaged in the first half of
1992; and there had been fears that Italian volume would not recover, as the
ever-widening corruption scandal blighted hopes of a post-devaluation
economic recovery.
Switzerland, once again, outperformed a rising Europe in share price terms
with a gain of 4.7 per cent on strong fundamentals, a rising dollar, the
view that its banks were still quite cheap, and a recovery in the
pharmaceutical sector after worries about President Bill Clinton's
healthcare package in the US.
Swiss turnover showed a rise of 48.5 per cent on the month. The question
arising from this is why Dutch turnover only increased by 7.6 per cent in
June: Amsterdam bourse performance ran parallel with that of Zurich, showing
a gain of 4.7 per cent in local terms on the month and 15.7 per cent for the
six months to June, compared with 9.7 per cent for Europe as a whole.
Mr Cornish reckons that the turnover arose from the quality of the stocks
underlying the gains in the market. So, while Switzerland's winners had
strong defensive qualities, the Netherlands saw a highly cyclical upturn
based on shares such as those of DSM, the chemicals group, or Hoogovens, in
steels. In this instance, he thinks, there was more of a trading quality to
the gains.
Germany rose by 26.2 per cent on the month, just ahead of the French 25.5
per cent increase on the post-election sell-off. Foreign buying of German
stocks increased on signs that the west German economy was bottoming out;
but there, the fun is still to come, with turnover in the first nine trading
days of July up by 49 per cent from the average for June.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Danes feel ERM strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH central bank sent a flutter through European exchange markets
yesterday by raising its two-week repo rate by 1.2 percentage points to
defend the krone, writes Stephanie Flanders.
The Danes' action came before the news that the Bundesbank and Bank of
France were leaving their official interest rates unchanged. The rate
increase left Danish real interest rates at 8 per cent on the day that
Danish GDP was announced to have fallen by 1.6 per cent in the first quarter
of the year. The combined effect was to heighten speculation that the Danish
currency was in trouble, while the tension surrounding the French franc
subsided.
Traders reported interventions by the Danish and Dutch authorities
throughout the day, as the krone fluctuated widely. There was a flurry of
rumours, thought to have begun in the New York market, that the Danish
government was making plans to leave the ERM. But few analysts took them
seriously. 'I give them two out of ten for credibility,' said Ms Alison
Cottrell at Midland Global Markets in London.
Some thought that the active rumour market was itself a sign that the
speculators had lost their nerve. Perhaps supporting this view, the Danish
currency was able to finish slightly above Wednesday's European close of
DKr3.8951 per D-Mark, at DKr3.8925.
Meanwhile, the pressure on the French franc eased a little, with the
currency hovering between FFr3.41 and FFr3.42 for most of the day. Analysts
continue to differ on the long term prospects for the franc fort policy.
Mr Brian Hilliard, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull in London, said that ultimately the existing parities would
survive.
'What is happpening is a scare, not a fatal blow,' he commented. 'The fact
that the Bundesbank did not reduce rates yesterday morning led many people
to write off further German moves to help the franc,' he added. 'But there
is plenty more that they can do to help the French. The Bundesbank's
commitment to support the franc is total.'
On the other side of the spectrum was Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank in
London: 'The absence of a Bundesbank rate move puts another nail in the
coffin of the ERM.'
Gaining, as ever, from the uncertainty in continental Europe was the dollar,
which rose against the D-Mark for most of the day. The US currency ended at
DM1.7245 in London, up from Wednesday's DM1.7155. In New York, however, it
eased back to a DM1.7207 close. 'The dollar can only gain as long as the
European turmoil continues,' said one London trader.
The pound suffered against the D-Mark, but this was considered to be the
result of profit-taking, rather than a re-evaluation of sterling's
underlying strength. It finished at DM2.5650, down 1 1/4 pfennigs.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Germany disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank was quick to inform the market yesterday that there would be
no reduction in German interest rates for the time being, writes Stephanie
Flanders.
Although German Lombard and discount rates stay unchanged until the next
council meeting on July 29, short rates were still able to fall, due to the
extra liquidity provided in Wednesday's repo tender. One-month German money
closed at around 7.24 per cent, down from Wednesday's 7.40 per cent.
There was more movement in Danish money market rates, following the central
bank's decision to increase its repo rate from 7.80 per cent to 9 per cent.
This drew attention away from France, where the central bank held its
inter-vention rate at 6.75 per cent and the repo rate at 7.75 per cent.
Three-month French money market rates fell during the day, reflecting the
general lull in the tension surrounding the franc, rather than a fundamental
shift in market opinion.
Meanwhile, sterling money markets were unsettled at the short end today by a
lingering shortage which at one point took overnight rates as high as 7 1/2
per cent.
The Bank of England had forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn, which was later
revised to Pounds 1.45bn, but it did not enter the market in the morning.
Afternoon discount market operations later dispatched the shortfall, and
dealers did not generally think that the Bank had been signalling a rate
change. Overnight money fell back to 6 3/4 per cent.
Other sterling money market rates were steady, in spite of the fifth
consecutive fall in UK unemployment and a large reduction in unit wage
costs.
As one trader pointed out, the unemployment data would have pleased the
financial markets either way. 'It was a win-win situation,' he said. 'The
promising figures mean that Britain is headed for precisely the kind of
recov-ery that the markets would like to see, but weak fig-ures would have
signalled an early rate cut, which is also desirable.'
Overall, it was felt that the figures conveyed little new information, and
this was reflected in the trading in sterling futures.
The September contract declined 4 basis points to finish at 94.18, while the
December contract was down slightly less to a close of 94.43.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Antofagasta takes the slow
train to success - How one of Chile's leading copper producers bought a
railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andronico Luksic was so angry about the standard of service provided by
his local railway that he decided to buy the company and put things right.
That is how one of Chile's leading copper producers came to be quoted on the
London Stock Exchange.
For the company was the Antofagasta (Chile) and Bolivia Railway, established
in 1888 with British capital to haul freight and people from Antofagasta on
the coast of Chile up through the mountains to La Paz in Bolivia and back.
Mr Luksic's first contact with the railway came when he wanted it to
transport some very large tonnages of copper concentrate. He was referred to
a book of tariffs containing more than 2,000 entries, one for almost every
conceivable type of copper ore or concentrate. The railway's bureaucrats
insisted on charging 'by the book' - there was no such thing as a quantity
discount.
'That made me look more closely at the railway and I decided it must be the
most badly managed business in the world,' Mr Luksic recalls. During long,
boring drives to copper operations in Chile's Atacama desert, the road often
ran parallel to the railway, and this set Mr Luksic thinking about what
changes he would make if he was managing the railway company. Eventually he
decided it would make great sense to buy it and to put his ideas into
action.
He was rebuffed two or three times by the main UK shareholders, but in 1980
he bought control from the Rothschild merchant bank and some of its
partners. Within six months, he had put most of his ideas into action and
moved the railway from losses into profits. Today his family still owns
about 67 per cent of what is now called Antofagasta Holdings, or 'Fags'.
The railway still has 30 locomotives and 2,000 wagons to move freight in
Chile and to Bolivia. Once a week some passenger coaches are attached to the
train to La Paz. Fags has spread its interests into forestry,
telecommunications and banking, but Mr Luksic, now the chairman, says his
first love remains mining - he bought his first copper mine in 1953 when he
was 24 years old.
'We are in many different business and it will stay that way. But mining
will grow faster than the rest because that is where we are making the big
investments.'
Fags has spent about Dollars 200m in the past two years on its copper
operations and could easily justify spending another Dollars 1bn. But it
will not spend that much because Mr Luksic prefers not to borrow. Fags
claims to be the lowest-geared public limited company in the UK and has only
a Pounds 3m overdraft that will be paid off by the end of 1993.
Mr Luksic's aversion to debt will have a fundamental impact on the way Fags'
copper business will develop. For example, the group is joint owner and
operator of the Los Pelambres copper mine, 300km north of Santiago, which
started production last year and stands on what Mr Luksic suggests could be
the world's third-largest copper deposit. Fags' partners are Midland Bank of
the UK and Lucky-Goldstar, the Korean group. Already there are plans to
double or triple annual production at Los Pelambres. Mr Luksic would prefer
to take the slow route, spending Dollars 50m to take output to about 40,000
tonnes and then employing the mine's cash flow to step up to 60,000 in 10
years time.
He believes that Midland would prefer to speed expansion by spending between
Dollars 500m and Dollars 800m to go to an annual 60,000 tonnes in only three
years. 'But then we would be working for the banks for the next 10 years,'
says Mr Luksic who is more than likely to get his way on this issue.
Los Pelambres is on a deposit estimated to contain 3bn tonnes of ore
containing 0.7 per cent copper. Fags is earning its way from its present 20
per cent stake to one of 65 per cent. 'The way costs are coming down, this
won't take long,' says Mr Luksic. Anaconda, the US group, spent Dollars 55m
to drill Los Pelambres and to build roads and a camp. Fags paid Dollars 13m
for its stake.
Mr Luksic can think seriously about expanding Los Pelambres now the
finishing touches are being put to a scheme to merge two neighbouring mines,
Michilla and Lince, which share the same copper deposit. Michilla produced
25,200 tonnes of copper last year while Lince, where Dollars 60m was spent,
came into production last January. Fags is to close an old plant 30kms from
the mines, which produces an unusual intermediate material, copper
precipitate, from Michilla's ore. Instead, copper cathodes will be produced
by the inexpensive solvent extraction-electro winning process at Lince. 'Not
only will this cut our costs, it will also give us a more saleable product,'
Mr Luksic points out.
Fags bought out its partner in Lince, Outokumpu of Finland, last year for
Dollars 36m cash to smooth the way for the changes.
Mr Luksic admits he is under pressure from colleagues to develop quickly a
copper mine at the Sorpressa deposit in the El Tesoro area, 150 kms from
Antofagasta. The deposit lies on the same geographical fault line as Chile's
two biggest copper mines, Chuquicamata and Escondida.
Fags has already found 100m tonnes of very high grade - 2 per cent - copper,
enough for a big mine, and is spending only Dollars 1m a year drilling to
find more. Every mining company operating in Chile has staked some land in
the area because Sorpressa's copper is 'exotic', washed there from what must
be a huge, high-grade deposit elsewhere, probably close by.
Mr Luksic says one drawback at Sorpressa is that the exotic copper is very
difficult to release from the ore. Also: 'Before we get to Sorpressa we must
do the Lince and Los Pelambres expansions. And also the Qui Punita (a gold
deposit in Argentina) is looking good. So it may be four years before we get
to Sorpressa.'
Gencor of South Africa is one of the partners with Fags in La Coipita, which
owns the gold project in Argentina.
Argentina has no mining tradition but Mr Luksic believes the country has a
great deal of copper potential and Fags will go looking for the metal now
that the law has been changed to permit Chilean companies to own mines in
Argentina. He says: 'Only 10 per cent of the Andes belongs to Chile, the
rest is in Argentina. Why should all the copper be the Chile side of the
line?'
Fags is also taking an interest in the sale by Codelco, Chile's state-owned
group, of the El Abra deposit, which has 500m tonnes of ore containing 1 per
cent copper. But 18 other international mining companies have expressed
interest.
Given Mr Luksic's dislike of bank debt, any large acquisition would require
a rights issue by Fags. He says: 'If we had a chance to buy something
cheaply we might have a rights issue.' That would provide an opportunity to
reduce his family's holding. 'It might be beneficial to have the shares more
widely held,' he admits.
Meanwhile, 'as we are not sellers of the shares, the price does not concern
us, although some of the family buy shares from time to time. Neither do I
worry about the copper price - I only worry about my costs. I've been 40
years in this business and there are no copper market gurus who can tell you
with certainty what the price will be'.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Community lifts ban on Polish
meat deliveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLISH MEAT deliveries to the European Community, halted three months ago
because of a foot-and-mouth disease scare, are to resume.
The EC imposed bans on imports of livestock, meat, milk and dairy products
from 18 central and eastern European countries in early April after cases of
the disease were discovered in northern Italy. Most of the bans were lifted
later that month following the agreement of tighter quarantine rules and
stricter enforcement of export certification procedures, but the controls on
imports from Poland remained.
The latest Brussels decision follows a compromise with the Poles on
quarantine for animals before shipment.
Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, Poland's minister in charge of European
integration said yesterday: 'It's obvious that the disease was used as a
pretext to try and eliminate the export of Polish calves and lambs to the
EC.' The ban had meant the loss of Dollars 30m worth of meat exports, he
added.
'This wasn't a catastrophe but it was important as it was the first time in
our relations with the EC that we have had to deal with subterfuge by the
bureaucrats in Brussels.'
Polish meat exporters' costs will increase by about 10 per cent as a result
of the new quarantine rules. The Poles estimate that the break in sales
means that the country will only be able to use up two-thirds of this year's
meat quota, which includes 190,000 head of cattle, 150,000 calves and
750,000 sheep.
No cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been identified in Poland for 21
years.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poor market outlook pushes
cocoa prices up Pounds 16
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S COCOA futures market maintained its buoyant mood yesterday with
nearby positions reaching 19-month highs. The September contract, which rose
by Pounds 11 on Wednesday, touched Pounds 789 a tonne before closing at
Pounds 775 a tonne, up Pounds 16 on the day.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at London broker GNI, attributed the recent
change of sentiment to a growing realisation that the structural imbalance
that had developed in the world cocoa market would continue to worsen until
prices moved out of the depressed range in which they had been confined for
much of this year.
While consumption had gone on rising by 2-3 per cent a year, overall world
production had stagnated, he explained. That had resulted in the
supply/demand deficits of the past two years and the 'near certainty' of
another in 1993-94.
Early indications were that this year's Ivory Coast and Ghana crops would be
'average at best', he said, while the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer,
had, to the surprise of many international cocoa dealers, stood by its
decision to ban exports of mid-crop beans.

FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices plunge on fears of
Iraq-UN export deal

WORLD OIL prices plunged to three-year lows yesterday as traders feared Iraq
was close to agreement on limited exports in talks with the United Nations.
Although London and New York prices recovered slightly after sharp drops in
late trading on Wednesday, the price for North Sea Brent crude remained at
its lowest since June 1990.
During the day the North Sea Brent blend price for September delivery
slipped 22 1/2 cents to Dollars 16.45 a barrel from the official close on
Wednesday, but in after-hours trading on Wednesday it had touched Dollars
16.25 a barrel.
By yesterday's close it had steadied to Dollars 16.66 a barrel but traders
were not ruling out a renewed decline.
'It's dropping like a stone and there's no bottom in sight yet,' said Mr
Peter Gignoux at Smith Barney in London.
Iraqi officials, who were attending the UN talks in New York, left on
Wednesday for Baghdad with a draft agreement, but it did not cover all the
technical points necessary for the oil sale. The Iraqis want to sell Dollars
1.6bn-worth of oil to pay for humanitarian aid.
UN officials said the talks would resume next week although they declined to
specify on which day. If an agreement is reached on the sale, Iraq will
probably be able to deliver between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day for
six months. But it is unlikely that oil would reach the market before
September.
Prospects for the oil market until then look pretty bleak. Traders say
buyers are reluctant to return to the market until the uncertainty over the
oil sales is removed. In addition, speculation over action by members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been heightened by the
weak market.
'Traders are trying to come to terms with the impact of possible Iraqi sales
and any remedial action Opec might take,' said Mr Andrew LeBow, analyst with
EDF Man, the New York trading house.
Opec has continued its telephone diplomacy, with several ministers including
the Kuwaiti oil minister denying the need for an emergency meeting. But the
organisation cannot really act until it is clear what will emerge from the
Iraqi talks.
Opec members are still producing more than their ceiling and they will come
under a lot of internal political pressure to counteract the slide in oil
prices. However, to hold an inconclusive meeting before there is any
resolution of the Iraqi talks could be worse than holding no meeting at all.
