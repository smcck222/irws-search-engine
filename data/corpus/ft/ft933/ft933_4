THE FIERY saxophone partnership of US tenorist Chico Freeman and altoist
Arthur Blythe has has been at Ronnie Scott's all week. They have been joined
by their regular rhythm section, the raffish Idris Mohammed on drums and
Curtis Lundy on upright bass, plus the young British pianist Julian Joseph
to make up a quintet.
Freeman and Blythe create an eccentric but compelling sound together. Where
Freeman's tenor technique is impetuous but also sensitive, his stout partner
ploughs a straighter furrow, making sense of the leader's flights of fancy.
Opening by throwing blue shapes at one another, Freeman moves quickly into
sinewy abstraction in the upper register and blurting punctuation in the
bottom. Blythe, who has more firmly anchored ideas, drives out a gritty alto
sound spiced with blue inflection. Joseph, an instinctive player presumably
working with the minimum of rehearsal, provides a colourful backdrop for the
reeds, his tidal, repeated motifs set off against sparkling runs. Mohammed
is reliable as ever, the stripped down almost martial rhythm driving rock
steady behind the ensemble.
The main attraction is Freeman, however, flamboyant and moorish in
appearance with his black flowing shirt, earring and custom black horn.
Worrying around the edges of a ballad with moist breathing or exploring
every crevice of the instrument with gale force blowing, his technique is
both difficult and convincing.
It is not a quintet for everyone's taste and the tense reed mayhem which
closed this first set did leave some bewildered faces in the club. But for
fans of high voltage Freeman driven by the Blythe spirit, it is highly
recommended.

CITY OF DJINNS: A YEAR IN DELHI
by William Dalrymple
HarperCollins Pounds 16.99, 352 pages
ASK INDIA hands, old or new, which of the four great cities of the
subcontinent they prefer, and the response will be mixed. Most will plump
for the zingy, non-stop, rags-and-riches city of Bombay. Some will prefer
the more traditional southern rhythms of Madras, others the intellectual and
artistic predelictions of Calcutta. Few are the Indophiles, though, who will
show affection for the city that sits baking on the dusty north Indian
plain, Delhi.
It is not only a disagreeable climate that breeds indifference to the Indian
capital. Modern-day Delhi is not a city of much grace, subtlety or culture.
The centre of one of the world's largest state administrations, this is a
town of politicians, bureaucrats, of naked ambition, venality and grasping
materialism.
Nor does the physical management of the city inspire great admiration. In
its race to modernise, the Moslem buildings and monuments of Old Delhi have
become neglected and decrepit. In New Delhi the architecture of the British
Raj remains, but is increasingly overshadowed by the spread of concrete and
high-rises. For most ordinary observers Delhi's abandonment of the past and
its gaudy embrace of western modernity have made it just one more
over-crowded third-world city.
William Dalrymple, though, is not an ordinary observer. It is a measure of
his enthusiasm for history that he is able to simply ignore much of the
dross of present-day Delhi; by concentrating on remnants of the past he
manages to present in City of Djinns a sympathetic and intriguing portrait
of this age-old city.
With In Xanadu, the bestseller that he wrote in 1989 at the age of 22,
Dalrymple took us from the Levant across central Asia to Beijing, an
attractive blend of amusing traveller's anecdotes and scholarly historical
observation. In limiting itself to describing a single city Dalrymple's
second offering will not have the same wide public appeal as his first.
Yet in one sense City of Djinns is a travel book, too - the route is not
geographical but, using the same blend of anecdote and erudition, takes us
ever further back in time.
Sub-titled 'A Year in Delhi', the book describes the first 12 months that
the newly-married Dalrymple spends in Delhi as a foreign correspondent. Far
from focusing on Delhi daily life - much less Delhi political life - the
book concentrates on Dalrymple's real interests - the Moslem world and the
900 year period in which India was ruled from Delhi by a succession of
Moslem dynasties, each one more eccentric and picaresque than the last.
Pursuing his historical research across the city, particularly in the narrow
alleys, mosques, abandoned ruins and tombs of Moslem Old Delhi, Dalrymple
encounters a range of characters who continue, despite modernising
pressures, to give Delhi a special character. Pigeon fanciers, Sufi mystics,
Moslem healers, musicians, calligraphers, philosophers and a guild of
transvestites all provide Dalrymple with entertaining insights into the
lesser-known life of present-day Delhi.
Each encounter, though, provides the peg for the real meat of the book, an
historical exploration of the city. Beginning with Mrs Puri, his Sikh
landlady, and her arrival in Delhi on the great wave of Punjabi refugee
immigration at Partition in 1947 - 'it was as if Bloomsbury were made to
absorb a deluge of mud-booted Yorkshire farmers' - he looks at the shocks
that time and again have transformed the city. He has ample material to work
with - over the centuries Delhi has been razed to the ground and born again
at least eight times.
Dalrymple looks fondly at declining pre-1947 Moslem Delhi, 'the grandest of
grand old aristocratic dowagers', as it was before it became Punjabi
dominated - 'all show and vulgarity and conspicuous consumption.' He shows
us the broad ceremonial avenues and imposing buildings of Lutyen's 20th
century New Delhi, at the the same time 'patronising and authoritarian' and
'the finest cultural artifact created by the British Empire.' His gaze at
colonial India stretches back through the Victorian age and Mutiny to the
wild exploits of the first colonial adventurers and administrators in 18th
century Delhi.
Dalrymple is fascinated by the pageant of imperial rule in the city, but he
reserves his full enthusiasm not for British empire but for its much
longer-lived and more colourful predecessor, Moslem empire. From the
'Twilight', the century of Moslem decline that preceded the Mutiny,
backwards to the glory days of the Great Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, and
still further to the first Moslem invasion of India in 1192, Dalrymple
follows the fortunes of some of history's most colourful and unprincipled
rulers.
There is nothing dry about this history. Besides describing the wealth,
military skill and political cunning that kept these cruel autocrats in
power, there are tales of imperial orgies, atrocious tortures, assassination
attempts, love affairs, spies, palace coups, magic, court poetry, whirling
dervishes, fratricides and patricides. Where else could you find a
knowledgeable account of the nature and role of the eunuch in medieval Asia?
It is all fine, entertaining, well-written stuff, thoroughly researched but
with none of the stern, academic tone that so many historical profiles
adopt. What sustains it, apart from his erudite knowledge of Moslem
architecture, medicine, music, military principles, and arcane religious
practices, is Dalrymple's sense of historical adventure. Just open your
eyes, he says. If you know how to look, even the empty tombs and abandoned
ruins of the past are alive.

A HISTORY OF WARFARE
by John Keegan
Hutchinson Pounds 20, 432 pages
TO SAY that war is a continuation of politics by other means is like saying
divorce is a continuation of marriage by other means. Nonetheless the great
military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said exactly that. Indeed it was a
central tenet of his book On War (1832), which became the sacred text of
generations of German staff officer. Clausewitz's advocacy of total war,
involving vast, indoctrinated 'citizen' armies which could only be raised by
conscription, lay at the heart of the Schlieffen Plan, and of Hitler's
Wehrmacht.
Understandably, no serious commentator on war has been able to ignore
Clausewitz, and most have succumbed to his thrust. Among such commentators
the historian John Keegan stands pre-eminent. His past publications,
including The Face of Battle - a hugely absorbing reconstruction of
Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme - have altered and enriched our perception
of warfare as something hideously logical in its detail. Now comes A History
of Warfare: not just his latest offering, but a summation of much that has
gone before, and Keegan's attempt to secure for himself at least a
separation from the Prussian genius.
War, he proposes, has quite as much to do with culture as with politics, at
least in its origins. And just as there are different kinds of culture, so
there are different kinds of warfare. Keegan identifies four historic phases
of warfare, which he calls Stone, Flesh, Iron and Fire. Each refers to a
primary combat resource - in the case of Flesh, horses. And while these
provide him with the thematic chapter headings needed to make sense of six
millennia of armed conflict, between chapters he conducts mopping up
operations ('interludes') that account for the 'limitations of warfare'
(mainly the weather and terrain), fortification, armies and logistics.
Although the whole book swarms with brilliant analysis and a command of
history unrivalled among militaritians, it is the earlier sections of
Keegan's lengthy rumination that are the most satisfying. He casts his net
very wide. Not only does he examine warfare among the Samurai, the Zulus,
and the Mamelukes of Egypt, but, guided by anthropologists, he explores the
Yanomano, the Maring and the Aztecs. He also offers an explanation for the
disappearance of the Easter Island civilisation.
What he finds among these examples is that warfare, while limited by such
materials as were available, also limited itself. Conflict and combat were
ritualised. Tribal people, aware of survival values as few of us living in
comfortable urban homes can be, sought to contain, not to exploit, the
damage to life that can be done by even the most rudimentary weapons. War
therefore was practised in harmony with the greater needs of the societies
it protected. Among the Polynesians of Easter Island such controlled conduct
maintained an extraordinary culture for several centuries. It was only when
the islanders began disregarding their own taboos, and elected instead for
war to the bone, that their society was wasted.
As this was happening, across the Pacific the Japanese, in a startling
renunciation of seemingly superior technology, opted to dispense with the
gun. Although the samurai had an obvious interest as a privileged class in
keeping to the way of the sword, a generalised apprehension of the
consequences of powder and ball informed Japan's decision.
In these contexts, Clausewitzian true, or all-out, war becomes merely a type
of warfare specific to some cultures only, if not in fact an aberration.
Keegan's problem however is twofold. As he journeys through time toward the
20th century, it is the Prussian mode that comes to dominate all others, not
just in the west, but globally. Secondly, as he journeys forward, the more
difficulty he has in deciding which wars to discuss, and which to leave
alone. There are just too many of them.
But Keegan's actual selection does not help his suite. Guerrilla, or
people's, war generally gets short shrift. Vietnam is dismissed in less than
a page, and there is nothing on Nicaragua, El Salvador or Guatemala. Equally
odd is his failure to isolate and debate intelligence-gathering as a primary
component of warfare - unlike, for instance, Sun Tzu writng in the fourth
century BC
Today, although guerrilla warfare is likely to persist as a means of waging
armed struggle against unequal odds, and although weapons of
mass-destruction must inevitably keep alive the possibility of total war in
the future, the trend is toward surgical warfare: a synthesis in fact of
air-power, long-range missiles, commando tactics and, of course,
intelligence.
So the wheel comes full circle in Keegan's favour. It does appear that,
wittingly or otherwise, we are rediscovering the fundamental responsibility
of warfare, which is to preserve as much as to destroy.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Books: Totally mad about otters - The life of Gavin Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES

<TEXT>
GAVIN MAXWELL
by Douglas Botting
HarperCollins Pounds 22.50, 585 pages
DO PEOPLE who love animals exceedingly - excessively - have something wrong
with them? My question may seem mischievous, but it is likely to occur to
readers of this superb biography of Gavin Maxwell, 'the otter man' of the
1960s. Crusty old Wilfred Thesiger, that uncompromising Arabian explorer,
who once took Maxwell on a journey to the Marsh Arabs, evidently had his
doubts about his companion: 'Personally I think if people go to extremes
where animals become more important than human beings, then they ought to be
locked up', he opines, recalling what he described as Maxwell's hysterics
over the death of an otter cub they had had for less than a week.
Gavin Maxwell certainly had his problems. He was a grandson of the Duke of
Northumberland, a Percy on his mother's side, with a childhood to guarantee
neuroses ahead. He never knew his father, slept in his doting mother's bed
until he was eight, enjoyed a solitary and idyllic early childhood in the
Scottish Lowlands, was traumatised, according to the pattern, by prep
school, and suffered a serious illness in his teens.
He was thereafter an explorer (on a modest scale), one of the best shots in
Britain, a wartime instructor in the SOE, a shark-hunter off the Highlands,
a society portrait painter - and one of the finest nature writers of this
century. He was homosexual; he drank, and smoked, very heavily; he seems to
have been a manic depressive. He must have had great charm, though he was
also disliked by some people for his arrogant manner. His financial affairs
were undisciplined. He died, of cancer, at 55.
And he loved animals. Douglas Botting's thesis, though he does not insist,
is that he was emotionally atrophied, 'for ever an adolescent in his
attitude to the adult world, his sexual relations and his interests and
enthusiasms'. A male friend describes him as 'two different people - the
respectable public figure (the aristocratic painter, author, ex-Guards
officer and member of learned societies) and the less respectable private
one (the homosexual, the outlaw, the fearful, repressed, inhibited inner
man) . . . The externalisation of his emotional life led to a mistrust of
relationships with adults, so that he only felt safe in the animal world,
the natural world . . . '
This is the world in which he will always be remembered. As Mr Botting puts
it, correctly, 'Gavin Maxwell was to otters what Joy Adamson was to lions,
Dian Fossey to gorillas, Jane Goodall to chimpanzees and Grey Owl to
beavers'. (Which goes some way towards the first sentence of this review.)
He came to otters by accident. After the success of his first book, Harpoon
at a Venture, in which he described the disaster of his post-war attempt to
hunt the Basking Shark in Scottish waters, he went off to the Gulf with
Thesiger where he produced a very fine travel book called A Reed Shaken by
the Wind. There he discovered otters, and brought Mijbil back to his remote
cottage near Mallaig, opposite Skye, soon to be immortalised by him as
'Camusfearna'. Edal and Teko were to follow.
Ring of Bright Water came out in 1960 and was a colossal best-seller. Why?
Partly because it was so well written, partly because it offered escape. It
arrived at the beginning of the 1960s enthusiasm for the Good Life; in more
respectful language, it coincided with a new interest in alternative
life-styles and anticipated what we today call the New Age movement. In
Maxwell's words, 'I am convinced that man has suffered in his separation
from the soil and from other living creatures of the world; the evolution of
his intellect has outrun his needs as an animal . . .'
Hence the popular fascination with the story of a man who goes off to live
on a northern sea-shore in a remote house with no mod. cons., makes best
friends with an otter, and then writes about his fun and games - and
sadnesses - with these simple creatures.
It was never, of course, as simple as it sounded, as Maxwell always
emphasised. The success of the books in itself destroyed the integrity, and
the seclusion, of 'Camusfearna'. And otters were not the only friends. There
was the poet Kathleen Raine, for example, still happily with us today, who
conceived a grand infatuation for the handsome but unresponding Maxwell; she
comes out of this book as a self-regarding witch (and also a very bad poet).
Her obsession with Maxwell is no joke because he half-believed in her
'powers' and when he discovered she had laid a curse on his life he was
ready to believe he had been destroyed. There followed a terrible sequence
of tragedy: the otters turned savage, there were financial disasters,
'Camusfearna' burned to the ground, and in 1969 he died.
Botting, who knew Maxwell for the last 12 years, never forgets that the
books are what matter. After Ring of Bright Water (a line taken from one of
Ms Raine's poems) there were The Rocks Remain and Raven Seek Thy Brother. He
also wrote two excellent books about Sicily, and Lords of the Atlas, a
superior historical study of Morocco, a country he used to visit to indulge
his wilder tastes.
Botting is discreet about the homosexuality and explains that he is
respecting the wishes of the estate. He has the sense to caution that this
might have the effect of exaggerating the importance of the female
relationships, which he feels able to describe more candidly, including a
sad marriage. (There is one wonderful misprint or mishearing where Ms Raine,
in full poetic flood, describes Maxwell as 'the poor Eternus'. As a Jungian,
she presumably said Puer Aeternus.) Throughout a long but never exhausting
book Botting writes beautifully, except for a very occasional tendency to
overreach himself.
He assures us that there are still otters at Sandaig (as 'Camusfearna' is
known on the maps), though the landscape has changed. Apparently the new
bridge to Skye will destroy Kyleakin Island, where Maxwell took refuge for
his last year. All his life he knew that he was in search of Avalon, where
he might hope to heal Tennyson's grievous wound. Perhaps, for just those
first years with the otters, he found it.

CROSS SECTION: MAN OF WAR
written by Richard Platt,
illustrated by Stephen Biesty
Dorling Kindersley Pounds 12, 32 pages
CAN children's information books be as attractive, as authoritative and as
quick and easy to use as the kinds of information that can be obtained from
a computer at the touch of a button? One British publisher that has
certainly risen to these challenges is Dorling Kindersley, which specialises
in publishing information books, usually in large formats, that integrate
text, colour photography, and both traditional and highly sophisticated
graphics.
This autumn it publishes The Bird Atlas (Pounds 10.99), a
continent-by-continent guide to the world's birdlife, the latest in a series
of pictorial atlases for children of eight and above, and The Dorling
Kindersley Science Encyclopaedia (Pounds 25), which manages to make
scientific subjects seem both intellectually challenging and readily
intelligible. Again, an excellent array of different kinds of illustration
helps to bring life to the subjects under discussion: computer graphics and
aerial photography, for example.
Neither of these titles, however, quite matches in excellence Stephen
Biesty's Cross Section: Man-of-War. Stephen Biesty's first book, Incredible
Cross-Sections (Pounds 12.99) was published last year. It was a large-format
picture book of a very unusual kind. Having first made careful studies of
architectural plans and drawings Biesty sliced through the middle of 18
buildings and machines - the Queen Mary, the Empire State building, the
Flying Scotsman, a tank, and Covent Garden's Royal Opera House, for example
 -in order to reveal their inner workings. Over a sequence of double-page
spreads (two of these spreads had fold-out pages, which meant that the
illustration of the cross section of the Queen Mary was almost one metre in
width), we see what goes on inside the buildings; we see how the building or
machine was made; and we also see how it was used: on board the Flying
Scotsman, for example, we glimpse an extraordinarily dignified gentleman in
a waistcoat squatting on a tiny lavatory, trousers round his ankles. This
method of presentation yields up a mass of fascinating technical
information; and, simultaneously, it demonstrates what it must have felt
like to travel on the Flying Scotsman in the 1930s.
Biesty's new book concentrates on a single subject: a British man-of-war of
the late 18th century (it is based on Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory).
Spread by spread, he brings to life how the boat functioned as a war
machine, what went on in every reeking nook and cranny of it, under such
headings as: health at sea; cooking and eating; leisure and supplies;
working sea; battle stations; sleeping; the offices; the admiral. He has
again taken a slice through the middle of the ship so that we see it from
the inside, deck by deck. Every full-page illustration is crammed with the
minutest details of life on board with fascinating incidental information on
the opposite page, all linked to something that can be glimpsed in the
picture. Under 'Navigation and Discipline' we read of 'shot rolling', for
example: 'Ships on the verge of mutiny were known in the navy as 'shot
rolling ships'. This was because discontented crew members tried to knock
unwary officers off their feet by sending cannon balls rolling along the
deck.'
Biesty and his partner Richard Platt (who contributes the excellent text)
has brought the punishing regime on board a 100-gun man-of-war alive in a
way that will make history seem as vivid, fascinating and contemporaneous as
the latest computer game.

STRANGE PILGRIMS: Twelve Stories
by Gabriel Garca Marquez,
translated by Edith Grossman
Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 188 pages
TOLSTOY'S two great novels are so central to our culture that they have
overshadowed his shorter fiction such as The Kreutzer Sonata, A
Billiard-Marker's Notes, a tale about gambling fever, Strider: The Story of
a Horse and dozens more fine stories. The shorter fiction of the
Colombian-born, Nobel Prize-winning writer Gabriel Garca Marquez should not
be allowed to suffer from a similar eclipse. He too works just as powerfully
on a small canvas as a large one.
Marquez's epic-narrative of his own people, One Hundred Years of Solitude,
was his attempt at writing a War and Peace; his most recent novel to be
published in Britain, The General in His Labyrinth, about a revolutionary
soldier whose finest hour has passed, showed Marquez comfortably
accommodating himself to the confines of an average-length novel; in this
latest book, Strange Pilgrims: Twelve Stories, translated from the Spanish
by Edith Grossman, Marquez commands our rapt attention through stories some
of which are only a few pages.
They were written over the past 18 years, the fruits of the writer's
experiences while residing abroad. Some have appeared in an earlier form as
articles, film or television scripts. All 12 were re-written within the last
few years and the collection was conceived as a unity. We travel from
Barcelona to Rome, Paris, Geneva, cities seen in that same pitiless light,
exposing both the mean and the miraculous, that illuminated the Colombian
jungle and the Amazonian towns and villages of his longer works.
The characters are mostly Latin-American exiles. By living abroad they have
escaped from oppression but not from of a destiny that is driving them
towards their often premature deaths. Sometimes the death-sense comes to
them in the form of a dream or apparition; at other times it is couched in a
phenomenon of nature like that land wind that attacks the Spanish town of
Cadaques in summer. In 'Tramontana' - the story named after it - the young
night-club singer from the Antilles recognises in it the portent of his own
imminent death:
'It was a Caribbean certainty that could not be understood by a band of
Scandinavian rationalists aflame with summer and the hard Catalan wines of
those days, which sowed wild ideas in the heart.'
In 'Bon Voyage, Mr President' the ex-premier of a Caribbean island living in
exile in Switzerland has just as acute a sense of his own mortality but with
greater reason. He awaits a cancer operation in a Genevan hospital. The
ambulance driver whom he meets on a preliminary visit and who becomes his
friend is a fellow-countryman. Theirs proves to be a loaded friendship. The
man and his grasping wife are hoping to make a broker's turn on the funeral
arrangements.
Indeed throughout this macabre but memorable collection we are never far
from the graveyard. 'Maria dos Prazeres' is an elderly whore in retirement
in Barcelona who identifies with those who daub the names of the
anarchist-leaders killed in the Civil War on the anonymous tombstones. She
is training her dog to weep over her own grave when the time comes.
In 'Trail of Your Blood in the Snow' the wealthy young Spanish bride has a
cut on a her wedding-ring finger that will not heal. By the time she and her
husband, who picked her up on the beach a week or two earlier, have driven
through the night to Paris she has all but bled to death.
Equally bloody is the fate of the spinsterly governess in 'Miss Forbes's
Summer of Happiness'. She is found one morning by her young charges - with
whom she has been so punitive - dead in bed from multiple stab-wounds. In 'I
Only Came to Use the Phone' a Mexican-born music-hall artist's car breaks
down in the desert while she is on the way to re-join her husband in
Barcelona. She thumbs a lift from a coach full of strangely passive women.
It stops at a country mansion where they disembark. The women, mental
patients, are being admitted as new inmates of a residential home staffed by
warder-like nurses. The unfortunate motorist is doomed to spend the
remainder of her life in this virtual prison.
Tales like these have overtones that grimly resonate in the modern
consciousness. We witness the way certain individuals seem singled out for a
destiny as cruel and senseless as it is unmerited. If your preference is for
stories that radiate a measure of joie de vivre, the kind that, say,
Katherine Mansfield once wrote, then you should stay away from Marquez.
The nearest we get here to a glimmer of humour from him is in 'Sleeping
Beauty' where the Latin-American narrator cannot believe his good fortune.
He has been seated in the aircraft next to the beautiful young woman
travelling on her own. He had eyed her covetously, silently, in the airport
lounge at Charles De Gaulle during a long delay.
After take-off she hangs a notice saying 'Do Not Disturb' around her neck
and falls instantly asleep. On arrival in New York she wakes up as the plane
lands. The only words she speaks to him are 'Goodbye' in Spanish. Destiny up
to its tricks once again. In the world of Marquez it never ever does one a
favour.

THE HAILSTONES were so big I could have gone cross-country skiing in my

omen for a season full of snow? I must ask my neighbour, television
weatherman Michael Fish.
Certainly the season has arrived - in fact it has been steadily arriving
ever since the first brochure was sent to rather less than eager readers
before last winter was even over, I seem to recall. Did last winter ever
really end?
Neilson's early brochure landed on my desk in London while I was still
skiing on last winter's snow. I could hear the thud from Verbier. On the
other hand, some operators' 'early booking brochures' came out so late that
they had hardly reached the client's doormat before the 'main' brochure
arrived with a clatter on top of it.
Crystal has incensed Thomson this year by proclaiming the company as
Britain's 'biggest and best ski specialist' and 'offering the UK's biggest
ski programme'. Crystal adds that the 260-page brochure features more
resorts (105 in 10 countries), more regional airports (13) and more
fully-catered chalets (131) than 'any other operator'.
Thomson's brochure has a mere 195 pages covering around 70 resorts. However,
having a bigger brochure does not mean Crystal will sell more holidays than
Thomson. Do not expect Thomson to be dethroned from its position as brand
leader.
Between them, Thomson and Crystal have more than 400 photographs of skiers
skiing in their brochures. So it is intriguing that Finlays Chalet Holidays
has produced the (almost) impossible: a ski brochure with only one picture
of a skier skiing in it - and a tiny one at that.
Nevertheless, it is a pleasant brochure: there are photographs of lots of
skiers not skiing (leaning on poles, carrying skis, lying in the snow,
having lunch on the balcony after skiing etc).
Apparently, according to Richard Finlay, pictures of skiers skiing are
'difficult to come by'. A remark which prompted Paul Chase Gardener,
managing director of Bladon Lines, to retort light-heartedly: 'You mean you
have to pay for them?'
So what of the season ahead? Ski Solutions, the leading specialist travel
agent, suggests that Christmas, though hopefully white, is going to be a bit
of a nightmare.
'Christmas Day and New Year's Day both fall on a Saturday,' observes Lizzie
Norton, the company's director. The formula she dreads is this: 'Awkward
dates plus high demand equals limited availability.' The result? 'A
bewildering farrago of different departure dates and holiday durations.'
However, in spite of a terrible time for some four and five-star hoteliers
last March, ski business is booming - at least for the festive season. 'Even
clients who advise us that money is no object cannot be certain of getting
precisely the accommodation and dates of their first choice,' says Norton.
With Switzerland, France and Austria looking costly there is considerable
interest in Italy, where a good rate of exchange is helping a skiing
renaissance, and North America, where the likes of Vail and Breckenridge,
Colorado (with a new fourth mountain, Peak 7, to show off this winter) and
Whistler and Banff/Lake Louise are selling well.
Alpine Answers, the new kids on the ski specialist travel agent block,
suggest that Italy's gain is Austria's loss, with an increase in bookings to
Cervinia, Livigno and Sauze d'Oulx, 'where the apres ski is less expensive
than in similar Austrian destinations.'
According to Hilary Jackson, high-altitude French resorts may also be taking
a share of skiers whose usual haunt is Austria. This would narrow the gap
still further between Austria, which in Britain always outsells the other
ski nations, and its traditional rival, France.
The two countries might even end the season neck and neck, in spite of
on-going jokes about the size of French apartments and the lingering Gallic
shrug.
Safety is a big issue this year; the bloodcurdling way in which some people
ski is alarming many skiing fans. After nine British fatalities on the
slopes last winter, skiers are being urged to slow down, drink less at
lunchtime and be more thoughtful about other skiers on the mountain.
In a survey last month almost half of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators (AITO) 37 ski operators urged that separate areas should be set
aside for snowboarders. And 80 per cent of them called for a package of
measures including more piste patrols, with powers to confiscate lift passes
from dangerous skiers, slow skiing areas and clearer piste marking. Sue
Ockwell, AITO's chief executive, says: 'The aim should be to reduce
accidents on the slopes to an absolute minimum.'

FOR SOME TIME now furniture and interior designers have been exploring the
world of myth and legend, using symbols and imagery from astronomy and
alchemy, from fairy-tales and fables. Designers such as Paolo Guidi and
Katherina Harlow explore the metaphysical world of the Renaissance mystics,
while the style of the French designers Bonetti and Garouste is heavily
laced with references from the realm of primitive myth.
Tim Chitty and Simon Bacon, too, love delving into themes from ancient myths
and legend but they apply it thus far in a small, though admittedly
important, area - chairs. Their small design making production company is
called 'Chairs' and it specialises in . . . yes, chairs. All are produced in
limited editions, all are traditionally made by hand and all are filled with
references to myth and legend. Photographed right is Medusa. Medusa is made
from an ash frame and velvet or hand-painted suede is used for the
upholstery. Pictures of Medusa come with a little caption of soft-sounding
words - The Source/First born/bearer of dreams/the softness of sleep/the
bane of content. Quite what that all means I'm not entirely sure but it
sounds harmless enough, if a little potent for a mere dining chair, however
original, to carry.
But I have to admit I like the chair. It is an original, yet functional and
practical, solution to the problem of the dining-chair and a welcome change
from the serried ranks of Provencal, pseudo-Chippendale, heavy Victorian or
steely modern that more frequently grace the contemporary dining-room.
If Medusa doesn't seem quite YOU there is always Hecate which has a back
topped by a huge crescent moon. Or what about Achilles - or Inducement. . .
.
All the chairs are hand-made to order only, and orders take between four and
six weeks. Chairs is at 10a George Road, Guildford, Surrey GU1 4NP but for
those going to Decorex at Syon House next week the range can also be seen on
the Bosanquet Ives stand there.
Still in an utterly contemporary mood, Richard Ward's sofa, upholstered here
in a new Firifiss Contemporary Textiles fabric (Capella from the Columba
range, Pounds 42 per metre), has a laminated birch ply frame with a maple
veneer and is made to order only. Contact Richard Ward at his workshop at 72
Graham Road, London E8 1BX, tel: 071-729-6768.

FT  25 SEP 93 / How To Spend It: What the best-dressed walls are wearing -
Lucia van der Post previews Decorex, the biggest and brightest interior
decorating show that at last is open to one and all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT HAS ALWAYS been a mystery to me that one of the UK's finest interior
decorating exhibitions, Decorex, has traditionally been closed to its
ultimate customers - the public.
Rather as the glittery fashion shows are only accessible to those with
impeccable credentials (in other words, those in the trade) so Decorex,
where the latest in swags and chintzes, kitchens and designer bibelots is
laid out before us, has always been open only to those in the interior
decorating trade. This year, however, sense has at last been seen. Now those
who long to attend what really is the best and easiest way of seeing a whole
range of interior trends can for the first time do so.
Decorex is on at Syon Park, Isleworth, west London and though it opens to
the trade today on the evening of Tuesday September 28 there will be a
private view and champagne reception (sponsored by Perrier-Jouet) for anyone
who feels it is worth the Pounds 20 ticket.
All proceeds will go to Shaftesbury Homes, a children's charity that helps
disabled and disadvantaged children from inner city areas. Tickets can be
reserved by telephoning Shaftesbury Homes on 071-720 8709.
What, though, I hear you ask, will be on view? Previewing an exhibition that
has not yet happened is, as I have learned to my cost, a tricky business but
if last year's show is anything to go by then the standard of taste, flair
and exhibitors will be very high.
Here you should find the perfect opportunity to see which way the decorative
winds are blowing, to catch up on the small and new companies that are doing
original, idiosyncratic work, and to compare fabrics, colours, styles.
Decorex is also a good chance to find out what exactly an interior decorator
can do for you. Traditionally the British have been wary of buying-in the
skills of interior decorators - whether from a sense of latent puritanism or
a shortage of cash, it is hard to say - but interior decorating in this
country has for too long been thought to have a faint whiff of transatlantic
excess.
However, anybody who has ever tried it will have found to their cost that
putting a house in order requires much, much more than a gentle dabbling in
pretty paints and fabrics. It is usually very hard work. For every minute
spent sifting through swatches of fabric, something like 50 has probably to
be spent chasing up suppliers and sorting out the duller but infinitely more
important practicalities: plumbing, heating, lighting and ventilation.
Interior decorators can take all this off your hands - for a fee, of course,
and herein lies the rub. When prosaic matters such as cost are mentioned
interior decorators as a breed seem to have a wonderful way of looking fey
and conveying, just ever so haughtily, a distinct reluctance to discuss such
unaesthetic matters.
This is where the IDDA (the interior decorators and designers association)
can come in handy. It will have a manned stand at the show where advice will
be dispensed - everything from how charges should be fixed to how to choose
an interior designers and just what exactly he (or she) could do for you.
Those who cannot get to the exhibition can write to IDDA, Crest House,
102-104 Church Road, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 8PY, enclosing a 9in by 4in
sae for a free informative leaflet on 'why you should use an interior
designer'.
So what seem to be the current trends for the coming year? Two companies
with a reputation for finely-tuned design antennae (Jane Churchill and
Designers' Guild) have drawn on Britain's links with Colonial India for
their new collections and each, independently, has arrived at the same name:
'Indian Summer.'
This, you should note, is the India of the Raj and the Maharajahs, of silks
and satins, of brilliant ochres and terracottas, sapphire blues and
iridescent golds - not the peasant India of the rough-hewn tables and the
simple block-printed cottons or Madras checks.
The Jane Churchill Collection, photographed above right and on view at
Decorex, features a whole collection of Indian-inspired fabrics - from the
spectacular mix of pictorial designs on the sofa, reminiscent of the school
of Indian miniature paintings and called Indian Summer, to the Khalasa check
at the window, a heavy cotton linen blend in a choice of colours. Prices
range from Pounds 18.50 to Pounds 29.50 per metre. Indian Summer sells for
Pounds 23.50.
To go with the fabrics and the mood there is a collection of wooden and
decorative accessories - from wooden pots and ceramic urns to carved chests,
candlesticks, rugs and baskets. The collection is on sale now in all Jane
Churchill shops.
Designers' Guild is not exhibiting at Decorex, but its Indian Summer
collection, too, is already in its Chelsea shop (271-277 Kings' Road, London
SW3). Photographed below left is a selection of its blue and white bedlinen
(fine Egyptian cotton sheets with a blue spotted border, blue and white
checked pillowcases and duvet cover and an appliqued bedcover) and some of
its richly-coloured checked fabrics. The collection includes prints, woven
silks, velvets and wallpapers, all clearly inspired by the art, textiles,
architecture and history of India. Prices range from Pounds 15 per metre to
Pounds 52 for the cotton velvets.
Finally, if you feel that all this sumptuously coloured fabric needs
something special to set it off, consider Byron &amp; Byron, a company
specialising in what it calls 'curtainalia' which has developed a
wonderfully decorative range of finishes for wooden curtain poles
(photographed top left). Using the Victorian technique of decoupage, in
which cut-out shapes and illustrations are veneered on to furnishings and
furniture, it has grafted a selection of paper finishes on to the poles. The
result is colourful, original and indubitably different.
Prices range from Pounds 114 to Pounds 350 a set, depending upon design and
measurements. Byron &amp; Byron has a small showroom at 4 Hanover Yard, off Noel
Road, London N1 8BE (tel: 071-704 9290). Also available from John Lewis.

<TEXT>
IF YOUR work-a-day wardrobe is up-to-date and what you need is a little
sprucing up on the casual front, then it is worth knowing that Gieves &amp;
Hawkes, has produced a good collection of soft and subtle casual wear.
Gieves &amp; Hawkes has taken 'The Glory of the Turf' as its theme which has
allowed it to indulge fully in a rich panoply of equine imagery of the sort
that seems so to appeal to the English - classic riding and hacking jackets,
once made in heavyweight 22 oz cloths to keep out the bone-chilling winds,
are now reworked in soft lambswool. Overchecks are used in ways that
co-ordinate with knitwear and shirts.
Suits come in traditional birdseye fabrics or, for a bit of
turn-of-the-century panache, Prince of Wales' checks. Colours are rich and
autumnal. If, like me, you feel that horses are all very well in their place
but you can live without their image on ties and socks and sweaters, then
fear not, there are checks and Argyles, Fair Isles and plains.
If posh (or would-be posh) countryhouse visiting is on your agenda then
these are the sort of clothes you need - just duff them up a bit so they do
not look too new or too good.
Photographed here is a camel cashmere sports jacket (it also comes in navy)
for Pounds 895, worn over a lavender roll-neck sweater in merino wool for
Pounds 95 and pure wool dark brown trousers at Pounds 125. The lambswool /
angora tartan scarf is Pounds 25. All from Gieves &amp; Hawkes, No. 1 Savile
Row, London W1.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Fashion: The tailors who have reinvented British style - A
look at the innovative designers who have breathed new life into the Savile
Row suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW years ago the outlook was bleak for the British tailor. The late
Nicholas Ridley, then Minister of Environment and unable to understand why
all men might not want to wear suits from Marks &amp; Spencer, changed the
rating system of the tailor's premises from light industrial to full retail
status which threatened, either to put most of the West End tailors out of
business or, at least, banish them to a shopping mall at Heathrow Airport.
Savile Row's quietly dwindling clientele appeared to consist mainly of large
men from north America and small ones from the East. Young British men
appeared to be perfectly happy to slouch around in shapeless suits, a couple
of sizes too big for them. It seemed that the great British sartorial
heritage of simple, understated, wool clothes that stretched back to Beau
Brummel was doomed.
But gradually, increasing numbers of stylish young men could be spotted all
over London sporting rather good, obviously British, clothes. These outfits
encompassed the traditional British trademarks: a natural shoulder line,
accentuated waist and a gentle flare on the hips. They were often made from
tweeds and worsteds. But they were decidedly modern products from young
tailors able to combine traditional tailoring techniques with a contemporary
sense of style.
'Men had become very educated about fashion. Whereas once they would have
invested in the security of a designer label, they began to have faith in
their own sense of style and looked to a tailor to realise it,' says Timothy
Everest, probably the most successful and best known of the new tailors.
From modest beginnings three years ago, he now boasts over 1,500 clients
ranging from foreign advisers to John Major to television presenters. His
bohemian atelier in a shabby, picturesque corner of Spitalfields is a
quantum leap away from Savile Row.
'I love the traditions, the craft and the quality of the Row, but feel it's
important to add something more modern, accessible, affordable and relevant
to the way men live today,' he says of his contemporary style.
His sentiments are echoed by Richard James, a designer who made his name
creating exuberant ready-to-wear interpretations of British classic style
and who operates a successful made-to-measure service from his shop in
Savile Row.
'Tradition is wonderful, but it is not a sacred cow. The modern tailor has
to appreciate how men's lifestyles have changed: they are used to wearing
lighter, softer clothes and no longer need a 20 ounce tweed; they have given
up worrying about wearing brown shoes with blue suits and love mixing
unexpected fabrics, patterns and textures,' he says.
Georgina Godley, who switched from ready-to-wear to custom-making, feels the
tailoring revolution has only just begun. 'I love to break new ground by
using modern high tech fabrics to create clothes that have the authority of
tailoring but the comfort of sportswear,' says Godley, whose more notable
commissions include a stretch worsted suit with built-in spats, a
prisoner-of-war boiler suit, a lavender boucle and angora jacket and a
multi-pocketed micro fibre travelling jacket that can roll into a ball
without creasing. Her prices start at about Pounds 800.
Even pop musicians, are starting to turn to tailors to create an image.
'They like the idea of employing a tailor to create a look that won't be
seen on other artists,' explains Ozwald Boateng, whose streamlined,
futuristic, updated-Steed-like clothes are worn by Seal and members of what
he describes as the 'acid jazz scene', happy to pay the Pounds 500-Pounds
1,000 his suits cost.
All the tailors I spoke to sense a disenchantment with expensive designer
fashion and say sensible pricing has contributed to their success.
'Men are looking for good value and service, at an affordable price and are
questioning paying for high overheads and marketing campaigns. They know
what they are paying for, when they order a suit,' says Everest, who charges
from Pounds 650 for a fully bespoke suit.
Richard James, whose suits cost from Pounds 850, says, 'I do not know
anybody who wears designer suits now. Men's dressing has returned to the
idea of personal style rather than an imposition of somebody's else's
ideal.'
Both also admit they have been lucky with fashion's swing to a more shaped
and slimmer silhouette for men: a look that is hard to achieve
off-the-peg,unless you have a perfect figure.
However, like many trends, the new tailors include some charlatans and
well-meaning individuals, who although big on ideas, often lack tailoring
skills. Many never get the hang of measuring accurately, interpreting a
fitting properly and appreciating the proper 'balance' of a garment. Others
promise a fully 'bespoke' suit, but deliver a bad, factory-made pastiche of
the real thing.
You should therefore find out exactly what is on offer before you order. A
real bespoke suit, made to the old method perfected in Savile Row, is built
by hand from complex layers of canvas, stitching and padding. It conceals a
man's bad points and enhances his good ones. It should fit perfectly and be
so comfortable that lesser garments feel clumsy by comparison.
Below this ideal of the tailor's craft, there are many levels of manufacture
ranging from the perfectly respectable to the very depressing indeed. To
avoid confusion, Everest offers two very distinctive levels of make: a
bespoke service, which is 'as good as you will find on Savile Row' and a
City Line: an up-graded version of a basic City suit, which although
machine-made, offers many of the nuances of bespoke such as real button
holes, some hand-finishing and proper ermazine linings.
This type of suit is less soft in appearance than the hand-made variety, and
is proving popular with men who need well-priced, hardwearing basic suits
for business. 'There are a lot of men who would like to have clothes that
reflect their personality, but who don't want the pomposity and expense of
Savile Row,' explains Serena Kelsey, whose hand-made bespoke suits start at
Pounds 500 and whose peripatetic, made-to-measure service, has proved so
popular that she has opened a shop, midway between the City and the West
End. A similar company, Norton &amp; Townsend is also enjoying considerable
success with its visiting service that offers a range of classic
made-to-measure styles which are made-up in a factory in Yorkshire.
The renaissance of the British tailor is particularly remarkable as the
success of its practitioners, most of whom work as small traders without any
major backing, has coincided with the biggest recession in the fashion
industry for years. In addition to an emphasis on good value, personal style
and service, the new tailors are offering a quintessentially British style.
James says: 'The vast majority of our clients are British.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Fashion: Black is back for a Puritan's night out - But
layers of chiffon help lighten the mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF AUTUMN'S new style has the minimalist, monochrome appeal of a nun's
habit, then evening wear can provide some light relief. Dressing for a
celebration is, surely, an excuse for some jolly jewellery or the glint of a
gilt button?
Not in the view of fashion purists. High evening wear for winter festivities
will indeed be rich with beading and the multiple textures of velvet,
chiffon and lace, but it will all be black - or the most sombre of medieval
shades. And for anything less formal, 'plain' is the only word that counts.
Evening wear is the final area to succumb to the new Puritan simplicity.
Last winter women who had already pushed their sharp little suits to the
back of the wardrobe were happy to step out at night in pert bustiers and
short, bright skirts. But now, as the key recessionary mood lingers, even
celebration is in soft focus.
Although evening style is simple and unadorned, it is not heavy or dull.
Instead it is based on a delicate lightness and the finest of fabrics. In
the past, the philosophy of evening wear has too often been 'more is more'
with attention on decoration rather than clever cut. But a plain dress
relies on the cutter's art and the choice of fluid, flattering material for
its success.
The way to achieve subtle evening fragility is with transparent but matt
fabrics, primarily chiffon. The newest way with sheers is to layer them. One
layer is completely transparent; two are tantalisingly veiled; three and you
might as well wear a solid fabric unles the outer one is cut to float free
and create a diaphanous lightness. Single-layer chiffon is often contrasted
with a rich, deep texture in the form of devore, or cut, velvet.
Chiffon now is about softness, not nudity. At a summer party in Cambridge in
the 1960s I remember earnest male undergraduates crowding round a girl
better-known as a dollybird than a brainbox. They were probably not hanging
on her every word - she was wearing the university's first recorded
see-through blouse over nothing at all.
By the hardened, unshockable 1980s, a sheer blouse over a worn-to-be-seen
Wonderbra was standard nightclubbing gear for teenagers. The inevitable
reaction has now set in. The underpinnings for chiffon should be as
concealing as possible and the puffed-up cleavage has all but disappeared.
So, along with sheer layers, you may need some new lingerie. The Wonderbra
illustrates the point. At fashion-forward stores, its sales are now being
matched by those of Gossard Glossies, Pounds 11.99, another 1970s revival
but this time a totally smooth, plunge-fronted, lightly underwired 'no-bra'
style that gives a natural shape. Alternatives include Jockey's plain
cotton, almond-coloured, elasticated edge briefs, Pounds 3.99, and crop-top,
Pounds 6.50, though this has rather wide shoulder straps, and Knickerbox's
cotton/Lycra, cup-stitched crop-top, or camisole, both Pounds 6.99 from
their Brilliant Basics range, available in black or white. There is also the
more grown-up version of visible lingerie, such as Marks and Spencer's
pretty black or burgundy stretch lace tank top, Pounds 9.99, which looks
equally good under chiffon or on show.
Sheer layers are strong at every market level. Chanel and St. Laurent revel
in them for couture, but realistically the most luxurious is Flyte Ostell,
who produces plain and beautiful layers, either tunic-style or bias-cut and
sometimes mixed with satin or cashmere. Ellis Flyte was previously a
lingerie designer with a gift for bias-cutting while Richard Ostell was
known for high-quality, understated daywear. Their teaming has proved a
winning combination. Zoran is the more exotic American equivalent, available
at Browns in London, and English Eccentrics has had a great success with its
classical motif devore chiffon and velvet.
Evening transparency need not be expensive. Jigsaw, Whistles, River Island
and Marks and Spencer all use synthetic chiffon and georgette to great
effect and at reasonable prices. Ex-film designer Andrea Galer has a new
ready-to-wear range of simple evening pieces in heavy silk crepe but will
make to order in other fabrics and sizes.

in other words, a staple. There can hardly be a female wardrobe that does
not sport a pair. They are what we put on when we get dressed on auto-pilot
when we're off to potter round the shops.
They can be teamed with skinny rib knits or cropped sweaters if you are
young and lithe, with thigh-covering shirts or sweaters if you are not. With
Lycra they accommodate almost every size and shape. They come dark and
serviceable for everyday, or slinky and velvety for glamour.
But what happens to the legging now that fashion has done a volte-face and
gone all soft and feminine? Like all successful species, the legging has
evolved and adapted itself seamlessly to the new fashion environment and is
still on all the smartest shelves, alive and kicking.
The new-look legging this winter comes in many moods: satin-backed crepe,
silk chiffon, velvet, linen, wool or cotton. The newest are something of a
hybrid - a cross between a legging and a proper pair of trousers. For the
young, slim, trendy and long-legged there is the flare - French Connection
do some marvellously slinky ones in rich dark chocolate and dark blue as
well as black at Pounds 69.99. Hue, as ever on the ball, has some in a thick
matt soft but unclingy nylon/Lycra mix at Pounds 55 a time.
In sporty mode there is even more choice - from Ally Capellino's Hearts of
Oak leggings in ecru ribbed cotton, with something of the elan of a jodhpur,
at Pounds 60 a time to Artwork's beautiful indigo coloured cuffed cotton
jersey versions at Pounds 63.
You will like the look but maybe not the prices. Whereas once leggings
seemed to cost only roughly twice the price of tights nowadays, unless a
plain chain-store version suits you (and Marks and Spencer is still doing
plain classic leggings for about Pounds 16 and its jodhpur versions for
Pounds 19.99) the sky's the limit. However, for comfort they still beat the
classic pair of trousers hands-down.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Food and Drink: A fine taste of Sicily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROOM AND oleander were in bloom along the roadside when we left Palermo for
Menfi in south-west Sicily. Beyond acres of vines and olives, some citrus
trees showed yellow - the first hint of the thematic tastes of a Sicilian
week of cooking.
A course with Tasting Italy is a dream week for the lazy and greedy.
Primarily a cooking holiday, the philosophy is one of mood as much as food:
to introduce, along with superb cooking, the Italian sense of the importance
of fresh ingredients and mealtimes. 'I see people at supermarket checkouts
buying tinned potatoes,' says Sara Schwartz, one of the partners of Tasting
Italy, 'and I want to ask them why.'
Why indeed, when potatoes tossed in olive oil, interspersed with onion,
lemon and garlic, then scattered with coarse salt and origanum and baked,
can make your toes curl with delight?
Our course was held in an 18th-century palazzo owned by the Ravida family.
The rooms are huge and their church-like smell - one of the bedrooms was
formerly a chapel - is enhanced by paintings, frescoes and gilt finery.
We were an eclectic crowd, eyeing one another around our welcome table of
bread with lemon zest and sun-dried tomatoes. On a marble slab table was a
huge bowl of lemons, and ice-breaking jugs of Pimms-soaked strawberries.
This was not the bakers' dozen of serious foodies I had been expecting.
Ranging from 18 to over 60, they included a diesel generator factory owner,
a student, a waste disposal company MD; a retired builder and the head chef
of a King's Road restaurant. In charge of us for the week was Carla Tomasi,
cook and writer.
We were issued with aprons and watched Carla prepare sardines and anchovies.
An exponent of the hands-on school of learning, she threw us into the deep
end with that tray of unfortunate fish.
Our self-congratulation knew no bounds when we lunched on tender pink and
white marbled beans with a rough pesto, anchovies cured in lemon juice,
sardines fried around cheesy stuffings, spaghetti with a sauce of sardines,
onions, currants and pine nuts. Dessert was wild strawberry ice cream served
with strawberries marinated in orange and lemon juice. All this with too
much wine and sweet spring water. We slept it off on the beach.
The course may not be heavyweight enough for the really serious foodie. But
it was deeply enriching for me and we took away a file full of eminently
repeatable recipes along with memories of a slightly crumbling palazzo,
flaking frescoes, cool verandahs and new friends.
Tasting Italy courses also take place in Piedmont and Tuscany. Prices range
from Pounds 695-Pounds 715 which includes transfers, tuition and all food
and wine but excludes airfares. For further information contact Sara
Schwartz at PO Box 1930, London W11 2ZU. Tel (071-727 9376 or fax 071-287
2997).

FT  25 SEP 93 / Food and Drink: Slap another smoked 'roo on a barbie for me
 -Nicholas Woodsworth finds that Australia's 'new food' is very much to his
liking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARTLING food discoveries sometimes come at unexpected moments. I made one
not long ago as I streaked through the sky from London to Australia, and it
is this: if you travel east at 500 miles an hour, not only do you go through
two sunsets and two dawns in 24 hours - you also go through two breakfasts,
two lunches and two dinners. This might not sound earth-shattering but it
had me worried. I do not like the idea of travelling faster than my own
stomach.
Hardly were the Medoc and lamb medallions disposed of than the odour of hot
coffee, bacon and croissants drifted from the galley. My companions on the
flight - four women journalists from London - seemed wholly unperturbed by
these endless offerings and tucked in heartily. But then, they are
hard-bitten food-and-wine professionals who make their living through
eating. For them, this was just a limbering-up exercise in preparation for
the rigours ahead.
I, on the other hand, was merely a token male and food amateur who had come
along to see what ordinary visitors might make of Australian fare. And,
since food is a product of geography and social history, to discover what it
might say about Aussies themselves.
First stop, Adelaide. For most visitors, Sydney - that brash, bustling, and
most cosmopolitan of cities - provides an initial contact with the
continent. Adelaide is something else; the only small town I know of with a
population over 1m.
With old-fashioned and unhurried civic pride, red brickwork and Victorian
iron filigree, Adelaide exudes an air of colonial Australia. Not even its
endless and sprawling bungalow suburbs modernise the image wholly. Tidy,
staid, conservative, intolerant of airs or pretensions - they push the city
straight into the 1950s.
Does the food match the dated atmosphere? Walking past the cheap and
cheerful cafes of Hindley Street, the main drag, I suspected it would. Here,
amid pool halls, tattoo parlours and noisy, hard-drinking pubs were dozens
of establishments of the egg-and-chips, beans-and-chips, sausage-and-chips
variety - the kind of places that, world over, have satisfied the stolid
Anglo stomach and soul since colonial days.
Evidently, there is a strong element of Australian cuisine that remains
faithful to its English meat-and-two-veg origins. The further you get from
the larger centres of population on the coast, the simpler the whole idea of
food and eating becomes. At Alice Springs, in the dead centre of the
continent, such concepts are simplified to the irreducible minimum; witness
the dress code sign outside Bojangles restaurant: 'Neat casual or bugger
off.'
Even in civilised South Australia, though, the famous Adelaide 'pie floater'
 -a meat pie in a soup bowl of mushy peas and topped with gouts of tomato
sauce - retains its proud place. It is an item best bought, only half sober,
from the mobile vans that set up on the city's street corners at sunset.
'After a few tinnies on a cold winter's night, there's nothing better than a
floater,' one demure young waitress told me.
I followed her prescription and found, on the few-tinnies level by which
such things should be judged, that she was right. None the less, if you move
off Hindley Street and look just a little bit harder you will, without much
problem, discover a world of sophisticated food and drink that belies wholly
Adelaide's provincial image. For the visitor, it is the start of a culinary
trail that leads to some of the most innovative and intriguing cuisine found
anywhere.
Where does Australia's more exciting cooking come from? Not, we began to
realise over dinner at Adelaide's Universal Wine Bar, from British
tradition. That was not the source of the tender, charcoal-grilled squid and
marinated red pepper salad I was eating. If Anglo-Australians had been left
to their own devices, the Universal's menu today would not be enlivened by
garlic and olive oil, aubergine and shallots, scallops and fresh-water
crayfish. It would be duller even than the Adelaide suburbs.
The cuisine of the antipodes has moved on since the 1950s, however. Before
that time, Australians suffered from what was known as 'cultural cringe,' a
deep-seated malady that associated things superior with things British.
Conversely, everything domestic was regarded as inferior.
The result was as depressingly predictable as a Vegemite sandwich: tinned
and heavy foods, fried foods, preserved foods, foods with their natural
flavours and textures literally boiled out of them. It was only when the
first large waves of immigrants arrived from Italy, Greece, Lebanon and
Turkey that Australians discovered freshness.
Based on fresh ingredients, cooked rapidly and prepared without pretension,
Mediterranean cooking fits in well with the country's relaxed, outdoor
life-style (nouvelle flopped miserably in Australia). It shares something
with the back-yard barbecue that has always been popular Down Under. Put
plainly, the best Australian cooking is a kind of barbie-style cooking with
refinement.
By contrast, Adelaide's water supply, drawn from the city's rivers and
reservoirs, is not very refined at all - indeed, locals say there is a meal
in every mouthful. But then, water is not drunk in great abundance at South
Australian restaurant tables. Neither, these days, is beer, nor the sweet
and grapey Moselle that Australians used to favour. Why should it be when,
less than an hour's drive from Adelaide, is the Barossa valley, one of the
country's finest wine-producing areas?
France has lost a steady customer. In the Barossa - home to 48 wineries and
a centre for a third of Australia's premium wine output - I wandered around
vineyards lit up in autumnal shades of red and gold and found that, with a
little experimentation, Australian wines can give as much pleasure and
satisfaction as French wines and, generally, cost less.
I shall not pretend to serious wine judging; after the third tasting
session, I lost my standards of comparison. South Australian wines, grown in
a different soil and under a stronger sun, are fuller, fruitier and bigger
than the wines with which I am familiar. But it is these qualities that
revived my flagging interest in whites (particularly Semillons and the
country's superb, buttery-tasting Chardonnays), and gave me a taste for red
Shiraz, Australia's major grape variety, more commonly known in Europe as
Hermitage.
At St Hallet's winery, I revelled in Old Block, the product of Shiraz vines
planted by German Lutherans at the beginning of the century. At Maggie
Beer's delightful Barossa valley restaurant, the Pheasant Farm, I tasted an
even more exotic form of this rich, flavourful, heady variety, a sparkling
wine by Rockport called Black Shiraz. It is so big and full of tannin and
fruit flavour that it quite swept me away.
So, too, did the meal that it accompanied. Like all Australian chefs of
note, Maggie Beer believes in using freshly-prepared local produce. No
victim of cultural cringe, her menu features gum-tree smoked kangaroo on
duck-egg pasta. I found it as good as the best smoked venison.
Even a decade ago, such a dish would have horrified her compatriots. The
kangaroo might be a national icon but, in the past, most Australians have
rated it fit only for dog food. Today, kangaroo is just one of the items of
'bush tucker' - indigenous foods, hunted traditionally and gathered by
Aboriginals - in which there is growing interest.
I could go on. Certainly, our group did - on and on and on until I though we
would split.
At Seppeltsfield winery, we sat drinking Para tawny port, a concoction just
right for the wintery, grey, June weather. At the 1812 Restaurant in
Tanunda, I downed a tartare made from sweet and flavourful Tasmanian salmon.
At the Yalumba winery, I sipped a sparkling rose and learned why it would
never sell well Down Under - even the liberated Australian male has a strong
aversion to the colour pink. And at the Cafe C in the town of Springton, we
dined on spicy scallop salad and a delicate Thai green chicken curry. It was
a fair sampling of yet another trend: Austral-Asian cooking.
Brought once again by the country's newest wave of immigrants - Vietnamese,
Thais and ethnic Chinese - this is a fusion of styles that is fast changing
the culinary scene. The nation is finally realising that its future lies not
with the distant west at all, but with the Asia that lies on its doorstep.
I shall not go on, though. We were still in South Australia. Ahead lay
Victoria and New South Wales, both reputed for the sophistication of their
cuisine. Already, I was exhausted and ready to go on the Scarsdale diet.
My suspicion on the plane was right: Australia is just too much for one
sitting. But given a while to catch my breath, I shall be heading Down Under
once again. The culinary exploration of Australia is no mean achievement. It
took a Cook, after all, to discover it in the first place.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Cookery: Food to warm the hearts of Britain - Philippa
Davenport cooks comfort foods for autumnal evenings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN EVENINGS begin to draw in and bonfire smoke gives way to ground frost
in the garden, a yearning for comfort foods begins.
Game pies and stews make splendidly meaty offerings when the game season
gets properly under way. In the meantime my thoughts turn to less
carnivorous dishes.
Regional recipes such as Dublin Coddle, Pan Haggerty and Anglesey Eggs
clearly lack sophistication but, like hot water bottles and vests, their aim
is not glamour but to supply feelings of wellbeing.
That said, Anglesey Eggs is a more refined dish than the ingredients list
suggests. It is sufficiently filling to satisfy a family for supper, but not
solidly stuffing. In fact it could be served to lunchtime guests. Two things
keep it delicate: a sauce that is silky, not a heavy wallpaper paste, and
the lightness of the puree, which stems from a high ratio of leeks to
potato.
ANGLESEY EGGS (serves four) Quails' eggs are fiddly to peel but two dozen of
them nestling in the puree make a pretty alternative to hens' eggs.
1lb floury potatoes; 6 leeks (or more as needed to yield 1 1/2 lb after
trimming); 6 eggs; 3oz butter; 1 tablespoon flour;  1/2 pt gold top milk;
freshly grated nutmeg; 2-3oz Cheddar cheese; a spoonful or two of
breadcrumbs (optional).
Peel the potatoes, and clean and slice the leeks, tender green parts as well
as whites. Boil the potatoes and steam the leeks over them, cooking both
vegetables until they are well softened. Forget about al dente in this
instance.
Whizz the leeks in a food processor with 2oz butter to make a sloppy green
puree. Mash the potatoes, season them lavishly and beat in the leeks.
Make a sauce with the remaining 1oz butter, the flour and the milk. Let it
simmer for 10 minutes then flavour it with salt, lots of pepper and nutmeg
and 2oz grated cheese.
While the sauce cooks, hard-boil the eggs, shell and quarter them. Spoon the
puree into a ring in a baking dish. Pile the eggs into the centre of the
nest (sometimes I scatter snippets of ham among them) and pour the sauce
over them.
Sprinkle on the remaining 1oz grated Cheddar (or a few spoonfuls of
breadcrumbs) and bake at 400F (200C) gas mark 6 for 10 minutes or so until
bubbling hot.
PAN HAGGERTY (serves four/six) Rosti, crique and other potato cakes are much
enjoyed in fashionable circles, so why not our own Northumbrian version? The
richness of this dish calls for a large green salad afterwards. A mixture of
faintly bitter chicory, frizzy endive and peppery watercress is particularly
good.
2lb potatoes; 3/4 lb onions; 6oz mature farm-made Cheddar cheese; 4
tablespoons fat (beef dripping is traditional, butter and bacon fat are also
good).
Chop the onions finely and let them fry gently in two tablespoons of fat in
a very heavy based (or non-stick) frying pan about 11-12in in diameter while
you peel and thinly slice the potatoes and grate the cheese.
Away from the heat, lift the onions from the pan. Add a little more fat to
the pan and spread half the potatoes over the base. Season them well, lay
the onions over them and cover with the cheese. Finally spread the rest of
the potatoes over the top, seasoning well as before.
Cover the pan (a double-thick sheet of foil makes a good lid) and steam-fry
over a fairly low flame for, say, 30-35 minutes until the vegetables are
tender.
Remove the foil and turn up the heat towards the end to drive off most of
the moisture and to brown the underside of the potato cake.
Brush the surface of the potatoes with a little fat and slip the pan under a
hot grill to brown the top well.
DUBLIN CODDLE (serves four/six) This is said to have been a favourite dish
of Dean Swift. Some cooks use milk instead of water, which makes for a
richer sauce, though the texture can appear a little curdled. The proper
accompaniments are soda bread and stout.
1lb sausages; 1/4 lb thick cut streaky bacon; 2 onions; 2lb waxy potatoes; a
bay leaf and a bunch of parsley.
Dice the bacon and cook it gently until the fat begins to run. Remove it and
stir in the chopped onion. Five minutes later add the sausages. Turn them to
coat them with fat. Return the bacon to the pot, add the potatoes cut into
chunks, the bay leaf, a couple of spoonfuls of chopped parsley and a good
grinding of pepper, but no salt.
Pour on water to come just level with the top. Bring swiftly to simmering
point and stew gently (on the hob or in the oven) with the lid slightly
askew for at least 45 minutes until the ingredients are very tender but not
falling apart, and the 'gravy' is reduced and well flavoured.
Lift out the solids and boil down the liquid at the end if there is too
much. Sprinkle with extra parsley and adjust seasoning to taste.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Gardening: A portrait from beyond the grave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THERE life for a garden after death? We all burrow away, planting our
musk roses and lavender-blue Aster frikartii; we wage inconclusive war on
weeds; we escape for hours from human company and then, like our tender
salvias, we keel over.
'I have seen only one certainty in life', said an early Muslim saint:
'death'. We have to agree that he was right. These autumn evenings have a
melancholic tinge: responding to it, I have been on the trail of autumn
mortality. Just north of London, I have revisited a garden where the balance
between death and continuing life is particularly evident.
In autumn, its former owner is particularly in my thoughts. Autumn crocus
looks very pretty at the moment and the bigger flowers of the colchicum are
even better. Nobody has ever been such an expert on the family as the late
EA Bowles. Bowles' life spanned the great age of gardening, from 1865 to
1954. He outlived the later years of Gertrude Jekyll and the formative years
of Hidcote or Sissinghurst. Nowadays, they have all been revived and they
are household names, even to non-gardeners. Yet Bowles had a sharper eye,
ever alert to the small beauties of botany.
Dozens of good garden plants still bear his name, from a grey cotton
lavender to a well-known cream-yellow crocus. Nonetheless, he has remained a
name for connoisseurs only. Some of us have read his three seasonal books,
called My Garden: others, perhaps, have seen Bowles Corner in the gardens at
Wisley in Surrey. If Bowles had been a woman, not a bachelor, he would be
all over bookshops, the radio and the US. When he died, the Bowles line
branched into Parker Bowles, whose fame now extends beyond cream-coloured
crocuses. What about his garden: has it survived him in any way?
Through his books, readers still feel that they know it intimately. His
habit was to describe what he grew as if he was taking us round with a cup
of coffee in one hand. The garden lies at Myddleton House in Enfield,
Middlesex, just off the junction of the A10 with exit 25 of the M25.
In Bowles' day, it teemed with rarities, not the roar of traffic: his alpine
meadow of bulbs was famous; so were his crocuses, snowdrops, irises,
anenomes and his rare quirks of nature (his Lunatic Asylum), not to mention
his rare trees and shrubs. Through his own writings, you cannot help knowing
his habits: his dislike of sweet peas on the dining room table, his habit of
going out in January, throwing buckets of water at the trunks of the yew
trees and polishing them until they shone.
This month of September was the season for Bowles' bowling: he would scatter
narcissi along his drive by bowling them over-arm and planting them wherever
they landed.
In 1954, Bowles' famous garden passed to the pharmacology department of
London University; in 1968, after years of academic neglect, it sold most of
the flower garden to Lee Valley Park. Nowadays, there are civic lamposts up
the drive where Bowles once bowled narcissi. The Lee Valley Rangers have
made themselves at home and have established a Ranger Base in the stables.
Since 1984, there has been talk of refurbishment and approaches to Wisley
and the new conservation movement for plants. I have heard good things about
the new iris beds whose varieties have names such as Indian Pow-Wow. Lee
Valley inherited a difficult legacy after 14 years in London University's
inadequate hands and a further 16 years of restraint has not made the task
easier. Admirably, Lee Valley and the Rangers open the garden daily
throughout the season; they provide leaflets, some labels, an incongruous
glasshouse from a show in Glasgow and a budget for garden staff.
As a test-case for a garden's afterlife, Bowles' has enjoyed an unusual
life: neglect, then attempts at restoration from an unusual quarter.
The site is a muddle and I am not impressed by progress, even if funds have
been scarce. I suspect that a no-spray policy has been popular, leaving the
weeds untamed; it looks as if no strong personality has taken a firm grip
and pulled the garden back into shape. In these days of conservation, the
opportunity ought to be taken. Bowles's garden is one of the few which a
famous owner described so carefully that we could recreate its extraordinary
interest in this new, plant-finding age. If run ruthlessly, it would not be
impossibly expensive.
Nonetheless, all is not melancholy. To an ear trained on Bowles, there are
echoes which survive the grave. Sometimes you catch them on the old pergola
where roses grow with names like Silver Moon and Paul's Perpetual White:
Bowles enjoyed single-flowered roses and two of his favourites, Anemone and
Bracteata, still climb where he planted them, up the old stone cross of
Enfield, which he rescued and conserved in his own garden.
In the neighbouring jungle, his carnations have gone from the box-edged
beds, although anyone competent could reinstate them. The grey-leaved
tree-poppies are still going strong with those single white flowers like
newly-fried eggs. Nearby, you hit on a tangle of oddities, a white passion
flower, a big clemetis armandii, a badly-damaged celletia with its thorns, a
red colquhounia and behind the wall, a climbing dicentra.
The river has changed course: the hosta-bed continues; the irises have been
updated; Bowles might not care for all the Rangers' bedding-out, but I
certainly cared for the sight of his marvellous long-flowered Wistaria,
still growing by a former river-bridge and twisting upwards far into an
evergreen tree. Even among neglect, old echoes suggest new tricks: I now
want wistaria up my awful leylandii cypress.
Among the weeds and the ever-present snowberry, I began to relish the
fragments of immortality, made famous by his writings. The cyclamen are
still there and so is the old conservatory, now housing the pair of
ornamental ostriches which used to stand by the river. The lake looks
forlorn and the meadow is gone, but there is still a tantalising sweet
chestnut tree and a plant or two of oxalis Bowles White whose long season of
flower has been delighting me in my garden this year. There are even some of
the lemon yellow daisies, which Bowles' books recall as a special present.
If the owner returned, he would be philosophical, perhaps in one of his
homely, but arch quotations. He might, however, ask us why we should expect
our gardens to survive us and whether this quiet subsidence was not better.
For gardens to live on, they have to be retouched by somebody else, like a
canvas for ever in an artist's workshop.
I have, however, learned what to plant in order to cheat life's only
certainty. In the corners of the flower beds and in a crack of the paving
round Enfield Cross, great clumps of autumn colchicums still thrust into the
open, leafless but wonderfully white and purple in the sun. If you want to
cheat mortality, plant colchicums for the future. They will survive a
University, and be friendly to a Ranger Base and the passage of 40 years.
Bowles loved this family and must have planted some of these great
survivors: in September I find it reassuring that some of them are still
flowering, in the jungle of the garden whose owner understood them best.

FT  25 SEP 93 / A white wall of death: Richard Cowper tells how his
mountaineering expedition ended in near-tragedy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVALANCHE] The cry most feared by mountaineers everywhere. None more so than
by those lured to the greater ranges, where heavy snowfall, warm weather and
fierce winds regularly send thousands of tonnes of snow crashing down the
mountainsides.
Avalanches are the high-altitude climber's worst enemy. There have been just
2,385 successful ascents of the world's 14 8,000m peaks - all of them in the
Himalayas or the nearby Karakoram - but 450 climbers have died trying,
almost half in avalanches. An avalanche has killed one climber for every ten
successful ascents on the world's most coveted peaks.
My trip to Nanga Parbat in Pakistan, on an expedition to the world's ninth
highest mountain led by Doug Scott, 53, the first Briton to climb Everest,
was brought to a premature end by just such an imperious act of nature.
Scott and our other team member, Wojciech Kurtyka, a Pole in his early 40s
who is one of the world's most outstanding Himalayan mountaineers, have more
than 50 years of climbing between them and nine 8,000m peaks to their
credit. But avalanches are complex natural phenomena, and even the most
experienced climber is not able to predict when - or even if - one will
occur.
On the day of the avalanche we planned to climb the highest peak west of the
Mazeno pass, above our base camp. Unlike the lower but more alluring rock
spire nearby, climbed by Scott in a great rush of adrenalin a few days
earlier, it was not an attractive mountain. But it had not been climbed
before as far as we knew and, at just under 6,000m, was suitable for
training and acclimatisation. We named it Mazeno west.
Our party of three set off in fine weather from base camp at 5am, early
enough we felt to get us down before the heat of the day made the slopes
unstable. No danger there, we thought - except that the peak we were
attempting was in a basin and south facing, caught by the morning sun.
There had been some snowfall the day before, but lower down it was just a
light dusting. No danger there, we thought - but it does not take a huge
snowfall to trigger a slope already poised to slide.
It seemed a sensible route: up an old avalanche scar. No danger there, we
thought - except that the top third of our route had not avalanched
recently, and higher up we found that in places the snow had an unpleasant
hollow ring to it.
We reached the top without any great difficulties shortly before 10am, from
where we had dazzling views of many of the peaks along the 13km Mazeno
ridge, the expedition's planned route to Nanga Parbat's 8,125m summit. It
has become known as 'infinity ridge' because it is the longest unclimbed
ridge in the world, and some argue it will prove impossible to climb so far
at such altitude.
By now the sun was well up and we did not linger, descending at speed
unroped, as we had on the ascent. Kurtyka first, then Scott, with me, the
expedition lightweight in terms of skill and experience, well behind.
As it turned out my slower descent was a stroke of luck. It meant I was not
in the path of the avalanche when it struck.
Kurtyka, a man with the looks, sensitivity and athleticism of a young Rudolf
Nureyev, tells of the incident that so nearly killed Doug Scott.
'Very soon after arriving at the narrowest part of the gulley I heard a
muffled noise. Avalanche] I looked up and saw a long crack appear across the
slope above and then the snow began to slide. Doug was about 25m above me,
running towards some rocks. He was trying to escape, but the snow was
catching him up . . .
'Immediately I made three or four jumps out of the gulley and on to some
rocks at the base of the nearby mountain wall. It was just a few seconds
before the first rush of snow hurtled past. I had made a very narrow
escape.'
But with less time to get clear, Scott was not so lucky. A wall of snow
crashed into him, sending him spinning down the steep couloir.
'I tried to scurry across the gully towards the rocks away from the
avalanche, but it was too late,' says Scott. 'I thumped both my ice axes
into the ice. Then the avalanche of heavy wet snow hit me and pulled me off.
I was carried down, not thinking much of it at first.
'Suddenly my descent speed picked up. I lost one ice axe. I tried to pull
myself upright to put the other pick in the ground. It was useless. I was
vaguely conscious of passing Wojciech. All the time I was flailing my arms,
trying to get on top of the snow to stop myself from being buried and
suffocated.
'Twice I felt as if I was flying through the air. There was a wonderful
sensation of floating, just mixing with the snow. Twice I seemed to bang my
head on rocks or something solid. About two thirds of the way down my boot
crampons snagged on some rocks. It was tremendously painful.
'As I was swept down the mountain I kept thinking that I would soon become
unconscious and die. But after each bump I didn't and I thought how
resilient the human body was. I had been expecting a kind of blackness.
'There was no other thought, other than living each second of the fall. Then
the whole thing slithered to a halt. I had to undo my rucsac belt in order
to breathe. I poked my head out of the snow, cleaned my glasses. 'Oh, I'm
alright' I thought. Then I tried to walk - and I couldn't'
Scott had fallen 350m down a snow and ice gully of more than 50 degrees.
Even with a helmet, which he had only decided to take at the last minute, it
was a miracle he survived. But he was badly hurt: his snagged crampons had
smashed the joints and tendons in one ankle and the flesh had come away from
the bone.
If the snow which peeled away like a broad carpet across the slope had been
just 15cm deeper, Britain's most accomplished mountaineer would have been
buried under more than 2m of snow and would have quickly suffocated. We may
never have found him. Or he might have hit directly one of the many boulders
on his long fall. In either case his chances of survival would have been
minimal.
As I climbed nervously down through the avalanche debris the tenacious Scott
was already starting to slide and crawl across the glacier, while Kurtyka,
showing his extraordinary stamina, ran off to get assistance from Captain
Ali, our liaison officer, and our two Pakistani camp assistants, Hussein and
Hakim.
The journey down the last part of the mountain had taken Scott just a few
seconds. But the 3km trip to base camp, over moraines and around crevasses,
mostly on his knees, took several nightmare hours. He is a giant of a man,
well over 6ft, and just too big to be carried easily across steep terrain.
The pain on his face as he crawled over snow, ice and boulders reminded me
of the famous photographs of him taken in 1977 by Chris Bonington, when
Scott broke both legs while climbing the 24,000 foot Ogre in the Pakistani
Karakoram. That epic descent in a storm took eight gruelling days.
Later, back at Nanga Parbat base camp, Scott said that the memory of that
terrible day had helped him develop an efficient method of crawling, like a
crab, on Nanga Parbat.
Even after his lucky escape it was hard for us to accept that the expedition
was now over. We had been happy together; healthy, fit and on the way to
becoming well acclimatised. The lure of Nanga Parbat was still strong. This
was Scott's third attempt to climb it; Kurtyka was captivated by its size
and many challenging unclimbed routes; and after several weeks on its slopes
I too had come under its thrall.
Bounded to the north and west by the river Indus, Nanga Parbat ('Naked
mountain' in Sanskrit) stands in mighty isolation as the culmination of the
western half of the Himalaya. Looking to the summit from the Rupal valley it
rises almost sheer for close on 5,000m, the biggest face on any mountain in
the world.
It may not be the most beautiful of the Himalayan giants, but it is the
grandest I have seen. It is also one of the most dangerous. Famous for
savage storms just 112 climbers have reached its summit since it was first
climbed by Herman Buhl in 1953, and 56 have died trying, over half by
avalanche.
It certainly saw us off. Even the 'walk-out' from our 4,800m base camp was
not without incident. We overcame a porter strike, lost one of our 11 mules
over a 60m ravine, and Scott narrowly prevented his horse from jettisoning
him down the same precipice when the beast shook off his saddle.
Six days after the avalanche we limped into the small mountain town of Astor
where a doctor took an X-ray, wrongly diagnosed that Scott had a broken foot
and assured us that the three screws put in after the Ogre break were still
in the right place. Four days later we were in an aeroplane on our way home
from Islamabad. From the aircraft, we had a final glimpse of the
unattainable snow-white trapezoid peak, looming in the distant mist.
The expedition was supported by the British Mountaineering Council, the
Mountain Everest Foundation, and Malden Mills. Clothing by Buffalo and Jack
Wolfskin.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Travel: Shaken, and stirred, in Marseilles - Two nights and
a day are just not enough in France's city of anti-legend, says
self-confessed Dumas junkie Nigel Andrews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARSEILLES is one of those cities that exist in anti-legend: fogged by
folklore and apocryphal fame, but all of a faintly dubious kind. Smugglers,
drug-dealers, the Mafia. Corsican brotherhoods, impossible fish stews, bad
Humphrey Bogart movies. Not to mention - but we will - all those
interminable low-life stories by Pagnol where men in striped sweaters throw
oeillades at the daughters of the dockworld.
On my first stopover in France's second largest city, I made the inevitable
finding. All of this and none of this is true. The most famous landmark is
the Vieux Port, hitherto stamped on my retina by films like French
Connection 2 where the villain was chased over slippery quaysides by Gene
Hackman, or Hackman's fitter double.
On inspection, the Old Port is a place for moody visceral chase scenes. But
it is also an architectural-archaeological jewel: centrepiece in a town
where a lustrous, laid-back joie de vivre seems just as prevalent as the
swarthy, laconic mood the place is supposed to enjoy. (Note in
part-explanation of the joie de vivre: Marseilles won the European Cup just
after I got there).
A visitor feels like a native as soon as he arrives. The airport taxi flails
through traffic while the driver talks of his joys and sorrows. Then one
comes to an emergency stop outside the chosen hotel. Mine is the Sofitel.
I get out shaken and am soon strangely stirred. The hotel has a magnificent
view: it stands on a headland at the harbour mouth and surveys the whole
port, with its sparkling water, bristling yacht-masts and sunset-pink walls,
towers and fortresses of ancient brick.
For - yes - Marseilles dates back to the year 600 BC when, my guidebook
informs me, Phoenician galleys slipped into the inlet which is now the Vieux
Port and founded a place called Massalia. This became Greek, later allied
itself with Rome, finally pronounced itself French.
As for the anthem that became France's battle hymn of the republique, it was
composed by a young French soldier in 1792. Popularised at a banquet for 500
volunteers in Marseilles, it was then sung all across France as the men
marched to Paris. By the time it reached the capital the Marseillaise had
won the Eurovision Song Contest, or its dix-huitieme siecle equivalent,
several times over.
Two nights and a day in this town are not enough, but they concentrate one's
mind and delight in the place. In the morning, wander round the fish market
on the Quai des Belges.
Le tout Marseilles is out and about, assessing the eels while the eels
assess them back. (Do not wait for the nasty chop of the vendor's cleaver).
Then have a cafe creme and flaky croissant in a waterside bar, surrounded by
the usual central casting crowd of blue-and-white-sweatered mariners.
After that, board the boat for the town's offshore piece de resistance, the
Chateau d'If. I must disclose an interest. As a child I was an Alexandre
Dumas junkie. Not so much The Three Musketeers with its dandyish threesome -
foursome, actually - shooting their lace cuffs as they helped Milady
So-and-So fight Cardinal Such-and-Such. No, rather the Gothic shivers,
dripping rocks and elegantly calcinated prose of The Count Of The Monte
Cristo.
As the boat leaves Marseilles and bumps across the silver strait beyond the
harbour mouth, the castle-island swells from a floating chess piece to a
craggy fortress. Having taken the first morning boat, one is alone with the
shrieking gulls and beetling cliff of wall. A short climb, an archway - then
the sullen, bearded doorkeeper relieves you of your valuables (FFr10, Pounds
1.13) in return for a small ticket. Un-jangling his keys, he pushes you into
the courtyard.
Around this tall, dank well are three grim storeys. Arched doorways are
surmounted with Gothic name-signs: 'Edmond Dantes, Comte de Monte Cristo',
'L'Homme au Masque de Fer' (yes, he too), and dear 'Abbe Faria', Dantes'
neighbour, friend and sacrificial ally in flight.
Inside the cells, some things surprise. That of Dantes has some
wall-scratched messages that seem to be distinctly post-19th century in
origin. And Faria's cell has a wide-open door, a pleasant view through a
hole in the rock and a TV screen set into the wall. (This, I learn, is for a
coming art exhibition). But such things fail to distract. If you close your
eyes the castle still has the smell of fear; touch the walls, the texture of
decay.
If you climb the pitch-black spiral steps in an outer keep to the castle's
roof, you can survey the terror of the jagged rocks and cold sea Dantes
fought before reaching safety and riches. (It should only occur to one after
wandering round this place - why spoil your fun during? - that Dumas's
characters were fictional and that the Man in the Iron Mask was accommodated
not here but at the Bastille in Paris).
Back on main land, it is time for lunch. It must be bouillabaisse. I order
at an outside table in a small dockside restaurant. With a good Marseilles
bouillabaisse you first get a bowl of spiced and succulent fish soup with
bits of browned bread and garlic relish.
I was given a fork, not a spoon, with the all-liquid soup, and assuming this
to be an old Marseilles custom battled away for several minutes dredging the
un-dredgeable. Then the waiter, noticing my discomfort, realised his mistake
and replaced it with a spoon.
Then followed the fish stew itself: heaven in a serving bowl. Self-warnings
about the state of Mediterranean seafood are suspended as the fishy
fragments in stock-rich gravy - here a mussel, there a piece of loup de mer,
now some lobster - are fetched up with accompanying nuggets of potato,
carrot or courgette. Bouillabaisse is essentially a fish couscous. Recipe:
throw in absolutely everything, followed by most of the stocks and spices of
the Mediterranean.
There is more Marseilles for the afternoon. The two churches you should
visit are the 11th century Saint-Victor, a crenellated gem overlooking the
port with a crypt containing an earlier 5th century basilica as well as a
collection of early Christian sarcophagi; and Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde, a 19th
century folly in Roman-Byzantine style whose hilltop position affords the
most spectacular views in town.
Now return to the Old Port, go back a street and relax in the Jardin des
Vestiges (Garden of Ruins). Here, just behind the stock exchange, you will
discover the vertebrae of history. The bones and stones of ancient
Marseilles stick spine-like from the green sward. Here a fragment of Greek
fortification, there a 4th century entrance into town; and clambering around
and over the building-blocks of the old port - this is the really old port -
are children of the gipsy and Moorish families who make this park their
afternoon relaxation point.
My own relaxation point is back in my room. I sit at the window in the
evening mesmerised by the colour changes in water and sky, the double-imaged
yachts, the lights blinking on round the harbour and cueing their
reflections in the starry night sky.
Here is perfect, sense-filling peace. And if, when you are finally thrown
out of the Sofitel by a restless management, you cannot bear the prospect of
returning to the old life and old cares, you can always knock at the
fortified gate of the large stone building next door. 'Legion Etrangere',
says the grim, forbidding, irresistible sign: 'Recrutement Jour et Nuit.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (12): Conserving the
interests of the nation - Gerald Cadogan talks to the organisations working
to maintain the old - and not so old - buildings that distinguish Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATION societies began when William Morris founded the Society for the
Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) in 1877. The aim was to defend them
against unneeded restoration, a pastime dear to the Victorians - as almost
every church in the UK shows. New members are still expected to read and
assent to the manifesto.
Among other things, it condemns those - academics especially - who attempt
to 'restore' a building by fixing its origin arbitrarily at a particular
point and ignore its history and life since; he calls this 'a feeble and
lifeless forgery.'
Morris's broadside hits at the heart of the debate on how to treat old
buildings. Would he approve of rebuilding Windsor Castle or Uppark, in West
Sussex, both damaged severely by fire, exactly as they were? I doubt it, for
that is parody. Far better - and braver - to consolidate the charred ruins
and build anew.
The SPAB sets the pattern for the other national societies which exist to
meet the threats of destruction and public ignorance. It campaigns to save
buildings and advise on planning applications to alter or demolish them.
Often, they are designated by law to do this, and get some funds from the
department of national heritage.
They have lectures and field trips and give parties in period dress in
buildings they are defending. They also run courses and publish books and
pamphlets to teach about the buildings and how to look after them
sympathetically.
It used to be a battle, and still is sometimes; but, nowadays, government
and the public are more understanding. All the same, does the government
connect Conservatism and Conservation fully?
The SPAB promotes the 'P' in its name by stressing regular maintenance and
teaching how to repair by means of handbooks, courses and working parties.
As one of the designated 'amenity' societies which planning authorities
consult, it concentrates on pre-Georgian buildings, but will step in for any
building of quality of any period.
Full members have an unusual perk. The society sends them (quarterly) a list
of houses for sale that need repair, expecting them to follow SPAB
principles if they take on such buildings. In a recent issue of this useful
list, which includes properties being sold by local councils, values ranged
from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 4.5m.
The Ancient Monuments Society (AMS) joined the fray in 1924 and is now
another designated amenity society, seeking to look after anything man-made
 -from megaliths to cinemas - and resisting unsuitable changes and
unjustified demolition. It handles 5,000 cases a year and its newsletter is
packed with helpful information.
Bright Young Things started the Georgian Group in 1937 when 18th century
London was vanishing; indeed, Nancy Mitford offered to chain herself naked
to the railings of a terrace under threat. Now another designated amenity
society, it has a young and dynamic leadership which, among other things,
opposes golf courses that alter the countryside and its 18th century parks.
It runs a lively programme of events in and outside London and abroad.
The Victorian Society has been a force since it began in 1958 to try to save
the Euston Arch in central London - the best symbol in the country of the
railway age - and the Coal Exchange.
Thanks to relentless campaigning (led, notably, by Sir John Betjeman, the
late poet laureate) and now its casework as an amenity society, it has
revolutionised attitudes to 19th and early 20th century buildings. Some of
its events take place in the untouched late-Victorian house it administers
at 18 Stafford Terrace, London W8 (open to the public), which belonged to
Linley Sambourne, a cartoonist on Punch magazine.
The Twentieth Century Society (TCS), founded as the Thirties' Society, takes
the story from 1914 to the present. Aims, methods and programme are like the
others (would you care for 'A Morning Walk in Wembley?') but it is not yet a
statutory amenity society, although having plenty of casework.
Its message that more modern buildings need to be protected from
antipathetic adaptations by listing - the FT's old headquarters at Bracken
House, near St Paul's cathedral, was one of the first of its era to get this
accolade - is, slowly, being heard. Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary,
announced recently the listing of 95 educational buildings, from post-second
world war schools in Hertfordshire to the University of Sussex. The TCS does
not take sides when architects and critics joust over 20th century styles;
only the quality matters.
Save Britain's Heritage, four years older, is solely a campaigning
organisation - and one prepared to fight the whole way, as it did (and lost)
for the Mappin &amp; Webb site in the City of London. Successes include
Billingsgate fish market in London and Calke Abbey (now with the National
Trust).
It does not arrange a programme and spends all contributions (not
'subscriptions') on the fight. Temples of Steam came out recently: a
gazetteer of the pumping stations, water towers, engine houses and dams that
are the heritage of the water industry.
Friends of Friendless Churches shares subscriptions with the AMS. It is a
small, valuable body that picks up casualties from the Church of England's
re-organising of parishes, and works at being steward of Britain's huge
inheritance of wonderful churches. The Friends now own several of them.
The Garden History Society (GHS) began in 1965 to promote the study of
gardens and conserve historic ones. It played an important part in preparing
the English Heritage (EH) register of 1,200 historic parks and gardens. Its
conservation officer says councils now consult the GHS, even though there is
no statutory requirement yet for them to notify it or EH of garden
applications.
The smallest and youngest society (1985) is the Historic Farm Buildings
Group, with a dedicated and knowledgeable membership of under 250 which
campaigns for the buildings of UK farming history.
Indeed, the officers of all the societies have these qualities, and welcome
new members. The societies are charities and benefit from subscriptions paid
by covenant and Gift Aid.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Sport: Ringside seats by an empty stage - Golf

<TEXT>
FROM FIRST light on the Open's final day, spectators pack the grandstands
that frame the 18th hole in anticipation of the drama to come. They are
taking part in one of sport's rituals; the long wait that is so often
necessary to reserve a seat for the action.
At the Open, at least they are more involved than most. The long hours can
be spent watching members of the supporting cast, who, with one eye on
aeroplace schedules, complete their rounds in the time it usually takes to
play nine holes. They can applaud Jack Nicklaus into the sunset once more,
or laugh at the buffoon who is past caring and has more money than he knows
what to do with and takes four putts from 20 ft.
But is there anywhere else in sport where spectators pack the grandstand
with no guarantee that they will see a single shot played? They used to say
that if they opened the gates on non-match days at Old Trafford, the people
would still come and watch the grass grow.
This came to mind on Thursday when I joined the spectators as they parked
themselves in the 18th grandstand at The Belfry even though nothing,
absolutely nothing, was happening at the time on this hole in the Ryder Cup.
The players, on their practice rounds, were on the front nine, the cheers
that heralded their deeds just within range of our ears.
'What are we doing here when all the action is out there?,' I asked the
young couple adjacent. 'Have you been out there?' they asked. 'And did you
see any more of the action following the matches than we are seeing here?'
Their thesis was correct.
The Ryder Cup is a unique event in many ways and one of them is that for two
days at least, just four holes out of 18 are in operation at any one time.
The owners of the Belfry have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds creating
natural spectating areas around most holes. But 25,000 people (the size of
the sell-out crowd) into four holes just will not go.
The Ryder Cup, more than any other event in the sport, is based on
atmosphere. People rely on scoreboards and whispers through the trees to
discover what is going on. You might think the cognoscenti would stay at
home and watch on television but the people in attendance here are not
voyeurs of big-time sport. The true golfers prefer seeing a snatch in person
than just as another TV event.
Yes, they spend large amounts of time doing and watching nothing, but there
are rewards. The young couple, myself and all the others pleasantly passing
the time on an idle Thursday morning, chatting about Manchester and the
Olympics, Aston Villa's win over Birmingham, the clearing fog and Watson's
wobbler over signing Sam Torrance's Gala Ball menu, witnessed a small
exclusive.
Hours before the news was announced at the opening ceremony, we knew that
the Americans, John Cook and Lee Janzen, would not play in the first
morning's foursomes.
We knew this because while their colleagues were out on the golf course,
away from our view, this pair suddenly came out and started practising their
chipping in front of us on the home green. This was not done to keep us
amused. No, when they had chipped and putted for a short while, we heard the
news in a whisper from the pair to a confidante.
It was Cook, I think, who revealkedf: 'No, we are not in there tomorrow
morning.' We digested the information and added it to our list of
discussions. We thought about sharing it with the part-time grandstanders
who came later.
Days spent by the 18th green of the Ryder Cup are rarely in vain. Later, we
witnessed the opening ceremony. And tomorrow the young couple plan a dawn
vigil to be sure of their seat for the final day's singles.
For while all the 12 matches could finish out in the country, the chances
are that those that matter will be played out on this wonderful hole. Seven
of the 12 went to the 18th four years ago and in all of them the hole was
either won or lost and you can imagine the consequent pull on the emotions.
That is why there will not be a spare seat anywhere by the time the players
go down the first hole and begin a journey that will lead many of them back
to a scene that is quite unmatched anywhere else.

THE Farr Hegemony. It sounds like a third-rate historical novel set in
Nepal. In fact, Bruce Farr is a shy New Zealand yacht designer. His hegemony
is among the Whitbread Round the World Race fleet which leaves Southampton
today. Three of the five 80ft maxi yachts are from Farr; all but two of the
new W60 class are from his drawing board.
Statistics alone make it likely that a Farr yacht will win the 32,000-mile
Whitbread race. Even the great Olin Stephens, patriarch of the New York firm
Sparkman &amp; Stephens, never achieved this kind of dominance in the sport.
Rival designers understandably chafe at the presumption that there is only
one choice for a skipper who wants to win. Rob Humphreys, a top British
designer, is responsible for the W60 entry Dolphin &amp; Youth, points out that
his boat gave the Farr-designed Winston a neck-and-neck match in the New
York / Southampton race earlier in the summer.
The sport, he thinks, has an ethos like the one which once prevailed in the
computer world ie 'No one ever got fired for buying IBM'. To compete in big
professional races such as the Whitbread requires millions of dollars in
sponsorship. Large corporations may not know much about sailing, but for IBM
read Farr.
His business, based in Annapolis, Maryland, employs just 12 people and 10 of
them are yacht designers. Each year it controls race boat projects worth
nearly Dollars 100m, a startling position for such a small business headed
by a 44-year-old. Farr says he is uninterested in the money. 'It is much
more important to be the best in the world than the richest,' he says
emphatically.
One story says a lot about Farr's style. In 1988 he was responsible for the
New Zealand challenge for the America's Cup in a 130ft sloop. American
skipper Dennis Conner responded with a rule-busting catamaran and the US
kept the trophy after an ill-tempered Cup that featured more lawyers than
sailors.
At a news conference after the race, a tired and emotional Conner insulted
Farr in front of the world's media. But the icy Kiwi regained his
self-control and the moment passed.
Fast forward five years to the current Whitbread race. Conner has the
dollars of RJ Reynolds and its Winston cigarette brand at his disposal to
give him the easily the best-funded campaign. Without hesitation Conner
chooses Farr to design the boat.
In England recently Farr admitted that the two had not met, or even spoken
about the project. Farr's people talk to Dennis's people. But the yacht is
real enough and is one of the favourites to win the race.
Bruce Farr is one of a generation of New Zealanders now at the top wherever
one goes in world yachting. During the late 1970s his boats would
continually break new ground within the design limits of the International
Offshore Rule which covered most racing and win every prize in sight. The
IOR would then attempt to close off a particular route, only for Farr to
find another design avenue.
At that stage of his career it was probably the quality of his imagination
that was unusual. What was to make Farr special was the willingness to
channel the income that comes to a 'hot' designer into endless generic R &amp;
D. Around 20 per cent of Farr Associates practice earnings is still spent,
year in, year out, on pure research.
He is the biggest customer of the Wolfson Unit at Southampton University, a
tank-testing and wind-tunnel facility that is regarded as the world leader
in hull and foil evaluation. The quality of the Farr computer Velocity
Prediction Programmes is legendary.
Before deciding whether to build a maxi or a W60, Grant Dalton, skipper of
New Zealand Endeavour, commissioned a Dollars 50,000 study from Farr on
which of the two classes would be fastest around the world. The VPP gave the
bigger boats and advantage of perhaps half-day - probably statistically
invalid, given weather variables - but Dalton had enough faith to commission
a maxi.
Perhaps the most extraordinary thing is that when the Farr fleet sails
today, for all the millions of dollars invested by bitter rivals, there will
not be a single complaint that perhaps one client has had better service or
benefitted from technology developed for another. Integrity comes with the
Farr label. The 'Chinese walls' between one design and another are
unclimbable.
As the yachts leave on the 5,000-mile first leg dash to Uruguay, this race
is probably already over for Farr. He is thinking about hulls and keels for
the 1995 America's Cup.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Sport: Sydney's strategy - Keith Wheatley was in Monaco to
watch the intrigue behind the final Olympic vote / Olympics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEER bottles made impromptu batons as the victorious Sydney team conducted a
roaring chorus of Advance Australia Fair, the national anthem. Elsewhere in
Monte Carlo, the defeated licked their wounds. 'There is no bronze medal in
this Olympic race,' said Walther Troeger, a German member of the
International Olympic Committee and supporter of Berlin's campaign to host
the 2000 Olympics.
Whether the Beijing team, beaten at the final hurdle, were so phlegmatic is
doubtful. 'This whole process was so unlike the Chinese. They were virtually
begging to be given something they desperately wanted,' said one Hong
Kong-based observer. 'One can't calculate how they will handle the loss of
face.'
Sino-British relations, already at a low ebb over the Hong Kong issue, will
now be seen from a new perspective by China. With just three candidates left
Manchester won 11 votes, Sydney 37 and Beijing 40, so Manchester was removed
from the final ballot. Its supporters split 8-3 in favour of Sydney in the
fourth and final vote to give Sydney a 45-43 victory.
'I think we gave the Australians more than just our votes,' said Bob Scott,
the Manchester bid chairman. 'The emphasis and agenda of their bid followed
very closely what we had learned and formulated during our campaign for the
'96 Games.'
Coincidentally, the two presentations to the IOC were consecutive and
offered a highly traditional, athlete-centred view of the Games. The IOC's
technical evaluation commission had already given Sydney's plans the
highest-rating of the five cities.
Beijing, in contrast, made no claims in its 55-minute presentation to offer
the best Games for 2000. The 'pitch' was a simple proposition that the time
had come to let the world's most populous nation emerge from the shadows of
troubled modernisation and take centre stage.
The speech of Zhenliang He, a vice-president of the IOC and much-respected
within Olympism, was a masterly encapsulation of the Chinese proposition.
'My destiny is tightly entwined with my country. As a child and an
adolescent I saw bitter times,' said He who is 64. 'As an older man, I have
seen China's reform and open-door policy provide my country and myself with
new horizons.
'We believe that the Olympic Games are for all nations, not just for those
that are highly sophisticated. Awarding this honour to a developing nation
like ours would not only expand the horizon of the Olympics, but also assist
us in our development process.'
There seemed to be a certain melancholy abroad that the dream of a simpler,
more frugal Games had drifted further out of reach. China's strong support
from the 16 African IOC members had this element - as well as
straightforward gratitude for an intense sports aid programme that had
brought massive stadia to Kenya and Zaire, for example.
'There is now so much technology necessary, so much investment, that
although one cannot speak of China being Third World, there is an
understanding,' said General Zein Gadir, the Sudanese IOC member.
Certainly the IOC as an organisation is unashamedly delighted with the
choice of Sydney. It provides a host city without political or economic risk
and will stage a spectacular Games. Just as important from the IOC's
perspective is that Sydney showed it possible to win the nomination with a
scrupulously fair campaign.
'They played it 100 per cent straight from the outset. There was never the
slightest complaint against them,' said IOC information director Andrew
Napier. Beijing, in contrast, played hardball. Government-to-government
pressure, relayed to the individual IOC member, was the most frequent
manifestation.
However, the IOC is thought to have warned the Beijing campaigners over the
number of 'facility trips' to China that some members were offered. Under
recent rules forbidding excessive generosity, each member is rationed to one
free inspection trip.
Already 70 per cent of the Sydney sports facilities are in place. Most of
the catamaran ferries which will ply the harbour between the Homebush Park
site of the Games and the city centre are in service. 'We said to the IOC
this week that if, for any reason, Atlanta fell down we could probably be
ready in '96,' said John Fahey, the premier of New South Wales.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Paring down costs and carving a
niche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASTLEFORD is one of those earthy Yorkshire towns where the symbols of an
affluent middle class remain inconspicuous in a culture overwhelmingly
influenced by low technology industry and tight family budgets. One public
house offers a three-course lunch at Pounds 2.75. From the windows of the
town's centre for small business, you can see shoppers packing Aldi and
Netto, the shock troop supermarkets for rock-bottom food pricing.
Inside the centre, the short history of Nile Productions underlines a not
always obvious point. Even in an unfashionable environment, little companies
in the softer service industries can make a go of it.
Nile is an 'events' company, arranging presentations mainly for so-called
company internal communication days, as well as offering script writing,
print design and organising the supply of promotional gifts and sound and
lighting systems. Among its clients are such names as Citroen and the
Halifax building society. Started in 1991 by Tim Rhodes and Stephen Bindley,
Nile had Pounds 200,000 turnover in the 12 months to May 1993 and hopes for
Pounds 300,000 this year.
The founders took nothing from the venture in the first year. In its third
year each extracted a salary of Pounds 15,000, which was almost doubled by a
bonus out of profits.
Rhodes says they could see a niche for themselves, partly defined by their
company's meagre operating costs. 'When you are working for a large company
offering what we do the sums involved are fabulous,' says Rhodes. 'The end
result is that a lot of money is spent but the value is very poor because of
mismanagement and bad buying-in of services and equipment. The client does
not get value. Everything goes through several pairs of hands and everyone
takes a mark up. It is a nice industry in many ways but there is a lot of
greed.'
Nile's cost structure certainly makes those of a big city service company
look decidedly unattractive. Both put in Pounds 12,000 to start the
business. Rent on the office - big enough for three people, filing cabinets
and computers - is a miserly Pounds 135 a month. This also covers the
services of the receptionist at the centre which was set up by Wakefield
district council. 'Our total overheads are about Pounds 600 a month,' Rhodes
says. The company employs no other staff but brings in freelances when
needed.
Though the two Nile directors worked in the industry for some years - Rhodes
for Harrogate's conference centre, Bindley as a conference production
technician - they say they brought no clients with them. The first contract
was a financial services presentation for women given by the National &amp;
Provincial building society. Nile charged the society Pounds 350. The second
was setting up a public address system and video projector with operator for
a meeting of the Macclesfield Conservative Association.
Nile secured its biggest client when it won the contract to do some of
Citroen's dealership days - occasions for the French car company to provide
its dealers with information about the company and indulge in a spot of
corporate bonding. Nile offers Citroen lighting, sound systems, installation
of multi-screen video walls, slide make-up slides and design of point of
sale material. It charges about Pounds 1,000 for preparing and running a
dealership day and might do 40 in a year.
Other important clients are Software Box, a Yorkshire software retailer,
British Rail's Watford management centre and the North-West regional health
authority. 'We write to companies and do some cold calling but most work
comes from word of mouth,' says Bindley.
Nile has to pitch for almost all its jobs and this is one of the biggest
costs: 'About 50 per cent of our time and money goes on failed pitches,'
Bindley says. 'We get 20 per cent of the jobs we pitch for. An average pitch
costs us Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 2,500 to make. So we need Pounds 12,000
profit from one job to adequately cover for lost pitches. It can be very
frustrating, especially when the client simply rips off our ideas and uses
them itself.'
Nile tries to keep job specifications tight when it employs freelances for
design and lighting work. 'A piece of work and what it costs can go haywire
if the designer is a wacky guy. If a person is not taking responsibility for
the final budget he doesn't have loyalty to the end client.'
Nile aims for a pre-tax return of 10 per cent. Jobs arrive in fits and
starts and as with so many small businesses, Nile's owners occasionally
endure a disastrous spell.
'I had three telephone calls in one day last year which ended our chances of
getting Pounds 150,000 of work,' says Bindley. When that happens I take the
day off, go for a wander, sit in the woods. It's all you can do.' Still,
there are compensations in running your own enterprise. 'It's the ultimate
toy.' Nile Productions. Five Towns Resource and Technology Centre, Welbeck
Street, Castleford, West Yorkshire WF10 1DR. Tel 0977 519625.

<TEXT>
SAAB'S share of executive car sales in Britain, currently a record 6.7 per
cent, seems set to climb with the arrival of the new 900 next month. Pricing
is aggressive; the 140 horsepower 900S 2.0i will cost Pounds 15,995 -
between 7 and 8 per cent less, Saab GB says, than a comparably equipped BMW
318i or Audi 80 2.0E. It should cost no more to insure than a Mondeo 2.0i or
BMW 318i, slightly less than a Cavalier 2.0 SRi or Rover 620 GSi.
Prices of the 155 bhp 900S 2.3i start at Pounds 17,945 and the top model,
the 175 bhp 900SE 2.5V6, with air conditioning and traction control, is
Pounds 21,795. The new cars go on sale on October 20.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Motoring: Vauxhall looks for automatic success - The Corsa
and V6 Calibra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ROUNDING off its Corsa range with three automatics, Vauxhall has beaten
the Japanese producers at their own game. Companies such as Daihatsu and
Honda, Mitsubishi and Nissan realised several years ago there was a growing
niche market for small cars with power steering and automatic transmission.
Until now, they have had it all their own way. But their cars have grown in
size and, thanks to the zooming value of the yen, in price. The cheapest
two-pedal, power steered Japanese small car is now the Pounds 9,645 Daihatsu
Charade 1.3GXi five-door. A similarly equipped three-door Honda Civic is
Pounds 11,765, Mitsubishi Colt Pounds 12,059 and Nissan Micra five-door,
Pounds 10,685. The only non-Japanese rival, a two-pedal Renault Clio
three-door, costs Pounds 10,215 with optional power steering.
Remarkably, even the most expensive Vauxhall automatic, power-steered Corsa,
the 1.4i GLS 5-door, is only Pounds 9,585. And the cheapest, the Merit
3-door, just Pounds 7,962. But the Corsa's attraction goes far beyond price.
It is a little cracker of a car, as solidly built as a baby Saab, nimble as
a ballet dancer in town and effortlessly parkable.
The five-door 1.4i GLS I drove last week rode country lanes and cruised on
motorways as placidly as many a car one class up in size.
Its electronically controlled four-speed automatic gearbox is essentially
the same as that used in the Astra and Cavalier (Opel Vectra). If the Corsa
is driven sensibly, the transmission shifts so smoothly the only indication
is a change in the engine note. In third and top gears the transmission's
hydraulic torque converter locks up, eliminating slippage and saving fuel.
At least 40 miles per gallon (seven litres or less per 100km) should be
possible on a journey.
There are economy, sport and winter settings. I see little point is using
the sport setting because all it does is increase change-up speeds. (If you
were that kind of driver, you would go for a manual gearbox anyway). The
change-up speeds in economy setting are perfectly adequate. In winter
setting, the car moves off in third gear, which reduces the chance on
wheelspin in snow.
The two-pedal Corsas are on sale now. Vauxhall thinks it will sell 1,400 of
them by the end of the year and 3,000 in 1994. As word gets round among city
centre drivers and mature motorists, who ask little of a car except that it
is well made, keenly priced and exceptionally easy to drive, this could be
an under-estimate.
Vauxhall, which took UK market leadership in July for the first time in its
90-year history, has also introduced V6-engined, manual or automatic
transmission, versions of the Calibra, which looks like being Britain's most
popular coupe this year. Sales are up 36 per cent compared with 1992 and a
record 1,475 were registered last month. Under its elegantly curved body,
the Calibra is mainly Cavalier - the car sold as an Opel Vectra on mainland
Europe. The new Saab 900 also makes use of its chassis platform. Calibra
manages to feel different from Cavalier or Saab 900, just as Peugeots and
Citroens do, in spite of sharing most major components.
So far, Calibras have been offered with two-litre, four-cylinder engines,
including a rapid but well mannered 204 horsepower turbo version. This has
four-wheel drive and remains easily manageable on wet and slippery roads.
The V6 Calibras sit between the 16-valve 2.0-litre and the turbo 4x4 in
price and performance. Though both are said to have the same potential top
speed of 147 mph/237 kmh, the turbo is a half-second faster from 0-60 mph
(0-96 kmh).
They are quieter and, some might say, less sporting than either the 16-valve
or turbo, but does it matter? Not, I suspect, to many Calibra buyers who
have been seduced away from a cheaper Cavalier saloon by the coupe's
ravishing good looks.
The British-made 2.5-litre V6 engine, spinning silkily up to high
revolutions, puts out 170 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. Its strong mid-range
pulling power makes for quick, safe overtaking.
The standard V6 Calibra has a five-speed manual gearbox and costs Pounds
19,870; the four-speed automatic is Pounds 20,624. Prices include airbags
for both front seats, ABS brakes and black leather trim.
One can pay a great deal more for a multi-cylinder coupe but for sheer
driving pleasure I would back a Calibra V6 against any price-competitive
rival.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Computing: Today gorillas, tomorrow a network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK I want to consider recent technical developments in the DOS
operating system. We will take them in order of priority.
Two gorillas are standing on skyscrapers silhouetted against the New York
skyline. Each lobs an explosive banana at the other. The angle and speed of
the throw, the force of gravity, the wind speed and direction, all affect
the accuracy of the banana. The first gorilla to score a direct hit wins.
Owners of PCs purchased within the last year or two may not be aware that
this rather enjoyable game comes free within DOS 5 and DOS 6. To find out
whether you have Gorillas: Go to the C:&gt; prompt, type VER and press Enter to
check whether you have DOS version 5 6. If you do: Type CDDOS and Enter;
type QBASIC Enter; press the ESC key to clear the Survival Guide comment;
hold down the ALT key and press F for the FILE menu. Highlight OPEN and
Enter; from *.BAS press the TAB key once so the cursor is under GORILLA.
BAS; press the SPACE BAR to highlight GORILLA. BAS; press Enter to bring up
the rules.
DOS 6.0 was released by Microsoft in March and I recently tried it on my own
machine. Its big attraction is the 'Doublespace' disk compression feature.
If you have a 20 or 40 megabyte disk and are short of space, DOS 6.0 can
nearly double your available capacity.
Typing CHKDSK at C:&gt; showed that my disk capacity was 120 megabytes, of
which about 32 megabytes remained available. Installing Doublespace was very
easy: just launch it, and off it goes. It took about two hours to compress
and 'defragment' my disk. I was delighted to find that Doublespace had
generated an extra 86 megabytes of disk space from 32mb to 118mb.
Next I tried running some of my programs to make sure everything still
worked, but got the message 'insufficient memory'. Typing MEM from C:&gt;
showed only 440k usable memory so this was the cue to try another feature of
DOS 6.00, 'Memory Maker'. Again, you just have to launch it and off it goes.
At the end my available memory was increased from 440k to 592k and there
were no more memory problems. All in all, I was impressed with DOS 6.0.
There are further valuable features such as an 'Anti-virus' detector and
'MSBackup' from Symantec Corp. which makes copying far easier than under the
usual DOS 'Copy' and 'Backup' commands. Even the accompanying manual seemed
sensible and clearly-written. At around Pounds 59 DOS 6.0 is a bargain.
However, problems with Doublespace have surfaced in the computer press and
my local dealer recently told me a terrible tale. He has a customer who
installed Dos 6.0 and Doublespace. The disk drive is now unreadable and
Microsoft say nothing can be done to retrieve the data. To cap it all, the
poor fools were not taking backup copies so they have lost 300 megabytes of
data and five years' accounting records. So if you run a mission-critical
application such as accounting on your PC, do not use disk compression. And
if daily copying starts to involve too many floppy disks, invest in a tape
drive for quick, easy backup.
Finally, a note on something very exciting indeed - networking DOS. The
biggest defect in DOS has always been that it is single-user. If a manager
wants to call up on his computer the financial information residing on his
accountant's PC, he cannot simply connect the two machines together with a
cable and look; he has to buy special networking software such as Lantastic
from Artisoft or Netware from Novell.
Recently the latter took over Digital Research, whose own version of DOS,
DRDOS, is generally acknowledged to be superior to Microsoft's. The first
fruit of the marriage - Novell DOS 7 - will be released before the end of
the year.
This new version of DOS will, for the first time, integrate networking into
DOS itself. Theoretically it will be possible to cable all your office PCs
together, load Novell DOS 7 on to each one and, hey presto, you have a
network. If it makes connecting PCs together in a network as simple as
hooking a PC to a printer, Novell DOS 7 will be the most important DOS
development yet.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (11): Where to search for
that second home / International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be interesting but probably impossible to define the ideal holiday
home because individual needs are so different. So how does one go about
finding one's holiday ideal?
Rich sources of ideas are the international property exhibitions, held in
spring and autumn and advertised in newspaper property pages.
The World of Property exhibition is now on in Manchester with more than 100
exhibitors and an expected attendance of 10,000. The French Property
exhibition is another that draws about 7,000.
Many buyers choose in a resort where they have spent foreign holidays,
although if they plan to use the property for later retirement, they may
find the place a ghost town out of season. Other holiday homes are bought as
the result of visits to friends' properties.
Spending holidays in rented properties in different resorts gives
opportunities for comparison both of areas and property. The Spanish Villa
Bureau (081-868-2242) has a choice of homes for renting on the Spanish
mainland, Balearics and the Canary islands.
Some holiday home buyers will shop for a rural ruin. But how do they find
that without unnecessary risks and no building experience?
Well, they could talk to Stanley Silver. After retiring from an export
company Silver, who speaks French, went around Normandy and bought several
neglected farmhouses. He had them partly renovated by local builders and put
them back on the market and found there was a demand for them. Although his
home is in London (071-602-2023) he has formed a company, Prince Estates, in
France. Through his connections he is offered places that never reach estate
agents. He buys the best and always has 20 to 25 available for selling on,
priced perhaps from Pounds 7,500 to Pounds 20,000.
Purchasers can make a choice and he can arrange through the local builders
to have as much or as little done as the buyer wants. He prices each job -
Pounds 2,000 for a septic tank, Pounds 1,500 for rewiring, etc. If he has
not improved a property himself he is there to give advice on what needs to
be done.
Perhaps you would prefer Italy, but still with a guiding hand? A British
couple, Patrick Beattie and his wife, Danny, bought a property in the Marche
region, learning procedure as they went along.
They have now settled there and turned their experience into a business,
offering to help with buying and restoration. They call the company
Followus. Their brochure gives clear details of their service and the sort
of rural properties that might be bought. (Tel Italy 733-598917 or London
071-352-9881).
A worldwide property search service was recently introduced by Sotheby's. A
client seeking a second home and with no idea where to look, can go to the
agency's New Bond Street, London, office and sit at a computer.
Beginning with a colour-coded map of the world on screen, he can touch the
region in which he might be interested and work through to the country and
area. Eventually, when several possible choices have been made, a list of
properties selected is shown and brochures with complete information are
produced.
The system stores about 500 to 600 properties and is updated every month. It
is available in Sotheby's offices in Geneva, Monte Carlo, Vienna, Hamburg,
Athens and Milan and many offices of Sotheby's agents in the US.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (10): A hint of a smile in
the Nordic markets - There is increasing foreign interest in home-buying in
Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland / International
</HEADLINE>

FOR THE first time in three years, estate agents in Stockholm are starting
to smile. Like those in the UK, they did well from the late 1980s when
housing prices climbed 50 per cent or more, but the 1990s have proved
wretched, with prices falling by at least 30 per cent and turnover slowing
sharply. Now, the market once again looks at a turning point, with clear
signs of a recovery over the traditionally quiet summer months.
'Things have been a lot busier since June,' says Thomas Vetterli, a broker
with Mats Holmgren, one of Stockholm's leading real estate companies; to
make his point, he noted that he had been forced to shorten his annual
holiday by two weeks to cope with the upsurge. Agents elsewhere in Sweden
also point to an improvement in sentiment, although most speak of a patchy
recovery and are wary of pronouncing the recession over just yet.
What goes for Sweden goes, in general terms, for the rest of the Nordic
region. House prices across all the countries in the area - Sweden, Norway,
Denmark and Finland - have fallen sharply during the 1990s, mainly because
of recession and sky-high mortgage rates. Now they have fallen sharply, some
of the accumulated pent-up demand has been unleashed; in Sweden, for
example, mortgages can be had for 9.75 per cent, a 17-year low.
In oil-rich Norway, which has a stronger economy and less unemployment than
either Sweden or Finland, the housing market is now in a firm recovery
phase. But this follows a five-year-long recession during which prices in
the Oslo area fell by 40 per cent. And the market in Finland, which has the
regions's most serious structural economic problems and unemployment of more
than 20 per cent, remains very depressed.
The surge in Swedish buyer interest is so new that prices have yet to move
up sharply. In any case, it is apparent that purchasers are being very
cautious and more selective. So far, only condominiums - flats bought in
apartment blocks - are showing signs of recovery.
Even there, potential buyers are worrying about maintenance charges. One
reason is that the cash-strapped government intends to scale back housing
subsidies sharply over the next decade, causing a shortfall that will have
to be made up by owners.
'Buyers are very concerned if there are plans to renovate the block because
this leads to a higher monthly charge. It explains why people are very
anxious to look into the balance sheet of the property before they buy,'
says Alf Midby, who owns a company specialising in more exclusive
properties.
Buyers are also proving wary about villas, although this is because property
taxes on houses are higher than on flats. Average prices for villas in
Sweden now lie at around SKr500,000 (Pounds 41,300), although the figure in
the Stockholm area is SKr884,000.
At Midby's end of the market prices have fallen by an average of 30 per cent
in the past three years, but he stresses there have been wide variations
depending on location and quality. A villa in the capital's smart Stocksund
suburb was sold for SKr8.8m in November 1990, but the purchasers got barely
half that when they sold it this summer for SKr4.5m.
Recovery in the housing market is likely to be slow, in any case, because of
Sweden's overall economic condition. Although exports are rising, the
domestic economy remains very depressed. Unemployment, already 13 per cent,
could reach 16-18 per cent next year and private consumption is still
falling.
Like Britain, there is also the problem of negative equity - those saddled
with a mortgage which is higher than the value of their property. In the
greater Stockholm area, an estimated 22 per cent of owners - broadly, those
who bought between 1987 and 1992 - are believed to be caught in this trap.
In 1991, the figure was just 2 per cent. For Sweden as a whole, the rate is
10 per cent.
Increased interest from foreign buyers is helping; indeed, Holmgren supplies
a contract drawn up in English or German, something it has only started
doing in the last year. To many, this is surprising because there has never
been a big foreign demand for Swedish property.
The legal restrictions placed on housing sales to foreigners has been part
of the cause. Then again, Stockholm has, traditionally, been one of Europe's
most expensive cities, lacking the cosmopolitan charms of London or Paris.
Even with the summer cottage market, the Swedish climate has proved a big
deterrent.
The situation has changed over the past year for two reasons. First, many of
the restrictions on foreigners buying Swedish property were abolished at the
start of the year. Second, there has been a huge devaluation of the krona
since Sweden floated its currency last November. Foreigners now see a chance
to buy cheaply before the market recovers.
The interest is coming particularly from foreigners with Swedish relatives,
businessmen and embassies. There are also rich Swedes living abroad - people
who did well from the last property boom and moved abroad to avoid tax but
now believe the market offers good value again.
Swedes and Finns remain sensitive over foreign purchases of their summer
cottages, and it has become an issue in their talks on joining the European
Community. In particular, they worry that the Germans, exploiting the strong
D-mark, will snap up their cherished stugas - which often lie deep in the
forest or on the coast - and price locals out of the market.
For the moment, this fear probably is overdone, although there are reports
that sales to foreigners of summer properties in southern Sweden have risen
by 42 per cent in the past year. Parts of southern Sweden are just three
hours away by ferry from northern Germany.
In any case, the Swedes are keeping some restrictions. Foreigners without
Swedish connections, and who cannot meet certain residence requirements,
still have to get a special permit to buy a property 'for recreation.' In
most cases, this is just a formality; but, in certain areas, applications
can be refused in the interests of taming demand and stopping prices from
rising beyond the reach of local people.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Mr 5 per cent between China and
the world - Shaul Eisenberg, the secretive billionaire and middleman,
invites Tony Walker on to his private jet for a glimpse of wheeling and
dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAUL Eisenberg, the reclusive Israeli billionaire and possibly the world's
greatest middleman, is holding forth in his private jet high above the neat,
patchwork fields of the Chinese countryside. 'Never show off, be humble,' he
advises. 'And if you become big, be even more humble.'
Asked the secret of making money, he is characteristically to the point: 'A
good supplier and a good buyer, and remember the buyer is always king.'
So it is that Eisenberg, at 72 and with one heart by-pass operation behind
him, travels the world in his private Boeing 727, stitching up deals,
stroking foreign potentates, and accumulating vast sums of money.
He is not prepared to say just how wealthy he is beyond referring to the
latest Fortune survey of the world's billionaires which estimates his net
worth at Dollars 1.3bn; in the same company as the Dassault's of Mirage
aircraft fame, William Hewlett of Hewlett Packard and Kanichiro Ishibashi of
Bridgestone tires.
By most standards Eisenberg, a heavy-set man with a lugubrious manner, has
made it; and yet he remains a mysterious figure operating in the nether
world of behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing, shielded from public view
by a coterie of Israeli assistants. China, in its explosive new economic
phase, is his domain.
He rarely talks to the media and when he does he has proved extremely
guarded about his business interests, his family and his past. This has
invited all manner of speculation and the odd unfavourable notice such as a
1987 article in Forbes which said: 'his story reads like The Merchant of
Venice bizarrely grafted on to TV's Dallas, then transmogrified into some
Far Eastern potboiler by James Clavell.'
Mention of the Forbes article with its accusations that he has not always
been scrupulous in dealings with Asian leaders pains Eisenberg who dismisses
the piece as 'anti-semitic', and adds: 'To think it was written by a Jew.'
Eisenberg's motives in talking to the Financial Times, and inviting its
correspondent to travel on his jet are not altogether clear. It may have
something to do with a successful man's desire to tell his story in the
twilight of his career.
It may also derive from a calculation that a more public stance, now that
Israel and China have normalised relations, will help his business interests
in China. These include direct investments in glass-making in Shanghai, a
computer disc-drive venture in Harbin, and a proposed potash plant in
far-west Qinghai province. These investments mark a switch in strategy from
'5 per cent middleman' supplying equipment to investor in projects in his
own right.
Eisenberg's Panama-registered United Development Incorporated is also one of
the biggest foreign traders in China, dealing in everything from pig-iron
and power plants to Disney comics.
Eisenberg likes to say that in these straitened times in China - credit is
being squeezed across the board - he has found a way to finance deals which
give him an edge over competitors. But he is cagy about details. 'It is my
patent,' he says of financing arrangements which rely heavily on his skills
as a barter trader.
Seated in his converted jet surrounded by his lieutenants, including a
retired brigadier-general of the Israeli Air Force, Eisenberg is en route
from Beijing to Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, where he is to be
a guest of the governor, rather like a state visit.
Eisenberg's business style, learned from the Japanese in the post-war era,
relies on cultivating friends in high places in country's such as South
Korea and Taiwan which were the focus of his deal-making in the years before
he targeted China in the late 1970s.
'I do only business with friends. If they are not friends I don't do
business,' Eisenberg likes to say. Among his more valuable 'selling tools'
is a well-thumbed photograph album which shows him pictured with various
Chinese leaders, including State President Jiang Zemin when the latter was a
relatively lowly official.
Eisenberg's jet lands in steamy Nanjing and is met on the tarmac by a senior
provincial official. Eisenberg is swept away in a black stretch limousine
preceded by police cars with flashing lights and sirens. His staff, all
Israeli, apart from Filippino and Chinese secretaries, follows in a
mini-bus.
At a lavish welcoming banquet which features hedgehog soup and glutinous
dumplings, toasts are drunk to successful billion-dollar joint projects,
including a bridge over the Yangtze and a toll-highway from Nanjing to
Shanghai.
And so Eisenberg continues around China - from Nanjing to Nanning, capital
of Guangxi, to Shanghai, and on to Jinan, capital of Shandong before
returning to Beijing. It is an exhausting schedule in mid-summer in some of
China's hottest regions and begs the question: why would a man of
Eisenberg's age and wealth bother? 'I like to cook (deals),' he says. 'In
any case, if I stop I would die]'
It was ever thus, it seems. The story of German-born Eisenberg's escape from
Nazi Germany to Shanghai by way of the Netherlands with just 20 Guilders in
his pocket reveals an early penchant for deal-making, and was a pointer to
his later vocation as a middleman.
Two weeks after he boarded the ship, the Netherlands fell to the Germans and
the Guilder became worthless. Good fortune smiled, however. Eisenberg
discovered that the purser would not dirty his hands dealing directly with a
hold full of Chinese seaman who had been rescued from a sunken vessel, so he
became a go-between trading cigarettes and spirits. By the end of the voyage
he had accumulated Dollars 500, a considerable sum in those days.
Eisenberg joined his parents in Shanghai where his father had established
himself as a vegetable oil seller.
The young Eisenberg then ventured to Japan. There he sold Chinese carpets
during the war to wealthy Japanese and, after, to the US army, before moving
on to deal in iron ore and scrap in the post-war period, learning from the
Japanese business samurai in the process.
'I was friendly with Mitsui (Japanese trading company),' he recalls. 'I
learned a lot from them. They're good business people. They said they might
have lost the war, but they wanted to win the economic war, and they planned
it properly - like a war. In those days, there were a lot of military people
in Japanese companies.' Eisenberg himself has followed this formula. UDI is
peppered with military types. He likes military-style efficiency . . . and
people who are prepared to work long hours without complaining. A quick
staff turnover is one of the features of the Eisenberg organisation.
Former employees, while they respect his prodigious energy and deal-making
skills, are less complimentary about his abilities as a manager. 'He expects
200 per cent from his employees, and he meddles in everything,' said one.
'We used to joke that if we wanted to change the colour of the toilet paper
from white to pink Mr Eisenberg would get involved in the decision. The
problem is that he doesn't trust anybody.'
A more serious observation is that UDI is virtually a 'one man show' and
that when Eisenberg passes from the scene the company will disappear with
him. 'The Eisenberg group of companies could have been a real empire, but it
is a one man show,' said a former UDI manager.
UDI's China business has come a long way since Eisenberg arrived in Peking
on Christmas eve, 1978, to explore opportunities in a country cautiously
opening to the outside world. Today, he has more than a dozen offices around
China, 150 employees, and a billion-dollar trading turnover which includes a
large barter business.
Eisenberg directs operations from a plush suite of offices on the 35th floor
of Beijing's China World Tower. He shouts orders from his office to
assistants who drift in and out to report progress on deals. This is not the
hush-hush world of high corporate endeavour, but a trading post juggling a
thousand and one business opportunities.
Of his sometimes fractious relations with his staff, Eisenberg says: 'Let's
say I'm a tough character, but I'm only tough if I see someone making
mistakes. I don't like mistakes. If they make mistakes they have to be told,
or even thrown out.'
On one issue, Eisenberg is particularly sensitive, and that is the question
of Israeli arms sales to China. 'People think I am an arms dealer,' he says.
'But I only did it for Israel. I hate the military business, and I don't do
it in other countries. In any case, it's only small business between China
and Israel. We did not give them hardwear, only know-how.'
Independent sources say the relationship was more extensive, possibly
running into hundreds of millions of dollars in the past decade. According
to a Rand Corporation study in 1991, Israel has helped China develop a
surface-to-air missile, an intermediate-range missile, an air-to-air
missile, advanced armour technology for tanks and an airborne early warning
system, among other items.
While, Eisenberg spends more than half his time roaming the world, 'cooking'
deals his home base has been firmly in Israel since the mid 1970s when the
Israeli Knesset, passed what became known as the 'Eisenberg law'. This was
drafted with Eisenberg in mind to allow Israeli tycoons to operate from
Israel without having to pay local tax on their worldwide earnings.
Israeli press reports indicate that life within the Eisenberg family - one
son, five daughters and 19 grandchildren - has been fairly turbulent with
the autocratic patriarch skirmishing with sons-in-law, who had been drawn
into and then abruptly left the family business. Relations with 42-year-old
son Erwin have been tense on occasions. Eisenberg deflects questions about
his household, but he does volunteer that at time he has given Erwin a 'hard
time,' because 'I don't believe in spoiling your kids.'
Eisenberg's reputation in his own country is that of a fairly ruthless
wheeler-dealer. A case in point was his intervention 18 months ago when the
struggling Israeli aircraft industry planned to sell the Kfir copy of the
Mirage to Taiwan - a deal which could have hurt his business activities in
China. 'I intervened very strongly,' he said. 'Taiwan is not a threat to
Israel as China is.' He would not have blamed Beijing, he said, if it had
carried out a threat, conveyed privately, to supply arms to Syria for
nothing, if the Kfir deal had gone ahead.
Eisenberg's connections brings some strange business propositions. He was
recently approached by North Korea with a proposal that Israel provide
Dollars 200m to develop a gold-mine. In return Pyongyang's would undertake
not to supply nuclear technology to Iran or arms to Syria.
Eisenberg dismisses the proposal as 'blackmail,' but sensing there may be
opportunities in North Korea, which cannot remain closed forever, has begun,
tentatively, to do business there, placing an order for textiles.
Wherever he is in the world Eisenberg keeps in touch with his various
businesses which include an aeroplane leasing company in the US and a
trading house in South Africa.
'I know every week how much money we make and how much we spend,' he says.
'Before I go home for the weekend I want to know if I'm broke or if I am
rich.
So where does Eisenberg, at an age when most tycoons have quietly retired to
the golf course or to their country estates, go from here? Apart from China
he has established a presence in central Asia and in the Russian Federation,
although experience has taught him to be wary of those markets. He is also
focusing attention on India which is undergoing a process of privatisation.
What of his ultimate goal in these twilight years? 'I would like to think
that one day I could do business with the Arabs,' he says reflectively.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (9): A snip - of the
secateurs - Homes for serious gardeners / Gardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ACID or alkaline?' is a typical, no-nonsense question that serious
gardeners will ask an estate agent when they are considering buying a house.
With a shrewd idea of the answer, these gardeners are inquiring about the
soil type and, perhaps, checking to see if the garden is good enough to
appear in the Yellow Book, the annual list of gardens open to the public.
Serious gardeners start viewing the outside of a property first. How much
work will it be? Has the owner planned the beds well and coped with the soil
conditions? If it is limey, are there acid pockets for heather or azaleas?
These practical queries help to decide how interesting a garden it is, or
could become.
Is it a standard mixed herbaceous, shrub and rose garden - or is it a
plantsman's garden with unusual species? For serious gardeners the grounds
are as important as the house, if not more so, because the garden says best
what sort of people they are.
Two of the most interesting gardens to have come on the market in the past
year, Clapton Court, in Somerset, and Shute House, in Dorset, each the
creation of their vendors, deserve serious gardeners. Shute sold quickly;
Clapton has taken a year but a sale is now agreed.
New on the market, and sure to excite, is Tilgates at Bletchingley in
Surrey. Together with Bodnant and the Savill Garden in Windsor, it houses
the National Collection of Magnolias and has the world's largest collection,
which vendor David Clulow has made over 23 years. Add azaleas and
rhododendrons, many of his own raising, and a total 5,500 shrubs and trees
(listed and labelled by computer) - but nothing herbaceous - so that it can
be run by a gardener and his wife, and Tilgates looks a snip of the
secateurs at Pounds 600,000 (from the London office of Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley).
In 1906 Surrey's greatest gardener, Gertrude Jekyll, designed the 20 acres
of terraced gardens and park at Thorpe Hall,Louth, in Lincolnshire, a brick
house that dates back to 1584 and is listed Grade II*. Savills in Lincoln is
seeking in excess of Pounds 650,000.
Elaborate stone terraces, clipped yew hedges and spring fed pools abound in
the garden of Overdale, at Church Stretton, Shropshire, landscaped by Bakers
of Wolverhampton in 1928. As the job took three years and employed up to 20
men, buyers will ponder how much labour it needs today. Does that explain
why the price has come down from Pounds 375,000 to Pounds 295,000, from
Balfour &amp; Cooke or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hereford?
In Yorkshire, Totterdownhill Farm, 16 miles from York, has four separate
gardens in 1 1/4 acres and varieties of hosta, viburnum, prunus, cornus and
much more. Savills in York is selling it for Pounds 300,000. In Perthshire
the garden at Dykeneuk, at Butterstone, near Dunkeld, is larger and is
planted with shrubs to give year-round colour. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in
Edinburgh is asking for offers of more than Pounds 200,000.
Back in the Home Counties, Chesworth, in Horsham, Sussex, is a 15th/17th
century house in 65 acres beside the River Arun, which feeds the waterfalls
and weirs in the water gardens. Its 65 acres include a walled rose garden.
'A halo of romance still hangs about this quiet spot,' wrote the local
historian in 1889. This romance, from Egerton, costs Pounds 950,000. The
Barn, an intriguing Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced, Tudoresque brick and
timber octagonal house, with leaded windows, in Nan Clark's Lane, Mill Hill,
London NW7, overlooks another superb water garden with ponds and waterfalls,
and a glorious parade of shrubs and trees in five acres eight miles from
central London. The price is over Pounds 2m, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in
Hadley Green.
The attraction of Waterstock House in Oxfordshire, two miles from exit 7 on
the M40, is that it is in the flat and well- watered country of the River
Thame. The present owners have concentrated on horses. Gardeners, here is
your chance, at Pounds 875,000, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Oxford. At
Pounds 1.25m the company's Cirencester office offers water gardens, and a
formal canal, by the River Leach, in Gloucestershire, flowing through the
grounds at Southrop Manor, near Lechlade. Large greenhouses, walled gardens,
terraces, cedar trees, an 18th century gothic gardener's cottage and a
verandah along the front of the house, are the attractions of Melton Lodge,
near Woodbridge, Suffolk, (from Bidwells or Savills in Ipswich at Pounds
775,000).
You may find some of these houses too grand. A good, manageable family house
in Swerford, a warm and unspoilt village in the northern Cotswolds, near
Banbury, comes to auction on October 27. Its sheltered garden looks splendid
now but with thoughtful replanting can easily be made better still. The Old
Rectory needs work, but there is plenty of potential in both house and
garden. Auctioneer/agent Lane Fox expects to obtain more than Pounds
400,000. I shall look for serious gardeners at the auction.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Dividends and tax credits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE'S income, which is well up into the basic rate band, stems
predominantly from UK dividends with their associated tax credit. From her
income she makes covenanted payments to charities well above the small
interest element in her income which has borne tax at the basic rate.
Your recent article stated that basic rate taxpayers have no further
liability on dividend income 'because the legislation provides that, within
the basic rate band, the rate of tax applying to dividends is only 20 per
cent, not 25 per cent.'
Does this also mean that dividend income in these circumstances covers the
requirement that covenanted charitable payments have to be paid from tax
income? Or will the Revenue be entitled to recover the difference of 5 per
cent through my wife's assessment? If so, it seems to me that there are
implications, not publicised to my knowledge, for a great many taxpayers.
Unfortunately, there will be a clawback of 5 per cent, to the extent that
the gross amount of the covenanted charitable annuities exceeds the gross
amount of your wife's non-dividend income. This result is achieved by
section 207A(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 in conjunction
with section 3(a).

FT  25 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Dividends and tax allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I READ in a recent Financial Times article that the first slice of dividend
income is covered by personal allowances. As there are three types of income
and three rate bands it appears that allowances cannot simply be deducted
from the total gross income. Can you confirm that the allowances are set
against the type of income carrying the highest rate band first - excluding
chargeable capital gains? Also, are capital gains used to determine whether
age allowance should be reduced?
1) Yes, your allowances are set primarily against your non-dividend income.
2) Capital gains do not affect your entitlement to age allowance.
The Inland Revenue did try to restrict age relief by taking capital gains
into account at one time, but admitted that this was unlawful in the 1970s.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Can BES offset my gains?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM embarrassed by considerable capital gains which must be realised within
the next two tax years and which will exceed, by a large amount, my annual
allowance. If I take gains which, when added to my taxable income, take me
into the 40 per cent tax bracket, can these be offset against a Business
Expansion Scheme investment, or can BES's only be used to offset tax against
income as opposed to capital gains?
BES relief is an income tax relief, and is treated like your personal
allowance, as you will see from the free pamphlet IR51 (Business Expansion
Scheme) which is obtainable from your tax office. To the extent that BES
relief reduced your total income below the basic-rate limit, of course, it
would indirectly reduce the rate of CGT on part of your capital gains.
The BES is to be abolished at the end of this calendar year, so it could not
have helped you for 1994/95 and 1995/96 in any case.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Show pensioners real values - Eric
Short urges Lautro to make pension illustrations show more meaningful
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FROM THE beginning of November, life companies will have to show pension
illustrations on two new investment return assumptions - 6 per cent and 12
per cent, instead of the present 8.5 per cent and 13 per cent.
This change corrects one defect in the present illustration basis - that the
rates shown are too high. Many traditional life companies are paying less
than 8.5 per cent on their unitised with-profit contracts. But Lautro has
failed to remedy other defects in the illustrations, in particular to
indicate the real (inflation-adjusted) value of pension benefits as well as
the money value.
The general purpose of illustrating the benefits on life contracts is to
provide the investor with some indication of the benefits provided. This
means the calculations must be realistic and the illustration must be in a
form that portrays the real value of those benefits.
Low cost endowments used to repay a mortgage are monetary contracts because
they are used to repay a liability which does not increase with inflation.
So it is justified for the illustration to show the benefits in money terms.
But pension contracts are real assets, because pension benefits need to rise
with inflation in order for beneficiaries to use them to buy goods and
services after retirement. Accordingly, illustrations should show not only
the monetary value of pension benefits, but also their value in real terms.
The Lautro illustration basis does not do this.
Lautro is on the right lines in its illustration basis for appropriate
personal pensions (used to contract-out of Serps). The contribution, less
expenses, is accumulated at two different real rates of return - 0.5 per
cent and 2.5 per cent. The pension thus illustrated relates to current money
values and gives a realistic picture.
There are disadvantages. First, the real rate shown is the difference
between the investment return and earnings growth, whereas the general
understanding of real rates of return is the difference between the
investment return and price inflation.
The second disadvantage is that such a picture is not easily understood by
the layman. It is more likely to be understood if the illustration showed
separately the money growth in the contributions and the increase in
earnings to retirement and expressed the money pension as a percentage of
earnings at retirement.
However, with ordinary personal pensions, the illustration simply shows the
accumulated value of the contributions, less expenses, as a cash sum, using
two separate rates of investment return. The objective is to give some
indication of the variation in benefits with different returns. The
illustration then shows the annuity bought with that cash sum.
Thus the benefits are shown in money values at the time they will be taken;
there is no requirement to show the real value. The illustration is
accompanied by an inflation statement and the individual is left to do his
own adjustment.
The effect is shown in the tables, which indicate that the new investment
rates produce more realistic cash sums than the present rates. Indeed, even
on the new rates, the benefits look adequate compared with the individual's
earnings. But even if life companies wanted to adjust for inflation, they
are not permitted to do so. I therefore had to make my own calculations,
shown in italics.
In table A, I took the pension and discounted the value back to the present
using the Lautro price inflation assumptions - the method used by following
the instructions on the Inflation Statement. Using this method, the benefits
are shown to be inadequate.
Second, the choice of contribution rate and type of annuity quoted is left
to the individual and his adviser. Most illustrations are prepared on a
level contribution basis and a level single life annuity, thereby presenting
a false picture - compare table A with B and the level single life annuity
with the increasing annuity plus spouse's pension.
The investor should have a realistic picture of the contributions needed to
provide an adequate pension - whether he pays them or not is another matter.
At least, he would know what he is doing, and not be lulled into a false
sense of security.
My idea of the minimum information which should be provided is shown in
table B - an increasing contribution with two types of annuity.
The adjustment for real values in B is my preferred method - showing money
values of benefits at the time of retirement and comparing them with
estimated earnings growth. This is what happens in real life. If Lautro's
assumptions are fulfilled, these are the amounts that will be paid in money
terms and as a percentage of earnings.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (8): Enfranchisement: the
word means freedom - Gerald Cadogan explains how the new leasehold reform
act will work / The rental sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENGLISH and Welsh property markets enter a new phase on November 1 when
the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 comes into
force.
When the measure left the House of Commons for the Lords its proposals for
leasehold reform had provoked strong reactions from landlords, especially in
central London where many of the great estates are situated.
Both landlords and leaseholders are perhaps happier now that the Lords have
had their say, although the act will still not satisfy those who saw it as a
big step towards abolishing the leasehold system altogether. Indeed, Charles
Boston, of surveyor Francis Russell, claims: 'The attractive option of a
90-year lease extension (as contained in the act) will perpetuate the
system.'
From November, though, many people will have the option to enfranchise - the
official term for acquiring the freehold of your house or flat. For complete
details, the act can be obtained from Her Majesty's Stationery Office for
Pounds 19.65, while the department of the environment has prepared a booklet
for libraries and citizens' advice bureaux.
The DoE also is planning an advisory agency to help with more complex
matters, such as when capital gains tax applies. Liability could arise, for
example, when enfranchised owners sell a lease to a third party who was not
an original member of the group enfranchising.
The main aims of the act are:
To give long leaseholders the right to take a full share - financially and
in management - in the ownership of where they live.
This will be done by giving them a right to buy their freehold or extend
their leases, so improving immediately the chances of around 750,000
leasehold flat-owners in England and Wales to get a mortgage for what have
been, until now, diminishing assets. The lease extension alternative will be
equally effective in improving the scope for getting a mortgage.
To improve the quality of management.
This often is woeful, especially in outer London and the south-east. On the
great central London estates, complaints about the expense of management are
heard regularly.
For enfranchising houses, the act extends the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (as
modified by the Housing Act 1974) and keeps its residency test. Thus, the
property must have been the owner's main residence for the past three years
or three of the past 10. The original lease must be over 21 years and the
ground rent low.
The old test of a rateable value limit of Pounds 1,500 in London, or Pounds
750 elsewhere, is scrapped. The new criterion is that the ground rent must
have been two-thirds or less of the rateable value when the lease was
granted (or of the letting value if that was before April 1 1963), or not
over Pounds 1,000 in London (Pounds 250 elsewhere) for a lease granted after
March 31 1990. Thus, leasehold houses with high ground rents (which applies
to many new leases) have no chance of enfranchising until there is another
change of law.
The alternative of a 50-year lease extension beyond the original date of
expiry is still available - but only for houses that satisfy the rateable
value limits of the 1967/1974 rules, not for those that now meet the 1993
low rent rules for enfranchising. There is no capital cost for an extension
but it does involve a 'modern' (high) ground rent which can be reviewed
after 25 years. Any right to buy the freehold is lost.
While mews dwellings, with a separately-let garage underneath, cannot be
enfranchised, they could qualify for lease extensions. Houses in cathedral
closes will be enfranchiseable if they qualify.
With flats, the the new rules for enfranchisement say:
The building cannot have more than 10 per cent of its private floor space
used commercially.
This means that if the ground floor is all shops, the block must be more
than 10 floors high to qualify. (If it does, the leaseholders' company -
which must be formed in any case to acquire the freehold - will have to buy
out the commercial interest, too. This could be very costly).
The building must be a vertical unit.
This excludes some flat conversions which spread across what were originally
two or more houses.
There must be two or more flats.
In addition, two-thirds or more of them must be let on qualifying leases
(more than over 21 years) and at a low ground rent (as for houses).
At least two-thirds of the qualifying leaseholders must give notice of
wanting to buy the freehold, and they must own at least half the total
number of flats in the building.
Likewise, at least half of these qualifying leaseholders must have occupied
their flats as their only or main home for the previous year (not three
years, as for houses) or for three of the past 10.
Excluded from enfranchising are business tenants; tenants with three or more
flats in the building (none qualifies); and cases where two-thirds of the
qualifying leases end in the next five years and the landlord intends to
re-develop. Converted houses with up to four flats and a resident landlord
(or adult members of his family) do not qualify, either.
There is a blanket exclusion for National Trust and Crown property, although
the Crown might not always enforce this. Also excluded are buildings owned
by trusts and associations providing charitable housing (this does not
include Smith's Charity in South Kensington, London) and buildings exempted
by the Treasury from inheritance tax, such as (leased) dower houses forming
part of a stately home. There may be only 80-100 such cases in England and
Wales.
There is also an exclusion under the 1967 act for houses where the landlord
intends to move in and had an interest before April 1966 - meaning that, if
he bought it after that date, he should have known he could face
enfranchisement.
Flat leaseholders will have an individual right to a 90-year lease extension
at a peppercorn rent (whether or not they qualify for collective
enfranchisement) if they have occupied the flat as a main or principal home
for three years (or three of the past 10).
This does not apply to corporate leaseholders, who cannot extend their
leases compulsorily in this way. It can apply to people owning two or more
flats in the building, but it could be hard to pass the residency test. Such
extensions are renewable - and may still qualify for enfranchisement.
The price for extensions is calculated like that for enfranchising and will
include an element of 'injurious affection' to compensate the freeholder for
the compulsory purchase and loss of development potential, or decline of
value in adjacent land he owns. But the landlord can counter the purchase
with a proposal to re-develop.
However, the price for enfranchising could be daunting. It includes the
freeholder's interest (the ground rent discounted over the remaining period
of the lease), plus at least 50 per cent of the 'marriage value' (MV) - the
increase in property value by combining the freehold and leasehold
interests) - plus buying out intermediate interests such as head leases,
plus injurious affection, plus the landlord's costs, plus the leaseholders'
own costs.
On leases near expiry which are approaching a freehold status, the 50 per
cent minimum of the MV could rise to 80-90 per cent or more. And, in blocks
of flats, the total price depends partly on how many leaseholders take part.
'It will incorporate MV in respect of participants and possible 'hope value'
(of a better deal some time later) for those not participating,' says
Boston. 'The corollary is that it is not just a matter of dividing a cake of
set size. The cake will vary in size.'
To enfranchise, it is wise to seek professional advice from the start. And
it is essential to go through the steps by the times specified in the act,
or the effort will fail. The strict timetable for both sides cuts to a
minimum the grey period when a group of leaseholders starts the process,
affecting the sale value of flats that are not joining in.
The act also allows tenants to appoint their own auditor if the management
is not doing its job or is charging too much. The environment secretary can
approve codes of management. While these will not be binding legally,
infringing them can be used as evidence.
'Tenants will benefit most when the open market value of their leases is
about half of the freehold vacant possession value,' Boston says. In London,
that means leases with 20-25 years left.
In view of the cost and fuss of enfranchising, lease extensions could end up
as the most popular option. In the future, as present 80-90 year leases run
down, ever more leaseholders will be glad they are no longer pariahs to the
mortgage companies but can show evidence of a continuing asset.
The new act extends the 1967 act's system for compulsory purchase of
property for reasons other than the public good. Landlords have attacked
this as a denial of contracts made freely (although that principle fell in
1967) and leaseholders feel it has too many traps. All will watch the first
cases attentively.
Enfranchising should not, however, affect the look of the great London
estates. Amendments to the original bill tightened the rules for estate
management schemes after enfranchisement. They allow English Heritage (or
the local authority) to run a scheme as a last resort in a conservation
area; or for the landlord to transfer it - say, to the association of new
freeholders - when he does not own enough freeholds to keep his interest.
That is well into the next century, though. In the meantime, if you live in
a flat and want to enfranchise, make sure you get on with your neighbours.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (7): Landlords are flavour of
the month again - The property recession has been a boon for the rental
market / The rental sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RENTAL sector has profited from the recession in the UK property market.
Many people rent short-term, for employment or other reasons. But in the
past few years many Britons have been renting longer-term until they feel
that the time is right to buy - agent's books are full of such people
waiting and watching the market for signs of a pick-up.
Before the second world war it was common to rent one's house, in London and
sometimes also in the country. After the war the habit withered - except for
sportsmen renting shooting lodges, hunting boxes or houses for Ascot or
Wimbledon.
It was also an era of high income tax: it made sense to be a buyer and to
gain as much mortgage relief as possible. Meanwhile landlords fretted that
they would never be able to eject tenants from their property because the
law would protect them. So they let to companies or to foreigners, who were
unlikely to go to court. Gradually the rental market dried up.
In the recession it revived. The new law of assured shorthold tenancies,
allowing landlords to regain possession at the end of the lease, has given
them the confidence to let to the British. As the buying and selling of
houses slumped, renting grew.
A recent survey by the University of York with the Association of
Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) reported that lettings increased in 1992
by an average 13 per cent per agent countrywide, with the largest increase
of 21 per cent in the inner London suburbs. Seventy per cent of the lettings
were assured shortholds.
While UK interest rates were high, potential house-buyers found that their
monthly rent was cheaper than a hefty mortgage, and that it was easier to
wait and see how far prices would drop.
The reverse was that would-be sellers became landlords, waiting for prices
to rise again. So did those hit by Lloyd's liabilities or other debts, who
decided that the rent income from a pied-a-terre was more valuable than the
luxury of a second home. The York/ARLA survey found that about one fifth of
private landlords in 1992 were people unable or unwilling to sell their
properties.
Now it is back to the 1930s. Renting is established again as a flexible
alternative that makes sense for landlords and tenants. A glance at the
property advertisements shows how many more homes are for renting, in town
and country. The UK is slowly catching up with the rest of Europe, where it
is normal for city-dwellers to rent rather than buy.
But the fall in interest rates and prospect of rising house prices changes
the picture for those wanting to buy and settle down. They do not want to
miss the turn of the market, knowing that month by month their payments (on
an old-fashioned repayment mortgage) cut the building society's share of
their house.
For first-time buyers, who can obtain a 5 per cent mortgage if they shop
around, it makes sense to buy now. From rental savings they should be able
to recoup their deposit and buying costs in 18 to 30 months, says Yolande
Barnes, of Savills. That is one of the reasons behind her bullish view of
the property market. All those who have been waiting five years are now
eager to make their move. The problem is, Where?
At present there are not enough houses on the market. And until the new
private landlords who would not or could not sell their properties change
their minds, the stranded tenants wanting to escape to their own place as
owner-occupiers will have to carry on renting.
In London the hard core of tenants that all cities have is growing, Ruth
Gray of agent John D. Wood reports, as foreign banks and multinational
companies look for places to house the extra staff they are bringing to
London.
In Arthur Road, Wimbledon, SW19 she could quickly arrange a let at Pounds
2,600 a month for a family with Shell, for a house which had 'sat' for a
while at Pounds 2,400. This was in August, which is letting agents' busiest
time, before school starts.
Whether tenant or landlord, you need a good agent - unless you make the
arrangements yourself. For new landlords that is not advisable, as the law
has many traps. And even if you are experienced or the tenant is an old
friend, it is easy to make a mistake or fail to keep up with the changes in
the law.
Do you, for example, know who normally should pay the new council tax?
Glentree Estates' (081-458 7311) useful guides for landlords and tenants
point out that it is the tenant or permitted occupier - even though the tax
is a modified form of the old rates, when the landlord often paid.
ARLA (071-734 0655) is the only professional organisation devoted solely to
lettings. It has about 600 member offices across the UK, which are growing
by 10 a month. Its code of practice is what all letting agents should
follow, stressing the duty of care to the tenant as much as to the landlord.
Good agents will check references, prepare the inventory, see that the rent
is paid on time (and passed on to the landlord), pay the tax at source that
the Inland Revenue may require from landlords abroad, and deal quickly with
the sudden failure of the boiler and the other hassles of living in a house
or flat one does not own.
Since October 1992 all ARLA members have been bonded by professional
indemnity insurance to protect the tenants' deposits and the landlords'
rents. They must also have been in the letting business for at least two
years and, like solicitors and accountants, have separate client accounts
for the monies. For letting property they can take commissions only from the
landlord.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Hidden dangers in a family loan -
Take care before you lend cash to loved ones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE HAWTHORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DIFFICULT economic times, it is tempting to offer financial help to less
fortunate family members. Parents in particular do not want to see their
sons, daughters, or in-laws get into financial difficulties when a loan
might stave off bankruptcy, repossession, or more positively, start or prop
up a business.
Take care however, if you are in this situation and about to make a loan to
your nearest and dearest. Lending has more hidden perils than giving. When
you make a gift by throwing your bread upon the waters, you may neither hope
nor expect to see it return, although sometimes this action can have the
happy consequence of reducing inheritance tax on your estate.
The first danger the lender faces is that the money may never be repaid.
Whatever arrangements have been made to repay the debt may be cancelled.
Even borrowers with the best intentions may find it impossible to raise the
money.
Against this most obvious hazard of lending, assume the worst. Never lend so
much that you put your own security in jeopardy. Take another precaution
too: no matter how well disposed to each other debtor and creditor may be,
put any lending arrangement in writing, and give receipts when money is
received.
The receipt can be quite simple, the name of lender and borrower, the amount
and purpose of the loan, (to pay off other debts; buy a house, car, stock,
equipment etc) the instalment paid, and the amount now outstanding at the
date of the receipt. Use a small duplicate book with numbered pages. Keep
the book and hand out the duplicate receipt.
This action will save you from other dangers which sometimes beset the
lender. In certain circumstances it can also prove tax efficient, giving you
tax relief on any capital gains that you may make.
The second hazard which a written arrangement overcomes is the possibility
of family quarrels. These may arise in the course of time about who had what
and who did or did not repay what. The written arrangement will show what
was lent, for what purpose, how much was repaid, and will also ease the job
of an executor, even if you have (or have not) made a will.
A third hazard of lending is that the money lent may not be used as you
intended. Rich philanthropists control trusts to ensure that their donations
go where they want them to. There are sound reasons for this. Take a leaf
from their book. If for example, your debtor uses your loan to buy not the
equipment for which you lent the money, but, say, a share, and receives a 10
per cent dividend, that is technically your income and you are liable for
income tax on it.
The fourth point to notice when making a private loan, is more uplifting.
When you lend or act as guarantor for a loan to somebody who is broke, and
there is no hope of ever getting repaid, your unlikely saviour could be the
Inland Revenue.
Section D36 of its booklet Extra Statutory Concessions states that in
certain circumstances a loss may be claimed where money lent to a person
carrying on a trade, profession or vocation has become irrecoverable. Though
the claim usually arises from the date of the loss, it can be made up to two
years afterwards.
Lending to family or friends is, generally speaking, a private arrangement
of no interest or concern to anybody else. But if any eventual difficulty
arises, a written agreement does show evidence of intention, even if nothing
else, and may help the lender get tax relief on any capital gains elsewhere
that he or she may make.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: The all-or-nothing share - Capital
shares are at the end of the queue but have most to gain / The Speculator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL SHARES are one class of security issued by so-called 'split capital'
investment trusts. They pay no income and are normally the 'riskiest' class
of share in the trust.
Where there is high risk, there is the chance of high reward and this is
where the capital share may attract the speculator. According to S G
Warburg, the average capital share rose 65 per cent between January 1 and
August 20 this year, when the stock market was around its peak.
The key to understanding capital shares is to grasp that they are at the
back of the queue when it comes to paying out a trust's assets. An
assortment of other claimants - debenture holders, zero coupon preference
shareholders, income shareholders - have to be paid first. Only then, if
there are any assets left, do capital shareholders get their slice. It is
possible that the capital shares will receive nothing at all.
The good news, however, is that the claims of the other shareholders are
normally fixed. Once the assets of the trust have grown past a certain
point, all the excess gain will accrue to the capital shareholders. In a
bull market (provided the trust managers are reasonably competent), capital
shareholders should earn very high returns.
Furthermore, profits come in the form of capital gain. Since many people do
not use up their annual capital gains tax allowance (Pounds 5,800 in
1993-94), there is a good chance that a fair slice of this gain will be
tax-free.
Valuing capital shares can be tricky. On the London Share Service pages of
the FT (at the back of the first section on Saturdays), capital shares are
often quoted at a very wide discount to their asset values.
But this figure should not be compared to the discount at which conventional
investment trust shares trade. As stated above, capital shareholders are
only repaid after other claimants; the asset figure which appears in the FT
is based on the current value of those other claims.
However, in many cases, split capital investment trusts have zero dividend
preference, as well as capital, shares. The zeros have a claim on the assets
of the trust which steadily increases over the years. A more conservative
way of valuing a capital share is thus to allow for the final, rather than
the current, claims of other shares. If one uses that method, shares which
appear to be standing at a discount, can often be seen to be trading at a
premium.
Investment trust analysts tend to value trust shares by looking at their
gross redemption yields over the years until the trust is wound up. They do
so by assuming a number of different rates of growth of the assets of the
trust.
As an example, take the shares of Contracyclical Investment Trust, which on
August 31 were standing at 20p. According to the Association of Investment
Trust Companies, if the trust's assets grow at 10 per cent per annum until
wind-up (in seven years and seven months' time), Contracyclical's shares
would return a gross redemption yield of 25.3 per cent per year.
Mouthwatering stuff. But if the assets do not grow at all over the remainder
of the trust's life, the shares would return a gross redemption yield of
minus 16 per cent per year. In other words, the trust currently has
insufficient assets, if you allow for the final claims of other shares, to
repay capital shareholders at the current share price. (This despite the
fact that, on August 31, the quoted 'discount' was 65 per cent).
In cases such as this, analysts talk of the 'hurdle rate', the annual rate
of asset growth needed to repay the current price of the capital shares. On
August 31, Contracyclical's hurdle rate was 1.8 per cent, according to the
AITC.
Contracyclical was not the most extreme case. On August 31, the hurdle rate
for Scottish National capital shares was 4.4 per cent, ie the trust's assets
needed to grow at 4.4 per cent per year to repay the then share price of
34p. But, if you took a bullish view and assumed that Scottish National
could achieve 10 per cent per annum asset growth over the remaining five
years, one month of its life, the yearly gross redemption yield to capital
shareholders would be a staggering 49.2 per cent.
A capital share such as Scottish National offers an extremely hairy rise as
the graph shows. But some capital shares have lower risk-reward profiles.
Take Aberforth Split Level. As of August 31, the trust had more than enough
assets to repay the then capital share price of 166.5p. Indeed, the trust
could afford to see an annual rate of asset decline of 3.8 per cent over its
remaining 10 years, 10 months of life, and still repay the capital
shareholders at the August 31 price. If the assets of Aberforth Split Level
do not rise at all over the rest of its life, capital shareholders will
still enjoy a 4.2 per cent gross redemption yield.
But for those who take a really bullish view of the market, the rewards are
much less attractive. As of August 31, a 10 per cent annual growth in assets
would earn Aberforth Split Level shareholders a gross redemption yield of
only 14.8 per cent.
For those who do not fancy the mathematics involved, a simpler route might
be to invest in the Exeter Capital Growth fund. This is a unit trust, run by
Exeter Fund Managers, which invests in a broad portfolio of capital shares.
The investor is spared the chore of stock selection, at the cost of a 6 per
cent initial charge and a 1 per cent annual charge.
The Exeter Capital Growth fund was third in the UK equity growth sector over
the year to September 1, with a return of 83.16 per cent (offer-to-bid with
income reinvested, source Micropal). But it is, by its nature, a highly
volatile trust.
If your stockbroker cannot give you access to statistics on capital shares,
the Association of Investment Trust Companies will send out a free sample
copy of its Monthly Information Service. Thereafter, the service is payable
on an annual subscription of Pounds 28 (for monthly issues) or Pounds 15
(for quarterly issues). Write to the AITC at: Park House (6th floor), 16
Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7JJ.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: CGT allowances for August
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in August.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure shown for the month in
which you bought it. Subtract the results from the proceeds of your sale;
the balance will be your taxable gain or loss. Suppose that you bought
shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them in August 1993 for
Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the September 1985 figure of
1.481 gives a total of Pounds 8,886. Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000
gives a capital gain of Pounds 4,114, which is below the 1993-94 CGT
allowance of Pounds 5,800. If you are selling shares bought before April 6
1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The RPI in August was 141.3.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (6): Smoother moves abroad -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DOES one cope with moving abroad? Currently, some 421,000 Britons live
in other EC countries. While there is a network of relocation agents to
guide and help other nationals moving into Britain - as in the US - the
number of companies offering to assist the British into Europe seems
surprisingly few.
The directory of the Edinburgh-based Association of Relocation Agents (ARA)
lists 116 members and Associates ready to help people find homes in parts of
Britain. But only six will handle moves into Europe.
ARA was founded in 1986 and its chairman, Tad Zurlinden - he is of Swiss
extraction - admits that the number of members in the international section
is sparse. In a growing market it seems odd to find so few companies
operating.
Taking the Benelux countries as an example, the latest figures (which are
for 1991) show that Belgium had 23,300 resident Britons - the number of
Britons moving into Belgium has nearly quadrupled since 1985 - the
Netherlands 39,000, Luxembourg, 3,200.
'The Americans have had relocation in all its different guises for 25 to 30
years. In Britain there were a few companies in the 1970s but the service
has only built up in the last ten years,' says Zurlinden.
However, although there are relatively few relocation companies, between
them they provide a wide range of services. Not only will they find property
and furnishing services, they will make sure that gas, electricity and so on
are connected for new occupants. They may also arrange the letting and
management of the home you have left behind.
People &amp; Property says it gives a personal service to corporate and private
clients. This includes area orientation, homefinding (to buy or rent),
educational counselling, furniture removals and introductions to decorators.
At EuroHome Corporate Services, based in Amsterdam, Avrom Goldberg, managing
director, provides destination homefinding, international homesale and spans
37 countries on four continents. Goldberg says of Belgium: 'It is pretty
much a buyers' market. You will get detached houses and far more space
there.' Rents in Brussels had peaked and were coming down, he says, while in
Amsterdam they were rising.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (5): A French connection on
the waterfront - Audrey Powell has been touring France and discovering
holiday homes to suit nearly every pocket / International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH A near 2,000 mile stretch of coastline, France offers the homebuyer who
has designs on living by the water three choices: the Channel, the Atlantic
or the Mediterranean. A variety of property styles and climate to go with
the three expanses of water are also on offer.
For those living in south-east England the spring opening of the Channel
tunnel will make a weekend home on the northern French coast a more inviting
and easily-obtainable prospect.
The French tourist board stresses the virtues of the Opal coast - 55 miles
of beaches, dunes and cliffs between Calais and Berck.
It will be possible to reach the resort of Le Touquet and lesser-known
Hardelot (founded by Englishman John Whitley at the beginning of the
century) in three hours from London.
Hardelot is a resort with many activities to amuse all the family. It has
two of the Opal coast's eight golf courses, a sizeable equestrian centre, a
tennis club and 10 miles of broad beach (much used for horse-riding and
sand-yachting) stretched before a pine forest. Then there is a compact town,
with boutiques and restaurants, to interest all shoppers.
Lesur Promotion has a choice of property in the resort to suit most buyers -
apartments, seafront or in more secluded areas, from Pounds 48,000.
A family looking for a weekend home may prefer to have a house built.
Different sized plots can be bought from Pounds 60,000 either on a golf
course or tucked away in pine woods. A three- to five-bedroom villa is
standard, as is the steep roof. This would cost Pounds 80,000 upwards on top
of the plot price. Other prospective buyers might prefer an
individually-designed property. (Information from Lesur Promotion Hardelot
21 91 91 00).
Earlier this year a group of established British-based estate agents
offering property in France combined to form Groupe France, which
collectively almost covers the country. Each company continues to specialise
in a defined area, but when one does not have a particular type of property
sought after, the applicant's name is passed on to a fellow agent.
One member of the group, Rutherfords (071-386-7240), extolls the virtues of
west coast France - bracing air, beaches cleaned by the Atlantic ocean. It
suggests resales at Port Bourgemay, near Les Sables d'Olonne, could be
useful buys. A typical studio starts from Pounds 24,500, a furnished
two-bedroom apartment from Pounds 43,000. Port Bourgemay has a sandy beach,
golf course, tennis and other resort facilities.
Up to 100,000 Britons are selling their property in France, says Frank
Rutherford. Indeed Britons buying resales at Port Bourgemay will likely be
buying from fellow countrymen, saving time and trouble.
On the south coast of France the choice of property is immense, with a price
tag to match.
Residence Atoll Beach, at Port Saint-Laurent is a new eye-catching block of
apartments, built in a series of horizontal lines. It took the development
company, Atoll Beach, seven years to obtain permission for the project,
which involved relocating the nearby road to enable the apartments a
situation next to the sea.
The completed, crescent-shaped building, on six floors, comprises 109 one to
four-bedroom apartments, with shops at ground level and a hotel with
swimming pool. Prices range from Pounds 150,000 for a large studio with
terrace and sea view, to Pounds 1.24m for a four-bedroom, four-bathroom
apartment, with basement garaging. (London agent is David de Lara &amp;
Partners, 081-742-0708).
For those who prefer something with more privacy, a recently-restored 1920s
house on the water, with private mooring, beach and cove, is available on
the Cote de l'Esterel, west of Cannes.
Each of the villa's three bedrooms has a balcony overlooking the sea. The
owner, a member of a rock group, is seeking Pounds 1.6m, through London
agent Barbers (071-381-0112).
Canalside houses at Port Grimaud, the 'lagoon city' in the Gulf of St Tropez
are as near the water as is possible.
The resort has grown to 2,500 homes. On a summer evening a procession of
boats can be seen - their owners returning them to the end-of-the-garden
moorings.
Building began at the resort in 1966 and was due to be completed by now, but
the final section has not yet been built. This will comprise 40 apartments
and 55 houses - reservations are awaited. Meantime there are a few other new
properties available and some resales. (Sales office Port Grimaud 94 36 21
82 or UK contact 0243-572001).
The architect, Francois Spoerry, now aged over 80, has a home there, which
he designed he says, with a smuggled pencil while a prisoner of war.
His commissions have been worldwide but he now concentrates mostly on
France. One current project involves a hotel at Beauvallon, St Maxime, with
additional development, for the American Disney group - its first hotel in
France.
Interesting to watch develop will be a project further east along the coast
at the old port at Frejus.
Spoerry's practice has been brought in to oversee the second phase, which
will mirror Port Grimaud, with its canal side pastel-shaded houses and
slightly taller apartments. But here the development is cut inland, rather
than being built outwards like Grimaud, and the canal will meander beneath
bridges leading to a lake. Several builders will be working on different
sections that will be carefully co-ordinated.
A few properties from the first phase are still available and those in the
next phase will start coming on the market next year. Prices are expected to
be lower than at Port Grimaud. (Information from the developer, La Semaf, at
Frejus 94 82 63 00. Or those whose French is rusty might prefer to contact
Caroline Jenkins at the Frejus Notaries' Office, 94 51 00 05).
Waterside France is not limited to the coast. David Kay, of Waterside
Properties International (0892-750011) points out: 'There are over 33,000
communes in France and 25,000 of them have water features - lakes, tarns,
rivers, canals.' His agency has dozens of inland properties with what he
calls 'water-related opportunities', on its books. There are lock-keepers'
cottages, canalside houses, watermills, restored and unrestored. Prices
range from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 1.5m.
A former windmill, now a two-bedroom house, has views over the bay of Mont
St Michel. A small hotel in a tourist village is 'just a few yards from a
large lake'. A terrace of four cottages is 'ideally situated for gites' and
a five-bedroom watermill close to a lake is just an hour of Paris.
Different again is the 'waterside France' bordering the Alpine lakes.
Whatever the market, someone has it - Alpine Apartments Agency (0544-388234)
specialises in this sort of property.
Seekers of a waterside holiday home are reminded that while a town like
Annecy has popular appeal with its cobbled streets and arcades, prices are
high, even for a one-bedroom apartment. 'Lakeside houses with a mooring at
the bottom of the garden are rare and can command Pounds 950,000.' A
somewhat old-fashioned three-bedroom house looking over the lake at Menthon
is Pounds 255,000.
Close to the Swiss border on Lake Geneva and on the water's edge, is The
Sanctuary, at Meillerie, a phased development of apartments. Prices for
two-bedroom designs are from Pounds 105,000. A rental-income and letting
service, is available. Building starts on the second phase this month.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: An attractive option - Offshore Bond
Funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOND INVESTORS who are non-taxpayers are likely to be attracted to offshore
bond funds than onshore unit trusts as they pay income gross. Some resident
UK citizens who are liable for tax may also choose to invest offshore
because the tax payment can be delayed.
The table lists those sterling offshore bond funds recognised by the
Securities and Investments Board - the chief regulator for the financial
services industry in the UK - and which have a three-year performance
record. SIB recognition should comfort investors, as should well-known
industry names in the table.
Figures have been taken from Hardwick Stafford Wright and show the top 10
performing SIB-recognised funds in the sterling fixed-interest sector.
They are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis because some funds have a single
price but add an initial charge. Were all funds to be quoted on an
offer-to-bid price, the single-priced funds would receive an unfair
advantage. The effect of quoting on an offer to offer basis is that the
performance figures are inflated and the returns which would actually have
been achieved by an investor will have been lower.
Charges on the funds are similar to onshore unit trusts: in the range of 5-6
per cent, although they can vary widely (see Phil Coggan's Serious Money
piece on Schwab's new no-load offshore fund service on Page II). The John
Govett fund, for example, carries a 5 per cent initial charge and a 1 per
cent annual management fee while TSB's charges are 3 per cent initial and
0.75 per cent annual. Barclays Unicorn Sterling bond fund also has
relatively low charges of 3.5 per cent initial and 0.85 per cent annual. The
Henderson fund, an umbrella fund, carries a 4.5 per cent initial charge and
0.6 per cent annual fee; Sun Life's fund has a 6 per cent initial charge and
a 0.6 per cent annual management fee.
Investors seeking income should not base their choice entirely on the size
of the yield, since a bond fund can achieve a high yield at the expense of
declining capital - a problem highlighted by TSB. 'We used to pay a high
distribution and became concerned that we would have to pay out capital, so
we have reduced the level of income,' said TSB.
John Govett's Simon Osborne says that his fund's yield is achieved by
investments in foreign currency bonds. A minimum of 75 per cent of the fund
must be invested in UK sterling bonds but 10 per cent is in Mexican
short-term paper, currently yielding 13.5 per cent. A proportion is also
invested in 10-year Italian government bonds which also have a high yield.
Barclays Unicorn's sterling bond fund, managed by BZW, the securities arm of
Barclays, invests only in gilts (to a maximum of 35 per cent) and
Eurosterling bonds. Anita Higgins, fund manager, says that the good yield
has been achieved by investing in long-dated high-yielding corporate bonds.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Rhapsody in prudence - How to insure
musical instruments against passing coat-tails, the roadie's beer or the
casual attitude of their own players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU knew an object was worth several thousand pounds, and was so delicate
that one crack could halve its value, you would normally treat it with some
respect. You would hesitate to entrust it to a teenager, bundle it into a
car boot, or lug it around on public transport. But people do this all the
time - a cello is designed to be played, after all, not locked away for
safety's sake.
Many musical instruments are not only valuable, but fragile, yet the
attitude of players can be somewhat casual. Instrument repairers point to
workshops full of cracked bows, left balanced on music stands, and chipped
violins, abandoned on chairs during rehearsal breaks with necks sticking out
to be caught by passing coat-tails. Brass and woodwind instruments are
slightly more robust, but cannot take rough handling.
A decent, student-quality musical instrument could be one of the single most
valuable items a family owns; older pieces, perhaps passed down through the
generations, can easily be worth five-figure sums. Household insurers are
usually willing to cover musical instruments up to a certain value, for
example Pounds 12,000 at Legal &amp; General, but you will need to ensure the
instrument is named on the policy, and you will pay extra for accidental
damage cover, or all-risks if the instrument is ever taken outside the home.
Sun Alliance charges Pounds 30 per Pounds 1,000 value for all-risks cover,
for example.
If you have an instrument you do not play, but which you keep as an
investment or for sentimental reasons, clumsiness or carelessness should not
be such a problem, but insurers will need to know that it is kept properly.
They will not cover hazards such as woodworm or deterioration caused by
extremes of temperature.
However, claims handlers at general insurers may not be familiar with the
peculiarities of musicians' requirements. Damage claims are more common than
theft claims, and expert repairs can be very expensive. Household insurers
are not used to paying large amounts for possessions to be repaired: it is
often cheaper and easier to throw out a damaged video recorder and buy a new
one, but few musicians would want to junk a 200-year-old instrument if it
suffered one dent too many.
The wording of most home contents policies is unlikely to allow compensation
for loss of value if a damaged instrument can be repaired, but will never be
worth as much again. If the instrument is ever played professionally it
becomes 'business equipment' in the eyes of many general insurers, and is
therefore excluded.
These are the kind of areas where specialist insurers may have an advantage.
They are more likely to appreciate the problems of antique instruments and
the need for expert repairs; also they do not draw distinctions between
professional and amateur players. Premiums may be lower than for an
all-risks extension to home contents insurance.
The biggest name in classical music insurance is British Reserve, a division
of Cornhill. It has been offering insurance for orchestral instruments for
three decades, and now has the largest share of the UK market. Pop and rock
musicians are excluded, but jazz is a grey area - 'serious' musicians are
usually acceptable.
The British Reserve insurance package covers loss and damage anywhere in the
world. There are 10 per cent discounts for members of the Musicians Union
and various other professional bodies. If you are happy for theft from an
unattended vehicle to be excluded, there is a discount of 20 per cent.
The minimum premium is Pounds 15 - the company aims to catch young musicians
when they acquire their first half-size violin or clarinet and keep their
custom as they metamorphose into soloists and orchestral players. Hired
instruments can also be covered.
Hartley Cooper Associates, part of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation group, has just entered the market with a policy similar to the
British Reserve one. Again, the cover is intended mainly for classical
musicians, whether amateur or professional, and discounts are available for
members of professional organisations. Cover can be limited to the UK, or
Europe, or worldwide. The minimum premium is Pounds 50, for cover limited to
the UK.
Electronic instruments present different problems to underwriters. No
insurer is going to pay out if would-be rock stars start smashing up their
guitars on stage. But the disruption to a sensitive synthesiser's innards
caused by a carelessly placed beer can, or a rough roadie, can be covered.
The rapid pace of technical innovations means that badly damaged electric
guitars or keyboards are rarely worth repairing, even if the spare parts
exist - but a musician with an emotional attachment to the guitar he played
on his first big tour may insist on a repair no matter what the cost.
Entertainment &amp; Leisure specialises in rock and pop music equipment, even
disc jockeys' records and microphones, but it will also cover classical
instruments. Premiums depend on the type of equipment or instruments being
insured, and whether the things insured are kept in one building or need to
be covered for anywhere in the UK. The wider option includes an automatic
31-day western Europe extension.
As a rough guide, managing director Brian Martin quotes an annual premium of
Pounds 241 for Pounds 5,000 of heavy-duty rock equipment, and Pounds 160 for
classical equipment to the same value. A teenager's Pounds 500-worth of
electric guitar and amplifier, kept in the home, would cost Pounds 30 to
insure, or Pounds 39 if it was used in practices or performances elsewhere.
E &amp; L can also provide performers' public liability cover of up to Pounds
2m, and pays up to Pounds 2,000 for the hire of replacement equipment.
Galaxy 7 is another specialist offering insurance for musical instruments
used for classical, jazz, pop and other types of music. Even karaoke
equipment can be insured. The choice ranges from cover limited to a single
building in the UK to worldwide, including all transit risks. The basic cost
is Pounds 2 per Pounds 100 insured, with a minimum premium of Pounds 25,
plus a Pounds 7.50 documentation charge. Public liability cover can be
arranged as a policy extension.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (4): Bureaucracy: the new
Berlin wall - Legal and ownership disputes have snarled the market in the
former east Germany / International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Berlin Wall was dismantled in November 1989, those who had never
dared set foot in the former east Germany were surprised by what they saw.
In spite of the former communist regime's attempts to pull down many fine
buildings in east Berlin, some were spared the bulldozers. The Dom, the
beautiful Protestant cathedral where some of the Prussian kings are buried,
and the Synogogue are just two examples. Both have now been restored.
As the visitor drives northwards through the rolling plains of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the Baltic coast, or southwards through small,
cobble-stoned villages in Saxony and Thuringia, he or she will see numerous
houses standing empty and in need of repair. These properties should have
been snapped up by now by property developers, speculators and former
owners. But what was once considered a dream, providing rich pickings for
those with cash, has turned into a nightmare for some wanting to buy
property in the five new Lander, or states.
The root of the problem rests with the unification treaty of 1990. The
treaty gives former owners, whose property was confiscated between 1933 and
1945 or between 1949 and 1990, the right to claim back their property or
seek compensation.
The law was amended two years ago to give investors priority over
restitution, provided that the claimant could not match the investor,
particularly in terms of property development which would provide
employment. Once that was proved, the investor paid compensation to the
original owner. But as investors and individuals wishing to buy a plot of
land are finding out, things are not so simple.
Anyone wanting to buy land or property in eastern Germany must first
establish whether there are any outstanding claims on that property. This
means going to the local Landesamt, which holds a record of some land
titles, or applying directly to Barby, eastern Germany's central land
registry. The latter contains almost every single land title for the
country. The problem is, the 15 kilometres of thick, leather-bound titles
are not computerised. Moreover, some of the land registries were destroyed,
had pages torn out, or in some cases the Nazis or the communists blotted out
the names of the original owners so that - particularly in the case of
Jewish families who survived the Holocaust - they would not return and
reclaim their property.
In a bizarre twist of history, I have been told several times by lawyers
that former Nazis who concealed the names of the original Jewish owners are
now trying to reclaim that property.
The staff at Barby - which was used as a Russian garrison after the second
world war, later as a hostel for Gastarbeiter, or guest workers, and then as
a land registry tightly controlled by the Stasi, or state security police -
have since installed infra-red equipment which can penetrate the blacked-out
titles. But the process takes time.
At present, 1.21m claimants are seeking restitution or compensation for 2.6m
titles throughout eastern Germany. The expiry date for registering a land
claim was December 31 1992, but the 4,000 officials processing the claims
have only resolved about 22 per cent of all cases. In cities such as Leipzig
and Halle, claims have proceeded very slowly; indeed, the success rate is as
low as 6 per cent in Halle, the birthplace of George Friedrich Handel. Klaus
Rauen, the mayor, throws up his hands in despair. 'Without resolving all
these property rights, we cannot speed up investment. Moreover, we need to
settle these claims so that we can renovate the buildings in the centre of
our city.'
Cities such as Leipzig and Berlin are awash with property consultants who
set up offices after 1989 in the expectation that they could acquire land
quickly and cheaply. But Stefan Brendgen, a consultant for Jones Lang
Wootton, the UK property consultant also based in Frankfurt and Berlin, is
more realistic. He says property claims are moving a bit faster, but those
wanting to buy must have 'patience, money, and a good lawyer'.
Patience is needed because the bureaucracy is so slow. Although government
officials stress that establishing the title on land can be resolved within
two months, claimants and property developers say many cases take at least
nine months - if not longer. Moreover, claimants complain that local
officials delay in replying to letters and demand more evidence of original
ownership. Claimants also say that low-level officials are bribed by
property speculators to dissuade the original owner from pursuing a claim.
Money is needed because claimants not wanting to regain their property will
be looking for compensation at the market rate. And a lawyer is crucial to
establish, check, and negotiate the final purchase, restitution or
compensation claims.
The investor faces another potential problem. It concerns property
expropriated by the former Soviet Union when it controlled eastern Germany
between 1945 and 1949. Under the terms of the unification treaty, those
whose property was expropriated during this period are not entitled to
restitution or compensation. The government in Bonn claims that the Soviet
Union made the non-return of this property a pre-condition of German
unification. Many of these former property owners were aristocratic
land-owners and large entrepreneurs.
In recent months, Daimler-Benz and other land-owners have begun to challenge
the Soviet veto on the ground that Moscow never laid down such a
pre-condition for unification. Whether they can prove this in the courts is
another matter. But it places a question mark over the status of this land,
which totals 13,000 square miles. Some is under the Treuhand, the agency
charged with privatising eastern German industry. Some is rented out to
small farmers.
Perhaps this is an unduly bleak picture of the property market in eastern
Germany. But there is hardly an official in any of the five Lander who does
not agree that outstanding Vermogensfragen - property questions - is one of
the principle headaches of unification. All admit, too, that the problem
will need at least 10 years to resolve. The longer it takes, the longer the
delay in property prices finding their real market value.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Four steps to haven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LIDDINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the taxman's best kept secrets is that, with careful planning,
foreign nationals living in the UK can often avoid paying any tax at all.
For such people the UK is an excellent tax haven.
It is surprising how many foreign nationals do not know this, or, if they
do, fail to take action in time, particularly as the amounts of tax at stake
are sometimes very large.
Consider Mr B, a Middle Eastern businessman, who came to the UK with his
family in March 1980. He has Pounds 2m cash in a bank outside the UK and a
London residence worth Pounds 300,000 which he acquired in 1986. He uses the
deposit interest to meet his living expenses, and he also used it to fund
his house purchase.
He dies in 1997, his wife having predeceased him. He leaves everything to
his children, who all wish to remain in the UK.
He has had no contact with the UK Revenue. After his death, his children
learn that to obtain probate they must pay inheritance tax of Pounds 860,000
on his worldwide estate of Pounds 2.3m. They then learn that the estate
faces an income tax bill of Pounds 640,000 for 17 years' unpaid income tax.
Finally, they discover that the entire Pounds 1.5m tax bill could have been
avoided if their father had taken four steps.
Most of the steps depend upon Mr B having retained his foreign domicile.
One's domicile is one's permanent home. Provided appropriate action is
taken, foreign nationals living in the UK can often retain their foreign
domiciles for many years.
The first step Mr B should have taken is to bring capital rather than income
into the UK. The capital must be 'clean' capital, that is, it must not
contain capital gains or income accruing while Mr B was resident in the UK.
This should not have been difficult for Mr B to arrange. He could have put
all his cash into one offshore bank account (the capital account) before
coming to the UK, and opened a separate, initially empty, offshore account
to which the interest earned on the cash would be credited. He would then
draw on the capital account alone.
So long as Mr B is domiciled outside the UK, only income and gains brought
into the UK are subject to tax, and as the capital account contains neither,
money paid from it to the UK is tax free.
If Mr B exhausted the capital account and had to draw on the income account
he would have become liable to income tax on the income brought into the UK.
But he could have avoided the tax if, before drawing on the income account,
he had restructured it by closing it down and opening suitable new accounts.
This is the second step. It requires timing and planning, but it can be used
to wash out the income tax liability and create a new 'clean' capital
account, which can be drawn on free of tax.
The third step is for Mr B to put his non-UK assets, ie his cash, into a
suitable offshore trust. This ensures that UK inheritance tax on the cash is
avoided on his death.
Under the inheritance tax regime, foreign assets are only free of
inheritance tax if their owner has been resident in the UK for tax purposes
for less than 17 of the last 20 tax years.
As tax years cut across calendar years, it is not uncommon for someone who
has been in the UK for little more than 15 calendar years to be caught and
their worldwide assets become subject to inheritance tax on their death at
the rate of 40 per cent above Pounds 150,000.
Mr B could have avoided this by putting his assets into a suitable trust.
before the 17-year period elapsed. So long as the trust assets are kept out
of the UK, no inheritance tax is payable.
If the trustees are resident and the trust is run outside the UK, it can be
used to avoid capital gains tax in the long term, and to defer income tax.
The trap foreign domiciliaries most frequently fall into is to fail to
create a suitable trust until it is too late. Anyone of significant means
who arrived in the UK more than 10 years ago should be considering creating
such a trust.
This leaves the house. There are various ways of avoiding tax on it, but the
least expensive and most satisfactory is for Mr and Mrs B to make
appropriate wills.
Under conventional wills it is not possible to avoid inheritance tax on a
couple's residence, but inheritance tax at current rates on the first Pounds
300,000 of the matrimonial home can be avoided. This technique, which
involves the use of discretionary trusts is also available to UK
domiciliaries and I will describe in a future article.
If Mr B had used these strategies the tax bill on his death would have been
reduced from Pounds 1.5m to nil.
Prompt action on arrival in the UK is essential and can pay immense
dividends. Even so, with careful planning it is usually possible to achieve
significant tax savings provided the 17-year period has not expired.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of 20,000 shares by Gordon Bond at Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the
specialty paper group, was made following the announcement of interim
figures which were marginally up on the same period last year.
The sale by three directors of Jupiter Tyndall, the banking and investment
management group, of more than 1.5m shares has been made just before the
company went into its close period. The share price has been performing well
over the year but the sale almost halved the holding of chairman John
Duffield.
The Scottish packaging company, MacFarlane Group (Clansman) has enjoyed a
good rise in its share price over the past year. Directors have been selling
the whole way up; the most recent transaction, by Gordon Lane, was made at
209p.
Simon Engineering announced interim results at the beginning of September.
In spite of announcing a loss before tax for the first six months of the
year, three members of the board, including A M Davies, the new chairman,
bought a total of 79,000 shares at 59p.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Small team, broad themes - Philip
Coggan finds long-term thinking and a record to match / Unit trusts/St James
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE investment team of St James Place unit trust group consists of three men
 -Nils Taube, John Hodson and Cato Stonex - working from a tiny office in an
elegant Palladian building in the West End.
Sitting at desks, strategically placed within prospectus-throwing distance
of each other, the three men spend the day swapping ideas and looking for
investment themes, from which they hope their funds can profit.
As well as the St James's Place range of unit trusts, the trio runs pension
and life funds for J Rothschild Assurance, the life assurance company
recently established by Sir Mark Weinberg and Lord Rothschild.
Nils Taube is definitely the guiding spirit of the team. He has been a
director of George Soros's Quantum fund for 15 years, and has been linked
with Lord Rothschild since 1982. He has been managing the St James's Place
International fund (which has had various names) since 1971.
Taube's long-term record commands respect. The International trust ranked
first out of 43 funds in the international equity growth sector over the 10
years to September 1, with growth of 459.4 per cent (offer-to-bid with
income reinvested: source Micropal). It also achieved first quartile
performance over the one, three and five year periods, with growth of 62.6,
62.7 and 99 per cent respectively.
The trust follows a stock-picking style and he says the geographical
allocation of assets stems from stock selection, rather than the other way
round.
The current split of funds under management is (all figures percentages) UK
(16.9 per cent), US (22.5), Canada (3.8), Australia (2.4), South Africa
(0.2), France (0.9), Germany (9.7). Sweden (1.1), Switzerland (4), Italy
(14.4), Czechoslovakia (1.1), Japan (12.6) and Argentina (1.6). The
remainder of the trust, just under 9 per cent, is invested in cash and
bonds.
Taube adds that he sees currency and stock selections as entirely separate.
'Probably what makes us different from the others,' he says, 'is that we are
not in the least bit afraid of hedging currency risk if we want to. Although
only 16 per cent of our assets are in UK equities, 46 per cent are in
sterling.'
The investment team looks for undervalued stocks round the world and is
willing to be a long term holder. One stock, the US-based Pep Boys Manny Moe
&amp; Jack, has been in the fund since launch - its original cost was Pounds
32,000, while its current value is over Pounds 1.5m.
It is better still if a stock can be both cheap and fit into one of the
team's themes of the moment. Like some other fund managers profiled in this
series, St James's Place is enthusiastic about the prospects for the Italian
telecommunications groups, SIP/STET, which at the end of January made up
6.44 per cent of the assets of the trust.
The enthusiasm for SIP/STET, although based on the shares' cheapness
relative to cashflow, fits into the theme of communications, which Taube
believes will be the growth sector of the decade.
Other stocks in the portfolio which fit the communications theme include
News Corporation, Security Services (which owns a stake in the Cellnet
mobile phone system), the Mirror Group and Nextel, a US telecommunications
group.
Another portfolio theme is insurance. The company owns stakes in Royal and
Sun Alliance in the UK, TIG Holdings in the US, Munich Re in Germany,
Alleanza in Italy, Swiss Re in Switzerland and, in Japan, stocks such as
Mitsui Marine and Sumitomo Marine.
'I like the reinsurance companies because there has been a shakeout of
capacity and premiums are rising,' says Taube, 'whereas we like Alleanza
because the Italians are behind other countries in their use of life
insurance.'
Cross-border plagiarism is another general theme of Taube's. A development
in one market, such as the US, will often be copied in other markets. An
example was the way in which supermarkets spread from the US to the UK in
the 1950s.
The International fund remains relatively small, with Pounds 67m under
management, although the link to J Rothschild Assurance may build up the
fund over time.
The group has two other funds in the international equity sector, growth
(5th over one year, 30th over three years) and North American and
International (43rd over one year, but 5th over the 10 year period).
The three funds tend to own similar stocks, although with different
emphases. Taube says that the growth fund has done better than the
International fund over the past year because it had a large stake in
SIP/STET.
Charges. The initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual charge is 1.5 per
cent. The bid-offer spread is around 5.5 per cent. The minimum initial
investment is Pounds 1,500. There is no savings scheme attached to the
trust. Both income and accumulation units are available, although the fund
is manageds for capital growth, so the yield is very small - less than 0.1
per cent.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (3): How to remain
independent in old age - What are the priorities of elderly people when
choosing a new home? Gerald Cadogan finds out what is on offer / Retirement
homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW ARE gran and grandpa? Carrying on, ever plucky but less able to cope? Is
it time to say 'You can't spend another winter in this house, mummy,' and
ask them to live with you? That would be the way in Mediterranean countries.
A British variant is to put them in a granny flat next door to you.
Or you can suggest buying a flat or house in a retirement home. For many old
people it is the best solution - if it is a high-quality, well-run place.
Retirement homes maintain grandparents' independence. If you are ageing but
not incapacitated - the average for entering homes in the Pegasus group is
73.5 years - you continue to have a base that is yours with your own things
around you, or what you keep of them after distributing the chattels from
your old house - in a pre-emptive strike against your children's squabbling
over them when you are gone.
You have company, of people of similar background who have had similar
experiences. And you have protection, which is why retirement homes are also
called sheltered housing. A warden/administrator is on duty or at the end of
a red emergency button all the time. They are not nurses, but can arrange
nursing and will check that you are alright if you have not been out for a
day or two. (If you are chronically ill, you need a residential home.) They
also call the plumber, make sure the dustbins are out and have the windows
cleaned. For the service charge, retirement homes free you from building
maintenance.
Top-class specialist developers such as (in alphabetical order) Beechcroft,
Bovis, English Courtyard Association, McCarthy &amp; Stone, and Pegasus, are
coming through the recession, and the market is picking up well. But some
companies - both big ones and local speculative builders - thought rejigged
starter homes would suffice for the old. They do not. This has led to an
overhang of 'sheltered flats' in the market, which discourages the banks
from putting up money for new schemes, Henry Thornton of Beechcroft notes.
Choose your scheme carefully is the corollary, and look closely at the
service for the residents. Is it easy to walk to the shops? How near are
airports, railway stations and motorways?
Beechcroft's University Farm scheme in Moreton-in-Marsh (a joint venture
with Nationwide Housing Trust) has a rare plus. It is in a Cotswold town
that has a station at the end of the High Street. And Pegasus's Grandpont
scheme, now being built as a joint venture with Brasenose College, just
south of Folly Bridge, Oxford, on the former Oxford City football ground, is
surprisingly close to the middle of the city.
Old people like activity, or watching it. Michael McCarthy, of Pegasus,
finds that the first units to go in a development overlook the drive or the
main entrance.
Good schemes are often built around a courtyard, giving a sense of community
neighbourliness that people living in city terraces are used to. They may
incorporate an existing building that gives the reassurance of continuity.
Pegasus's scheme at Brackley, in Northamptonshire, is designed around a
solid Edwardian building which used to be a boarding house for Magdalen
College School, and at Cerne Abbas, in Dorset, Beechcroft has a tithe barn
and a meadow beside the River Cerne.
The units are usually flats or cottage-sized houses that can be arranged for
buyers' preferences, sometimes by knocking two units into one. Size varies.
Grandpont will be the largest in Britain with 101 units, including 42 family
houses with gardens to include young marrieds with children as well.
Beechcroft's scheme in Odiham, Hampshire, will have just 18 cottages, and
English Courtyard's Framers Court at Lane End, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire,
17 cottages, six maisonettes and four flats.
Inside they are planned to help the old unobtrusively. That means doors wide
enough for wheelchairs, living rooms that will convert into downstairs
bedrooms and plugs at knee to waist height. But Pegasus does not install
grips and rails around the bath until people ask. It helps planning,
McCarthy says, to visit buyers' old homes to see how they live.
Some schemes expect residents to instal their own washing machines. Others
have communal laundry rooms. Any problems? Ask the warden. In Brackley she
knows the house well as she had been the house matron when it was part of
the school.
Other amenities may include a guest suite, a common room and a restaurant. A
three-course lunch with coffee in Brackley costs Pounds 3.75. Pegasus is
including restaurants on all its new schemes as part of the service although
they do not make money. It also puts some of its profits into the Pegasus
Trust, to help with emergencies such as hospital operations or wheelchair
provision.
McCarthy, who has a doctorate in social studies and has written The New
Politics of Welfare, stresses that good retirement home management is
'anticipating progressive need.' Residents can then cope for many years. It
is not the aim to push them out. And if the scheme has a swimming pool,
there is no better exercise.
So who are the occupants? At Oxford they are dons, librarians and clergy. At
Brackley they are engineers, doctors, teachers and businessmen. Nowadays,
couples often decide to make the move together. Prices for Pegasus average
Pounds 102,500. The Beechcroft Cerne Abbas cottages cost Pounds
135,000-Pounds 185,000. At Radlett, in Hertfordshire, Bovis has flats from
Pounds 97,500 to Pounds 135,000, and English Courtyard's new developments
range from Pounds 130,000 (a flat at Ilminster in Somerset) to Pounds
215,000 (a cottage near Marlow in Buckinghamshire). The service charge at
Brackley is Pounds 23 a week including water but not council tax.
Whether leasehold or freehold, selling on should not be difficult. With a
greying population it is a growth market. From 1961 to 1989 over-80s
increased from 2 per cent to 4 per cent of the population and over-65s from
12 to 16 per cent, and will rise to 19 per cent by 2021 and 22 per cent by
2031.
The sector, McCarthy says, is a 'still embryonic' large market, where the
homes can meet needs that fragmented families cannot. He values development
companies which run their own management. It makes a better planned way of
helping us to grow old pleasantly.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: BES offers more variety - The tide
of university schemes has abated. But others are available
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS university business expansion schemes draw to an end because of the
requirement that BES companies buy only empty properties, the latest
offerings are more varied than the steady diet of university schemes issued
over the summer when student accommodation was vacant.
Sponsor Close Brothers has launched BESSA Bristol &amp; West, a cash-backed
buy-back scheme which will mainly acquire repossessed properties and let
them on assured tenancies. The exit price is 120p after five years for every
100p invested, equating to an annual return of 13.8 per cent for a
higher-rate taxpayer. The offer is backed with sterling certificates of
deposit. After the five year period, Residential Property Reversions, a
private company, will buy back the properties. Minimum investment is Pounds
2,000.
Artesian Developer, from the Artesian Group, which has raised Pounds 37m in
nine previous issues, aims to buy properties and some land with planning
permission to make a profit from capital growth and rental yield after five
years. Some properties can be let with minimal refurbishment but most will
have the potential for further redevelopment.
There is no guaranteed buy-back price but there is also no upper limit on
the return. Investment Advice published by the British Taxpayers Association
regrets the lack of detail on mangement costs. Best BES Advice, published by
the Allenbridge Group, recommends the scheme for its experienced mangement
team and low costs, while BESt Investment says that given the emphasis on
capital return, much depends on the uplift from planning consents.
The British Linen Bank, a subsidiary of Bank of Scotland, is sponsoring The
Ettrick Premier Return Companies which aims to raise Pounds 20m to buy
residential property in the UK, some from Bank of Scotland for letting under
assured tenancy agreements. The contracted exit price is 120p and after four
years, the properties will begin to be sold. Bank of Scotland will buy back
any remaining at the end of five years. Johnson Fry is manager of the
properties and company administrator. The minimum investment is Pounds
1,000.
Best BES Advice says: 'This product offers a first class covenant, well
constructed exit arrangements and good underlying security. The return is a
little light but for those investors for whom risk minimisation is
paramount, this scheme should be attractive.' BESt Advice also gives the
scheme a top rating but says: 'A high minimum subscription and competing
returns make us conclude that there are currently better overall returns
available elsewhere.'
Turning away from assured tenancies, the Ecological Trading Company which
has been in existence since 1989 aims to expand its trade in tropical timber
from a number of community forestry projects in Papua New Guinea, Soloman
Islands and Latin America. The company says: 'Community members themselves
undertake the forestry operations and receive a far greater proportion of
the benefits of these activities than would otherwise be the case. The ETC
works closely with . . . organisations involved in community development and
environmental protection to assist in the development of this type of small
scale of small scale forestry operation.' The minimum investment is Pounds
500.
Matrix Securities has launched an enterprise zone trust to buy South Quay in
London's Docklands for Pounds 95m. The idea is that investors receive an
initial cash profit and 80 per cent of any occupational rents or sales
proceeds to a third party. The minimum subscription is Pounds 25,000.
Analysts' comments will be covered next week.

FOR THOSE with a gripe about their tax affairs, the Inland Revenue has an
answer: its adjudicator.
A new leaflet describes the role of Elizabeth Filkin, the Revenue
Adjudicator and former consumer advocate, whose appointment was announced
earlier this year.
The idea behind the Revenue adjudicator was to provide an independent
channel for complaint by those who feel aggrieved at the way they have been
handled by the Revenue or its Valuation Office Agency.
It does not deal with disputes over the amount of tax to be paid. It does
not remove the right of taxpayers to use other methods of complaint. But it
does provide a new channel for arbitration.
Examples of concerns it will handle include excessive delays, errors,
discourtesy and the way the Revenue has exercised its discretion in tax
negotiations.
Taxpayers should initially give the Revenue the chance to settle a complaint
itself by contacting the person in charge of the office or unit concerned.
Failing that, the next approach should be to the Controller of that unit.
The names and addresses of these are given in the leaflet.
The adjudicator's service is free. The office will only consider complaints
arising after April 5 this year. It will normally not handle issues sent to
it more than six months after a response from the Controller to the
taxpayer.
Complaints can be made by phone, but the adjudicator prefers them in
writing. The office can take calls to help those wondering what to include
in a letter.
Taxpayers should provide the name of the Revenue office involved, and
ideally their tax reference and National Insurance number. They should give
details of costs incurred as a result of the Revenue's action, and say how
they want to settle complaints.

ON TUESDAY, Sears, the retail group, is expected to announce to interim
profits of about Pounds 30m, after exceptional costs relating to the closure
of ter Meulen Post, the Dutch mail order business. That compares with losses
of Pounds 8.8m, though that included an exceptional charge of Pounds 32.5m.
Analysts are looking for a strong recovery from British Shoe, but the
performance of the rest of the group is expected to be patchy.
Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of reference books floated last October,
is expected to report annual profits of about Pounds 9.5m on Tuesday.
Analysts downgraded to that level in March, when the group warned of tougher
competition for children's books in the US.
Redland, the construction materials group, reports its interim results on
Thursday and is expected to lift pre-tax profits to about the Pounds 100m
mark, against Pounds 88.5m last time.
Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, also reports interim profits on
Thursday, with expectations of pre-tax profits of between Pounds 42m and
Pounds 45m. News of the progress of the London hotels will be closely noted.

Peps: the options.
Every UK resident aged over 18 is allowed to invest up to Pounds 6,000 a
year in a general Personal Equity Plan, and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company
Pep, so a couple can invest up to a joint total of Pounds 18,000 a tax year.
way. You can only start one of each type of Pep a year but you can choose
different managers for the general and single company plans.
The Pep investments must be predominantly based in equities and in European
community investments. This means that if you choose to invest in a
collective fund, less than 50 per cent of its investments can be bonds or
gilts, or in shares outside the EC. A maximum of Pounds 1,500 a year can be
invested in funds, such as a Japanese unit trust, which do not qualify in
this way.
General Peps:
Managed. These are plans operated by stockbrokers, financial advisers or
fund management groups. You give them the discretion to invest in a range of
shares, investment trusts and unit trusts. Performance statistics for these
Peps are difficult to obtain, so often the only information you can base
your choice on is their charges or the perromance of another fund by its
manager.
Investment trust. These are usually run by investment trust management
companies, and use a Pep to invest one investment trust, or several managed
by the same group. You can invest through regular savings schemes. There are
likely to be extra charges for Peps, so basic rate taxpayers need to work
out carefully whether the charges outweigh the tax benefits.
Unit trust. Similar to investment trust Peps, but investing in unit trusts.
Savings schemes can be used. There is usually no additional charge for a Pep
on top of the up-front and management charges - so if you are going to buy a
unit trust, you might as well buy it in Pep form.
Self-select. You make your own choice of one or several shares, but the
paperwork is handled by a manager, who charges for the service. The level of
charges is the main deciding factor, but some managers also offer investment
advice. If you wish to transfer shares you already own into a Pep, you must
sell them and buy them back again. This 'bed and breakfasting' mayresult in
a capital gains tax charge.
Corporate. These schemes are organised by a company through an outside
manager to encourage employees or other investors to buy its shares.
Corporate schemes have the advantage of lower costs, but they are inflexible
 -there is no opportunity to switch your investment if it does not perform
well. A few corporate Peps also allow investment in some collective funds or
other companies' shares on top of the main company's shares.
Single company Peps:
Particularly useful as a tax shelter for shares transferred from employee
share option schemes, or for investors who have already used up their
general Pep limit for the year. Only one company's shares can be held at any
time, but it is possible to switch between companies. Single company Peps
cannot be used to buy unit or investment trusts.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Beat the rush, pick your Pep early -
Philip Coggan asks the experts to recommend the best schemes for growth,
income and total return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXISTENCE of a deadline often creates the tendency to leave decisions to
the last minute. So it is with Personal Equity Plans. Although there is no
logical reason to wait until February and March before investing for tax
free income and capital gains, Britons seem to need the spur of the end of
the tax year to take action.
In 1992, September was probably the best time to invest in a Pep since those
who did so caught the post-Black Wednesday rally in share prices. This year
might be different, but investors should still consider investing in a Pep
before the end of the tax year rush.
A couple of caveats. In the early years, the label tax-free on a Pep does
not mean much. If a Pep yields 4 per cent, then a basic rate taxpayer who
invests the full Pounds 6,000 will save just Pounds 48 in tax. That can be
wiped out in a day's trading, so remember, a Pep is only for long term
investment.
Secondly, charges can outweigh the tax benefits in the early years. Watch
this carefully, therefore; for small investors, basic rate taxpayer, unit
trusts, which do not normally impose any additional charges for Peps, may be
the best bet.
Bethan Hutton's piece below explains the various types of Peps on offer.
Since there are so many to choose from, the Weekend FT asked three financial
advisers to pick three Peps, one for income, one for capital growth, and one
for total return.
John Cole, group managing director of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble selects the
Fidelity High Income Pep for income. 'We prefer to keep the income
requirement in perspective and would encourage going for a reasonable yield
with insuring protection of capital,' he says. 'We favour the Fidelity Pep
after taking into account charges, yield and record. It has an estimated
yield of 5.9 per cent per annum which can be paid monthly. Up to half the
portfolio can be invested in fixed interest stocks to provide greater
security.'
'Although only launched in February, it has made an impressive start showing
a total return, including income and charges, of more than 11 per cent
during a six month period. The yield is not over-ambitious bearing in mind
the mix of investments and should avoid sacrificing capital growth.'
Even when investing for capital growth, Cole says there is little point in
going for a fund without a reasonable yield, because the main benefit of a
Pep is the income tax exemption. 'We feel smaller companies offer the most
attractive growth prospects at this stage but must be viewed as higher
risk.'
'We recommend the Amicable Smaller Enterprises Trust, an investment trust
managed by Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, which has an estimated
gross yield of 3.8 per cent and a discount to net asset value of 8 per cent.
It aims to provide growth of capital and income through UK smaller
companies, particularly the lowest 10 per cent by market capitalisation. The
fund is Pepable through a self-select plan, such as that offered by brokers
Allied Provincial. Although it is too early to speak of track record, the
managers have a tremendous pedigree and are investing in one of our favoured
sectors.'
'For total return, we would recommend the Perpetual High Income fund. Its
record is exceptional, with growth of 174.2 per cent since its launch in
1989, well ahead of the sector average. It has an estimated yield of 4.27
per cent. In looking at total return, we believe the great attraction of
Peps is income accumulation and this fund balances a good yield with capital
growth.'
Clive Scott-Hopkins, marketing director of Towry Law, says: 'For income, it
has to be Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial which, earlier this year, set up their
cleverly structured High Income Plan. This invests in FT-SE 100 shares and
high yielding debenture stock, with put and call option trading to give up
most of the potential growth for a higher immediate return.
'The fund is a case of 'jam today rather than cream tomorrow' with a current
income yield of 10 per cent, payable monthly. HF&amp;C uses hedging techniques
to guard against a severe market fall and we feel this fund is very suitable
for the retired investor who needs an immediate boost to spendable income.
'For growth, we favour Perpetual's Growth Fund which takes full advantage of
the Pep rules which allow up to 50 per cent to be invested outside the EC.
Currently, nearly 20 per cent is in the US and almost 25 per cent in the Far
East, including Japan. Since launch in September 1989, the fund has grown by
almost 125 per cent (offer-to-offer including reinvested income) and has
been a top quartile performer most of the time.
'With Perpetual's outstanding success in world markets, we believe it should
continue to achieve above average results (and this fund would lend itself
to monthly savings).
'For total return, we like Perpetual's Income fund, which we believe has the
right balance for growth of both capital and income. The yield is 4 per cent
and it is almost entirely invested in UK equities.
'Since launch in February 1988, it has achieved over 150 per cent growth
(offer-to-offer including reinvested income) and is first in the income
sector. With Perpetual's known skills at stock selection, we believe it
should continue to achieve an above average overall return.'
Graham Spinks of Murray Noble says: 'Our view is that clients would be
better off investing in a self-select Pep rather than the ready made plans,
since charges can be lower (if commission is rebated) and the client has
control over asset allocation.'
Spinks favours self-select plans from broker Charles Stanley, with an annual
0.75 per cent charge and an initial charge of Pounds 29, or from Pilling,
which has no initial or annual charge, but levies Pounds 6.75 per dividend
payment.
For income Spinks says: 'Half the Pep should be invested in the high
yielding shares of a split capital investment trust, such as River &amp;
Mercantile or New Throgmorton, which can yield around 9 per cent. Further,
we would suggest that clients use the non-qualifying element of a Pep
(Pounds 1,500) by investing in an international fixed interest unit trust,
such as Commercial Union's Global Bond Fund. The latter may also produce
capital gains for the investor, given international reductions in interest
rates. The final quarter of the Pep would be invested in high yielding
utility stock, such as British Gas.'
For capital growth, Spinks says: 'We are keen to stress the need to have
exposure to emerging markets because of the tremendous growth prospects that
these areas of the world offer. These can be incorporated within the Pounds
1,500 non-qualifying limit; we would opt for a trust such as Templeton. To
balance the volatility of emerging markets, we would recommend zero coupon
preference shares of investment trusts, such as St David's. These are
slightly more risky than gilts and typically yield just under 8 per cent.
'We feel that such an arrangement, perhaps with the inclusion of a smaller
companies fund such as TR Smaller Companies IT, will serve investors better
than the typical Pep allocation of 60 per cent UK equities. We believe the
latter is unsound, given the political uncertainty and structural weakness
attaching to the UK market.'
For total return, Spinks again suggest incorporating a combination of
emerging markets and zeros for capital growth. 'The income portion of the
Pep would then be the high yielding income shares of a split capital
investment trust.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (2): Foreigners sniff the
bargains - Gerald Cadogan considers what's on offer in the capital and the
market's state / London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING LED the property revival since last autumn, London is still pulling
ahead of the country market. Both markets suffer from a lack of good
properties to sell and eager buyers becoming frustrated at the lack of
choice. Will this imbalance of demand and supply in London translate into
higher prices?
Yes, it is already doing so, but slowly. It is a long haul before they match
1989 levels. Last year when prices had fallen to mid-1980s levels, the
devaluation of the pound brought foreign buyers. Britain's political
stability, lower inflation rate and the likelihood of being first out of the
recession were extra inducements, besides the perennial pleasure of having a
London base.
Buying has continued busily this year. 'Prices have hardened, with sale
prices closer to asking prices,' says Noel Flint, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's
Knightsbridge office. Yolande Barnes, head of Residential Research at
Savills, puts the rise at 2.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1993, and at
4.4 per cent over January-June.
She sticks to her December 1992 prediction that the rise for prime flats and
houses in central London will reach 10 to 15 per cent by June next year. She
expects an increase of 12 per cent or more during 1994 as a whole, to bring
prices back to spring 1988 levels in nominal terms. This bullish forecast
carries a caution. The economy must carry on improving without 'major
political setbacks.' And in 1995 it will need another 12 per cent growth to
bring prices back to the 1989 plateau.
David Forbes, of agent Chesterfield, is worried that with the shortage of
stock agents will compete for instructions by suggesting higher asking
prices. This would raise the hopes of would-be vendors but would not attract
buyers. 'Vendors could flood the market with over-priced houses and we could
see a return to an inflated market which could simply stall,' he says.
The proportion of foreign buyers in central London has risen from 28 per
cent in 1992 to 32 per cent this year, Savills estimates, increasing to 46
per cent in Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Chelsea and Kensington. Many
are buying for their own use.
Other overseas investors are buying a return of 8 to 10 per cent from
letting, which is more than twice the yield on shares and a percentage point
or two above that of long-dated gilts, says William Gething, of buying agent
Property Vision. These yields will drop as rents will probably remain static
when buying prices move upwards once owners decide to release properties.
The desire to buy has now spread out from the centre.
Battersea, Fulham and Clapham reported good business in the spring. But
again it is the familiar story of not enough stock. Vendors worried that
spring 1993 might fizzle out, like spring last year, helped to ensure that
it did. Those who were waiting for the apparent security of higher prices,
were overlooking the fact that the market is wholly relative. Sell for more,
buy for more. You must live somewhere. When prices go up, the first to
benefit is the Treasury through stamp duty and inheritance tax.
As another boost to UK economic recovery, big foreign companies are bringing
more staff to London, helping both buying and rental sectors. Agent Lassmans
finds that many prefer to buy on behalf of their staff if they are working
in London for a long time. If, eventually, there is no need for the house,
it becomes part of company assets and can be let. For Britons posted to
London, borrowing is cheap - and may become cheaper - and capital growth is
likely in a non-inflationary climate.
If vendors agree a good price, the surveyor or mortgage provider's valuer
may declare it not worth that much or point to its bulges and cracks as
possible signs of subsidence (covering against later claims of negligence).
Then the buyer may try to renegotiate.
The vendor may refuse but then he has the hassle of finding another buyer,
while a foreign potential buyer may lose confidence and withdraw altogether.
This is a real risk when, as Flint pointed out, the discrepancy on the best
properties may be Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 200,000.
Two seriously expensive houses still wait for the right buyer, 9 Tregunter
Road, SW10, with a guide price of Pounds 9m freehold, and Halkin Gate House,
off Belgrave Square, SW1 on a long lease, with high ground rent, is Pounds
5.75m. De Groot Collis is agent. Two other premier league properties offer
plush penthouses and flats: the new conversion of 130 Park Lane, W1 on the
corner with Green Street (from De Groot Collis or Wetherell) and 3a Palace
Green in Kensington Palace Gardens, W8 (from Hamptons or Savills).
An unusual Art Deco house, within walking distance of Lord's cricket ground,
is 58 Hamilton Terrace, NW8. Designed by Francis Lorne in 1934, it deserves
to be listed. It visibly pays respect to its early Victorian neighbours.
Behind is a long garden with swimming pool. Lassmans is selling the 58-year
lease for Pounds 1.75m. The freeholder is the John Lyon Road Trust which
continues to carry out the wishes of Lyon, founder of Harrow School in 1571,
to keep the road from Harrow to London in good repair.
On the better known Eyre estate, in St John's Wood, 30 Marlborough Place,
NW8, is an early Victorian six-bedroomed 'cottage', which Lassmans offers on
a 43-year lease for Pounds 1.15m. It too has a good garden. A more imposing
house is no 28 in Nash's Chester Terrace, NW1, on the east side of Regents
Park. It is on sale for Pounds 1.395m from the same agent or Aldine Honey.
In Lowndes Place, SW1, there is a villa on offer for Pounds 1.85m from
Francis Russell or Aylesford (52 years: the ground rent, already Pounds
1550, is to be reviewed in 2001).
Lord Kitchener, the soldier and war minister, lived in 44 Phillimore
Gardens, W8, a solid house with a garden, which John D. Wood offers for
Pounds 2.45m. The agent also offers, new on the market, a maisonette with
palm trees in the garden at 49 Holland Park, W11, for Pounds 875,000. This
freehold property gives the buyer the right to Pounds 600 of ground rent
from the other occupants who will become his/her tenants.
Some good Georgian brick houses: 21 St Leonards Terrace, SW3 (Egerton or
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, Pounds 975,000), 20 Fournier Street, E1
(Jackson-Stops, over Pounds 280,000), 5 Highbury Terrace, N5 (Wood at
Regents Park, Pounds 695,000) and 29 Percy Street, W1 (William H. Brown,
Pounds 700,000).
And, to end with a splash, The Chantry, a grand 1920s Tudoresque house on
Ellerton Road in Wimbledon, SW20, which includes a Japanese-style water
garden in the grounds; Pounds 2.9m from Wood, in Wimbledon.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Markets: Traders enjoy a storm in a tea cup - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the White House is surrounded by angry crowds denouncing the country's
political leadership and urging military intervention to oust the President,
and the vice-President has rushed to claim supreme state authority, it is
not surprising that Wall Street panics.
Sounds like the plot for Tom Clancy's latest book? Not so fast. This
actually happened this week. On Tuesday, share prices plunged as the first
reports came in of the turmoil engulfing the White House. At one point
mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down almost 70 points,
and the 'circuit breakers' on the New York Stock Exchange were triggered in
an attempt to halt the slide. Although prices eventually recovered to end
the day down only 38 points, the stock markets had received a nasty jolt.
The jolt would have been much nastier, of course, if the White House at the
centre of the political crisis had been the one at the end of Pennsylvania
Avenue, and the president facing hostile crowds and a possible coup had been
a former governor of Arkansas with a weakness for Big Macs.
No, But this was the other White House, the one 4,683 miles away, also known
as the Russian parliament in Moscow. And it was the other president, the one
with a weakness for dissolving parliaments and fighting political crises.
Wednesday's front page news told the full story: of how Boris Yeltsin shut
down parliament and called new elections for December; of how opponents
denounced his actions as a state-sanctioned coup d'etat, and claimed
political power for themselves; and of how stock market investors in the US,
fearing a civil war, or the very least an end to liberalisation in Russia,
started selling shares in a frenzied hurry.
There was nothing unusual in that. There is a long history of stock market
panics prompted by dramatic news events from abroad: the Saudi Arabian oil
embargo of October 1973; the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990; the
coup attempt against former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in August
1991.
Yet, explaining why investors rush for the exits at the first word of
turmoil overseas is not always easy. The Saudi oil embargo and the Kuwait
invasion shocked the markets for a good reason - they feared (as it turned
out, correctly in 1973) that the events would trigger a sharp rise in oil
prices and a worldwide economic recession. The attempted coup against
Gorbachev was also an earth-shaker - the return of hardline communists and a
revival in the cold war was a distinct possibility if the military had taken
power that summer.
This week's reaction from Wall Street, however, is harder to fathom. It is
not as if the events in Russia on Tuesday plunged the country from order
into chaos. Russian political life has been pretty chaotic for some time,
and it could be argued that Yetsin's bold move in calling for elections to a
new assembly will, if it works (a big if), help restore order in Russia.
Anyone selling stocks on Tuesday, however, obviously felt that Yeltsin's
gamble was not going to pay off. Yet even if Yeltsin was ousted, it is not
likely that the events that followed have had much of an impact outside of
Russia.
The UK broking house James Capel probably got it right this week when it
rushed out a quick analysis of the crisis entitled: 'The Russian Situation -
A Storm in a Tea Cup?'
Capel argued that the problems in Russia were internal to that country, and
that the fallout for the rest of the world would probably be limited.
Assuming civil war was not going to break out as a result of Yeltsin's
actions, even the bleakest scenario - the old communists take control of
government via parliament and slow future economic and political reforms -
should not have unduly worried US investors, said Capel. The pace and extent
of Russian political and economic reform for years has been patchy at best,
and markets have long since discounted this fact.
So why did the markets panic on Tuesday afternoon? The answer is quite
simple. The turmoil in Russia was an excuse, not a reason, for traders and
investors to sell stocks. Under cover of a 'grave' world crisis, they were
able to take a few of the profits they earned during this summer's strong
rally.
If the Russian-inspired sell-off is added to the losses of the days before
the crisis and after it, the Dow has fallen almost exactly 100 points, or
2.7 per cent, over the past week. By allowing investors to let off steam
from an overheated market, Yeltsin may have done Wall Street a favour.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Markets: Hays delivers the goods - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market value of Hays, the business services group, has recently climbed
through the Pounds 1bn barrier - not bad for a company which was floated
with a capitalisation of Pounds 393m in late 1989, just before the UK
economy moved into recession.
Investors have become very disenchanted with groups such as BET, which
boasted that business services were 'recession-resistant' - only for their
results to collapse when the economy really did turn down.
However, Hays has substantially outperformed the market, as the chart shows.
One reason is that it is among the small group of companies which provide
contract distribution, through dedicated warehouses and transport fleets, to
leading retailers such as Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer.
Ronnie Frost, Hays' forceful executive chairman, argues that recession can
help even his group, as it forces companies to put out to contract
activities which they were content to do themselves when profits were not
under threat.
Frost says this happened in the UK and has also been demonstrated recently
in France, where Hays last year bought Fril, a national distributor for
Pounds 37.5m. He believes the same process will occur in Germany as
recession bites, hence the group's acquisition in July of Mordhorst, a
Kiel-based national distributor, for an initial Pounds 32m.
Not all of Hays' activities have responded so well to recession. Operating
profits from the personnel business, which specialises in recruiting
accountancy staff, plunged from Pounds 19m in 1990 to a mere Pounds 4.8m two
years later.
News that personnel's operating profits had improved by 40 per cent to
Pounds 6.7m in the year to June 30 was one factor behind the enthusiastic
reception given to the group's annual results this week. Having slashed
employee numbers in personnel from 1,500 to 850 by the end of last year,
Frost says 75 per cent of any increase in turnover will drop straight
through to the profits line.
Analysts also admire niche businesses such as Britdoc, the group's overnight
letters business, which won many new customers, including four clearing
banks, during the year to June. Britdoc charges 66 per cent of the
first-class letter rate, so automatically benefits from any Post Office
increase.
Hays might suffer if the arrival of discount retailers in the UK leads to a
price war that undermines the high profit margins enjoyed by UK food
retailers, which have long been the envy of their European counterparts. The
group would initially benefit from any increase in volumes caused by a price
war, but would seem likely to suffer in the longer term if a less profitable
environment causes retailers to re-examine their costs.
Hays has already started to seek more industrial distribution contracts, but
believes that its recent acquisitions will allow it to offer pan-European
distribution facilities to customers such as Seagrams, the Canadian drinks
group, and Moet Hennessy, LVMH's champagne and brandy business.
Hays does have cyclical businesses within the group. The distribution of
bulk chemicals has suffered from a drop in margins which will only recover
when the UK climbs out of recession - a process which Frost this week warned
'looks as if it will be long and slow.'
Frost talks with evangelistic zeal about the group's businesses and his
downbeat view of the UK recovery seemed to be aimed at forestalling previous
criticism by analysts that Hays has been guilty in the past of not quite
delivering on expectations it raised.
It should be said that the same analysts give Frost credit for having
established a strong management team, and were impressed by his view that
Hays was capable of doubling the size of its business over the next few
years.
Given the company's track record, it is no surprise that Hays shares are
currently trading on a 20 per cent premium to the market. That rating limits
the scope for short-term advance, but the shares do not look expensive on a
long-term view, given the quality of the businesses and the potential of its
pan-European distribution strategy.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Abbey's new fixed mortgages - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National is launching a new range of fixed rate mortgages from Monday.
Existing homeowners can choose from 7.4 per cent (APR 7.8 per cent) until

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Fund payouts slip - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCOME Fund Analysis, which monitors the payouts of income unit trusts, has
found that more than half of the funds covered paid lower distributions in
the third quarter. Out of the 65 fund analysed, 34 made cuts, 10 kept
payouts unchanged and 18 increased distributions (the remaining three
switched to quarterly payments). Barclays Unicorn Income has managed to
maintain its record of increasing its payout every year since 1981.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Building society outflow worsens -
At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies suffered their worst outflow of funds this year, when
Pounds 132m was withdrawn in August following smaller net outflows in the
previous two months. There was a Pounds 61m outflow in July and a Pounds 56m
outflow in June. Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies
Association, said the recent outflows of Pounds 249m needed to be balanced
against a Pounds 2.5bn inflow in the first half. He said that people were
withdrawing money to invest in equities, buy cars and fund the BT3 share
offer.
On the mortgage side, net new commitments of Pounds 2.43bn were the lowest
since January. Coles said: 'There are growing signs that house prices have
stabilised. This should help to underpin a recovery in activity over the
coming months, albeit from low levels.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Markets: An offshore fund without charges - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGULAR Weekend FT readers will know how much we welcome any efforts to
bring down the cost of financial services products for investors. So it is
good to see Charles Schwab, the US discount broker, launching a service for
investors in offshore funds.
The International FundSource service is modelled on the Mutual Fund
OneSource sold by Schwab in the US. The idea is that funds are sold without
any initial charge, or 'front end load' as it is known in the US. Since that
initial charge is often around 5-6 per cent, that can represent substantial
savings.
Of course, over the long run, a good investment manager can easily overcome
the effect of an initial charge. The problem is that the investor does not
know in advance who the good fund managers of the next few years will be;
you do know what the charges are. Investing in a no-load fund, as they are
called, gives you a 5-6 per cent head start.
At the moment, however, the Schwab deal is rather restricted. For a start,
some of the funds on offer - the currency funds from Guinness Flight and
Rothschild Asset Management - already have no initial charge. Furthermore,
there is only a restricted choice of fund managers: Guinness Flight for
bonds, equities and currencies; Wright Investor Services for equities; and
Rothschilds for currencies.
Furthermore, all the funds on offer are offshore; the British investor will
be unable to buy, say, M &amp; G Dividend via the no-load route. Since Schwab is
promoting the service across Europe, using offshore funds avoids regulatory
problems.
Still, everyone has to start somewhere. In the US, the same service offers
200 no-load funds from 25 fund management groups. And the European service
does at least offer a wide range of funds, from Australasian equities to yen
bonds. All the funds are recognised by the Securities and Investments Board,
the UK's chief regulator.
Schwab will also send investors summarised statements of their portfolios
and orders can be made through a 24 hour telephone service.
Are there any catches? Schwab makes its money by taking a fee from the fund
manager, which it says is around 0.3 per cent. It adds that the manager pays
the fee out of its own annual management charge, so there is no additional
cost to the investor. The manager benefits because of the extra volumes of
funds under management which Schwab will generate.
The service is dollar-denominated, so sterling-based investors will have a
currency risk, and a conversion cost, which Schwab says will be around 0.2
to 0.3 per cent.
To benefit from the service, investors must open a Schwab dollar account and
the minimum investment into any of the funds is Dollars 2,000. (Some of the
funds on offer normally have much higher minimums.) There are toll-free
numbers for anyone interested in details - 0800-526027 in the UK,
0130-817465 for Germany and 0590-8103 for France. US residents cannot use
the service.
Schwab is not a well known name in Europe and it is hard to see this service
revolutionising the market. Still, it is good to see further competition in
the field and someone who was already considering investment in, say, a
Guinness Flight bond fund, might find the Schwab approach worthwhile.
*****
Those who follow our weekly table of directors' dealing in their companies'
shares, might be intrigued by the new Pointon BRI Directors Dealings Unit
Trust. The trust will use the pattern of transactions by directors to
determine its investments.
The obvious rationale for following directors' dealings is that they must
know something the rest of us do not. But this is a fine line. They are not
supposed to be insider dealers, buying shares in advance of a takeover
approach. There is a 'close' period before the publication of results,
during which directors cannot deal.
So it is more of a question of directors acting on a gut feeling, based on
their general knowledge of the company, than on specific information. Nor is
it wise to assume that directors' instincts are infallible.
Back in 1991, after one year of publishing the directors' dealing table, I
conducted an exercise to see how investors would have done if they had acted
on the basis of that first table. The results were not encouraging.
Investors would have done better to buy shares in companies where directors
had sold holdings, than to buy where they had made purchases.
Nevertheless, there have been obvious cases where a pattern of directors'
sales have been followed by a share price slump and similarly, if directors
are consistently buying shares, that ought to give investors some
confidence.
The new trust will be managed by BRI, a rival service to Directus, which
produces our table. It says there will be no 'blind following of directors
transactions'. It will assess the financial and marketing strengths of
companies and look at details, such as whether more than one director has
been dealing, the track record of the purchaser and the scale of the deals
in relation to existing holdings.
The initial charge will be 5.5 per cent and the annual charge 1.5 per cent.
The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Markets: A trolley-full of worries for supermarkets - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE MAY soon learn the answer to one of the stock market's most intriguing
questions: was the 1980s success of the three big UK supermarket chains the
result of outstanding management or dumb luck?
Success there certainly was: the collective market capitalisation of
Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll rose from around Pounds 2bn in 1983 to over
Pounds 17bn earlier this year. There was good management, too: the three
chains are world leaders in developing own-brand goods, they enjoy margins
that are the envy of overseas rivals, and they have transformed UK shopping.
But are those margins, and that leap in market capitalisation, due solely to
management skill, or did luck and British planning restrictions play a
decisive role?
The question was given fresh pertinence this week by the 5 per cent drop in
the shares of Tesco, the industry's number two. On Tuesday, the company
announced disappointing interim profits, a rise of only 3.4 per cent though
turnover rose 9.5 per cent. More important, it finally admitted that the new
wave of discount stores were enough of a threat to warrant a fierce
competitive response.
As the chart shows, the glamour of the supermarkets has been fading for much
of the year; for Tesco it became tarnished more than 12 months ago. The
scale of the market's worries can best be judged, however, by looking at
Sainsbury, by any reckoning one of the great British growth companies of
recent decades.
This year, Sainsbury shares have been selling at a sustained discount to the
market as a whole for the first time in recent memory. Throughout the last
two decades, Sainsbury has almost always sold at a price / earnings ratio
well above the market average, often double it. You can now buy Sainsbury
shares for 14 1/2 times current earnings, when the figure for the market as
a whole is 19 1/2 . (Tesco's p/e ratio is 9, less than half that of the
market.)
The yield figures tell a similar story. At the turn of the year, Sainsbury
was selling at a yield of less than half the market average. Now, it is
yielding 3.0 per cent, at a time when the market yield is 3.8 per cent, a
difference of only a quarter. The gap has been closing inexorably. For
Tesco, it has closed already: its shares are yielding 4.6 per cent, a fifth
higher than the market as a whole.
One way of looking at the change in sentiment is to examine the real cause
of the chains' remarkable profitability in the 1980s. Part of it, no doubt,
was due to innovation and good logistics management. But part of it was due
to the nature of the British food retailing market: a semi-cartel enforced
by the planning authorities.
Planning regulations made suitable sites for huge modern supermarkets very
hard to come by. Only the big groups had the expertise in coping with the
regulations and - more important - the deep pockets necessary to pay the
high prices that tight planning restrictions ensured for the few available
sites.
The big chains raised ever larger lumps of capital to buy their way to an
ever larger market share. Some of their managers, at least, put pressure on
suppliers to restrict shipments to rivals who wished to compete on price.
Instead, the big three chose to compete on innovation, location and
ambience, a recipe for a stable and profitable industry. The two
next-biggest chains, Asda and Gateway, were slipping behind in the capital
spending race, so the big three could continue to achieve steady growth,
even though total food sales were essentially static.
In the last few years, almost all those trends have started to move into
reverse. The arrival of European discounters like Netto and Aldi raises the
spectre of sustained competition on price from companies that are not likely
to be intimidated by suppliers' pressure. US 'warehouse clubs' such as
Costco threaten to make the supermarket chains' mastery of the site
acquisition irrelevant, since if classified as wholesalers rather than
retailers they are not subject to such tight planning restrictions. Asda and
Gateway, back from the dead, are no longer easy targets. Customers' value
perceptions have been changed by the recession. And the property slump has
put a question mark over the price at which supermarket sites are carried in
the chains' books. In short, once an industry's luck turns, even the
best-managed companies suffer the consequences.
The market as a whole managed, however, to shrug off worries about food
retailing with as much aplomb as it ignored the excitements in Moscow. The
FT-SE 100 index stayed healthily above 3,000, with traders taking comfort
from revised economic figures that showed much stronger growth in gnp and
corporate profits in the first half of the year than earlier estimates had
suggested. Another statistical source of cheerfulness was the revelation,
from the figures on institutional liquidity, of just how much money UK fund
managers had been pumping into domestic equities and gilts. In the first
half of the year, UK institutions made Pounds 24bn in net new investment,
almost half as much again as in the same period in 1992.
The consensus still seemed to be that the tone of companies' comments during
the interim results season had been disappointing. The steady flow of
medium-sized rights issues has continued - on Tuesday, for instance, Tarmac
asked its shareholders for Pounds 215m. But for at least one big broker,
James Capel, the results have been coming in slightly ahead of expectations,
the first time that has happened since the recession began. And one top
investment manager complained this week that the results season had been
disappointing largely because it had not produced the drop in share prices
that would have provided him with an opportunity for bargain-hunting.

FT  25 SEP 93 / The Long View: Troubled by bubbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE'S a number to jolt every saver and every marketing manager of a retail
deposit-taking institution: 1 3/4 per cent. It happens to be the new
official discount rate set by the Bank of Japan last Tuesday, but might it
also be the kind of pensioner-panicking short-term interest rate ruling in
other important countries in the next year or two?
Figures this week from two of Britain's leading savings sectors show that
the wind continues to blow powerfully in favour of longer-term institutions.
Unit trusts pulled in a net Pounds 980m of funds in August, taking the
aggregate above Pounds 6bn after eight months of 1993. But the poor old
building societies lost Pounds 132m from savings accounts in August, as
investors drifted away from what they see as stingy interest rates; the
societies have added only Pounds 2.4bn so far this year (although this
ignores another Pounds 5bn of accrued interest added to accounts).
The banks have been able to exploit the malaise of the building societies by
issuing bonds and gathering medium-term wholesale deposits, while eagerly
promoting fixed rate mortgages. Abbey National, the bank that dares not
speak its classification, has pushed its share of the mortgage market up to
23 per cent while mighty Halifax has been squeezed down to 15 per cent where
it is waiting grumpily for the wind to back into a more favourable
direction.
But will that happen soon? The freespending British government is happy to
swim with the tide. This week the IMF ticked the UK off for running too big
a public sector deficit, but the government shrugged and announced another
Pounds 3.25bn gilt-edged issue for next Wednesday.
At the beginning of 1993 it looked as though there might be problems in
financing a borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn-odd. I did not share those
fears, at least for the current year, but against the fortuitous background
of a global bull market in bonds it is proving even more of a doddle than I
expected. Very low short-term rates in the two biggest investment markets,
the US and Japan, are fundamental to keeping this bull market going. The
UK's own short-term rates are still relatively high, against this
background, at 6 per cent and if the building societies are under
competitive pressure now they must be prepared for something even worse.
In the first half of 1993 British investment institutions, especially the
life assurance companies, pumped almost Pounds 9bn into gilts, and
foreigners put in nearly Pounds 7bn. For the first time in years the life
companies and unit trusts are selling large volumes of income products based
on investment in bonds. The shift from short-term to long-term markets is
also evident on the borrowing side, where British companies are financing
themselves through the stock and bond markets and shunning the banks. In the
late 1980s industrial and commercial companies were increasing their
indebtedness to banks at anything up to Pounds 34bn a year, but in the first
half of 1993 they repaid Pounds 7bn of bank loans while obtaining Pounds
18bn of finance from other sources.
These changes should not be seen as a temporary or cyclical adjustment but
as part of a permanent return to normality. There was a grotesque growth of
short-term institutions in the 1970s and 1980s, when, over 20 years,
building society deposits (including Abbey National) grew nearly fourfold in
real terms. Historically, those must be viewed as freak conditions. This is
not to say that short-term interest rates will never rise again, but in the
very long run they have tended to fall within a range of 2 to 7 per cent and
that should again be a reasonable expectation.
If savers are already responding vigorously to the downwards shift in
short-term interest rates, the attitude of borrowers is more mixed. Big,
creditworthy companies are refinancing themselves, but other kinds of
debtors are not so well placed. Many are still overborrowed (the ratio of
personal sector debt to income is still only slightly lower than at the
peak) and business confidence remains muted.
The big danger of sharp cuts in interest rates is that financial bubbles may
be created. In a recession bank credit flows initially not into productive
industry and services (where there is excess capacity) but into various
kinds of financial assets. This is a big concern in the US and Japan, and
would be in the UK too if interest rates were to fall to 3 or 4 per cent.
At low interest rates the cost of financing speculative positions can be
trivial in relation to the expected capital gains. We glimpsed the
disruptive power of speculative flows in this year's mini-bubble in the gold
bullion market. But that episode also taught a lesson in risk awareness, the
natural restraining factor in speculative markets.
Some argue that a bubble has developed in the US Treasury bond market, and
it is hard to see how all the short-term positions propping up that market
can be unwound without some kind of uncomfortable hiatus. In Japan the
authorities half-deflated the bubbles in real estate and the stock market
but do not want to finish the job because the banking system would disappear
as the bubbles finally popped.
In the UK the main risk is of a sudden resurgence in the housing market.
Millions of home owners would love a re-run of past inflationary house price
booms, if only to rescue themselves from the consequences of the collapse of
the last one. Many lenders appear to be almost as irresponsible as ever, and
too many newspapers are ever-eager to pump up a new house price bubble. I do
not think it will happen, but at some stage, long before interest rates get
to 1 3/4 per cent, the government may need to dismantle the remaining tax
incentives for home owners.
That could be counted on to drive a good many more than four Tory
backbenchers barmy.
Barry Riley has started a new column in Wednesday's Financial Times on
worldwide investment themes and strategies.

FT  25 SEP 93 / The men of violins fight for the loot: The future of
London's orchestras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY DOES London need more symphony orchestras than New York, Paris,
Amsterdam, Berlin and Vienna? It is a question that has haunted London's
musical world for decades, not least at the deliberations of the Arts
Council which has been forced to stretch its subsidy around the London
Philharmonic, the London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic and the
Philharmonia orchestras.
The Council has tried threats, and bribes, and rumours in an effort to shift
an orchestra out of London - or off its client list. It has gathered up all
its nerve - and asked a High Court judge to do the deed on its behalf.
Just before Christmas Mr Justice Hoffmann will announce that the committee
he is chairing has selected two of the four orchestras for Arts Council
funding. One orchestra, the London Symphony, which is resident at the
Barbican Centre, has already been shooed into the winners' enclosure. The
other three are competing for second place. The aim is to build a generously
funded super-orchestra which, with the London Symphony, will be able to
match the best that Vienna or Berlin can field. The two losers will be
thrown to the market place.
This is the dispiriting background against which the conductors of the
orchestras picked up their batons this week at the start of the 1993-94
season, a season which threatens sudden relegation for two of them. What
upsets the congenitally highly strung musicians is that the orchestras are
hardly competing on a level playing field.
No one objects to the privileges of the LSO. The orchestra has picked itself
up from near oblivion and made a success of its status at the Barbican. It
is financially sound, with the City of London matching pound for pound the
Pounds 1.2m it receives from the Arts Council. It played to audiences of
almost 90 per cent capacity in the Barbican last season and can enjoy a
ringside view as its rivals slug it out.
And the orchestras are rivals. The days when a second violinist might find
himself, or herself, playing for the Royal Philharmonic one night and the
Philharmonia the next, are over. The orchestras have developed into
exclusive, self-governing, democracies jealous of their privileges and quite
ready to rebel against imperious chief executives or insensitive conductors.
This is what makes the Arts Council's preferred solution to the contest less
and less likely. The Council loves the idea of a merger between the London
Philharmonic and the Philharmonia, or, rather, since a merger among such
quarrelsome musicians is unrealistic, it would like the London Philharmonic
to absorb the Philharmonia. With its enlarged grant the new orchestra could
expand from 80 to 120, finding jobs for at least half the Philharmonia's
musicians.
But neither orchestra favours this solution and tentative talks have
foundered. A year ago the London Philharmonic took up a five year residency
as the house orchestra at the South Bank. To ease its progress the Arts
Council more than doubled its grant to an impressive Pounds 1.12m. this
year. The London Philharmonic is the hot favourite to scoop the pool. Having
booked conductors and soloists for a South Bank concert programme stretching
well into 1996 it is in a strong position to sue the Council if Hoffmann
decided to take away its funding. It is in no mood to compromise with the
Philharmonia.
But if Judge Hoffmann is as independent as his reputation it is just
possible that the London Philharmonic could be in for a shock. By an ironic
twist the much sought residency at the South Bank has unleashed a string of
setbacks. It suddenly lost its chief executive John Willan; its new
principal conductor Franz Welser-Most has come in for criticism and failed,
through illness, to conduct the London Philharmonic at Thursday's opening
Festival Hall concert; the residency has caused severe financial problems,
in spite of its success in keeping audiences last season above 80 per cent.
Even its appointment this week of Sir Harrison Birtwistle as its conductor
in residence at the South Bank could look like an attempt to sway Hoffmann.
If the London Philharmonic does not get the Arts Council's money its future
is immediately threatened.
The faltering at the London Philharmonic is encouraging for the
Philharmonia, which is reserve resident orchestra on the South Bank with 40
odd concerts a year against the 50-plus played by the London Philharmonic.
In spite of a seasonal residency in Paris the Philharmonia would find it
difficult to survive without its Pounds 710,000 subsidy, but it is
financially sound for now and has few enemies in the musical world.
The fact that the Royal Philharmonic has even entered the contest reveals
the changes in its approach since Paul Findlay joined as managing director
from the Royal Opera House. The Royal Philharmonic has been out of favour
with the Arts Council for years. Its subsidy has been reduced to Pounds
400,000 a year, a mere 7 per cent of its revenue. In retaliation the Royal
Philharmonic embraced the joys of the market, playing concerts of popular
classics, touring assiduously and pretending that there was life after
subsidy. All that has changed under Findlay. There is less sponsorship money
around; less funding for touring. He is trying to revive the Royal
Philharmonic's noble tradition as the orchestra of Sir Thomas Beecham,
playing British music with British musicians. The Royal Philharmonic will
lose its Arts Council money but carry on regardless.
Hoffmann has been asked to ignore politics and personalities and assess the
artistic potential of the orchestras. This side of the question looks like a
photo-finish, but taking a snapshot of which orchestra is playing the best,
has the most exciting programmes, the most prestigious conductors, is hardly
a fair way to proceed.
Orchestras go up and down. The four London orchestras have snapped at each
others' heels for the past 20 or 30 years. If this decision had been taken
10 years ago, few would have picked the London Symphony Orchestra as an
automatic winner. The move to the Barbican had proved unpopular with
audiences and musical standards were variable (the LSO was seen as the
bruiser among London orchestras, always happy to play loud and fast). Now,
after a series of successful festivals devoted to Britten, Stravinsky and
others, it has won a reputation for being adventurous, the only British
orchestra of unquestioned international status.
Two years ago the London Philharmonic could claim to be its equal - but now?
How quickly the tune changes. Almost from the moment the orchestra won its
residency on the South Bank it has careered downhill. The public perception
that the LSO has won the initiative rankles at London Philharmonic
headquarters. By parading an array of the world's top conductors in London
(an expensive policy) the administration believed that they occupied the
high ground, while pointing out that they have to draw 2,900 to the Royal
Festival Hall against 2,000 at the Barbican.
Unfortunately, pampered modern maestros only want to tour the world with
their favourite symphonies. The conductors' roster for the London
Philharmonic's autumn season shows what happens when money is short and
out-of-the-way music is added to the schedules. This looks like a sinking
ship and there is every sign the orchestra knows it. Just this week it
announced that it is taking on Birtwistle and Roger Norrington - two
highly-regarded musicians who can hoist the flag for innovation - to bolster
its case.
Nothing symbolises more potently the London Philharmonic's malaise than the
failure to sell its Music Director, Franz Welser-Most, as the dashing young
counterpart to Simon Rattle. It did nothing for the orchestra's image when
word leaked out that some of the players refer to him as 'Frankly
Worse-than-Most'. Morale has slumped. Key players have their bags packed.
The orchestra looks shipwrecked, but at least it has one lifeboat to cling
to: it still plays well.
That is the problem with the Philharmonia. It is so easy to make comparisons
between the London orchestras. Within months of the Philharmonia assaulting
music-lovers' sensibilities with its strained strings and ear-splitting
brass in Mahler's massive Eighth Symphony under Giuseppe Sinopoli at the
Royal Festival Hall, the London Philharmonic and Klaus Tennstedt turned up
in the same piece and gave a grand and glorious performance. No comparison
at all.
Sensing which way the race was likely to go, the Philharmonia has not sat
back. It has lured conductors such as James Levine and Christoph von
Dohnanyi to London. It has forged a relationship with Boulez's Ensemble
InterContemporain for 20th-century music. It has gone out to win a residency
at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, no doubt to pique the opposition back
home.
To those who complain that Sinopoli's long tenure as Music Director has seen
standards eroded, we now have the Philharmonia's answer. Sinopoli will not
be renewing his contract when it expires in 1995. The orchestra knows who it
wants to replace him, but is not expected to make an announcement before the
day of judgment. (Which conductor would want to find his opening concert
featuring the orchestra's funeral march?)
Pity the poor Royal Philharmonic. Nobody even seems to discuss what would
happen if it wins the race. For many serious concert goers the Royal
Philharmonic's annual programme sits on the shelf gathering dust and that,
in essence, has been the orchestra's life story. Under Principal Conductors
such as Walter Weller and Andre Previn, it marked time, filling its diary
with revenue-earning business, recordings of film soundtracks or pops
concerts.
Regrettably, this has obscured one important point: the orchestra has kept
up a remarkably high standard of performance and has a rich blend of sound
all its own. To come upon the Royal Philharmonic unexpectedly, on one of
those evenings when it has been hired by an outside organisation such as the
Bach Choir, is to be struck afresh by the quality of its playing. Since
Vladimir Ashkenazy took over as Music Director, its programmes have become
more dynamic, but probably too late. Orchestra standards may vary almost
monthly, but a reputation takes years to change.
All three of these orchestras have put their bids forward, which suggests
that they are resigned to nobody asking the obvious question. Is it in the
country's interest, let alone that of the orchestras, for one or two of them
to face extinction? It is instructive to look across the Channel. In 1967
France under Pompidou decided that Paris needed an international orchestra.
In true French style the government mobilised musicians, finance, conductors
(including Karajan and Solti) on a grand scale. But the Orchestre de Paris
has been a flop from the start.
Extraordinary, really, that a British Conservative Government should be
heading down the same road. For years four more-or-less privatised
orchestras have survived - some might say thrived - through cut-throat
competition. Now there is to be less competition, less choice, fewer
concerts. All the taxpayers' money is to go to the lucky two.
Of course there could still be a last minute reprieve. In the summer the
Arts Council announced that it was axing the grants of half a dozen popular
regional theatres, such as the Bristol Old Vic and the Theatre Royal,
Plymouth. There was an outcry and this week the theatres were reprieved. The
Council's music panel could over-ride Hoffman's decision and the full
Council could in its turn over-ride the music panel. Hoffmann could decide
the case on the basis of the plans submitted by the three orchestras and
ignore the London Philharmonic's South Bank residency, or the recent
travails of the Royal Philharmonic.
Or he could ignore his brief and decide that the South Bank needs its two
orchestras, and suggest that they stay independent but work more closely
together on programming, marketing, etc. Alternatively the whole issue could
hang fire until the Council carries out its planned investigation, with the
BBC, into the nation's regional orchestras, some of which, such as the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle and the Bournemouth Symphony, receive more
subsidy than some of the London bands.
The depressing thought is that whatever happens to Hoffmann the variety and
quality of the musical life of London will not improve. Audiences at the
Festival Hall have declined by 20 per cent over the last two decades, to 61
per cent last season. A marginal change in the funding of the symphony
orchestras will not in itself change that.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (1): Why estate agents long
for meaty bones - When confidence blossoms the housing market will burst
into life, predicts Gerald Cadogan, but big price rises are unlikely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTHER HUBBARD'S bare, boneless cupboard offered no joy for her or her dog.
Estate agents sympathise. They long for more meaty bones to throw to the
many would-be buyers on their lists, who have to continue living in rented
houses or flats, sustained by the hope that eventually vendors will find the
same confidence to sell as they show by trying to buy.
When that confidence blossoms, a true trading market will burst into life.
But it is far from certain that it will bring large price increases from
today's 'realistic' post-1980s levels.
It is an odd situation. Encouraging signs abound. The UK appears to be the
first country in the EC to be coming out of recession and, since last
autumn, foreigners have shown their confidence - and taken advantage of the
devaluation of the pound - by buying in London. For British owners and
buyers, lower interest rates lighten the mortgage burden and houses are more
affordable than for many years. But reluctant vendors are frustrating these
strong stimuli.
Even the stock market's sharp rise has little effect, however much it frees
investors from shares that plummeted on an unexpected profits warning the
day after they were bought, and releases cash for bearish sellers who think
the rise will not hold.
Have shares affected houses? Not yet. From June 1989 to June 1993 agents
Savills' index of prime country houses (castles to cottages) has markedly
underperformed the FT-Actuaries All Share index, although in the period
1979-1989 the two kept pace with growth of 16.2 per cent compound (houses)
and 16.1 per cent (shares). For the whole period 1979-1993 the figures work
out at 9 per cent compound (houses) and 13.2 per cent (shares), or more now
with the the stock market rising sharply.
Since the general election in April 1992 it has been a fractious market
across the UK, trying to settle but changing tack from month to month. John
Major's return produced an optimism which lasted only a few weeks. Vendors
in April and May last year were lucky. Then came the season of green shoots,
nipped whenever they budded. Prices continued down - as did buying once
stamp duty relief for houses up to Pounds 250,000 had stopped. There was a
slight upturn in September, until Black Wednesday. That was the nadir.
As autumn became winter, real changes began. Foreign buyers came to London,
and in the shires British farmers realised that, overnight, devaluation had
turned farming to profit. Collecting more 'green pounds' from EC support
payments originally expressed in Ecus, they started buying any fields
offered for sale, at rock-bottom prices.
At the beginning of this year, good news reached the country, often hard of
hearing, that there were London buyers and that interest rates had come
down. Agents reported better winter business than for many years, and looked
forward to an upswing. It did not happen. Completed sales measured by the
Corporate Estate Agents Property Index peaked in March. Since it has been a
dance of 1 1/2 steps forward, pirouette, and one step back, to judge from
the up and down news and views of the construction industry and the
sometimes agreeing, sometimes conflicting Halifax and Nationwide property
indices.
Mild optimism prevails, which would be much stronger if more good houses
were available for sale. A few houses in the country have sold for more than
their asking prices when buyers were competing, as happened notably with
Tennyson's Aldworth House, in Surrey, offered at more than Pounds 600,000
and sold by 'best and final' offers at more than Pounds 1m. Seven bidders
were in the ring. It helped that it is in Surrey which was one of the first
counties to suffer in the property downturn and is now recovering ahead of
the rest of the country.
The reverse is that there are still houses which are having their asking
prices cut, because they were too high in the first place, and houses where
agents propose a realistic 1990s price which the vendor rejects as it does
not meet his 1980s-conditioned expectations. It makes it hard to sell the
house, but the vendor may strike lucky. If so, he will be convinced he was
right all along. An alternative that should be used more often is to have an
auction with energetic marketing beforehand, thus ensuring that there are
several bidders in the room.
Prime country house prices showed a slight rise in the first six months of
1993, Yolande Barnes, head of Savills' residential research, says. An
average increase of 2.2 per cent reversed a downward trend that had lasted 3
1/2 years. Values that were at mid-1987 levels at the beginning of 1993 are
now back to autumn-1987 levels. But it would take two years of boom growth
before they reach mid-1988 prices, when Savills' index had jumped 36.2 per
cent from June 1987, or the peak of mid-1989 when it was up a further 2.6
per cent.
Barnes expects the recovery to continue hesitant, even in the south east,
and be patchy in the north and Scotland, where prices fell less and so have
less to recover. In Devon, Tim Burrage, of agent Stags, reports that 'many
properties are selling for a good 10 per cent more than they would have made
at the end of last year.' Barnes says that, if political and economic
conditions are right, prices should strengthen appreciably in 1994, as Tony
Snarey and Bill McClintock must expect in buying the Cornerstone chain of
estate agents from Abbey National. Earlier in the summer Snarey, went into
association with Humberts in Lincolnshire and adjoining counties.
In the meantime the market is soggy, as Mary Still, of relocation agent
Stacks, put it. Vendors must jump in if prices are to find firm ground. Why
do they hold back? Waiting until the market goes up is a large part of the
story. Once bitten by negative equity, if they bought their house three to
six years ago, they are now twice shy about committing themselves again.
If you must move, but have negative equity, be brave. Talk to your lender.
There are ways to rearrange loans. If the price of your present house has
come down, so probably has the one you want to move to. You may find your
pounds buying a room or two more and a larger garden than they could in
1988.
Other worries may be more inhibiting. How safe is your job? Are we out of
recession? Does the government really know what to do? Is it in charge?
Think 'no' once, and 'no' again until the question that needs 'yes' wakes
you in the middle of the night. Is it stupid to chance it now? Yes, yes, yes
resounds in your head. But if the market can shift gear this autumn, house
prices will probably go up a little and more people will be able to live
where they wish. That will mean plenty of business for the agents and make
Snarey's purchase of Cornerstone look singularly well-timed.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Union faces pressure to support Labour leader: GMB stance on
voting reforms seen as crucial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE was mounting last night on the GMB general union to abandon its
opposition to plans by the Labour leader, Mr John Smith, to reform his
party's links with the trade unions.
Mr Smith indicated yesterday he was confident of victory at next week's
Brighton conference, but senior officials said he still faced the threat of
defeat unless one or more of the leading unions reversed their opposition.
With the conference emerging as a crucial power struggle between the party's
so-called modernisers and traditionalists, the dispute over the union link
also threatens to spill over into a row about economic policy.
Party officials said yesterday that two-thirds of the constituency parties
had backed Mr Smith's proposed one-member, one-vote system for the selection
of parliamentary candidates.
That means Mr Smith might just scrape home if unions such as the Nupe public
service union, UCW postal workers and Usdaw shopworkers all wriggle out of
conference commitments to reject the reform, and back him.
But for Mr Smith to avoid a humiliating defeat he probably requires a large
union like the GMB to support him or abstain. 'There is a lot of unease
among senior union officials about what John Edmonds (the union's leader) is
doing on one-member, one-vote,' said one GMB official. Mr Edmonds says the
difference between his union and the party leadership is now 'no more than a
constitutional tiff' but he is not prepared to offer anything more than
discussions about a last-minute compromise.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, also said there would no
'horse-trading, no smoke-filled rooms, and no nudge nudge' on one-member,
one-vote. But the TGWU may indirectly aid the Smith camp by not backing any
motion against one-member, one-vote except its own, in which case all such
motions may fall, making it easier for Mr Smith to impose a solution.
On economic policy, the decision by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
to abandon the spending and tax policies on which Labour fought the 1992
general election faces attack in Brighton from union leaders and leading
left-wing MPs.
But Mr Brown, who yesterday rejected any attempt to commit a future Labour
chancellor to higher spending and borrowing, intends to pre-empt his critics
with a detailed rebuttal of charges that he has abandoned the party's
principles.
Party officials said all the main unions had given their backing to his
revamped economic strategy earlier this summer.
Mr Smith's aides said the initial returns from the constituency parties on
the one-member, one-vote plan showed that he could count on the support of
around two-thirds of their votes after Wednesday's debate. The
constituencies, however, hold only 30 per cent of the overall votes at
conference, with the remainder held by unions.
The Labour leader appears determined not to allow the issue to provoke a
public slanging match with the leading union leaders.

FT  25 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since most institutional investors will never have had anything repossessed
in their lives, the notion of Hell's Angels beating down front doors to grab
family televisions doubtless occasions some alarm. That is the lurid vision
raised by reports that Thorn EMI's US subsidiary, Rent-A-Center, has been
using strong-arm tactics to reclaim goods and charging excessive interest
rates. Yet it is the knock to Thorn's strategy that will keep fund managers
awake at night. The company has made much of its determined focus on rental
and music in recent times. Recently, however, the warning that the defence
business would make no profits postponed the day when shareholders reap the
rewards of patience. Now one of its core businesses has taken a knock.
Always supposing that the aggressive reclamation tactics are not widespread,
the fuss will probably die down reasonably quickly. It is particularly
unfortunate for Thorn, however, that the row should surface when margins in
the US rent-to-buy business are under scrutiny by Congress. As most
individual states have decided that rent-to-buy arrangements are not credit
agreements, and thus not subject to interest rate limits, it might be
surprising if Washington took action.
Even if curbs are enacted, there are plenty of ways Thorn could respond
without damaging earnings badly. Rather it is the delay, continued
uncertainty, and worry that the strategy is not entirely under control that
will hold back the shares. This is all the more so since the short-term
earnings outlook is little more than dull.

FT  25 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Willis Corroon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Willis Corroon is not the first insurance broker to admit that its talents
do not extend to underwriting. The plan to offer a majority stake in
Gryphon, its US property and casualty business, should allow Willis to cut
debt and concentrate on what it does best. It must be taken as a mark of the
company's faith in the recovery potential of broking that it is prepared to
shed a profitable subsidiary at this stage of the cycle.
Floating the business on Wall Street is expected to net more than a trade
sale. US investors are especially eager to back insurance ventures with an
international flavour. At least two of the reinsurance companies established
in Bermuda this summer plan to raise additional capital by making public
offerings of shares. Sphere Drake, the leading London market insurer owned
by a consortium, recently returned to the public domain via the same route.
Yet the Sphere Drake example underlines how difficult it can be for past
owners to escape the shadow of insurance policies already written. Alexander
&amp; Alexander, the big US broker, sold Sphere to its present owners in 1987.
Indemnities given to the buyers as part of the deal were still eating into
profits last year. All credit to Willis if it can both raise cash and make
the clean break which it promises. Insurance brokers with less profitable or
less well-reserved underwriting operations will not be so fortunate.

FT  25 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan will doubtless receive many plaudits for its decision to
separate the roles of chairman and chief executive. It is gratifying, too,
to see a senior executive withdraw gracefully to the sidelines without any
immediate sign of an enormous Glaxo-style pay-off. To stop here, though, may
be to miss the point. The separation of roles is less significant than it
looks. It does not involve new blood, and the ebullient Sir Allen Sheppard
will still sit on the executive committee as well as being chairman.
A deeper question is raised by the choice of Mr George Bull as chief
executive when Mr Ian Martin had so obviously been groomed for the role.
Yesterday's 4 per cent fall in GrandMet's share price reflected the
suspicion that some untoward development underlay his failure to get the
job. That looks unlikely; if GrandMet was sitting on any serious bad news,
it would surely have revealed it with the management change.
The more plausible explanation lies in the nature of the challenges facing
GrandMet. It must reduce gearing by shedding peripheral businesses such as
the Chef &amp; Brewer pubs. For the longer term it must develop its brands,
particularly in food where Green Giant was proving a mammoth headache until
the recent US floods pushed up prices. That is where Mr Bull's talents lie.
Mr Martin is better at structural change, such as the acquisition of
Pillsbury. The implication of yesterday's announcement is that GrandMet now
wants to concentrate on organic growth, but first it has to jump the hurdle
of selling unwanted businesses.

FT  25 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Russian roulette
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the UK equity market's resilience that the threat of
civil strife in Russia - a good excuse for taking profits if ever there was
one - failed to drive share prices lower. The FT-SE 100 index finished the
week more or less where it started, a shade above 3,000. Still, the
aggregate performance hides a multitude of sins. Food retailers took another
battering, with disappointing figures from Tesco and William Morrison the
proximate cause. The sector has fallen 14 per cent this month, threatening
to take the mantle of least popular sector from pharmaceuticals.
Whether the market can find inspiration for another march upwards is
doubtful. The interim results season has been at best mixed, and certainly
not good enough to validate the high expectations on earnings built into
many share prices. Strength in gilts would again set a positive mood, but
with a Pounds 3.25bn auction scheduled for Wednesday there seems little
immediate hope of a lead from that direction. The best that can be said is
that gilts are showing few signs of nerves in the run-up to the auction, on
the expectation that foreign buyers will step in.
The dependence of gilts and equities on overseas investors is perhaps the
best reason for caution. The Pounds 13bn which flowed into UK stocks and
bonds in the second quarter is unsustainably high. The level of sterling,
the relative value of gilts against continental European markets and - ahead
of the Conservative party conference - the political climate will determine
exactly when the tap is turned off.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Break-up of British Gas no longer vital, regulator says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR James McKinnon, the director general of Ofgas who is shortly to retire,
said yesterday the break-up of British Gas was no longer necessary, provided
new competitors were allowed to supply gas to homes.
He was speaking as the government announced that he would be succeeded in
November by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, a 40-year-old businesswoman.
Sir James's forceful demands for the break-up of British Gas are thought to
have influenced the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's recent decision to
recommend the split of the company into two by 1997, followed by the
abolition of the mono-poly. But he said yesterday that it would be
sufficient for British Gas's transport and trading divisions to be separated
by internal walls, so long as competitors had fair access to the company's
pipeline system.
The main priority was to abolish its monopoly in the tariff market and
design ways for new suppliers to compete within two or three years.
Sir James said he had not changed his position. However, his comments are
likely to find an echo in the Department of Trade and Industry which must
decide whether to accept the MMC's recommendations. Department officials
have said they are more intent on abolishing the monopoly than on breaking
up British Gas.
A decision is likely by December, by which time Ms Spottiswoode will have
become the gas industry regulator.
A former Treasury economist, she also has experience of running her own
business. She is a director of several companies, and has been a tutor at
the London Business School's Centre for Enterprise. Colleagues describe her
as intelligent and charming but also tough.
However, with the monopoly inquiry now complete, she will not have to adopt
the stormy tactics used by Sir James to combat British Gas. Mr Cedric Brown,
British Gas's chief executive, said: 'We welcome the appointment of Clare
Spottiswoode and the opportunity to form a constructive working
relationship.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / GrandMet names Bull as chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan yesterday appointed Mr George Bull, driving force behind
the growth of its IDV drinks operation, as chief executive, instead of the
long-time heir-apparent, Mr Ian Martin, who led the Dollars 5.8bn
acquisition of the US Pillsbury group.
The surprise reshuffle of top management followed the decision of Sir Allen
Sheppard to split the combined post of chairman and chief executive, which
he has held since 1987.
GrandMet's shares fell 15p to close at 393p - a reflection not of market
dissatisfaction with the changes but of some fears that there may be bad
news to come.
Mr Martin, 58, who spent five years in the US restructuring the Pillsbury
group after the takeover, returned to the UK in January last year as group
managing director and chief operating officer.
He will give up his executive duties to become a non-executive deputy
chairman, with special responsibility for North American affairs. He will
continue to receive his current salary.
Mr Martin said yesterday: 'The other guy won the race - and I have the
greatest respect and admiration for him.
'I think the great thing now is to look forward. I am delighted to continue
to be associated with the group, and I should have time to reduce my golf
handicap,' he said.
Sir Allen, whose decision to end his dual role was welcomed by institutional
shareholders, said the GrandMet board had been faced with a choice between
'two world-class executives'.
The votes went unanimously to Mr Bull because of his marketing background,
wider experience of international markets, and business development record.
Mr Bull said: 'I see it as my role to lead GrandMet closer to its markets.'
Mr David Nash, finance director, will take over in December as head of the
food and international retailing operations.

FT  25 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow unmoved by data, bond
price gains

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended little changed yesterday in spite of good economic
news and fresh gains in bond prices, although once again over-the-counter
stocks rose to new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.36 at 3,543.11. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.05 at 457.79, while
the Amex composite ended up 1.82 at 454.53 and the Nasdaq composite up 2.41
at 754.67, a new record high. Trading volume on the NYSE was 244m shares.
The markets ended a volatile week - one dominated by political turmoil in
Russia and the debate over healthcare reform at home - in subdued fashion.
Prices firmed across the board at the opening, primarily in reaction to some
rare positive economic news. The commerce department announced that durable
goods orders rose 2.0 per cent in August, a bigger increase than expected by
Wall Street analysts, who had forecast a rise in orders of about 1.5 per
cent.
The durable goods figures, however, are notoriously unreliable, so any
positive impact they had on equities was limited. By mid-morning blue chip
stocks had eased back into negative territory. Investors ignored fresh gains
on overseas markets - Tokyo, Paris and London were all higher - and on the
US bond market which, after a week of big losses, has now rallied for three
straight days. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government
bond was up  9/32 at 102 25/32 , yielding 6.043 per cent.
Among individual stocks, cyclical stocks were mixed, with some still under
pressure because of concern about the economy. General Electric fell Dollars
1 1/4 to Dollars 94 7/8 , Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing gave up Dollars
7/8 at Dollars 102 7/8 , International Paper held steady at Dollars 59 3/8 ,
Aluminum Company of America firmed Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 68 and Caterpillar
rallied Dollars 1 to Dollars 78 1/8 .
Car stocks were also mixed. General Motors eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 46,
Chrysler rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 47 7/8 and Ford slipped Dollars  1/4
to Dollars 56 5/8 , all in heavy trading.
Wachovia jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 after brokerage house Alex
Brown raised its rating on the banking group to 'buy' from 'neutral', saying
that growth from operations would be strong for the foreseeable future. Bank
stocks in general were firmer, with Banc One up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 40,
JP Morgan Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 75 3/4 , Chemical up Dollars  1/8
at Dollars 44 1/4 , and Citicorp Dollars  1/4 firmer at Dollars 36 1/4 .
Northern Border Pipeline made a strong debut. The 14.2m shares were offered
at Dollars 24 3/8 , and by the close had risen to Dollars 25 5/8 in volume
of 4.7m shares.
Canada
TORONTO posted a mixed performance on the day, in moderate trading. The
TSE-300 index gained 11.50 points, to close at 3,982.36, in volume of 51.63m
shares valued at CDollars 477.8m. Losing issues led winners by 389 to 277.
Nine of 14 sub-indices ended higher, led by a 1.26 per cent gain in consumer
products.
Shares in Magna International, the Toronto-based automotive parts supplier,
jumped CDollars 2 1/8 to CDollars 55 1/8 on news that it was buying
interests in European auto-parts companies for about CDollars 100m.

FT  25 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris up 1.7% on interest rate
hopes, Frankfurt falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MOST cases, bourses approached the weekend with equanimity. Frankfurt's
worries about what could happen in Russia may have reflected the
precariousness of trading positions taken on Monday and Tuesday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS rose in expectation of an imminent cut in interest rates after the
authorities eased the overnight rate. On the first day of the new account
the CAC-40 index added 35.07 or 1.7 per cent to 2,092.60, slightly lower on
the week. Turnover was strong at FFr4.5bn.
Lafarge Coppee rose steadily in early trading to an intraday high of
FFr411.90 on overnight news that a German group had emerged as bidder for
CBR, the Belgian cement manufacturer. However, the shares later came off to
close FFr1.70 higher at FFr407.70.
Credit Lyonnais CI's rose FFr60, or 9.2 per cent, to FFr715 on better than
expected first-half results and the forecast of an improvement in the second
half. The bank also said that it would not be in a position to consider
privatisation for at least two years.
St Gobain slipped FFr5 to FFr546 after reporting that VW, the German vehicle
manufacturer, had asked for price cuts of up to 15 per cent for supplies of
car windows.
FRANKFURT fell as traders squared positions ahead of the weekend, the DAX
index falling 30.65, or 1.6 per cent on the day to 1,885.86, but closing a
fraction higher on the week.
Turnover fell from DM6.4bn to DM5.2bn. Causes of uncertainty included a
higher than expected inflation rate from the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, and
the position of the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin.
However, later in the day there were contra-indications on inflation from
North Rhine-Westphalia which showed a year-on-year rise of 3.8 per cent,
down from August's 4.0 per cent. After hours, the Ibis indicated DAX index
improved a little to close at 1,890.42.
Cyclicals hit particularly hard yesterday included Daimler,
Metallgesellschaft, and Preussag, down DM18.00 to DM732.00, DM11.00 to
DM345.00 and DM13.50 to DM395.00.
Among the few winners, Heidelberger Zement celebrated its bid for CBR of
Belgium, coming back from suspension DM55 higher at DM1,145; and Lufthansa
lost just 40 pfg to DM152.50 on reports from Washington that the US and
Germany had reached a tentative air traffic pact.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index finished off 0.3 at 123.8, little changed on
the week. Akzo dipped Fl 1.20 to Fl 168.70 on local press reports that its
textiles division might announce a loss when the group announces
third-quarter results next month.
Merrill Lynch this week noted that Akzo's longer-term prospects remain good
helped by aggressive cost-cutting and restructuring measures adopted by the
management. The brokers concluded that the share price should respond well
to economic recovery when it comes and forecast earnings of Fl 35 per share
'near the peak of the recovery cycle'.
ZURICH saw strong foreign demand for chemicals issues as the SMI index rose
20.1 to 2,445.9 for a 2.6 per cent gain on the week.
Roche certificates, continuing to benefit from analysts' buy
recommendations, rose SFr155 or 3 per cent to SFr3,505. Sandoz followed the
lead, rising SFr20 to SFr3,455.
MILAN was worried about forthcoming results and the Comit index shed 6.29 to
586.51 in quiet trading, a weekly fall of 1.6 per cent. Olivetti, expected
to announce a big loss after the market closed, shed L16 to L1,930.
With half-yearly figures due in the coming week, Fiat fell L85 to L5,850 and
Benetton L35 to L23,582. Bucking the trend, BCI put on L67 at L4,895.
Generali, the insurer, gave up an early gain to finish L180 lower at L39,420
in response to Thursday's announcement of a fall in first-half pre-tax
profits but a 14 per cent increase in premium income. However, Mr Simon
Rudolph of Morgan Stanley in London described the results as encouraging,
noting that last year's pre-tax figures had been inflated by net realised
capital gains.
ISTANBUL finally broke through the 15,000 barrier with the composite index
rising 160.1 to 15,046.7, a 4 per cent gain on the week. Turnover was
TL1,400bn after Thursday's record TL1,800bn.

FT  25 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Tough budget to put muscle into Madrid
 -Tom Burns says that the government attack on public spending should be
good for growth stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A restrictive 1994 budget approved in cabinet yesterday is likely to inject
new muscle into the Spanish stock market. Investors have received a very
clear signal that the government is going to tackle public spending
seriously, and this implies an upgrade for quoted companies with good
earnings prospects.
'In the mid-term the Bolsa has only one direction to move and that is up,'
says Mr Juan Bastos, managing director of the Madrid stockbrokers,
Ibersecurities. Echoing a view shared widely among senior Madrid
professionals, Mr Bastos believes that domestic interest rates will come
down again, perhaps by another half point before the end of the year. At
worst, rates will be a neutral factor for the foreseeable future.
It was expectations of falling rates, following the collapse of the European
Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism, that pushed the Bolsa's general
index above the 300 mark in August. Early this month the Bank of Spain
delivered a bold half a point cut to bring its key intervention rate down to
10 per cent, the lowest since the early 1980s.
A feeling of fatigue, brought on by so much previous discount enthusiasm,
stopped the rally subsequently but the brokers hope that they have found a
good support base at 280. Barring worsening developments in Moscow and the
export of Russian-bred bearishness to the global markets, it would seem that
the the Bolsa has corrected itself.
Looking ahead, analysts see share price prospects as domestic institutions
switch from lower yielding fixed income stocks into equities. At present,
Spanish funds have some Pta8,000bn in their coffers, and a paltry Pta50bn
invested in stocks. A switch of just 1 per cent of these funds, or Pta80bn,
into equities would represent a week's trading on the Bolsa.
Yesterday, the index fell 1.05 to 281.35, taking its decline on the week to
1.3 per cent. The expectation is that it will remain within a 280-290 range
over the short term and that, sooner rather than later, an 'earnings rally'
will take over from the previous 'interest rate rally'. The Madrid
securities house Benito y Monjardin is forecasting an average increase in
profits for major quoted companies of 11 per cent for 1994.
Such an outlook suggests what Benito y Monjardin calls a dichotomy in its
strategy recommendations for Spain. Equity investment could be reduced short
term because of the market's present exhaustion but sight should not be lost
of the basic upward movement that lies ahead.
'Spain, at present, is worth a 10 per cent correction,' says Mr Bastos of
Ibersecurities. 'Anything more than that, and you should sell.'
The cabinet's approval of the 1994 budget will almost certainly firm up the
bullish expectations. The market was waiting anxiously for the good news,
that the government intends to be tough.
There are several business friendly features to the new budget, such as a
set of fiscal incentives for investments, for the creation of new companies
and for exports, but its single most important aspect is a planned 1994 wage
freeze for public sector employees.
The wage freeze, which is coupled to an undertaking not to enlarge the
number of public employees, sets the scene for a much more ambitious
government target which involves a three-year agreement with the unions on
strict salary moderation.
Salary rises negotiated in collective bargaining agreements in the first
half of this year were in the order of 6 per cent, a level 1.5 per cent
above the inter-annual inflation rate. In the new climate of a public sector
wage freeze, the private sector will be expecting to contain salary
increases to below 3 per cent next year.
Potentially, the outlook for companies in Spain could not be better. They
have the cheapest borrowing costs in years and good reason to expect further
rate cuts; they have the benefits of three devaluations in the past year
which have allowed the peseta to stabilise finally after depreciating by
more than 20 per cent against most main currencies; they have a clear
prospect of sharply reduced labour costs next year and, possibly, through to
1996.
The missing link in such an outlook is of course a vital one - Spain's
continuing recession. The latest serious data in this respect came with an
August report by the Bank of Spain on the domestic economy in the second
quarter of the year. The central bank verified that the deep recession had
troughed although there was no sign of the beginning of a recovery.
In this context the early September rate cut by the Bank of Spain was very
encouraging, undertaken independently of the Bundesbank (which kept its
intervention unchanged) and well ahead of the cabinet's decision to stick to
its austerity programme.
The cut indicated that the monetary authorities believed that the conditions
were right to kick-start the economy. There is therefore every reason to
believe that in the months ahead, as the budget passes through its
parliamentary process and austerity begins to bite, further cuts will be in
the offing.

<TEXT>
TRADING volumes continued to fall away in London stock index markets
yesterday as investors took a calmer view of the week's events in Russia,
writes Terry Byland. After moving within a range of 18 points, the December
contract on the FT-SE Index closed at 3,035, a 27 point premium to the cash
market but only about 3 points to the Fair Value, cash and carrying costs,
premium.
Salomon International was believed to have been a large seller of the
December contract, selling about 1,000 contracts out of the day's total
business of 7,595; earlier this week, daily turnover topped 15,000
contracts.
Traded options had a brisk session, recording 36,996 contracts against
28,690, with the FT-SE contract active at 14,891 contracts. The Euro FT-SE
option recorded 2,580 deals. Individual share contracts also had an active
day, with Glaxo (4,358 contracts) still responding to President Clinton's
healthcare proposals. Amstrad, the computer manufacturer, saw 3,398
contracts traded.

FT  25 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares continue to hold their ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market continued yesterday to consolidate around its current
levels, encouraged by indications during the day that the chances of serious
political conflict in Russia appeared to be diminishing.
Equities were also helped by further gains in government bonds and also by
analysts' suggestions that, despite this week's unimpressive flow of
corporate news, prospects for UK corporate earnings may be stronger than
expected.
The FT-SE Index passed the day shuffling around its overnight levels, moving
in a narrow range between 3,006.9 and 3,002.2. But the Index was in positive
ground throughout the session and the final reading, up 3.9 at 3,005.2,
implied a further strengthening of the lower end of the latest trading
range. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 1.6 to 3,431.9.
This week has brought what must be the smallest recorded shift in the
Footsie - down a mere 0.3 points. The Footsie 3,000 mark has been
successfully held despite the uncertainties associated with the political
clash in Russia. Firmness in the US dollar and in other European continental
markets has buoyed London. Trading volumes have also been good and trading
has been little affected by the political drama in Russia. High retail, or
customer, volume in UK equities has sustained confidence in the securities
markets.
Company results, an actively restraining influence on UK share prices,
continued to present a mixed picture yesterday, with John Mowlem, the
building group, reporting increased losses.
But analysts at Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant banker, and at James
Capel, the London institutional broking house, published favourable comments
on the outlook for UK company profits.
Trading volume was fairly poor, however, with Seaq business reaching only
527.3m shares compared with 713.5m on Thursday; non-Footsie business made up
around 61 per cent of the total. In the previous session, retail business
jumped to Pounds 1.63bn, at the higher end of the improved trading range of
the past 12 months.
Long-dated UK government bonds edged higher without attracting much
turnover. In the shorts, the closest reflection of base rate hopes, gains
were very small. However, there was some interest in Index-linked gilts
which put on about  1/2 a point.

Consideration of President Clinton's health reforms continued yesterday to
affect those UK health stocks with significant exposure to the US.
The main feature in the London stock market was a switch of holdings from
Zeneca, the recently demerged pharmaceuticals arm of ICI, to Glaxo.
President Clinton has said pharmaceutical companies will have to offer a 15
per cent discount on drugs sold to Medicare, the health system which offers
subsidised treatments to the elderly and which represents 30 per cent of the
US health budget. Analysts said Glaxo, which rose 132 to 654p had less
exposure to Medicare than Zeneca, which fell 11 to 710p.
Healthcare group Fisons was the subject of renewed takeover speculation,
this time from both Zeneca and ICI. Although one of the oldest outstanding
bid stories in London, Fisons shares lifted 7 1/2 to 174p.
Oil stocks were firmer, reflecting a pick-up in crude oil prices and
expectations of an advantageous outcome to the weekend's OPEC conference.
Among the majors, Shell Transport improved 6 1/2 to 651p while BP was
marginally firmer at 302p. The exploration and production companies were
also a good market. Enterprise rose 4 to 432p and Lasmo gained 2 1/2 to 146
1/2 p.
Insurance broker Willis Corroon lifted 4 to 229p after announcing plans to
sell its 56 per cent stake in subsidiary Gryphon Holdings. Gryphon holds the
group's two US insurance companies - Associated International Insurance and
Calvert Insurance - which write commercial property and casualty policies
for small- to medium-sized insurers. However, Hoare Govett downgraded its
recommendation from hold to overvalued arguing that the yield was too low in
the light of the weak balance sheet and poor recovery in US casualty
insurance.
Shares in Hepworth, the building materials group, rose 7 to 377p in spite of
a fall in interim profits to Pounds 27.5m from Pounds 32.8m. The figure was
better than most analysts forecast and the operating profit by division was
better than expected. UBS raised its forecasts for the full year to Pounds
60m but remains a holder of the stock preferring to invest in MB - Caradon,
off 4 at 319p.
Bargain hunters caused a turnround in several of the food retailing stocks
after gloomy sessions that followed the release of disappointing figures.
Tesco firmed 4 1/2 to 202p, while its rival J Sainsbury gained 8 to 428p.
Asda edged a penny forward to 60 1/2 p.
Shares in Thorn EMI remained under a cloud as worries about the company's US
Rent-A-Center operation continued. Nervous selling saw the shares give up 22
to 922p. The US subsidiary contributes between 15 and 16 per cent to group
profits.
The recent selling in Ladbroke appears to have dried up and the shares
finished 6 ahead at 195p. However talk that the final dividend could be cut
continued to circulate.
In the rest of the drinks sector, the poor figures from Guinness released
earlier this week continued to exact a toll and the shares lost another 5 to
422p in trade of 4.1m.
The other stock to be downgraded by NatWest Securities in the sector was
Allied Lyons. The shares gave up 8 to 563p, after the securities house
reduced the current year profits estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 669m.
Several analysts were surprised to see shares in Mirror Group Newspapers
gain 2 to 180p ahead of a big stake sale. The book-building process for the
sale of the 54.8 per cent holding currently with the administrator begins on
Monday and was expected to depress the share price.
Shares in BICC advanced 7 to 420p, after it won two new contracts. The
company won a contract for work on the M8 motorway in Scotland said to be
worth about Pounds 39m. BICC is also believed to have secured a Pounds 50m
contract for a waste water scheme in Egypt.
The two new contracts rounded off a favourable week for the group in which
its Balfour Beatty subsidiary signed a memorandum of understanding with
Malaysia on project management contracts for building the country's new
international airport.
Williams de Broe was particularly active in the stock yesterday and Mr
Mustapha Omar at the broker believes, 'the 6 per cent yield premium is
likely to fuel advances in the share price.'
Among stores, SG Warburg was said to have been positive on Kingfisher where
the shares advanced 4 to 666p.
US buying was seen in British Steel and volume rose to 14m as the shares
firmed 4 to 119 1/2 p.
Further consideration of results from Quality Software, the developer and
retailer of financial computer packages, sent the shares down another 49 to
479p.

FT  25 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Doubts on GrandMet changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS of the awaited boardroom changes at food and drinks group Grand
Metropolitan took the market by surprise and unsettled the shares as market
watchers tried to rationalise the moves. Sentiment was further weakened by a
profits downgrading from a UK broker.
The company not only announced it was splitting the role of chief executive
and chairman currently held by Sir Allen Sheppard but named Mr George Bull,
now head of the food division, as the new chief executive. The market had
for some time assumed that Mr Ian Martin, the managing director, would
become the new chief executive.
Uncertainty reflected market fears that the changes might be an indication
of problems at the group. The shares gave up 15 to 393p, after heavy trading
of 8.5m shares.
The jitters over GrandMet came as sentiment in the drinks sector was at a
low ebb following the poor results from Guinness earlier this week. NatWest
Securities yesterday downgraded profit expectations at GrandMet. It reduced
the current year estimate by Pounds 24m to Pounds 941m and cut the following
year's figure by Pounds 38m to Pounds 1,047m.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar stronger on crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINUING crisis in Russia was again the dominant theme in currency
markets yesterday, pushing the dollar up to a high of DM1.6575 on the day,
writes James Blitz.
For most of this week, the movements in the dollar/exchange rate have been
entirely determined by events in Moscow. Yesterday, the dollar got off to a
very strong start as news was flashed on agency screens that there had been
shooting outside the headquarters of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Mr Yeltsin's order that troops inside the White House building had to disarm
themselves also helped the dollar to its highs for the day. An additional
factor was the onset of the weekend: few dealers wanted to be short of
dollars over Saturday and Sunday lest events got out of control.
However, towards the end of European trading yesterday, a succession of
statements suggested that there would be no violence in Moscow in the
immediate future, and the dollar drifted down again.
The US currency closed at DM1.6485 from a previous DM1.6450.
Events in Moscow are so unpredictable that it would probably be unwise for
any dealer to be too short of dollars next week. But the experience of the
market is that political crises like the Gulf War and the overthrow of
President Gorbachev have only short term effects on exchange rates, and the
dollar is likely to drift down again.
The Bundesbank meeting in two weeks time will also be Mr Hans Tietmeyer's
first as Bundesbank President - so there is unlikely to be any easing in
German monetary policy until October 7 at the very earliest.
The D-Mark's performance on the European crosses matched that against the
dollar. While weak in the European morning, the D-Mark soon came back. It
closed unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.481.
The Danish krone has had a far more robust performance in recent days, and
was further helped by yesterday's  1/2 percentage point cut in Danish
interest rates. It closed at DKr4.04 from a previous DKr4.07.
Sterling had a weaker performance against the D-Mark than any other
currency. Thursday night's report from the Confederation of British Industry
showed that export orders for manufactured goods have slipped this month to
their lowest level since April. This prompted more rate cut speculation in
sterling money markets and this had a knock-on effect on the currency, which
closed at DM2.4750 from a previous DM2.4775.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Hints of cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH FRANC interest rate futures rose sharply yesterday amid signs that
the Bank of France might ease monetary policy next week, writes James Blitz.
There was no formal statement or move by the Bank of France yesterday. But
dealers noted that the central bank did little to obstruct a 20 basis point
fall in the overnight rate of French francs, down to around 7.15 per cent.
It is now some 40 basis points above the intervention rate at 6.75 per cent.
One dealer said that the central bank had been gently adding liquidity to
the market.
UK clearing bank base lending rate 6 per cent from January 26, 1993
Another strong indication that Europe is in for another round of policy
easing was Denmark's  1/2 percentage point cut in all its key interest
rates. Its discount and key deposit rates came down to 8.25 per cent from
8.75 per cent.
Are there any reasons for a Europe-wide easing in policy now ? The weakness
of the D-Mark against the dollar has given some central banks plenty of
opportunity to rebuild reserves.
Some dealers also wondered yesterday whether France would come under
pressure at this weekend's G7 meeting for not reducing rates, and speculated
that a rate cut on Monday would help counter criticism.
The better tone was felt across the board in French franc futures. The
December contract, for example, rose 17 basis points to close at 93.78.
German interest rate futures were somehat more subdued, possibly because of
continuing pressure on the D-Mark because of the Russian crisis.
The December contract was up 2 basis points on the day at 93.90. Call money
was again very tight, despite an injection of Paragraph 17 funds by the
Bundesbank. It was quoted around 6.95 per cent from a previous 6.85 per
cent.
Sterling interest rate futures were very buoyant, helped by Thursday night's
report from the Confederation of British Industry showing that export orders
for manufactured goods have slipped this month to their lowest level since
April.
This raised speculation of more rate cutting. The Decmeber short sterling
contract was up 7 basis points on the day at 94.40. Three month sterling
closed on a very narrow spread of 5 29/32 per cent to 5 27/32 per cent.
There was a shortage of Pounds 900m, most of which was renoved in afternoon
trading.

FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Credit Local reports 5% rise to
FFr698m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Local de France, the French bank which earlier this year staged a
share sale on the Paris stock market, yesterday announced a 5.1 per cent
increase in net profits to FFr698m (Dollars 122.5m) for the first half of
1993, compared with the same 1992 period.
The French banking industry has suffered in recent months from the impact of
the recession on demand for credit and on property prices.
However, Credit Local, a specialist bank which provides loans to local
authorities, has been spared many of the problems that have affected its
competitors in retail banking.
Mr Pierre Richard, chairman, described the group's first-half performance as
'very satisfactory'. He anticipated continued growth in the second half,
with net profits increasing by around 7 per cent to between FFr1.26bn and
FFr1.28bn for the full financial year.
Credit Local saw net banking income rise by 6.8 per cent to FFr1.66bn at the
interim stage this year, from FFr1.55bn in the first half of last year.
Operating profits increased by 2.4 per cent to FFr1.07bn from FFr1.05bn, and
exceptional charges were FFr10.2bn, against FFr4.2bn in the previous interim
period.

FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Olivetti optimistic as deficit
widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the Italian computers group, remained deeply in loss for the first
half of this year. However, it claimed yesterday that the outlook for 1993
as a whole had improved due to greater competitiveness and a slight let-up
in downward pressure on operating margins.
Although net group losses at L168.1bn (Dollars 105.7m) were considerably
higher than the L93.4bn lost in first half of 1992, Mr Corrado Passera,
joint managing director, said the figures were broadly similar.
Mr Passera pointed out that the 1992 deficit been partly masked by L170bn of
accruals carried over from 1991.
According to Mr Passera, the first-half loss represented a small but
significant upturn from the depressed figures in the second half of last
year.
For the whole of 1992, Olivetti reported a net loss of L649.9bn.
Industry analysts expect the group to lose between L400bn and L450bn in
1993, while Olivetti itself predicts a return to break-even by December
1994.
Sales for the six months rose by 5.4 per cent to L3,949bn, with most of the
increase coming in 'a number of competitive European and US markets',
Olivetti said.
However, turnover has been boosted by last year's sharp devaluation of the
lira, which has swelled the value of foreign sales in lira terms.
Mr Passera said that although the devaluation had ostensibly helped
competitiveness, the overall effect had been mildly negative because of
appreciably higher prices for imported components.
Earnings had also been affected by the unexpectedly steep fall in domestic
demand because of the recession.
Mr Passera said that the information technology industry remained under
pressure because of overcapacity and competition.
However, although margins had continued to fall after precipitous declines
in 1991 and 1992, 'they are no longer dropping at the same speed', he added.
Olivetti said that its share of the European personal computer market rose
to 6.2 per cent in June from 4.9 per cent at the same time last year, while
shipments increased by more than 50 per cent.
There was also a rise in sales of printers, notably of bubble-jet models.
The group's financial position improved. Net borrowings dropped to L741bn at
the end of June from L961bn last December, due partly to this year's L903bn
rights issue.

FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: McCain brothers call truce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WALLACE and Harrison McCain, the Canadian brothers who head the McCain
potato-chip and frozen-food empire, have called a truce in their public feud
over succession plans for the family-owned company.
The agreement means that instead of airing their dispute in open court, the
brothers will renew attempts to reach a private settlement. If those efforts
fail to achieve a deal by early next year, the family will resolve its
differences through arbitration.
A court in New Brunswick was this week due to hear an application by Wallace
for an injunction overturning a decision by the McCain Foods' board to oust
him as joint chief executive by the end of this month.
Five minutes before the hearing was due, however, the judge was asked to
postpone the case while the two sides hammered out a settlement. Under the
agreement, Wallace will remain as joint chief executive while the company
seeks a successor to the brothers.
The feud stems from a unilateral decision by Wallace three years ago to
appoint his son Michael as head of McCain's US operations. Harrison said in
an affidavit earlier this month that an atmosphere of 'distrust, intrigue
and manoeuvring' has since pervaded the business.
Wallace has argued that Harrison has felt threatened since he had a heart
attack last year. Wallace said in a recent affidavit that failing the
implementation of a previously agreed succession plan, his first choice was
to split the company, which has annual sales of about CDollars 3bn
(USDollars 2.3bn), into two roughly equal parts. He would take over the US
and the Pacific Rim operations, leaving Harrison with the UK and European
businesses. McCain is the biggest UK supplier of frozen potato chips.
Wallace has also proposed buying the two-thirds stake in McCain Foods which
he and his branch of the family do not already own.

FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: AGF profits steady at FFr1.4bn
for first half

ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), the French insurance company which is
on the government's privatisation list, saw net profits stabilise at
FFr1.41bn (Dollars 246m) in the first half of 1993, against FFr1.40bn a year
earlier.
The static performance stemmed partly from the inclusion of a share of the
losses at Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the troubled finance group, which
totalled FFr297m.
Mr Michel Albert, chairman, declined to forecast full-year earnings, but
said he was confident in spite of the 'difficult state' of the insurance
market. He said he was 'even more' confident about 1994.
AGF, the third-largest insurer in France behind Union des Assurances de
Paris and Axa, saw turnover from insurance activities rise by 7.9 per cent
to FFr32.6bn in the first six months of this year, from FFr30.2bn in the
same period of 1992.
French accident insurance business recovered, doubling net profits to
FFr325m from FFr126m, and the reinsurance side made modest progress to
FFr48m from FFr44m. AGF's insurance interests outside France moved out of
the red with net profits of FFr212m against a loss of FFr89m.
The group said it had benefited from a slight improvement in conditions and
from tighter cost control.
However, net profits from French life insurance business fell sharply to
FFr858m from FFr1.05bn. Losses on financial interests deepened to FFr163m
from FFr60m mainly due to the losses on its 29.7 per cent stake in Comptoir
des Entrepreneurs.
The finance group is implementing a recovery plan. Losses totalled FFr900m
in the first half of this year, against net profits of FFr23.7m at the
interim stage last year.
The company said yesterday that the outlook for the full year was uncertain,
but it was convinced that the worst of its problems were over and that the
second half would show an improvement on the first.

FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Italian banks post advances in
run-up to privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANCA Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, the two big Italian banks
about to be moved fully into the private sector, yesterday both reported
substantially higher first-half earnings.
The figures were announced as the Rome government approved legislation for
privatisations. The changes allow for the introduction of 'golden shares'
and abolish the previous ban on the state lowering its stake in
public-sector banks below 51 per cent of the capital.
BCI, the bigger of the two banks, said that pre-tax profits reached L387.1bn
(Dollars 243m), net of L325bn in loan loss provisions, unrealised losses on
securities and depreciation.
No comparable figure was released for the first half of 1992.
Earnings before taxes, depreciation and provisions, but after extraordinary
items - the only figure allowing a direct year-on-year comparison - showed a
strong improvement.
Profits amounted to L866.8bn for the six months, against L601.5bn.
BCI said earnings had been boosted by a 10.9 per cent rise in interest
margins to L1,423bn and rapidly expanding fee-related business, which jumped
56.5 per cent to L824.4bn.
Operating costs, however, continued to rise at well above inflation, with an
increase of almost 9 per cent to L1,312.6bn.
Credito Italiano's first-half profits amounted to L133bn after tax and
provisions. As with BCI, no comparable half-year figure for 1992 was given.
Credito Italiano made net profits of L208bn for the whole of 1992.
Gross operating profits jumped 55 per cent to L632bn from L405.5bn in the
first half of last year.
The improvement was driven by a 17 per cent rise in interest margins to
L1,203bn and a 55 per cent leap in fee-based income to L532bn.
At BCI the ratio of bad loans to total lending rose to 2.3 per cent from 2
per cent. At Credito Italiano the ratio reached 2.56 per cent.
The Italian government is to extend the suspension of capital gains tax
until June 30 1994. The cabinet approved a decree on the extension
yesterday.
The suspension, which was warmly welcomed by the Milan bourse when it was
implemented after long delays, has been seen as one of the most important
factors stimulating Italian share prices this year.

LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, yesterday agreed to acquire a 25 per
cent stake in Sky Chefs, a Texas-based food service business, in a move
claimed to create the world's largest airline catering alliance with about
Dollars 1.3bn in revenues.
LSG Lufthansa Service, the airline's food-service division, is to buy one
quarter of Sky Chefs' existing stock for Dollars 75m. Onex, a diversified
Canadian group, currently owns 80 per cent of company, with Sky Chefs'
management holding the remainder.
Onex said the move was part of a global marketing accord between LSG
Lufthansa, the largest in-flight food operation in Europe and Asia, and Sky
Chefs, the second-biggest airline caterer in the US.
Sky Chefs has some Dollars 500m in turnover a year. The alliance will enable
the companies to provide food services to airlines on a worldwide basis.

FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trygg US arm to raise Dollars
355m

<TEXT>
TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the Swedish insurance group, said its US associate Home
Holdings plans to raise Dollars 335m through an initial public offering and
seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
The group made the announcement as it unveiled a doubling of operating
profits for the first eight months of the year to SKr975m (Dollars 121.1m)
from SKr437m. The 1992 figure excludes the impact of SKr6bn in losses
related to investments in Gota AB and two credit insurance operations.
The IPO will be in the autumn with the main aim of reducing Home's leverage.
Home is the 34th largest insurer in the US, specialising in areas such as
lawyers' professional liability insurance.
Trygg said Home's reserves would be strengthened by Dollars 290m to meet the
rigorous requirements imposed on listed US insurers. The cost will be met
partly by realised capital gains of Dollars 140m and partly by shareholders.
Trygg said its share of the reserve strengthening would wipe SKr450m off its
result.
After the IPO, the Trygg-Hansa SPP group's total ownership of Home will fall
to 47 per cent from 64 per cent, although it will have an option to purchase
a further 5-10 per cent. Mr Bjorn Sprangare, Trygg's chief executive, said
Home remained an important strategic investment.
Profits from Trygg's property and casualty business climbed 53 per cent to
SKr510m in the period. The market value of investments rose 19 per cent to
SKr21.1bn while solvency margin - the ratio of shareholders' funds to
premiums - rose to 150 per cent from 134 per cent.

FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Investors take stake in Burmese
airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Asian businessmen have taken control of Myanmar International
Airways (MIA), the Burmese airline, in the first large privatisation project
by south-east Asia's most politically-isolated country.
The Prince of Brunei, Mr Oei Hong Leong (son of the founder of Indonesia's
Sinar Mas group) and Mr Wong Fong Fui are the largest shareholders in a
consortium which has purchased 70 per cent of MIA for USDollars 10m. Burma's
military government retains 30 per cent, and has an option to move back up
to 50.4 per cent.
MIA has international landing rights for 37 countries, but little demand for
the routes and few assets. Its ageing fleet has been passed on to the
domestic airline, and a new aircraft has been leased from Royal Brunei
Airlines to fly routes between Rangoon and Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok.
Another aircraft will be taken on next year.
Mr Oei said: 'Burma is like China was 20 years ago.' His Hong Kong-listed
company, China Strategic, operates more than 200 factories in China,
injecting outside management into state-run businesses.
Mr Oei is confident that MIA will be profitable soon, once the government's
push to attract tourism and foreign investment starts to make an impact. In
1992, only 20,000 tourists visited Burma, but the government claims that
this figure will have risen to 500,000 by 1996.
The deal illustrates a changing attitude towards Burma by south-east Asia's
businessmen. A Hong Kong-led consortium is renovating the colonial Strand
Hotel in Rangoon (once one of the great hotels of Asia), and other Asian
hotel groups such as Shangri-La and New World are understood to be
considering projects.
The economy remains tightly controlled, with an artificial exchange rate - 7
kyats to the dollar, versus the black market rate of around 110 - but Mr Oei
claims that the military is committed to economic change.
Since the military takeover in 1988, Burma has been shunned by the
international community, although Korean and Thai companies are already
active investors. Mr Oei argues: 'If you isolate them, they can still
survive. But if you change the economic environment, it will change the
government.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: From drinks to the driving seat - The
challenge facing Grand Metropolitan's new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan's restless management culture yesterday produced another
surprise for its shareholders as Mr Ian Martin, group managing director, and
long viewed as heir-apparent to Sir Allen Sheppard, withdrew from his post
to become a non-executive deputy chairman.
Mr George Bull, present head of GrandMet's food operations but the former
driving force behind the development of IDV, its drinks division, becomes
the group's chief executive.
Sir Allen, having split his combined role, will continue as full-time
chairman until his retirement in 1996.
The GrandMet board, whose non-executive members include Mr Richard Giordano,
chairman of BOC, Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI, Sir Colin
Marshall, chairman of British Airways and Mr David Simon, of British
Petroleum, was unanimous in its choice of Mr Bull.
Sir Allen said yesterday: 'We had a high quality problem. The two men are
outstanding world-class executives.'
Mr Martin, 58, masterminded GrandMet's Dollars 5.8bn acquisition of the US
Pillsbury group, which included Green Giant and Burger King, in 1988. A
tough-minded Scot who came up through GrandMet's former brewing and hotels
operations, he stayed in the US to restructure Pillsbury before returning to
the UK as group managing director in early 1992.
His period in the post has been marked by a quieter style of management than
that which prevailed when GrandMet repositioned its portfolio of businesses
in the late 1980s.
Mr Bull, 57, more relaxed and urbane in manner, joined IDV in 1961, 11 years
before it was taken over by GrandMet. A skilled marketer, he became chief
executive of the division in 1984. He was closely involved in the
acquisition of Heublein in the US three years later, and led the development
of IDV into one of the world's largest drinks businesses. With established
brands such as J&amp;B Scotch whisky and Smirnoff vodka and a reputation for new
product development, IDV now contributes more than half the group's profits.
In June last year, Mr Bull was switched across the group to head its food
operations, where growth was being hit by trading conditions in the US.
Sir Allen made a point then of stressing Mr Bull's international marketing
skills - and by all accounts it was his marketing background and wider
experience of international markets that swung the board's votes.
Brand management and marketing are fundamental to GrandMet's business
strategy. Its intention is to be an international drinks, food and retailing
business. Its prospects of achieving that goal depend on its ability to
position and grow its brands.
Mr Bull said yesterday: 'I see it as my role to lead GrandMet closer to its
markets, closer to its customers. That will be vital to its long-term
growth.'
His record at IDV reassures the City. 'IDV has been a powerhouse of profit
growth and cash generation,' says Mr David Thompson, analyst at Kleinwort
Benson.
That position now has to be defended, he says, as recession affects many of
IDV's world markets.
After Guinness's setbacks this week, the market has already begun to revise
its forecasts of IDV's profits. However, IDV's market position, despite an
over-dependence on the US and Europe, has been generating good organic
growth, and it has recently made a number of acquisitions - such as Cinzano
and Metaxa - that should buttress profits.
The greater challenge for Mr Bull lies in the group's food operations. The
acquisition of Pillsbury was a critical step in GrandMet's ambition to
become a global branded food business. It gave the group a strong position
in the US and a product range with potential for international development.
The acquisition has provided reasonable returns; and the US operations are
now recovering from the effects on Green Giant of depressed trading and a
succession of harvests that produced a glut of vegetables.
However, expansion of the Pillsbury food brands into Europe and the rest of
the world has been more uncertain and slower than expected. In the global
food industry, the group languishes at number 12 - well short of its
ambitions.
Two former Pillsbury brands - Haagen-Dazs ice-cream and Burger King - have
gone from strength to strength. Burger King, once regarded as a potential
disaster area, now outshines by far GrandMet's other retailing interests.
The Pearle eye-care chain, now recovering after three years of losses,
appears to fit no more comfortably into its strategy than do its UK pubs in
the Chef &amp; Brewer chain and the Inntrepreneur joint venture. All three are
expected to be sold as soon as possible.
With debt of about Pounds 3bn, the group needs to accelerate cash generation
if it is to support the growth of its brands with further acquisitions.
No one will be more eager to promote such a policy than Mr David Nash, group
finance director, who will now become chairman and chief executive of the
food and international retailing operations.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons falls to Pounds 722,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of a substantial contraction in interest charges, pre-tax profits
at Hopkinsons Holdings, the industrial abrasives, plastic products and gas
control equipment group, showed another sharp decline over the six months to
July 31.
According to Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, the outcome, as anticipated, was
equal to the second half of the previous year at Pounds 722,000 (Pounds
1.34m).
Although Carborundum Abrasives returned to profit, Bryan Donkin Engineering,
still hit by uncertainty over the capital spending plans of British Gas, its
biggest customer, suffered a further decline in orders. Activities in
Germany continued to be affected by recession and the strong D-Mark, which
placed further pressure on sales and margins.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 51.7m (Pounds 51.3m); Mr Goodall said
that the comparison was flattered by exchange rate movements which disguised
a real decline of 6.5 per cent.
Borrowings were reduced by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 11.4m by end-July and by a
further Pounds 2.5m since then; gearing currently stands at 28 per cent (41
per cent).
After a nil tax charge, reflecting German losses and the release of tax
provisions, earnings per share emerged at 0.91p (0.89p). The interim
dividend is 0.5p (0.9p) but Mr Goodall said the intention was to maintain
the total at last year's 1.3p.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ICI ousts Hoare Govett as broker in cost
cutting move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has ousted its stockbroker of more than 65
years, Hoare Govett, an established London firm with a reputation for
representing blue chip clients.
The company, which hived off its drugs arm earlier this year to create
Zeneca, said the change of broker was the result of cost cutting following
the split. 'We are a smaller company now and we have decided we should only
have two brokers. We have worked extremely well with SG Warburg and BZW
since the demerger and we have chosen them.'
However, Hoare Govett, whose reputation lies largely with its extensive list
of blue chip clients, is bitterly upset by the decision, particularly as it
has recently been increasing its corporate list and ICI is one of its most
established clients.
Hoare had been ICI's leading broker for many years, but it was also broker
for Hanson, the international conglomerate. When Hanson launched a dawn raid
on ICI in 1991, buying 2.82 per cent of its shares, Hoare backed off and
refused to represent either side.
Subsequently, the firm, owned by Dutch bank ABN Amro, became the number
three broker behind SG Warburg and BZW. Last year, Hoare made a forecast
that ICI's profits would be well below the expectations of most market
analysts and issued a sell recommendation.
Mr Martin Evans, Hoare's chemicals analyst said 'It is very disappointing,
given our previous loyalty to the company pre- and post-Hanson, and might
reflect poor judgment at senior management level, given Hoare's
long-established reputation in the City.'
And a member of the group's corporate finance arm said: 'There was no doubt
that, since the demerger, a rethink on the chemicals side might have been
possible, but we have had a relationship with ICI since it was founded in
1926 so the news was obviously a surprise.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTNUM &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly department store, reported pre-tax profits
almost static at Pounds 2.01m for the year to July 10, against Pounds 2.15m
for the comparable period.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up slightly at Pounds 24.7m (Pounds
23.8m); profits at the operating level were marginally ahead at Pounds 1.43m
(Pounds 1.41m).
Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said the company's cash position had improved
over the year, but the sharp drop in interest rates had hit interest income,
which fell to Pounds 576,000 against Pounds 741,000.
Earnings came out at 311p (334p) per share and a second interim dividend of
14p makes a total of 100p (98p) for the year.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Ferrum Pounds 1.5m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Ferrum Holdings fell 3p to 16p as the engineering company reported
a fall to pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.49m for the six months to end-June.
The decline - from a profit of Pounds 424,000 - was forecast by Mr Simon
Miller, chairman, in his annual statement last March, and was struck on
turnover of Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 19.2m).
Trading was weak across the whole business, Mr Miller said, and the loss was
struck after 'provisions totalling Pounds 725,000 covering restructuring and
refinancing costs together with a general provision against contracts'.
In addition, tax changes announced in the March budget had held back
exploration activity in the North Sea, which adversely affected the services
division.
Losses per share came out at 4.6p (0.97p earnings) and in view of the
results the interim dividend is passed, against 1.1p.
However, following the reorganisation the group would now operate on a lower
cost base.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Commodities (Week in the markets): LME metal stocks top 4m
tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LME WAREHOUSE stocks of all base metals topped the 4m-tonne mark for the
first time ever this week, underlining the parlous state of the world metals
markets as traders wait with increasing impatience for the promised world
economic recovery.
More than half the total was in aluminium stocks, which rose this week by
31,850 tonnes to a record 2,187,175, so it was fitting that that metal
should be among the weakest on the exchange. The three months position
closed last night at a five-month low of Dollars 1,119.50 a tonne, unchanged
on the day but Dollars 19 down on the week.
The contract had begun the week with a test of resistance around Dollars
1,140 a tonne, but when this prove unbreachable the price quickly slipped
back. It rallied half-heartedly on Thursday morning as part of the general
LME response to the political turmoil in Russia, but, like the other metals,
it was soon back on its downward course.
Aluminium did not register the biggest proportionate fall on the week,
however, that was the lead market's dubious distinction. Despite rallying
Dollars 7.25 yesterday the three months lead prices ended Dollars 8.25 down
on the week at Dollars 380.50 a tonne. In the absence of fresh news traders
attributed the earlier fall to a seven-year low to long-liquidation against
a background of depressed consumer interest.
Enjoying better fortunes this week were two of the exchange's biggest recent
losers - tin and nickel.
Three months tin edged down to a fresh 20-year low of Dollars 4,377.50 a
tonne on Monday before the technically-inspired sellers who had driven the
market ever lower in recent weeks decided that enough was enough and
switched to being technically-inspired buyers. The ensuing rally was halted
by resistance above the Dollars 4,600-mark on Thursday, but yesterday the
three months price was able to move on to Dollars 4,627.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 240 on the week.
There was nothing technical about nickel's late strength, which left the
three months contract Dollars 43.50 up on the week at Dollars 4,390 a tonne.
On Thursday it was announced that Inco of Canada, the biggest producer of
the metal, was to discuss production cuts and other cost-reducing measures
with unions.
The move came within days of the LME three months nickel price dropping
below the equivalent of Dollars 2 a lb, the level many analysts had
identified as the 'crunch point' at which some big producers might be forced
into the retrenchment they have been so stubbornly resisting in the face of
soaring stocks, swollen by a big increase in shipments from the former
Soviet Union, and plummetting prices.
Zinc was also a gainer early in the week, as the market built on last week's
technical rally. But trade and merchant selling was attracted as three
months metal moved above Dollars 900 a tonne and the price ended the week
Dollars 1.50 down on balance at Dollars 892 a tonne.
The copper market continued the slide started by the sudden ending last week
of the supply squeeze that had been propping up nearby delivery positions
until the three months price hit bottom on Tuesday at Dollars 1,733 a tonne.
A period of consolidation ensued and by yesterday's close the price had
recovered to Dollars 1,766.50 a tonne, down Dollars 2 on the week.
A more direct consequence of the ending of the squeeze was the disappearnce
of the cash delivery premium over three months metal, which had recently
been as high as Dollars 80 a tonne, and its replacement by a discount that
reached Dollars 20 a tonne this week before narrowing to Dollars 15 at
yesterday's close. (Except when nearby availability is tight cash metal
usually trades at a discount to forward positions, reflecting the costs of
holding physical metal - principally storage, insurance and lost interest.)
Cocoa continued to be the star turn at the London Commodity Exchange this
week, the December futures position following last week's Pounds 47 rise
with a further Pounds 33 advance to Pounds 936 a tonne. That was trimmed
back to Pounds 918 at yesterday's close, but market sentiment remained
bullish and some traders were looking for an early test resistance at Pounds
949 a tonne, the peak reached in the summer of 1990. The more cautious
noted, however, that this week's rise could be explained largely by the
weakness of sterling against the US dollar, in which most international
trade in cocoa is conducted.
The LCE's robusta coffee market continued to display the hesitation that had
characterised last week's performance, following the exceptionally big gains
of the preceding month. Having been boosted largely by growing confidence in
the resolve of producers to make their export retention scheme work the
market's bullish mood appeared to be fading with the approach of the start
of the scheme next Friday.
As the market, which some traders thought had become a little 'overbought',
bowed to US selling pressure the November robustas price retreated by
Dollars 69 to Dollars 1,225 a tonne in the first half of the week.
The fall was partly due to doubts circulating in the market about Brazil's
ability to finance the necessary withholding of coffee beans from the
market. That ghost was laid, however, by an announcement from Brasilia that
financial arrangements for the scheme were already in place and the London
market gained in confidence.
Renewed buying took the December price up to Dollars 1,299 a tonne
yesterday, but then the rally ran out of steam and by the close it was back
at Dollars 1,264 a tonne, down Dollars 30 on balance.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 32m loss on tool hire sale hits
Mowlem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim losses at Mowlem soared to Pounds 41.8m after a Pounds 32m loss on a
tool hire business it sold recently. Excluding the charge, the pre-tax loss
and turnover were static at Pounds 9.8m and Pounds 658m, but the contractor
and housebuilder maintained the interim dividend at 2p believing
cost-cutting efforts will pay off next year.
'The benefit of cost-cutting measures will be clearly apparent in the 1994
results and the overall financial strength of the group means we are
maintaining the interim dividend,' said Sir Philip Beck, chairman.
'While there are some signs of recovery in the overall UK economy, the
improvement is still weak, uneven and, as widely reported, shows few signs
of feeding through into the construction industry,' he added.
Sir Philip said he expected the company to incur a full-year pre-tax loss
'broadly similar' to last time's Pounds 38.5m, before the loss on the
disposal of the profitable HSS Hire Service Group in May for Pounds 52m.
Under new accounting requirements Mowlem reinstated to reserves Pounds 42.5m
of goodwill previously written off, offset by a Pounds 32m loss on the
disposal based on the original purchase price. The net effect was a Pounds
10m gain in shareholders funds.
The first-half 1992 pre-tax loss was Pounds 10m on turnover of Pounds 652m.
Losses per share were 39.5p (9.7p loss before the charge) against losses of
9.3p a year earlier. For the fifth time, Mowlem has dipped into reserves,
withdrawing Pounds 2.3m to pay the Pounds 2.2m interim dividend.
All divisions recorded operating losses except scaffolding, which made
profits of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 1.8m), and contracting, which broke even
compared with a Pounds 500,000 loss last time. Housing incurred a loss of
Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 500,000 profits), while aviation was Pounds 2.4m
(Pounds 2.5m) in the red.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Thorn chairman answers Rent-A-Center
critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN SIR Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, got out of his New York
hotel bed at 6 am last Wednesday morning, he noticed that a fax from his
London office had been slipped under the door.
It was a copy of an article from that day's Wall Street Journal, alleging
that employees of Thorn's Rent-A-Center business in the US had used guns,
gangs of Hell's Angels and other unorthodox methods to deal with customers
who had fallen behind on rental payments.
It ruined Sir Colin's day.
Yesterday, back in London after several days of previously-arranged US
meetings, Sir Colin launched an emotional defence of Rent-A-Center, which
rents out anything from televisions to necklaces.
'I don't recognise our business from this article,' he said.
'I'm sure that out of 7,000 people we employ we're bound to have a few who
don't work to the standards we expect.'
But Rent-A-Center customers, he added, 'get treated like kings and queens.
These people get treated normally in 99,999 cases out of 100,000.'
The City was concerned enough to mark Thorn's shares down on three
successive days. Yesterday they closed at 922p, down 66p on their Wednesday
morning opening.
Foremost in the minds of London analysts was the fear that the article would
result in US federal legislation limiting the profits of the rental
subsidiary.
But there was also a mood of distaste for what Rent-A-Center was alleged to
have done.
An internal note on Thorn circulated at one London stockbroker yesterday
noted in shocked tones that the article had claimed that 'Rent-A-Center
employees have taken sexual favours in lieu of cash.'
Sir Colin said Rent-A-Center management were investigating every allegation
in the article. If he was dissatisfied with the outcome, Thorn would send in
its own investigators. But he could already say that the Hell's Angels
allegation was 'nonsense'; so was the story about the guns.
The article had been based on the word of former employees who had been
dismissed by the company. Many of those named, he alleged, had taken jobs
elsewhere in the rental business. The idea that their consciences had
provoked them to speak out was 'balderdash'.
It was unfair to say Rent-A-Center made excessive profits, Sir Colin said.
The article was wrong in saying the business had a 23 per cent operating
margin in 1992-93, he said. This failed to take into account central
marketing and other overhead costs. The true margin was about 12 per cent.
Sir Colin did not deny that 25 per cent of Rent-A-Center customers continued
their payments until they gained ownership of goods and ended up paying far
more than if they had bought them outright at the start.
The average rental item passed through 2.2 hands, he said. This meant there
were times when the goods were in Rent-A-Center shops earning nothing. The
business was also renting to people with no credit rating and was entitled
to some financial compensation for taking on that risk. No one else was
prepared to extend credit to the typical Rent-a-Center customer, he said.
He strongly doubted there would be federal legislation defining rent-to-own
as a credit transaction. This could lead to limits on the interest
Rent-A-Center could charge.
If, as Sir Colin alleged, the article contained false allegations, would
Thorn be suing the Wall Street Journal for defamation, either in the UK or
the US? 'No,' he said. 'We can't believe there's any point in a UK company
chasing a US paper like the Wall Street Journal.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon to float off US assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIS CORROON, one of the UK's leading insurance companies, has announced
its intention to float off most of its US underwriting operations, in a move
that would effectively complete the concentration on broking operations
begun in 1991.
The flotation of about 56 per cent of Gryphon, the holding company for
Associated International Insurance and Calvert Insurance, might raise
between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m, according to analysts.
Mr John Robins, finance director, said the flotation would allow the group
to focus on broking, consultancy and risk management. 'Underwriting is not
where we want to add extra capital,' he said.
Calvert and Associated, with net assets at the year-end of Dollars 71m
(Pounds 46m) would be relatively small in US insurance market terms. The
companies write speciality commercial and casualty insurance, particularly
for small to medium-sized clients.
Analysts said the sale would be unlikely to raise substantially more than
book value, and would not greatly strengthen the balance sheet. It would,
however, improve group liquidity.
Last month Willis Corroon halved its dividend following a decision to
improve its cash position. It continues to make losses on liabilities
incurred by Sovereign, the UK underwriting company, before it was closed in
1991.
In the year to December 31 1992, Gryphon contributed Pounds 9.9m to group
pre-tax profits of Pounds 42.5m, down from Pounds 67.1m, due to a Pounds
25.7m increase in provisions at Sovereign.
This provision covered claims from Hurricane Hugo and other natural
catastrophes from 1989, 1990 and 1991.
Willis Corroon said it expected the offering to take place in the fourth
quarter of this year. Smith Barney Shearson, Goldman Sachs and Lehman
Brothers will manage the underwriting of the offering in the US.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Docks bid raises eyebrows and ire - The
furore over Medway Ports' Pounds 104m sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE question arising from Mersey Docks and Harbours' Pounds 103.7m agreed
bid for Medway Ports has raised not only eyebrows but ire. That is: why are
shares which were valued in February and traded in June at a price of Pounds
2.50 now worth Pounds 37.25?
The huge difference in value has brought threats of legal action against
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants which valued the shares, from those who -
they feel - were forced to sell them at Pounds 2.50. So far, neither KPMG
nor Medway Ports have received writs, and many believe the protestors do not
have a claim.
KPMG will only say: 'At the time the valuation was carried out by KPMG there
was great uncertainty involving the labour force at the Medway Ports; there
was certainly no potential purchaser on the horizon at that time.'
One other adviser to Medway Ports said yesterday: 'Hindsight is a wonderful
thing. You have to remember why the valuation was done and what has changed
since. KPMG did a thorough job.'
He said that the valuation was done for internal share transfers in a
private company, where buyers and sellers had to be matched. Such values are
generally lower than an equivalent public company would expect.
At the time of the Medway Ports valuation there was uncertainty over the
long term profitability of the group and there was no prospect of an early
exit for investors.
When the government privatised Medway Ports, which owns the Sheerness and
Chatham docks, in March 1992 there was only one bidder, a management and
employee buy out which offered Pounds 29.7m. The employees bought shares at
Pounds 1 each.
By the end of last year the company was embroiled in a bitter dispute with
some of its workforce. The company wanted to cut wages and increase working
hours, doing away with working practices which it considered hampered its
chances of retaining customers and increasing profits.
One adviser said yesterday: 'The company's financial state was parlous, it
was right up against its bank covenants. It could have gone under.'
The dispute ended in the redundancy of 269 dockers, who were then obliged to
sell their shares because they ceased to be employees. The bitter irony for
them is that their departure in large part transformed the group's fortunes,
and made it attractive.
By the summer, the group was looking at an early flotation and a number of
trade buyers appeared enabling Medway to extract the offer from Mersey
Docks.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker considering options over
William Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the heavily-indebted leisure and property group which releases
its interim results on Monday, is looking at the possibility of retaining
its William Hill betting shop chain, rather than floating or selling it.
The group is considering two offers for William Hill. The Warburg
consortium, which opened the bidding with a Pounds 360m cash offer, is
understood to have upped its bid to between Pounds 450m and Pounds 475m.
This offer is structured to allow Brent Walker to retain a sizeable, though
minority, stake. This would enable the lossmaking group to share in any
recovery and growth the betting chain achieved.
The other offer, thought to be lower than Warburg's, is from a consortium
led by CinVEN and Legal and General.
William Hill is also pursuing the flotation option. It has appointed
sponsors and is interviewing potential public relations advisers next week.
Sober estimates of the likely value at flotation are in the Pounds 520m to
Pounds 540m region.
It is thought a trade sale could be completed sooner than a flotation and it
would not be subject to the vagaries of the stock market.
Standard Chartered, the lead bank in the Brent Walker syndicate, confirmed
yesterday that it had started talks with the other lenders about refinancing
the Pounds 350m William Hill syndicate. William Hill, which is ring-fenced
from the rest of Brent Walker, has to repay its loan by March 1 next year.
It is thought that Brent Walker would also seek to raise new money from its
banks, although StanChart would not comment on this. With the values put on
William Hill by the trade offers and the flotation estimates, Brent Walker
now has a better chance to convince its banks to take on the William Hill
debt. William Hill is cash generative and if the ring fence can be removed
and the chain absorbed within Brent Walker it could improve the prospects
for the group as a whole.
Brent Walker's results are expected to show an improvement in trading at
William Hill, thanks to evening opening and despite the fiasco of the Grand
National. However, the group's pub business is thought to be under pressure.
Massive interest charges will turn operating profits into pre-tax losses.
The loss for the first half of 1992 was Pounds 79.4m although operating
profits were Pounds 29.5m. Interest totalled Pounds 108m. In the whole of
1992 operating profit was Pounds 49.5m, but pre-tax losses were Pounds
427.4m after interest of Pounds 204.4m and exceptionals of Pounds 246m.

FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hepworth bullish despite fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S construction sector took heart yesterday from bullish statements
by Hepworth, the building materials and boiler group, which said it had
spotted definite signs of recovery in the UK, in spite of a 16 per cent fall
in interim pre-tax profits.
Mr John Carter, chief executive, said the outlook for trading was now more
promising than in recent years. 'There are pockets of recovery appearing
right across our operations, particularly in building products,' he said.
The group was announcing a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 32.8m to
Pounds 27.5m for the six months to June 30. Sales were 4 per cent higher at
Pounds 331.9m.
Mr Carter said the results in the first half were 30 per cent better than in
the second half of 1992, reflecting the savings achieved in a wide-ranging
cost reduction programme and the upturn in the UK. Hepworth cut some 500
jobs in the first half, mostly in the UK. Mr Carter said a further 200 would
be taken from the remaining 8,500 staff, mainly in the continental European
businesses.
Operating profits were down in all divisions, but Mr Carter said Saunier
Duval, the group's French boiler subsidiary, had performed well in difficult
circumstances. Saunier Duval, which fell 7 per cent at the operating level
to Pounds 12.5m, had been hit by weak currencies in its main export markets,
Spain and Italy.
Hepworth's building products division showed a slight decline in operating
profits from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 11.1m, on sales down 1.5 per cent to
Pounds 79.2m. Mr Carter said the decline had been cushioned by cost cutting.
Home products fell 21 per cent to Pounds 5m, while minerals and chemicals
came in Pounds 2m lower at Pounds 3.5m. Refractories fell 20 per cent to
Pounds 3.7m.
Earnings per share fell from 11.3p to 9.1p and the dividend is maintained at
5.5p.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Staff are bearing cost of higher
education changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID TRIESMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several features of the chancellor's statement on pay in the public sector
are worthy of further exploration ('Unions warn of 'chaos' over public pay
stance', September 15).
First, we have argued that a specific element of additional direct taxation
should he spent on higher education. The Treasury has always replied that it
is opposed in principle to hypothecated taxes. The chancellor has now
decided to introduce what is a bizarre form of hypothecated taxation applied
to higher education staff. Their employers have received increased income
because of growth in student numbers and despite 'efficiency savings'. They
are being told not to spend any of this money on staff pay increases and I
can only assume that it will be spent on current or future provision in each
institution.
In short, the staff have been taxed specifically to provide for any changes
in provision in their place of work as an alternative to doing so through
general taxation. And so it will be for nurses, doctors and health ancillary
staff. They will be 'taxed' to provide for change in their places of work.
Second, the chancellor has drawn attention to payment in return for
productivity. While that is not easily measured in some areas of public
provision, I can report that in six years the number of higher education
students has grown by 50 per cent, the number of staff by only 10 per cent,
and the decrease in the unit of resource is 20 per cent. The FT might find
it interesting to identify a single area of British industry which competes
with this success story. I suspect, unworthy though the thought may be, that
we will not be offered a pay settlement which reflects these productivity
accomplishments. Some reason for denying the chancellor's proposition will
be pleaded in aid and he will do the pleading.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK small business needs industrial
banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At last the Bank of England is taking some action to support small
business in the UK ('Bank governor calls in clearers', September 21).
The British financial system will impede the recovery from recession, as it
has impeded the development of the British economy for decades. When five to
seven years is regarded as long-term by the venture capitalists, who must
have their exit route in place on day one of their investment, and who
demand rates of return two or three times higher than those in Germany or
Japan, how can any company organise itself for long-term structured growth
and development in market share? The simple answer is, it can't. Instead it
has to concentrate on avoiding risk, short-term cost minimisation (equals
lack of investment) and production of 'satisfactory' results. We should be
asking ourselves who these results are satisfying.
The banks and investment institutions are not just providers of funds; they
actively influence the investment decisions and priorities of business
people by their short-term performance criteria, their demands for personal
assets as collateral, their preference for the fast-buck sectors rather than
the lower-performing manufacturing sectors, in terms of return and their
investment decisions and allocations being determined by quarterly reports.
In short, we need an industrial banking sector - a bank for business,
creating solutions and opportunities, not liquidations and bankruptcies.
Unless our financial institutions can become partners in the quest for jobs,
expansion and economic prosperity, any 'recovery' will be superficial and
transitory, with the real decline of UK plc in the world marketplace
continuing remorselessly.

FT  25 SEP 93 / A priest in turbulent times: The Japanese leader's first 50
days in office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa has taken the priestly approach to prime ministership.
At public gatherings, he stands with hands clasped before him, head slightly
bowed, and delivers small sermons to his flock on the virtues of good
government, the vices of regulation, and the need to confront Japan's
wartime guilt.
His style is in striking contrast to his sometimes arrogant predecessors at
the Liberal Democratic party, thrown out of office in a July election at
which the public showed its desire for change from the party's habitual
corruption and backroom intrigues.
But altering Japan's political structure requires more than a congenial
personality. The big question after Mr Hosokawa's first 50 days in office is
whether he can change the electoral system and weed out corruption in
government before the seven-party coalition collapses under the weight of
personal and policy differences. Could this priest end up a martyr?
The coalition has already put together a small but honourable list of
achievements. Mr Hosokawa has introduced a Y6,150bn (Pounds 38bn) package to
stimulate the economy, overseen a cut in official interest rates, agreed on
the framework of electoral reform, begun snipping away at regulations
restraining economic freedom, and avoided the chaos predicted by some
political observers.
Mr Hosokawa will go to the US on an official visit today knowing that about
70 per cent of Japanese, according to opinion polls, apparently like his
style, if not his substance. President Bill Clinton, whom he will meet on
Monday, might feel a touch envious that another provincial governor elevated
to the national leadership has had such early success in office. Mr Hosokawa
will explain to his US counterpart the thinking behind his economic
measures, which came partly in response to US pressure on Japan to curb its
record current account surplus.
But the high domestic approval rating of Mr Hosokawa is as much a measure of
expectations as of achievements. The prime minister conceded the point in
parliament this week: 'I am well aware that the real time of testing starts
now.'
In his short time in office Mr Hosokawa has made surprising progress but he
still has much to do. The coalition has shifted economic debate towards
consumers and away from the traditional focus of the producer. But it has
yet to deliver the policy changes that would put the consumer permanently at
the centre. And Mr Hosokawa's deregulation drive is run by bureaucrats who
have, so far, conceded mainly superficial reductions in their power.
Critics suggest that Mr Hosokawa is charming but indecisive. 'I don't know
who is making the decisions, but I know that it is not Mr Hosokawa,' says Ms
Makiko Tanaka, daughter of former LDP prime minister Kakuei Tanaka and newly
elected to parliament herself.
Unstated in her observation was the suggestion that Mr Hosokawa is the pawn
of a more powerful player: Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former power-broker behind
the scenes at the LDP. Mr Ozawa is now performing a similar role at the
Japan Renewal party, a coalition partner run by the LDP defectors who
brought down the government of Mr Hosokawa's predecessor, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa.
Mr Ozawa manoeuvred Mr Hosokawa into the prime minister's job by negotiating
a deal with the disparate coalition parties. The popular wisdom is that Mr
Ozawa needs time for the public to forget his associations with politicians
facing corruption charges. According to this view, when Mr Ozawa feels the
time is right he is likely to make a bid for the prime ministership. In the
meantime he is happy to let Mr Hosokawa's fine reputation hang on the fate
of a fractious coalition.
It is a sign of Mr Hosokawa's early success that Mr Ozawa and his associates
at the JRP are edgy. Many JRP members hope that Mr Hosokawa's team will only
be an interim administration to prepare the way for a JRP-led government.
One JRP leader said economic or foreign affairs matters should not
'distract' him from political reform: 'I don't think we have the time to
deal with other issues.'
But Japan's unexpectedly deep economic downturn has obliged Mr Hosokawa to
devote much time to 'other issues'. The economy appears to have moved
officially into 'recession' this quarter, the second consecutive period of
decline in gross national product.
The government also faces challenges on several other fronts:
Income tax. It is under growing pressure to cut rates from business leaders,
concerned that failing consumer confidence is undermining growth. But the
government cannot deliver because the JRP and the Socialists are divided on
how to finance the income tax reduction.
Deregulation. A reduction in costly burdens on business will assist
long-term economic growth, and Mr Hosokawa is planning to launch a more
radical deregulation drive than the 94 measures announced in recent weeks.
But bureaucrats are, not surprisingly, unwilling to deregulate away their
own considerable powers. Political reform. Mr Hosokawa has been obliged to
scale back plans for a ban on corporate donations to political parties. But
the procession of contractors and provincial politicians through the Tokyo
Detention Centre is a reminder of the need for action. Mr Teruzo Yoshino,
chairman of Shimizu, the country's largest contractor, was arrested this
week for allegedly attempting to bribe a prefectural governor.
Foreign policy. Mr Hosokawa has apologised for Japan's wartime brutality,
but there is the unresolved question of whether Japan wants permanent
membership of the UN Security Council. Several coalition partners believe a
permanent seat is a necessary part of Japan's growing international role,
though the Socialists fear a re-emergence of militaristic sentiment.
If the Socialists or the JRP withdraw support over this or another of the
divisive issues, the coalition will collapse. But both parties would risk
rejection at the next general election if they could not convince voters
that their withdrawal of support from a popular administration was
justified.
Mr Hosokawa has earned such popularity by keeping his promise to introduce a
more open style of government. He may not be able to answer tough questions.
But he has not resorted to the purposefully confusing double and triple
negatives favoured by his predecessors in their sentence structure.
The longer Mr Hosokawa tries to keep the answers straight, the more
difficult it will be for his successor, LDP or not, to revert to the old,
obtuse ways. For now, the priestly prime minister has convinced much of his
congregation that there is life after the LDP.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Market regime may be possible, but
not necessarily preferable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER GREY

<TEXT>
Sir, A single market, let alone a common market or a free trade area, can
indeed, as Sir Alan Walters claimed (Letters, September 22), get by without
the stable ('pegged') exchange rates, let alone the single currency, he so
abhors. But is the one, given convergence on a stability-oriented regime,
better off without than with the other?
Would the existing US single market, for example, benefit from each of the
US federal states sporting a separate currency of its own, and multiple
(internal as well as external) exchange rates, in place of the single
('almighty') dollar? Possible, of course, 'like a dog's walking on his
hinder legs'. But preferable?

FT  25 SEP 93 / Another long march to the next hurdle: China's dashed
Olympic hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chen Xitong, head of China's Olympic Bid Committee, sought to put the
best face on what must have proved a crushing disappointment for Chinese
officials.
In the end, China's hopes were dashed not, one suspects, so much because the
International Olympic Committee delegates had reservations about the
technical aspects of Beijing's bid, but because a sufficient number were
concerned about its human rights record.
Speaking by satellite television to a subdued nation, Mr Chen, a politburo
member, congratulated Sydney, and said the close result showed that China
had commanded considerable support. 'It was a remarkable achievement, which
underscored the success of our open door policy and programme of reform.' He
said he felt 'calm', and reminded people that he had always said there were
two possibilities: Beijing would either win, or it would lose.
The latter, almost inconceivable, result had tended to be discounted in the
last days before votes were tallied, since Beijing had become a hot
favourite, and Sydney's price had lengthened. China appeared to have
convinced itself that victory was a formality, hence the shocked reactions
in Beijing and other Chinese cities when Sydney's name was called.
The question is what effect the setback, and more to the point, loss of
face, will have on a government which had invested so much in winning the
nomination for reasons of politics and national pride.
An early indication of fall-out from the bruising experience suffered by
Chinese IOC delegates, many of them Communist party officials unused to the
free-for-all of a democratic ballot in which the result cannot be
preordained, may come as early as next Friday in New York. Then China's
foreign minister Qian Qichen is due to meet Douglas Hurd, UK foreign
secretary, to discuss Hong Kong.
The encounter may well be icy, since Beijing is certain to be highly
displeased with Mr Hurd's strong intervention on the eve of the Olympic
ballot in which he declared that China's human rights record should
disqualify it from being awarded the Games. The fact that Mr Hurd made his
remarks in Sydney will have sharpened China's displeasure.
Raising the stakes ahead of the Hurd-Qian meeting was the publication
yesterday on the front of a pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily of 11-year-old
remarks by senior leader Deng Xiaoping in which he warned that China could
take over Hong Kong before 1997 if 'serious disturbances' arose.
At best, it would seem likely that difficult moments lie ahead in
Sino-British relations as pressures increase for a resolution of the vexed
argument over proposals by Hong Kong governor Chris Patten for greater
democracy in the lead-up to the 1997 handover.
But it seems unlikely that Chinese officials, even in the depths of their
disappointment, would want to risk the accusation that they have been bad
losers. Indeed, in their initial public statements they sought to put the
issue behind them, and to look forward. These officials must know, however,
that human rights questions will continue to dog China when it seeks to play
a role on a global stage.
A crackdown on dissent in the next few weeks would convey an extremely
negative signal internationally, and would expose China to the charge that
its apparent softening on human rights issues - it released several
high-profile dissidents on the eve of the Monte Carlo vote - was merely a
cynical exercise in window-dressing.
If nothing else, the loss to Sydney poses a substantial challenge to China's
propaganda machine, which faces the task of explaining what went wrong,
after barely countenancing the possibility of failure. The People's Daily,
the Communist party newspaper, noted yesterday that this was the third
Australian bid in recent years, and so China should not feel despondent. 'In
the old society, China was a sick man,' it declared, 'but not any more.'
The headline over the editorial also struck a note of defiance which was
revealing perhaps of a feeling in Beijing that much of the rest of the
world, and the west in particular, had ganged up against its Olympic bid.
'We unflinchingly face the world,' it read over a commentary vowing that
China would not give up its goals of reform.
There seems little doubt that Beijing will bid again in 2004 and, barring
disasters of Tiananmen-like proportions, it will be difficult for IOC
delegates to deny China's wishes a second time. What is certain is that if
it does try again, its campaign will be even more awesome than its efforts
on this occasion, and that would be saying something. Never in Olympic
history had there been anything quite like Beijing's attempts to win the
2000 Olympiad.
Like the scarcely believable times achieved by its women track athletes in
recent days, it revealed an astonishing single-mindedness in pursuit of the
nomination. Few national projects, including the construction in less than
one year of the giant Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen square in the
late 1950s, could match the effort devoted to winning the Olympic
nomination.
Mr Chen Xitong and his associates face an unenviable task over the next four
years in their preparations for a second assault on the IOC summit. A second
failure would be unthinkable.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Complexities threaten pension schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD GRACEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write in response to the article 'Minimum pension may be scrapped'
(September 18/19).
The removal of the existing impossibly complex Guaranteed Minimum Pension
requirements is essential for the future of contracting out. It must be
viewed, however, in the context of an equally necessary overall objective -
the simplification of the present spider's web of pensions conditions as a
precursor to increased security. Existing Inland Revenue and Department of
Social Security requirements have produced a degree of frustration and
despair among scheme administrators and employers that must be virtually
unparalleled.
Indeed, in a survey we conducted among finance directors of some 300 UK
companies, one in three said any additional complicating legislation, with
resultant increased costs, would cause them to consider scaling down or
winding up existing company schemes.
In our view, true simplification is attainable only by examining the purpose
of each set of requirements, ensuring that it is really valid and then, if
so, devising an alternative way of achieving the same goal. Our
recommendations to the DSS and Goode Committee have stressed the need for
simplification involving a complete redesign of the current Heath Robinson
structure.
The private sector will only be able to fill the pensions gap, left by the
inevitable rolling back of state provision, when radical simplification has
taken place. This must have as its cornerstone the integration of DSS and
Inland Revenue requirements. There is a strong case for a co-ordinated
ministerial approach to pensions policy, for departmental co-ordination in
giving that policy statutory effect, and for a single regulator covering all
pension matters other than investment management. Without such
co-ordination, problems arising from conflicting objectives within
government will always remain.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Flash Harrys in sober suits: The new, less charismatic breed
of UK entrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleven years ago Mr Geoff Brown, a computer programmer turned rock musician,
spent Pounds 200 on computer games from the US which he started selling in
his home city of Birmingham.
Next month CentreGold, the company he created, will be floated on the stock
market and is expected to be valued at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m. By
selling some of his shares - he refuses to disclose how many - Mr Brown will
become a multi-millionaire with more than Pounds 1m in cash. He will own at
least 30 per cent of the company.
CentreGold, which distributes and publishes computer and video games, is not
the only fast-growing UK company planning to take advantage of the buoyancy
of the stock market to raise finance for expansion. In the eight months to
the end of August, 95 companies were floated - compared with 82 in the whole
1992, the lowest level since 1985. Another 40-50 companies have announced
they intend to go public before the end of this year.
The flurry of activity is some way from equalling the heyday of the late
1980s, when a rapidly growing economy fuelled investors' appetites for
untested but potentially lucrative new stocks.
There is now a more sober, post-recession mood among financial institutions:
there are questions about the risks involved in investing in companies whose
future is at least as uncertain as that of their pre-recession counterparts.
Some, such as CentreGold, are the first in their business sector to float,
leaving investors with no comparable measure of their likely future
performance. Mr David Nolder, corporate financier with stockbroker Smith New
Court, says: 'I think you need a particularly convincing story to take to
the institutions these days.'
Mirroring the City's scepticism, there is also a more sober style among the
entrepreneurs themselves. Rather than the high profiles adopted by some in
the 1980s - epitomised, perhaps, by Sir Terence Conran, who founded the
retail Storehouse group - the new generation of self-made businessmen
deliberately avoids any hint of excess or flamboyance.
'I do not have nor do I intend to have a yacht in the Mediterranean,' says
Mr Michael Peagram, this week voted Venturer of the Year, and head of
Holliday Chemical Holdings, the chemicals group floated in March. He paid
just Pounds 50,000 for a 25 per cent stake in 1985, and today his 20 per
cent holding is worth Pounds 37m. 'The biggest change that it gives me is a
position of influence to share my beliefs about business management.'
Mr John Houlihan, head of the small companies research team at the stock
brokers Hoare Govett, says recession means entrepreneurs are more pragmatic
by character. 'I don't think you will find many with charisma. They have had
to be boring managers coping with adversity. And when the chips are down,
charisma does not actually get you very far.'
Mr Brown is among the more extravagant of the new entrepreneurs. He likes
fast cars, music and designer clothes. But he is hardly an extrovert. His
small office is in a Birmingham industrial estate; the only luxury is a
stereo system. He is relaxed about his millionaire status and says it will
make no difference to his life. Most of his wealth will be in shares; the
cash will be his cushion against possible hard times in the future - 'drop
dead money', Mr Brown calls it.
The biggest change, he says, came much earlier in his career, once it was
clear that his passion for computers was turning into a lucrative business.
'Within three years from the start I was able to afford a better house and a
nice car,' he says. Today, Mr Brown drives a Jaguar for work and a Mercedes
sports car for fun. What about the Ferraris and Porsches he used to drive in
the early days of new-found wealth? 'Oh, they are all gone,' he says. 'All
those toy cars have gone.'
The son of a Birmingham scaffolder, Mr Brown says his biggest indulgences
have been a seven-bedroom Victorian country house and a Yamaha grand piano,
both bought last year. He says his wife, who also owns her own business, has
furnished their home with antiques. Wealth has, perhaps, brought a greater
appreciation of quality: 'I used to think antiques were second-hand
furniture,' he says.
After travelling extensively as a professional keyboard player for 10 years
in the 1970s, he says he is not interested in living flamboyantly: 'I have
done my sex, drugs, and rock and roll.'
Another stock market entrant, Mr David Jones, a Welsh miner's son who
founded Sharelink, the telephone-based stockbroker which was floated in the
summer, says the first draw on his new-found wealth will be ensuring
financial security for his family.
He has cashed in shares worth Pounds 1.8m to pay for a new house and to set
up trusts for the education of his three young children. He drives a Volvo
estate and a Porsche, 'which I had a long time before I had any money'.
Nevertheless, Mr Jones still owns 14 per cent of Sharelink, worth Pounds
7.7m.
He is not alone among entrepreneurs in refraining from taking profits when
their companies come to the market. Mr David Lloyd, the tennis player who
founded the sports and leisure group named after him, and Dr Chai Patel, a
medical doctor turned financier, who started the nursing home company Court
Cavendish, both bought more shares on flotation. 'I have a better living
because I am paid a higher salary,' says Mr Lloyd, who holds 10 per cent of
David Lloyd Leisure worth about Pounds 10.4m. 'But I haven't realised any
cash.'
Dr Patel, whose 3 per cent stake in Court Cavendish is valued at Pounds
1.3m, intends to devote part of his dividend earnings to a charity he is
founding called Mustard Seed. It will support healthcare and training issues
in the UK and abroad.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman of Badgerline, the west country bus company
which plans a share flotation in November, says: 'The reason for coming to
the market is the development of the company, not my bank account.' His
original Pounds 30,000 stake, bought in 1986, is expected to be worth about
Pounds 13m after flotation, but he intends to keep his Ford Granada car and
the three-bedroom country cottage which he, his wife and three year-old son
bought four years ago. 'That is probably the only change that we have had,
or will have,' he says.
Mr Graham Wilson, a farmer's son and accountant, borrowed at least Pounds
100,000 in 1989 and arranged other financial backing to buy Parkdean Leisure
for Pounds 7m in 1989 from construction group Beazer. Parkdean, which owns
seven caravan and chalet holiday parks in Scotland and East Anglia, is
likely to be valued at about Pounds 15m when it comes to the market in
October. After flotation, Mr Wilson expects to wipe out his debt, take a
little cash, and hold a 4 per cent stake in the enlarged company.
I will be comfortably off financially,' he says, but his first indulgence
will be modest - a lifelong season ticket to Newcastle United football club.
He intends to continue driving his second-hand company car, but may spend
the 'odd weekend' playing golf, staying at the luxury Gleneagles hotel in
Scotland. 'I have also become partial to Jaeger suits,' he admits.
Nevertheless, 'the biggest thing has been having that cloud of debt lifted'.
His image of relative thrift, and that of his counterparts, is probably
shrewd in the 1990s as Britain starts to emerge from a recession which
forced thousands of small businesses into receivership. Mr Houlihan, of
Hoare Govett, says financial institutions are looking at the long-term
stability of companies. 'Investors are now meaner and more sober than they
used to be,' he says.
On the other hand, the tougher environment means companies approaching
flotation are already well tested. 'Anyone who came through the recession of
1990-92 had to be made of fairly stern stuff,' Mr Houlihan says.
He does not believe, however, that the flamboyant entrepreneur - whose
success depends on high economic growth - is dead. 'They never die, they
just go into hibernation. When the climate gets overheated again, they'll be
back.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Iron fist and an iron glove: Yeltsin has won the first round
in his struggle, but can he hold Russia together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Handsome, bluff and straight, grey-haired but young for a politician, acting
President Alexander Rutskoi played his part well. Late Thursday night in the
Russian parliament, he took the podium and struck the right note, patriotic
but not rabid: 'This is not an assault on the deputies and the parliament:
it is an assault on the citizens of Russia, on their children and
grandchildren. Each of you stand before a choice - to defend, or not to
defend, your rights, your statehood, your future.'
But he spoke to one of the smaller audiences of his political life. Before
him sprawled little more than half the full complement of the Congress of
People's Deputies. Inside the White House, a few television monitors gave a
fixed, fuzzy picture of the parliamentary chairmen on the podium, with the
acting president on the rostrum, speaking into a void. No TV or radio
channel broadcast his words (a sign of the still supine nature of the
Russian media); his aides and colleagues had to scrounge time on reporters'
mobile telephones to make calls, because the phones are shut off.
A number of leading centrist deputies - such as Mr Yevgeny Ambartsumov, head
of the foreign affairs committee, and Mr Viktor Stepashin, former head of
the security committee - had resigned their mandate rather than, when push
finally came to shove, stand with parliament: two have already been rewarded
with ministerial jobs. Many more simply did not come to Moscow, their
enthusiasm for defending the present constitutional order deflated by having
to pay their own air fares once their free travel privileges had been
stripped from them.
That which, in a settled democratic country, would have been an outrage is
here accepted by the majority as a welcome end to an empty confrontation, a
natural response by the presidential power in the Kremlin to provocation.
Even the deputies seemed so little possessed of a sense of themselves as a
critical element in a civil society that they could neither invest the
situation with great meaning nor make - so far - sensible strategic
decisions on reversing their own descent into nullity.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the real president in possession of the Kremlin, has
clearly won this week's first round. Buttressed by the military, the
interior and the security forces, assured of the allegiance of the central
bank and the procurator general (the state prosecutor), his government
actively supportive and busy with orders, plans and initiatives, he could
leave the parliamentarians to stew while, yesterday, he conferred with his
fellow Commonwealth heads of state on how best to bring their economies into
line. The sudden deference to him is almost stifling: in a revival of
pre-Gorbachevian Soviet practice, Moscow Spartak, current premier football
league leaders, released a statement expressing their support for and trust
in their president.
Mr Yeltsin acted as he did for reasons which are still opaque. What is clear
is that the basic dilemma he faced - the inability to bring in a new
constitutional and parliamentary order without ripping through the old one -
had been long discussed, and the declaration of presidential rule
foreshadowed as long ago as March, in a TV speech. More recently, he has
been under strong pressure from the US and other Group of Seven leading
industrial countries, together with the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, to put order in the country's finances. Some senior western
officials believe this pressure has been crucial in assisting him to make up
his mind to act decisively.
Finally, he is a man of emotion and impulse. In speeches last weekend, both
Mr Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, launched
tirades of abuse at Mr Yeltsin - the latter going so far as to call him a
drunkard. According to two separate presidential advisers, this was crucial
in tipping the scale as to when to act - even as many of these advisers,
including Mr Yegor Gaidar whom he last week reinstated as first deputy prime
minister, pleaded with him to delay.
Thus he promulgated his fateful decree 'on step-by-step constitutional
reform in the Russian Federation'. The central concept in this, as in his
address to the people on Tuesday night, was that formal constitutional bars
could no longer be allowed to inhibit the rapid creation of the mechanisms
of a new state and economic order. To give this decree coherence, Mr Yeltsin
had to represent the parliament as the single, malevolent hurdle to the
country's progress. Aided by the media and a largely supportive, or
unconcerned, populace, he has achieved this aim.
He is now in the position of many of his predecessors who led Russia, both
tsars and commissars, who claimed and genuinely thought, perhaps, that their
enlightened or patriotic action in suppressing internal dissent set the
stage for a healthy development of society. They then found themselves in a
position where fear of a resumption of dissent, coupled with the discovery
that authoritarian government is simpler than the democratic kind, led them
to justify their continuing tyranny as the only antidote to chaos.
'Yeltsin is appealing to Russians' fear of an interregnum without clear
leadership,' said Dr Jana Howlett, a lecturer in Russian history at
Cambridge university. 'For them the most terrible times have been associated
with internal dissent rather than external attack.'
Mr Yeltsin's special claim is that he will use his temporarily untrammelled
authority to break, not confirm, the vicious cycle, of Russian history: that
he will, finally, use state power to break the state of ever again having
too much power. If he has round his neck the oppressive weight of the
Russian past, he has at least the pacific example of his predecessor, Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, who gave up power with an ill grace but clean hands, and
the pressure of foreign states whose open purses he still needs. He also has
his own instincts, which to date have usually pushed him in a liberal
direction.
Indeed, those closest to him worry more that he is too soft than that he
will be too hard. Mr Victor Smoryagin, one of the president's advisers on
regional policy, said this week that 'with the president it can be less of
the iron fist in the velvet glove than the velvet fist in the iron glove'.
The president has before him a range of daunting barriers. The best he can
hope for, or that his country can hope for from him, is that he will prevail
in part, or at least not retreat. Nothing he has done this week has helped
the economy - indeed, the one stable part of it, the rouble-dollar rate, has
slipped, and the rouble is falling heavily once more. The signing of an
economic union treaty yesterday with most of the leaders of the Commonwealth
of Independent States is likely to put further strain on Russia's budget -
if it works. He has wars on and inside his frontiers, terrible collapse in
health and other vital services, an unparalleled rise of violent crime in
big cities and a continuing fall in the output of oil, his one sure earner
of hard currency. Yet his greatest task is elsewhere.
It is keeping the Russian Federation together. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the
first-declared of the serious candidates who will challenge him for the
presidency if elections are held next June, said yesterday: 'Yeltsin is in
something of the same position as Gorbachev was in 1991. He has the same
problem - to stop the disintegration of the country. That disintegration is
a reality, it is going on.'
Republics and regions, having been given some autonomy from Moscow, have
taken even more as they have sensed the centre's weakness. The 'diamond
state' of Yakutia (re-named Sakha) has simply withheld taxes. In
neighbouring Irkutsk region, although the politicians have stepped back from
that extreme, they voice the same resentments: 'Moscow can no longer decide
everything from so far away,' says Mr Victor Ignatenko, head of the region's
parliament.
This 'freedom' does not mean greater economic freedom. In practice, the
local administrative and political classes seek to recreate a socialist
state in miniature - with ministries controlling various sectors and
investment coming from state, not private, funding.
Thus the reformists in the federal cabinet find themselves thwarted as soon
as their decrees leave their desks - by officials and politicians who find
them a threat and who are no longer sufficiently frightened by Moscow's
power to carry out its orders. The regions, ranked lower in the
constitutional pecking order than the autonomous republics in Mr Yeltsin's
proposed constitution, are demanding equality of treatment: the republics
want to preserve their privileges; both want to keep their resources, and
continue to receive subsidies. 'Can we allow this (inequality)?' asks Mr
Ivan Zelent, deputy chairman of the Irkutsk regional council. 'If we say the
republics are sovereign, then we need to divide everything up - army,
budget, citizenship rights. Our country must be fully federal and not just
in words, as now.'
The worst scenario - which Mr Yavlinsky evokes - is of a disintegration so
extreme that a kind of industrial feudalism overtakes Russia - with regional
army commanders allying with politicians and business or criminal circles to
declare full sovereignty, to set themselves up as 'national governments' and
to begin the systematic plunder of whatever riches the region/state offers.
Something of the kind has already happened in Chechnya, in the Russian North
Caucasus: while republics like Tatarstan, Bashkiria, Yakutia and others,
along with regions which are now declaring themselves as republics to enjoy
greater benefits, are now far down the path of self-rule - too far for
rational coexistence within a federal state.
It is this process, above all else, to which Mr Yeltsin must put a stop. It
will entail manoeuvres of a Machiavellian (and economically irrational)
kind, coupled with the use of both the iron fist and the iron glove, and the
promotion of Russia as once again a state within which the regions and
republics could feel valued.
He has volunteered to carry the burden, saying he will again stand for the
presidency even though it is, as he put it yesterday, 'inconvenient'. Yet it
is not at all obvious that he is the man for the job ahead. He has taken
further the great work started by Mr Gorbachev of destroying the communist
system. The latter carelessly lost the Communist party, the system's
political base, and Mr Yeltsin has largely torn the heart out of its
economic mechanism, the central-command economy and the parliament linked to
it. But to create a different order may be, for this very considerable man,
to reach beyond his grasp.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Leading Article: New doctrine for the G7
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REGULAR meetings of the leaders or finance ministers of the Group of
Seven industrialised countries have promised much in recent years:
co-ordinated growth strategies, exchange rate stability, debt relief or a
Uruguay Round agreement. They have delivered almost nothing of value. Little
wonder that seasoned observers argue that the G7 conforms to the Sinatra
doctrine - they meet, talk and then do it their way. Some argue that
disbanding the whole charade - the 'strangers in the night' alternative -
would make more sense.
G7 finance ministers are once again gathering in Washington this weekend.
They do so at a time of great insecurity in the world economy, and not just
because of Russia's present difficulties. Growth across the developed world
is slow and expected to remain sluggish, while unemployment is very high and
rising. The spectre of low-wage competition from east Asia and Latin America
is feeding protectionist sentiments, while both the North American Free
Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation are under
threat. Now, more than ever, the world needs the G7 to address these
challenges, not simply meet and talk and hope they will go away.
But first, the G7 must decide what it exists for. To do so, it must
recognise that its error has been to believe macroeconomic co-ordination was
its primary task, a role at which G7 summits have proved singularly
ineffective. Neither the US nor the rest of Europe has managed to persuade
Germany to tighten fiscal policy over the past two years and thus allow its
interest rates to fall. Nor do the US and the IMF look likely to persuade
the rest of continental Europe to cut their interest rates to more sensible
levels. Meanwhile, sluggish growth in both the US and Japan results, in
part, from past co-ordination failures - the ill-fated attempt to manage the
yen-dollar exchange rate in the late 1980s, and the failure of the rest of
the G7 to persuade the US to bring its fiscal deficit under control earlier.
Developing world
Macroeconomics is not the G7's forte. Unless fiscal policy is also
co-ordinated, monetary policy is best left to national governments. But this
does not mean that the summits can serve no useful purpose.
Far from it. If only G7 governments could persuade each other, and their
electorates, to lift their eyes above short-term difficulties, they would
see that the medium-term outlook for the world economy is far from
discouraging. For, while developed countries have foundered in recent years,
growth across the developing world is accelerating. Latin America has
recovered from its 1980s debt crisis, economic recovery is under way in
Poland and imminent across the rest of central Europe, while even Russia may
now be closer to reform than at any time in the past two years. Most
important, China and India - together accounting for half the world's
population - are now embracing market reforms. The IMF expects developing
country growth to average 6 per cent a year between next year and 1998,
faster than at any time in the past 20 years. Only crisis-ridden Africa is
still out in the cold.
'My way' doctrine
This outlook is not assured. It depends on whether G7 governments, and their
electorates, can adapt to a new economic order in which increasingly global
markets in goods, foreign direct investment and information are gradually
shifting the focus of energy and growth in the world economy towards the
developing world.
The G7 must celebrate this change. It must make clear to developed country
electorates that a vibrant and growing developing world is good for richer
countries too. Trade is not a zero sum game from which high-wage developed
countries inevitably lose. Open and growing economies in eastern Europe,
China or Mexico are as much a source of new markets and prosperity for
workers in Europe and America as sources of cheaper goods. That is why the
G7 must ensure that the December deadline for a Uruguay Round trade
agreement is met and that trade barriers continue to fall.
Of course, there will be a minority of losers: unskilled workers, whose
relative wages will inevitably fall as developing countries grow and
labour-saving technological change continues to develop. G7 governments must
find ways now to help upgrade the skills of the poorly educated. Meanwhile,
they must use growth-friendly polices to cut unemployment and thus combat
short-term pressures for creeping protectionism.
In short, the G7 needs to replace the Sinatra 'my way' doctrine. Its primary
task is to find collective ways to tackle the medium-term structural and
policy challenges that a growing and more egalitarian world economy throw
up. In the words of the Johnny Mercer song, sung by Bing Crosby at the end
of the second world war, the G7's gotta:
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive,
E-lim-my-nate the negative,
Latch on to the af-firm-a-tive,
Don't mess with Mister In-between.
So roll over 'ol' blue eyes'. The Crosby doctrine's time has come.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Man in the news: Fearless skater on thin ice - Sir Leon
Brittan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wedged inside the steamy, overcrowded lift, Sir Leon Brittan clutched his
briefing papers and cast his eyes around for a friendly face. The word
'victory' never passed his lips; but even at 3am in the morning he was still
savouring his confrontation with Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister
and designated hard man in the Gatt talks.
After more than 12 hours of discussions in Brussels, Sir Leon could
plausibly claim that he had resisted French efforts to force a renegotiation
of the EC-US Blair House accord limiting farm export subsidies, thus keeping
alive hopes of reaching a Uruguay Round agreement by the end of the year.
Sir Leon's clash with Mr Juppe during last Monday's EC 'jumbo' foreign, farm
and trade ministers council will go down as a classic confrontation between
two men with matching egos, intellect and ambition. But the price of facing
down the French government could be a further weakening of Paris's
confidence in the Commission as an impartial negotiator with the US,
increasing the threat of a French veto of a future Gatt deal.
'He was good,' says one senior German official, 'but maybe he was too good.'
Criticism that Sir Leon may be too clever for his own good has dogged his
political career. Memories of his involvement, seven years ago, in a clumsy
campaign to discredit Mr Michael Heseltine, then UK defence secretary, have
faded; but few will forget the verdict of a fellow Conservative MP at the
time: 'Too many brains, not enough common sense.'
Sir Leon has learnt a trick or two since he arrived in Brussels in 1989 to
take up the post of senior UK commissioner responsible for EC competition
policy. His willingness to work hard and learn languages (he speaks German
and French fluently) won him many admirers. Never shy of publicity, he
revelled in his reputation as a fearless and eminently quotable
'trust-buster'.
His new job as the EC's chief trade negotiator, which he took up last
January, is more challenging. Few could have mastered the Gatt dossier so
quickly; but doubts linger about his political judgment or, more accurately,
his political touch.
Sir Leon's relationship with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has
improved after a rocky start. 'In the beginning, Mickey wanted to look
dangerous, to show he was not afraid of breaking some furniture,' says a US
lawyer who knows both men. 'Now they have come to respect each other and
they share a common goal of getting a Gatt deal.'
On Monday, this willingness to compromise will be put to the test. Sir Leon
arrives in Washington saddled with a list of French-led demands for
'clarifying' or 'reinterpreting' Blair House. Technically, these demands do
not amount to a formal renegotiation; but Sir Leon knows he risks provoking
a further crisis within the EC if he comes back empty-handed.
During the all-night 'jumbo' council in Brussels, Sir Leon urged ministers
not to make public demands which could harden attitudes in Washington. In
fact, he disclosed that he had already presented certain requests for
modifying Blair House in an earlier private meeting with Mr Kantor. Concerns
that ministers would tie his hands as a negotiator prompted his devastating
intervention against a Franco-German compromise text, a move that provoked
Mr Juppe to remind Sir Leon that, as commissioner, he was merely a servant
of the assembled ministers.
Sir Leon is now skating on thin ice. The question remains why he failed to
respond to the hardening French attitude on Gatt in late August/early
September, relying instead on Germany to act as mediator. Some believe that
his inertia (which matched the passive UK government response) was born of a
stubborn refusal to accept any part of the French government's case.
Sir Leon's belief in the power of rational argument is unshakeable. He has
little sympathy for the emotionally tinged arguments in favour of preserving
French farming. 'Leon is an intellectual democrat. He will always listen to
another point of view,' explains a former colleague. 'But if he thinks he is
right, then he expects you to give in.'
The tendency toward self-righteousness has led to skirmishes with Commission
colleagues and the occasional bloody retreat. Earlier this year, Sir Leon
pressed his colleagues to accept a trade liberalisation package with the
former communist countries of eastern Europe, only to find himself isolated.
Belatedly, he forged an alliance with his rival - Mr Hans van den Broek, the
former Dutch foreign minister and now commissioner for external political
af-fairs - and the two carried the day.
A close Commission colleague describes Sir Leon as a brilliant negotiator
who suffers from being a loner. Too often, he misses the chance to win
friends by letting others take the credit for political successes. 'He lacks
Fingerspitzengefuhl (political touch).'
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is similarly
ambivalent. He shares Sir Leon's enthusiasm for hard work, and admires his
intellect. But Mr Delors has also been heard to grumble that Sir Leon is not
very good at returning political favours, or as he puts it in French: 'Il ne
rend jamais l'ascenseur.'
In the same spirit, Sir Leon would argue that he is very good at pressing
the right European buttons. As he showed in yesterday's speech on European
monetary union, he has broken with UK government policy. He does not share
Mr John Major's scepticism toward Emu, nor is he openly hostile to the idea
of further political integration. On Europe, he remains as close as ever to
his former political mentor, Lord Howe.
There is a wider game plan. However remote a prospect, Sir Leon believes in
his chances of succeeding Mr Delors as president of the Commission. He is
preparing a book on Europe, and he is vigorously cultivating German support.
A Gatt agreement would be a crowning achievement, not just for his own
reputation but also for his candidacy for the top job in Brussels.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Bank deputy in plea on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England, yesterday
issued a powerful plea for a reduction of unemployment in Europe. He said
governments must tackle the problem through long-term reforms of trade and
labour policy rather than by cutting interest rates.
In his first formal speech since taking office earlier this year, Mr
Pennant-Rea said western Europe was the only part of the industrialised
world where the level of unemployment had progressively risen in the past
two decades.
The deputy governor told a conference organised by the Italian Chamber of
Commerce: 'No one, no European certainly, can take much comfort from
economic conditions in Europe so long as 17.5m people unemployed remains
part of the tally.'
Mr Pennant-Rea acknowledged that tight monetary policy could be a reason for
the continuing level of unemployment in some European countries. But he
warned against thinking that high interest rates were the fundamental cause
of the problem. Instead, he suggested addressing the issue by looking at
microeconomic reforms in taxation, training and wage regulation.
Mr Pennant-Rea pointed to the need to continue liberalising trade policy,
and warned against turning the European Community into a fortress against
other trading blocs. He said: 'To single out trade as a destroyer of jobs is
perverse. It neglects the competitive dynamism that trade injects into every
trading economy.'
He also said reform was needed in labour market policy, in contrast to
European Community leaders who are committed to protective employment.
'There are many types of supply-side restraints. Europeans will have to
tackle these restraints if we are to be as successful in creating jobs as
the US has been in recent years,' he said.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Union reform is test of Smith's leadership: The issue which
will dominate next week's Labour party conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASSION, intrigue and excitement will not be in short supply at next week's
Labour party conference. The reason is summarised in an ugly little acronym,
OMOV, which has big implications for the party and the unions that created
it.
The question of whether or not to exclude affiliated unions from the
selection of parliamentary candidates at local level, in favour of
one-member-one-vote, is a relatively minor constitutional matter - but one
which has come to stand for much broader changes in the party/union
connection.
It is also the first big test of Mr John Smith's management of his party. If
he loses the vote 'there is a serious problem for his leadership', as one
union leader put it yesterday.
The stakes, therefore, are high, and the votes may remain too close to call
until they are cast on Wednesday morning. The union delegations, which
account for 70 per cent of the votes compared with the constituency parties'
30 per cent, will by then have met for a second time and Mr Smith will have
had a chance to sway them with his address on Tuesday.
The least that Mr Smith must hope for now is that there is no clear majority
for any of the three main motions opposing one-member-one-vote. That would
make it easier for the leader to impose a solution if the reform itself
fails to get a majority.
The main obstacle is the alliance of the TGWU and the GMB - the two general
unions - against the party leadership. Between them they account for nearly
30 per cent of conference votes.
In the case of the left-led TGWU, this opposition is not surprising. In the
case of the GMB, with its reputation for Labour loyalism and support for
'modernising' policies, it is much more surprising. According to fellow
union leaders, the GMB's stance is down to one man - its general secretary
Mr John Edmonds.
A senior official in the GMB says: 'Mr Edmonds has never really found a
secure niche in the union movement and he had a particularly uncomfortable
time at this year's TUC congress, being shunned by the people who are
normally his allies and feted by the leftwing dinosaurs.'
Many reasons have been offered for Mr Edmonds' hostility to
one-member-one-vote. Some say it stems from his union's belief that the
proposal is the beginning of an attempt to push the unions out of the party.
Others suggest it is a manoeuvre by Mr Edmonds to appeal to the dominant
left of the TGWU with a view to winning the top job when the two unions
merge in the next two years. Whatever the truth, the GMB's decision to
oppose the reform caught the Smith camp by surprise earlier this year and
threw their calculations into disarray.
Mr Smith had made clear his support for one-member-one-vote when he was
elected leader, with overwhelming union backing, last year. Mindful of
trouble his predecessor Mr Neil Kinnock had on the issue, he handed the
problem to a union/party committee.
One insider says: 'It was then that the Smith office seemed to take its eye
off the ball, heading back to Scotland for long weekends and there was a
feeling that issues like one-member-one-vote would look after themselves.'
By the time this year's union conferences came round the damage had been
done. The union/party committee produced an inconclusive report. The unions
were feeling under attack and started to see one-member-one-vote as the thin
end of the wedge.
Several key unions that normally would have supported the leader - the GMB';
Nupe, the former public services union; the UCW communication unions; the
MSF manufacturing union; and Usdaw, the shop workers' union  - passed
conference resolutions against the reform. Many constituency parties
withdrew support under the influence of disgruntled union officials.
In the past few weeks Mr Smith and Mr Murray Elder, his chief adviser, have
come out fighting. One union leader who opposes the reforms says: 'I've been
lent on more effectively by the supposedly hands-off Smith than I ever was
by the hands-on Kinnock.'
Mr Smith's powerful speech to the TUC on worker rights dispelled the idea
that he was anti-union, and his acceptance that unions should retain a
corporate presence in the election of the party leader has increased
goodwill.
It may be too little, too late. But with some subtle merging of motions,
procedural manoeuvres, and a refusal by the TGWU delegation to back any
motion but its own against one-member-one-vote, the leadership could scrape
home.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Labour tax reform 'could raise Pounds 8bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday unveiled proposals for a series of tax reforms that it said
could raise Pounds 8bn over two years without increasing the basic rate of
income tax.
The party also claimed families were facing an extra tax bill of nearly
Pounds 8 a week in national insurance contributions, excise duty and income
tax from next April. This was in addition to the higher fuel bills that
would result from the plan to impose value added tax on household fuel.
Labour labelled this the government's 'double whammy', in ironic reference
to the Conservatives' advertising slogan used against Labour in last year's
general election.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'Even the family on
three-quarters of average income is hit by the Tory double whammy.'
Among seven proposed tax reforms, Mr Brown said the government could save
Pounds 2bn over two years by ending the abuse of sovereign immunity whereby
companies traded 'under the umbrella of' national governments - as in the
case of the Kuwait Investment Office. He said at least a further Pounds 2bn
could be saved by ending the 'underpayment' of corporation tax.
He predicted water companies would pay 'next to no corporation tax right
throughout the decade' thanks to Pounds 7bn of tax allowances.
The Water Services Association, representing the 10 large water and sewerage
companies of England and Wales, said last night that 'water companies are
subject to the same tax rules as any other company'.
It said the companies can offset some investment against profits in tax
calculations. Because they are engaged in a large investment programme,
allowances have generally been greater than profits.
Mr Brown proposed saving another Pounds 1.25bn over two years by:
Preventing companies from paying dividends in shares instead of cash to
avoid paying advance corporation tax. Closing a loophole whereby capital
gains tax and inheritance tax 'interact', enabling some companies to claim
double tax relief.
Not implementing the foreign income dividend for holding companies proposed
by the government from November.
Further sums could be raised by retaining stamp duty on share transactions,
imposing a levy on 'excess' profits of privatised utilities, and
accelerating the shutdown of business expansion schemes.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A THIRD of large UK companies have codes of ethics or are developing them,
says a survey released yesterday by the Institute of Business Ethics.
The proportion of companies that have published codes is 28 per cent, the
same level as two years ago. But the survey detected a further 5 per cent of
companies working on codes.
The codes typically cover topics such as environmental responsibilities,
conflicts of interest, 'whistle blowing', and receiving entertainment and
gifts from suppliers.

SCOTS WERE urged yesterday by Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish
National party, never to blame the English for what was wrong with Scotland,
James Buxton writes.
He said that if Scots took responsibility for their own circumstances then
'we will be well on our way to self-government'.
In his main address to the party's annual conference at Dunoon, Strathclyde,
Mr Salmond said that Scots had the ability at every general election to
change the face of Scotland.
He said: 'We should be angry at the government for what they are doing to
Scotland. We should be angry at Labour for what they are failing to do. But
let's make sure we never appear to blame the English or anyone else for
Scotland's predicament.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Strike ballot looms on firefighters' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS in London to avert industrial conflict in the fire service this autumn
failed to produce an agreement yesterday.
As a result, today's special delegate conference of the Fire Brigade Union
is expected to endorse the calling of a strike ballot among its 49,500
members. The ballot would begin on October 4.
Speaking to 4,000 chanting firefighters outside the local authority
employers' offices yesterday, Mr Ken Cameron, the FBU's general secretary,
said he had 'no doubt that 80 per cent of firefighters would back the strike
call'.
He said the 'train was speeding down the hill' and a conflict, though
tragic, would be hard to prevent. Union leaders are planning a series of
one-day nationwide stoppages if they secure the approval of the members.
The result of the firefighters' ballot will be announced on November 1 and
the stoppages would begin after seven days' notice to employers.
Mr Cameron said the employers had failed to change their bargaining stance
since June. They had told the union they could not honour the firefighters'
15-year-old pay formula this year, but had to make a pay award in line with
the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector wage limit.
Mr Laurie Conlan, chairman of the local authority employers, blamed the
government for the threatened strike.
'We fully support the firefighters' pay formula. It has kept the peace for
15 years,' he said. 'It has never been our wish to suspend the formula. That
has been imposed on us by the government.
'We have told the union their members will have the formula in 1994, come
what may.'
Mr Conlan added: 'We have made an absolute commitment to them. We sympathise
with the FBU, though we can't support any strike action. The union is going
to tremendous lengths to avoid a dispute.'
He said the employers were to talk to Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, on
Tuesday, and intended to hold further negotiations with the union in Glasgow
next Friday on the eve of the strike ballot.
Mr Conlan added that a strike would be 'an economic disaster' for the fire
service. Firefighters outside the talks said they were ready to compromise
with a staged deal if it gave them 1.5 per cent in November and the rest of
the increase calculated by the pay formula next April.
Both sides believe that the actual sum of money proposed by the formula for
this year would not be much above the government limit.
The formula is based on an updated and adjusted link to the upper quartile
of male manual workers' earnings, which is compiled each April in the
government's earnings survey. This year's survey is due to be published next
Thursday.
FBU leaders believe public opinion is on the firefighters' side.
More than 250,000 people have signed a petition back-ing their demand for
the full implementation of the pay formula this year.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Accounts guidelines go beyond Cadbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES should provide detailed information on their cash position in
interim accounts, say recommendations released yesterday by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
The guidelines - a response to the Cadbury committee's recommendations on
financial aspects of corporate governance - go further than Cadbury
suggestions that companies might consider including some limited cashflow
information in interim statements.
The institute says companies' half-year figures should contain details such
as operating cashflow, and financing and investment payments required in FRS
1, the cashflow statement which is mandatory in year-end figures.
The guidelines were produced by a working party of the institute's financial
reporting committee on behalf of the Accounting Standards Board.
The working party says companies should provide a summarised balance sheet,
including details of fixed assets, creditors, provisions and capital and
reserves.
They should include basic profit and loss account information such as
turnover, interest payments, tax and exceptional items as required by FRS 3,
the profit and loss accounting standard. It recommends a combination of
approaches, treating most figures for the half-year in isolation, but
relating some to expected full-year results.
It is unclear how the guidelines will be enforced because the Financial
Reporting Review Panel, the accounts watchdog, only deals with annual
accounts.
It is possible that the Stock Exchange may make amendments incorporating
some of the recommendations in its official Yellow Book of listing
requirements for quoted companies.
The proposals are being circulated for comments by November 22.

FT  25 SEP 93 / TGWU members below 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERSHIP of the TGWU general union has dropped below 1m for the first time
since the middle of the second world war, it was announced yesterday.
The union has 994,881 members, less than half the figure of 14 years ago
when membership reached its highest total of 2.1m. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU
general secretary, blamed the decline in membership on the contraction of
employment since 1979 in private manufacturing, the former stronghold of the
union.
The largest section of the union is now employed in the public services -
107,655 members - followed by food, drink and tobacco (102,077), and
commercial services (97,312). Only 15,192 members are employed in docks,
waterways and fishing, and 73,163 in the vehicle building and automotive
sector.
Nearly a quarter of the TGWU's members are in London and the south-east,
with 165,506 in the Midlands and 127,270 in the north-west.

FT  25 SEP 93 / From businesswoman to watchdog: David Lascelles and Hugo
Dixon assess the task of the gas industry's new regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS CLARE Spottiswoode, the new director-general of Ofgas, will be 'reading
herself into the subject' before she makes any public comments, the
Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday.
That could be quite a task. Apart from the 1,000 pages of the recent
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the gas industry, she will have
to familiarise herself with the short but tempestuous history of Ofgas's
relations with British Gas.
But she arrives in the job with a reputation for intelligence and toughness,
as well as an ability to charm - all traits that she will need in the tricky
period ahead.
A Cambridge graduate in mathematics and economics, she began her career as a
Treasury economist but soon left to run her own business, selling gifts and
publishing computer software. She sold her company in 1988, since when she
has been involved in a number of activities, including working on the
government's deregulation initiative.
Not, at first sight, the most obvious set of qualifications for a gas
industry regulator. But few of the UK's utility watchdogs had close
connections with the job beforehand.
What counted strongly in Ms Spottiswoode's favour was her entrepreneurial
flair: regulators these days are supposed to understand business.
She succeeds Sir James McKinnon. The hard-hitting Scottish accountant will
be a tough act to follow. It was his relentless assault on British Gas which
provoked the monopoly inquiry, and a virtual breakdown in relations between
Ofgas and British Gas.
So infuriated was British Gas by his behaviour that it called on the MMC to
curb his powers, accusing him of manipulating the press and engaging in
devious practices.
However, the worst of that may now be past. Sir James said yesterday that
the atmosphere was much improved. 'It's quite different now,' he said.
'British Gas are much more willing to co-operate.' There was an acceptance
at British Gas of the need to change.
Ms Spottiswoode's arrival should therefore give Ofgas and British Gas the
opportunity to begin their relationship afresh, though it will be
interesting to see how a female regulator is received in the very male
bastion of British Gas' Rivermill House head-quarters.
The exact nature of her role will depend on how far the government goes in
accepting the MMC's recommendations. These called for the break-up of
British Gas by 1997 and the abolition of its monopoly in the domestic gas
market within five years of that date.
Even if the government only accepts part of these measures, Ms Spottiswoode
will be heavily involved in the future reshaping of the gas industry.
One of her main jobs will be to design a free market in gas where new
suppliers can set themselves up in competition with British Gas.
This will be an enormously demanding task, requiring a delicate balance to
be struck between market forces and the need to protect consumers' rights.
If the government went the whole way, she would also have to oversee one of
the largest company break-ups ever seen in the UK.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Mobile phone network planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Microtel, the cellular mobile phone operator, yesterday claimed
that the network it plans to launch next spring will cover 70 per cent of
the UK's population by the end of 1994.
Mr Malcolm Way, Microtel's managing director, said that by the time of the
launch the company would have spent Pounds 350m on its network, more than
twice the current investment in Mercury's One-2-One. It plans to have
invested more than Pounds 700m by the end of the decade.
One-2-One's network covers only the London region, although it will extend
further into the south-east next year. Hutchison Microtel's network uses the
same Personal Communications Network technology as One-2-One.
Mr Way warned that, in spite of Mercury's strong pitch for the consumer
market, a mass market for mobile phones would not be achieved easily. 'There
is still a long way to go before consumers are made aware of, and
comfortable with, the concept of a convenient and affordable mobile
telephone,' he said.
Microtel's parent company, the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa,
emphasised earlier this summer its determination to concentrate on its core
businesses of Far East property.
However, no buyer has yet emerged for Microtel and the company said that a
change of ownership would be unlikely to affect its building and launch
plans. The government has awarded three new licences to provide
telecommunications services.
The companies gaining the licences are ScottishPower Telecommunications, a
subsidiary of Scottish Power, Torch Communications, a joint venture between
Yorkshire Electricity and Kingston Communications, which operates a network
in Hull, and MFS, a subsidiary of a US business telecommunications company.
The companies plan to provide services in limited areas.

A CARGO company is being sued by the GMB general union over the death of two
dockers in separate accidents at King George Dock in Hull.
Northern Cargo Services was prosecuted in both cases by the Health and
Safety Executive. In the first it was fined Pounds 1,500 plus Pounds 1,000
costs, and in the second Pounds 3,000 plus Pounds 2,027 costs. Neither of
the victims' widows has received compensation.
Mr George Hewson, GMB regional industrial officer in Hull, blamed 'the lack
of health and safety provision' at the company for the deaths.
Accidents in Britain's ports have increased since the deregulation of dock
labour five years ago.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Rebel Tory MP may resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A SENIOR Tory Euro-sceptic MP will meet his local party today to discuss
whether to leave politics, David Owen writes.
If Sir Richard Body resigned from parliament it would trigger a by-election
which might narrow the government's precarious 17-strong majority.
Sir Richard, MP for Holland with Boston in Lincolnshire, yesterday said he
had received a 'very tempting' offer from a publishing company to write
books about Europe and agriculture.
Sir Richard, widely believed to be among the Tory rebels described this week
as 'barmy' by Mr John Major, the prime minister, acknowledged yesterday that
he might resign. But he said he hoped a compromise could be reached enabling
him to remain an MP and write books.
Sir Richard's majority was nearly 14,000 at the last general election.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Ashdown's heartland voters remain unconvinced: As the
Liberal Democrats finished their annual conference this week Roland
Adburgham visited the party's stronghold area of south-west England. He
spoke to a cross-section of people in the Somerset town of Bridgwater to
gauge their views on the performance of the party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE of Sedgemoor was fought near Bridgwater in Somerset in 1685, and
the town's pub names such as Cross Rifles, Volunteer Arms and the Rebels'
Retreat keep the memory alive.
The town is as good a place as any from which to view the ebb and flow of
British politics during the conference season.
A small cross-section of the more politically interested Bridgwater voters
assessed the Liberal Democrat performance this week. All accepted that Mr
Ashdown's message was that there was a 'dangerous gulf' between the
government and the governed in Britain. But the conference left most of the
panel unconvinced that Mr Ashdown could turn protest into power.
Mrs Beatrice Forber, who lives in retirement with her lieutenant-colonel
husband on the edge of the Quantock Hills, described the conference as 'the
best and most professional they've ever had - brimming with
self-confidence'. But it won't shake her support for the Conservatives.
'There are so many holes in their rhetoric,' she said. 'They only see the
dream and not the long-term cost.'
Mr Ian Weston, a former RAF pilot who runs InterWorld Travel, a Bridgwater
travel agency, thought the conference dull. 'There was a lot of rhetoric
we've all heard before: 'We're on the verge of a breakthrough, come on
chaps, one more push.' It hasn't happened before and probably won't'
Only the converted thought the party would move forward. Mr Hugh Barran, a
Bridgwater solicitor who supports the Liberal Democrats, said: 'Paddy
Ashdown spoke very well. He used to speak in long-winded sentences, but now
he speaks very well.'
Mr Allan Challenger, a psychiatric social worker, was more sceptical. 'On
the surface he is the most attractive of the three leaders, but he is not a
man of great principle. My impression of all the party conferences in the
last four years is that they are very stage-managed.'
Ms Glen Burrows, who works for the county social services and is a shop
steward for Unison, the public services union, was even more dismissive.
'Paddy Ashdown is prepared to sacrifice any principles for political power,
which is typical of the Liberal Democrats,' she said.
'When Mr Ashdown talks of his party's councillors behaving responsibly, it
means accepting underfunding and cutting jobs. It means playing to the
government's tune.'
Mr Challenger thought it 'a real trap' that the Liberal Democrats had to try
to win votes from both Conservative and Labour camps. Like most of the
others, he thought Mr Ashdown's attack on waste and council overstaffing was
a sop to seek Tory votes. Mr Weston thought it was inconsistent with some
Liberal Democrat policies which would increase bureaucracy. 'It is wholly
electioneering,' said Mrs Forber.
Mr Weston was also dubious about the Liberal Democrat bandwagon in Somerset
in parliamentary terms. 'People in Somerset are very parochial and there is
a big gap in consciousness between a local council and parliament,' he said.
'I have an open mind on how I will vote,' he added. 'But, from what I've
heard this week, I am not persuaded that the Liberal Democrats are sensible
people to run the country.'
Roland Adburgham will visit the same panel of voters to gauge their reaction
to the Labour party conference.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Littlechild gives out high marks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY companies were patting themselves on the back yesterday after
receiving high marks for behaviour from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
industry regulator.
Prof Littlechild's annual report on customer service showed that companies
failed to meet his standards in only one out of every 1,053 cases, compared
with one out of 770 the year before. Complaints decreased from 16,679 to
15,521.
The regulator said he was pleased companies were reaching standards and
providing better service for customers.
He added that he had set even higher service standards for 1993-94, and had
doubled the penalties for failure.
London Electricity claimed the report showed it gave its customers the best
electricity service in the UK, with a failure rate of 1.6 per 10,000
services compared with a national average of 9.5.
Midlands Electricity said it was providing a better service and the lowest
electricity bills in England and Wales.
Mr Mike Hughes, chief executive, said his company's overall targets for
service were now the highest in the country.
Companies with the lowest failure rates included Seeboard, Southern and
Eastern. Those with higher rates were Hydro-Electric, South Western and East
Midlands.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Cumbria wins first inward investment from Far East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUMBRIA has won its first inward investment from the Far East, the Northern
Development Company and the West Cumbria Development Agency announced
yesterday.
Sammi (UK), a wholly owned subsidiary of Korean audio speaker manufacturer
Sammi Sound Technology Corporation, is taking over a former shoe factory on
the Lillyhall industrial estate near Workington.
The Pounds 1.6m project, won against competition from Germany and Turkey,
will initially create 67 jobs. The factory, due to begin production next
spring, will assemble and manufacture a range of speakers.
Of the 20 Korean manufacturing plants already established in Europe, seven
are in Britain. Three of these, Samsung, Goldstar and Inkel, have settled in
north-east England with NDC help.
The NDC and WCDA hailed Sammi's investment as a turning point for Cumbria,
which has been hampered by poor communications links in its fight for inward
investment. 'It's highly important, it's a tremendous morale boost,' said
Mrs Barbara Stephens, WCDA operations director.
She believes it would stimulate further interest in West Cumbria from the
electronics sector.
However, she said that Workington's development area status, under which
Sammi's project has been granted regional selective assistance, has since
been downgraded to intermediate ranking under the new assisted areas map.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Lloyd's upbeat on corporate capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for the introduction of corporate capital to the Lloyd's of London
insurance market have already generated sufficient interest from potential
sponsors to meet the market's demands for the coming year, it emerged
yesterday.
Lloyd's said it was aware that at least 12 groups were considering
underwriting in the market in 1994.
The total value of the capital on offer if all these proposals were to be
implemented is about Pounds 1bn.
That compares with Lloyd's calculations of the potential for corporate
capital of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn for next year, which would
allow for an underwriting capacity of twice that level. The assumptions are
based on total estimated underwriting on the market of Pounds 7.5bn in 1994,
compared with Pounds 8.8bn this year.
Corporate capital would be able to benefit from the rules of limited
liability suggested for the first time under the Lloyd's business plan. Most
of the proposals have been in the form of investment trusts. It contrasts
with the unlimited liability to which Names - individuals whose assets
underwrite the market - are subject.
'We are pleasantly surprised with the level of interest,' Lloyd's said
yesterday. 'Now we've got to see whether they will put their money where
their mouth is.'
Further details of interested groups are expected next week. But none is
likely to request formal approval from Lloyd's until after the corporate
capital proposals have been approved by Names.
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, wrote to all Names earlier this week
seeking their support for the proposals at an extraordinary general meeting
on October 20.
Many Names - particularly those who have had to cease underwriting because
they have become insolvent - are concerned about the implications of
corporate capital.
But a letter sent out yesterday by Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association
of Lloyd's Names, the biggest Names' group, urges members not to assign
proxies to the chairmen of the action groups involved in litigation against
the insurance market, who are likely to vote against.
It calls on Names to make up their own minds and says it will provide
further recommendations based on independent advice before the meeting.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Kuwait warned it may lose tax immunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT has been warned that it is in danger of losing its valuable sovereign
immunity from taxation in the UK by one of its most distinguished and
longstanding UK advisers, Lord Shawcross.
The former attorney general, who is an adviser to the Kuwait Investment
Office, the emirate's international investment arm, gave the warning in a
letter he wrote over the summer to a senior member of Kuwait's ruling
Al-Sabah family.
The KIO is believed to have made annual tax savings in the UK of at least
Dollars 1bn a year over the past decade as a result of being given sovereign
immunity from taxation.
The Financial Times disclosed yesterday that Kuwait may have abused this
immunity by receiving more than Pounds 600m of tax refunds on its Dollars
1.7bn investment in British Petroleum. According to the testimony of a
former senior Kuwaiti official, the investment was made by the Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation, which is not entitled to sovereign immunity.
When the BP shares were bought, in 1987 and 1988, Kuwait said they had been
purchased by the KIO on behalf of the state investment fund.
Following the FT's disclosures, an Inland Revenue official said yesterday:
'If allegations of tax abuse are brought to us, we will investigate.'
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, yesterday wrote to Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, saying that the Inland Revenue had been making an
'over-generous and overlax interpretation of sovereign immunity' which was
'costing the exchequer and the British taxpayer millions'.
There is no suggestion that Lord Shawcross was aware that the BP investment
was made by the KPC. His letter warns about the possible loss of sovereign
immunity because of concerns that damaging disclosures are likely to be made
during Kuwait's legal action against former KIO managers related to big
losses on Spanish investments.
'The publicity attached to the case would be harmful,' the letter says. 'At
the least it must raise questions as to the adequacy of the control and
audit system exercised by Kuwait over the KIO, which permitted. . . alleged
crimes to take place. This in turn would suggest that some of the defendants
. . . were committing crimes of which the Kuwait government was unaware . .
. This would, I think, lead the British government to reconsider the status
and activities of the KIO in the United Kingdom.' Lord Shawcross's
associates said he refers to KIO's tax status.
Mr Brown also said there was a case for withdrawing the KIO's right to
sovereign immunity, which is normally withheld from state agencies such as
the KIO if they act in a 'commercial' manner. 'Quite clearly the KIO was
working in a commercial way,' Mr Brown said.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Hurd denies party 'crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party is gradually 'coming together' on Europe, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, said last night, asserting that there was no
'crisis' at the centre of government.
Speaking on the day Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a magazine
article to set out his European vision, Mr Hurd told Tory loyalists in
Oxfordshire that the party was starting to look to Europe's future rather
than raking over the past.
This was part of a process in which British politics was returning to normal
after the 'horrors' of the past 12 months, Mr Hurd said.
'Normal includes plenty of problems but no crisis,' he said. 'Normal
includes the chancellor of the exchequer setting about preparing his Budget
in an orderly way.'
Initial Euro-sceptic reaction to Mr Major's article in The Economist - in
which he ruled out a British return to the European exchange rate mechanism
in the strongest terms yet - belied Mr Hurd's remarks, however.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, a Euro rebel and Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West,
dismissed it as calculated 'manoeuvring' in the run-up to next month's
Conservative party conference.
The government was 'simply working on a different system leading to fixed
exchange rates'.
Mr Major was making a 'shrewd attempt to try and manage public opinion at
the Tory party conference - but it's nothing more than that'.
Mr Bill Cash, the arch Euro-sceptic MP for Stafford, said there was nothing
in the prime minister's words to suggest he had vetoed a return to the ERM.
'The move towards monetary union is clearly laid out in the Maastricht
treaty,' he said.
Mr Major's article was widely portrayed as a British attempt to pre-empt
further discussion of economic and monetary union at the special European
Community summit planned for next month.
His advisers hope it will help to marginalise the hard-right backbenchers
who have threatened to force a leadership election in the autumn.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Steel plant closure cuts 200 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UES STEELS, part of the UES Holdings joint venture between British Steel and
GKN, plans to close its steelmaking plant at Rotherham, with the loss of at
least 200 jobs.
The company yesterday blamed continuing European overcapacity in recent
years for the shutdown.
It also said scrap and electricity prices had risen much faster than
inflation, and it was unable to recover the extra costs by raising prices
because of market conditions.
The Templeborough plant, which employs 260 people, produces continuously
cast steel billets for re-rolling within UES Steels and by outside
customers.
It will close at the end of this year and production will be transferred to
UES Steels' two larger plants at Aldwarke, also in Rotherham, and
Stocksbridge, near Sheffield. Depending on market conditions, the transfer
might create between 40 and 50 jobs, UES said.
'This necessary step is being taken in order that UES Steels can retain its
present position as a leading European producer and as a competitive source
of engineering steels for UK manufacturing industry,' the company added.
The engineering steels produced by UES are used in the automotive industry
as forgings for crankshafts and gears. The steel is also re-rolled into bars
that are machined to make other automotive parts.
Although car sales in the UK are rising, the continental European market
remains depressed. UES said about 45 per cent of its steel sales went to the
Continent.
The closure at Templeborough will reduce employment in UES Steels to about
4,000 by the end of this year, compared with about 6,700 four years ago.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Investors still wary of the new S Africa: The decision to
lift sanctions may not spark a bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER three decades of isolation, South Africa can now re-enter the economic
community of nations following Nelson Mandela's successful call for the
lifting of sanctions at the United Nations last night.
While the normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations
promises considerable benefits, there is little anticipation of a short term
investment bonanza. A mixture of domestic political uncertainty,
international distractions, sanctions legacies and practical obstacles will
ensure that South Africa's rehabilitation is a gradual process.
In the US, which has been the most vocal and influential proponent of
sanctions, the most positive response was always likely to come from Mr
Mandela's most prominent supporters - namely Mr David Dinkins, the mayor of
New York, Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York state, and Mr Douglas Wilder,
governor of Virginia.
Mr Dinkins immediately announced that he was asking his city council to
repeal New York's anti-apartheid legislation, which could release cash in
city pension funds, some of which could be invested in South Africa.
Mr Charles Moses, executive director of the New York state governor's
Advisory Committee for Black Affairs, confirms that the state has been
working for 18 months on drawing up an International Partnership Programme
(IPP), an initiative that will cover economic development, trade, education
and support for small business.
An early response can also be expected from the IMF and the World Bank,
which are impatient to get involved in lending to South Africa. South Africa
is eligible for a Dollars 800m loan in terms of the IMF's Compensatory and
Contingency Finance Utility, while the World Bank has also made clear that
it stands ready to lend large sums in support of socio-economic development.
The Clinton administration, mindful of the political clout of the 43-strong
congressional black caucus, is expected to be supportive.
Expectations of the business community, however, are more muted.
Mr Jonathan Huneke, investment policy manager at the US Council for
International Business, an industry association representing about 300
multinationals, believes they will re-enter South Africa 'very cautiously,
very quietly and very slowly'.
Mr Huneke says there remains a 'residual distrust and scepticism' about the
ANC among his members, many of whom were 'vilified' during the 1980s for
their ties with South Africa. Although he acknowledges a 'metamorphosis on
foreign investment, appreciating that they need to cater to the interests of
business people', he says the ANC still has 'some way to go' before
businessmen are confident with its policies. Mr Huneke adds that investors
also have many more opportunities in new markets - notably in eastern
Europe, east Asia and Latin America - which were not available when the
sanctions period started.
The Washington based Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) believes
that investors will initially hold back from big investments, preferring to
set up branch sales and marketing offices, or assuming direct control of a
distributorship, while watching political developments.
Whatever foreign investment does flow is likely to focus on two areas in
particular: spending on infrastructure and consumer goods. The reasoning is
that a new government is likely to spend heavily on a social reconstruction
programme, while the rapidly urbanising black population, with rising
incomes, is targeted as a major future growth market for small ticket
consumer items. The IRRC suggests cosmetics, clothing, footwear, prepared
foods and non-prescription medications as likely consumer markets. It also
indicates computer and software companies as potential beneficiaries.
New investors are likely to seek partners in the black community, a route
already taken by Digital Equipment and the UK company Cable &amp; Wireless,
which this week was part of a consortium awarded a cellular telephone
licence.
Even if investors are keen to enter South Africa quickly, some will continue
to face practical obstacles. According to the IRRC, 179 local entities (30
states, 109 cities, 39 counties and regional authorities and the Virgin
Islands) had maintained some sort of restriction in their investment,
banking or procurement policies.
Although the US Senate and President Bill Clinton have urged that these be
rescinded, this will not take place overnight. Mr Bill Moses of the IRRC
notes that most states have adjourned until next year and in some cases,
notably Texas, state legislatures do not meet until 1995. Cities, counties
and public pension funds are often bound by legislative comment an waiting
periods.
In terms of portfolio investment, South Africa starts from a very low base.
A study of 47 global emerging market funds by the UK group Micropal shows
that at June 30 1993, only 0.07 per cent of their Dollars 8bn assets were
invested in South Africa. By comparison, on September 22, South Africa, by
market capitalisation, represented 0.85 per cent of the Financial Times
World Actuaries Index, measured in US dollars.
Mr Lloyd Pengilly of the New York brokers Mcintosh Martin says there is
relatively little foreign investment in South African stocks outside mining.
He says recent weeks have seen a lot of inquiries from US mutual funds about
the South African market, but this has not yet been matched by any
significant flow of funds.
He stresses that a 'terrific re-education process' lies ahead with most
portfolio managers ignorant of the market. This is borne out by a cursory
examination of Nelson's Directory, the US investment bible, which does not
list a single US analyst covering South African stocks.
Mr Pengilly believes that 'over time' there will be a flow of funds to South
Africa. Wall Street observers believe important US securities firms like
Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Smith Barney Shearson Inc and Lehmann Bros are
likely to re-enter South Africa.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Hero's welcome as rival Nigeria leader flies in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Moshood Abiola, victor in Nigeria's annulled presidential elections in
June, yesterday flew back to Lagos to a hero's welcome.
He was met by a huge crowd of supporters who defied security arrangements
aimed at limiting the size of the reception.
Thousands of people, many dressed in the green and white colours of his
Social Democractic party, lined the roads and cheered the waving Chief
Abiola as he was driven the two miles to his home.
'All we are saying is give MKO a chance,' his supporters sang to the tune of
the popular John Lennon song, referring to Chief Abiola by his popular
nickname.
Chief Abiola, who has been abroad since August 3 seeking support after the
military annulled an election he believed he won, said he was ready for
dialogue to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.
'I am going to struggle with you for the materialisation of the mandate of
June 12 for the benefit of our nation and people,' he told supporters.
The annulment of the June election plunged Nigeria into its worst crisis
since the 1967-70 civil war and still threatens the unity of Africa's most
populous nation.
While Chief Abiola was abroad the military government handed over power to
an unelected interim government.
Speaking at his Lagos headquarters, he said that during his travels he
received appeals from many Nigerians to ensure peace and the unity and
stability of Nigeria.
'Now that I am back. . . I am ready and willing to talk to anyone and
encourage any discussion with any group of people as long as such discussion
will take place on the basis of justice, fair play and the people's will as
expressed on June 12,' he said.
'It is a statement of political fact that all problems can be resolved
through dialogue. Indeed, even wars are finally resolved around the
conference table,' Mr Abiola said.
Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of the interim government, has said his
administration was prepared to talk with Mr Abiola to end the political
impasse.
Despite his warm welcome in Lagos, the heart of his political stronghold,
many of Mr Abiola's supporters fear he has missed the boat. A general strike
failed to shift the new military-led government from its plans to hold fresh
elections next March.
Many of Mr Abiola's supporters have also been disappointed by his extended
absence, which began when he fled Lagos in his private jet, fearing for his
life. He nevertheless has the capacity to revive protest in the south, where
his support is considerable.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Market forces were the power behind sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BLACK and white South Africans alike find it difficult to be dispassionate
about the 30-year sanctions era, which ended with yesterday's call by Nelson
Mandela to abandon the sanctions weapon.
In anti-apartheid circles, it is treated as self-evident that sanctions
brought the economy to its knees and the ruling National Party to its
senses; conversely, many whites believe they were either unnecessary or
actually counter-productive.
The answer is that sanctions had different effects on different segments of
the population, reinforcing the paranoia of the right while simultaneously
spurring reform among those already committed to change; angering some
blacks while boosting the morale of others; and while usually achieving some
effect, often missing the intended target.
Viewed as a strategy aimed at bringing about a clear transfer of power from
whites to blacks, sanctions cannot be said to have succeeded. But they were
clearly a factor in the potent cocktail of forces which led to the demise of
apartheid.
In an authoritative report for the London School of Economics, researcher Ms
Merle Lipton concludes: 'His (Mr FW de Klerk's) unexpected crossing of the
Rubicon (in 1990) goes beyond any consideration of sanctions, which were not
hurting enough to explain such a dramatic move.' Mr de Klerk has simply
recognised, as his predecessor Mr PW Botha had begun to do, that apartheid
had led South Africa into a cul-de-sac from which it had to emerge to
guarantee its survival.
Whatever the political impact of sanctions, it is clear that they had
considerable psychological and economic effects: whether they were
unavoidable or unnecessary, there can be no doubt that they were costly.
Tens of thousands of skilled whites left the country rather than accept the
status of international pariahs, refusing to live in a society deprived of
normal cultural and sporting exchanges. And even the most defiant supporters
of apartheid have nonetheless shown obvious delight at being readmitted to
the international sporting community since 1990. Indeed, many would argue
that sporting and cultural sanctions were the most effective of all - not
least because these measures had a clear and unambiguous impact, unlike
economic sanctions whose effects are difficult to differentiate from normal
market forces.
Ms Lipton argues that while sanctions imposed extra costs and difficulties
for the South African economy, the country's economic problems 'are neither
unique nor solely due to sanctions. They are primarily due to market forces
reacting to adverse perceptions of its economic and political problems.'
Indeed, markets and not politicians imposed the harshest sanctions of all:
the shortage of international loan capital which has so severely constrained
economic growth since the mid-1980s. The crisis was provoked in 1985 when,
against a background of internal unrest, several US banks refused to roll
over existing loans to South Africa, precipitating a liquidity crisis which
forced Pretoria to declare a unilateral moratorium on debt repayments. It
has since been repaying those debts under a scheme agreed with creditor
banks, reducing its debt to 15 per cent of GDP at the end of 1992 from 43
per cent in August 1985.
This has come at a price, however: debt had to be repaid from the country's
savings, leading to a net capital outflow of more than R40bn. Not only could
this money have gone towards much needed domestic investment, but the need
to repay debt has forced Pretoria to constrain growth to avoid sucking in
imports which would endanger the current account, which had to remain in
surplus to cover repayments.
In terms of direct investment, both domestic and foreign, the effects are
difficult to quantify. Sanctions prompted uneconomic investment decisions
from the public sector, including the decision to invest in a synthetic fuel
industry to provide 30 per cent of fuel needs at well over the world market
price. The R12bn invested in the Mossgas synthetic fuels project, for
example, is 10 times the 1993/94 budgetary allocation for housing, an area
of dire shortage.
Foreign disinvestment also imposed a burden, with hundreds of US and
European companies pulling out. However, the effects were ambiguous: though
many companies which wanted to remain were forced out by sanctions, over
half are believed to have sold out at bargain basement prices which
primarily benefited rich whites, and many retained non-equity links which
made their withdrawal largely symbolic. Some job losses among blacks also
resulted.
Trade sanctions were probably less effective: merchandise exports held up
remarkably well during the sanctions era. Figures from the Reserve Bank
(central bank) show that the physical volume of exports rose by 10 per cent
a year from 1984-90 and from the mid-1980s onward, despite sanctions, growth
in South African exports compares favourably with the overall growth in
world trade.
This is partly explained by the fact that two thirds of exports were
remarkably 'sanctions proof', being strategic metals and gold. And though
exports would certainly have been even higher without sanctions, their
effect was not decisive.
Over time, the effect of the oil embargo also declined: local oil companies
have been able to buy crude on international markets for some time, without
paying an 'apartheid penalty.'
However much as South Africans disagree over the effectiveness of sanctions
as a tool to inflict economic pain and reap political gain, they agree on at
least one thing: they are heartily glad to be rid of them. They realise that
the imperative now is to build the economy, not attack it for political
ends. That, in itself, is progress.

FT  25 SEP 93 / In the court of King Sihanouk: Victor Mallet observes
Cambodia's transition to democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORODOM Sihanouk was restored as King of Cambodia after signing a new
democratic constitution yesterday, formally bringing to an end one of the
UN's most expensive - and most successful - peacekeeping mandates.
The 70-year-old monarch, perched on a throne six feet above the ground, took
the oath of office under the chandeliers and painted ceilings of the
glittering throne room in his palace overlooking the Mekong River.
'I swear henceforth to abide by the constitution and to respect all the
interests of the Cambodian people,' he told the assembled diplomats,
Buddhist monks, and members of parliament wearing blue silk pantaloons and
white jackets.
The ceremony was the culmination of a two-year, Dollars 2bn UN operation to
bring peace and democracy to Cambodia after more than two decades of war.
King Sihanouk ended the mandate of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(Untac) by appointing the leaders of a new government: the senior prime
minister is his son Prince Ranariddh, whose royalist Funcinpec party won the
most seats in a UN-organised election in May; Mr Hun Sen, one of the leaders
of the previous communist administration, is the junior prime minister.
Yesterday was the occasion for mutual back-slapping, with the UN praising
the king and the king praising the UN.
'Cambodia is a striking demonstration to the world that an intractable
conflict can be resolved, and seemingly irreconcilable views can be
reconciled,' Mr Yasushi Akashi, the Untac chief, told a crowd of thousands
in front of the palace.
'Cambodia will thus stand as a model and a shining example for other UN
member states,' he said in an address from the balcony.
Many Cambodians, however, fear that the coalition government of royalists
and communists will prove to be unstable, and they doubt whether the
whimsical King Sihanouk will be able to confine himself to the ceremonial
role of constitutional monarch.
King Sihanouk, who was protected as usual by North Korean bodyguards armed
with ill-concealed pistols, was first given the crown by Cambodia's French
colonial rulers in 1941. But he resigned the throne after independence to
enter politics in 1955, and was overthrown in a 1970 coup d'etat.
In a speech from the palace balcony, the king quoted Tito and de Gaulle to
support his claim that his regime in the 1960s was a golden age of progress
for Cambodia, but he is remembered as much for his brutal treatment of
political opponents as for anything else.
The success of Untac and Cambodia's political factions in holding an
election and establishing the new constitution is overshadowed by the
daunting and barely begun task of rebuilding one of the world's poorest
countries.
At least King Sihanouk and his courtiers could be cheered by the sight of
about 100 defectors from the Khmer Rouge among the soldiers parading in
front of the palace.
The Khmer Rouge, the extreme left-wing guerrilla organisation blamed for the
deaths of 1m Cambodians when it ran the country between 1975 and 1978,
continues to harass the government from its strongholds in northern
Cambodia, but about 1,300 demoralised guerrillas have surrendered since the
election in May.
Prince Ranariddh, on walkabout in the crowd with his father, hugged some of
the former Khmer Rouge fighters and told reporters: 'Please don't call them
any more rouge or blue or yellow. Now they are back in the national
community.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / China moots threat of early Hong Kong takeover

CHINA yesterday raised the political temperature over Hong Kong's political
future when it published Deng Xiaoping's hitherto secret instructions to the
Chinese leadership on Hong Kong, including the threat to take over the
colony before 1997.
Publication of Deng's Hong Kong policy comes a week before the foreign
ministers of Britain and China meet in New York to review the progress of
bilateral talks about the colony's constitutional development. The 12th
round of talks starts in Beijing tomorrow.
The meeting comes as hopes are fading in Hong Kong for a Sino-British deal.
China has failed to respond to a compromise offered by the UK, and Hong Kong
government officials say the two may be weeks away from breaking off
dialogue unless Beijing relents.
Most observers saw the publication of Deng's thoughts in the context of next
week's meeting rather than as China's response to losing its bid to host the
Olympics in 2000, although China was angered by Britain publicly opposing
the award of the Olympics to Beijing. Publication was carefully
co-ordinated, suggesting that China planned it before it knew at 2.30am
Beijing time that it has lost its bid.
Deng's instructions were splashed across the front pages of the main
Communist party newspapers throughout China. Hong Kong's two pro-Beijing
newspapers also gave them front page treatment.
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, sought to play down the significance
of Deng's instructions. He said they predated by two years the Sino-British
Joint Declaration 'which guarantees Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years
after 1997.'
Yesterday was 11 years to the day when Deng met Mrs Thatcher, the former
prime minister, to discuss the transfer of the colony to China. His
instructions, titled 'Our basic position on the Hong Kong problem', were the
record of the conversation he had with her on September 24, 1982.
He told Mrs Thatcher that China was interested only in three issues: the
question of sovereignty, how China was to administer Hong Kong after 1997,
and ways of co-operating with Britain to prevent 'upheavals' in the colony
before its return to China.
Deng said that in the event of 'serious upheavals' China would make other
arrangements for the early recovery of the colony.

THE African National Congress said yesterday it would intensify efforts to
strike a deal with right-wing whites to ensure that they participate in next
year's multi-racial elections and reduce the threat of right-wing violence.
The ANC and the white right-wing Afrikaner Volksfront have held a series of
meetings in recent weeks to discuss right-wing demands for an Afrikaner
homeland, but have made only limited progress.
'The desire by the Afrikaner Volksfront to have an area demarcated as a
Volkstaat for Afrikaner people, where Afrikaners will be able to survive as
a nation, was tabled for frank and forthright discussions,' the two sides
said yesterday in an unusual joint statement.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, has often said that the ANC is prepared to
accommodate the demand for Afrikaner self-determination, by devolving many
central government powers to a region where Afrikaners would have a
significant presence.
ANC officials said privately they would be willing to draw up regional
boundaries to maximise Afrikaner support in one region, probably in the
Eastern Transvaal.
But Afrikaners would not be in the majority and would not control the
government; there was no question of an independent ethnic state for
Afrikaners.
But they hoped that such a region could allay Afrikaner fears of a
black-dominated South Africa, by providing an area where white political
power would not be completely diluted.
However, major differences remain between the two sides, with the Afrikaner
Volksfront insisting that non-Afrikaners would hold an inferior form of
citizenship in their proposed state, a demand which the ANC vehemently
rejects.
Talks are at an early stage and have not yet focused on detailed maps of
where the proposed state would be situated, or what powers it would
exercise. The two sides also disagree on a definition of self-determination.
The gap between the two sides is likely to prove difficult to bridge, but
officials from both the ANC and government see the effort to do so as
crucial to avoiding civil war in South Africa.
The ANC is particularly keen to accommodate the Afrikaner Volksfront, the
relatively moderate wing of the white right, in an attempt to split
Volksfront members away from the ultra-radical Conservative party. The ANC
is also trying to prevent a threatened alliance between the radical right
and Inkatha.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Czechs see threat to investment
</HEADLINE>

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOW of foreign investment to the Czech Republic is threatened by the
recession in the west and by rising local costs and wages, Mr Vladimir
Dlouhy, trade and industry minister warned this week.
Bureaucracy and the poor quality of information were also deterring
investors, he said in an article published in the daily newspaper Mlada
Fronta Dnes.
Mr Dlouhy, who is a fervent advocate of foreign investment as well as a
staunch defender of Czech interests, said that investment in the first half
of this year was Dollars 392m (Pounds 260m), slightly less than for the same
period of 1992. A large part of this was an investment carried over from
last year by Philip Morris, the US tobacco company, in Tabak Hutna Hora.
Mr Dlouhy said that the decision by Volkswagen, the German car manufacturer,
to scale down its investment plans for Skoda, the Czech car maker in which
VW has a 31 per cent stake, was 'another proof of the fact' that the
recession in the west was limiting investment plans.
'It does not make for too optimistic a picture,' though it was too early to
assess the likely results for the whole of 1993, he said.
Privatisation programmes in France, Brazil and other countries increased the
competition to attract foreign investors, while the recession in Germany was
causing a drop of 10 per cent in investment activity.
The Czech Republic's greatest attraction was its qualified, low-paid
workforce, but this was threatened by a 22-25 per cent rise in wages in the
first half of this year. The price of goods, raw materials, services, and
transport were also rising. There was serious overstaffing in companies, and
bureucracy made investment difficult, he said. 'When will all our
complicated specifications which foreigners cannot understand disappear.
There are 20 serious projects worth Dollars 540m for the Prague area alone
sitting in the network of the administration at the moment.'
Investors seeking to buy companies through the Prague stock exchange or its
over-the-counter RM-System rival were provided with poorer information than
they can find in other markets.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Germany and US agree on new bilateral aviation deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY and the US yesterday agreed a new bilateral aviation accord clearing
the way for a far-reaching collaboration deal between Lufthansa, the German
airline, and United Airlines, one of the three biggest US carriers.
The four-year agreement, which will come into force on November 1, allows
Lufthansa to enter a code-sharing partnership with a US carrier, giving the
German airline gradual access to any destination in the US. Code-sharing
allows two airlines to book their passengers on each other routes.
Lufthansa yesterday said that it was still negotiating with two potential US
partners, but negotations with United Airlines are urderstood to be in their
final stages. A deal would also place Lufthansa in a stronger competitive
footing against other European airlines which have already forged alliances
with US carriers.
Mr Jurgen Weber, the Lufthansa chairman, said that he was pleased with the
accord and that it would lead to fair competition on North Atlantic routes
to and from Germany.
The agreement also puts a two-year capacity freeze on US carriers flying
into Germany and back. A gradual increase on the number of North Atlantic
flights is foreseen for the following two years.
In return, the US will be allowed to have a second national carrier enter a
code-sharing agreement with an airline from the European Community.
Northwest, the US airline, already has such a partnership with KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines and has been seeking to prolong its transatlantic flights to
Amsterdam into the German market.
The air traffic agreement follows lengthy and difficult negotiations in
which Germany has sought to pry open the US market for its national
carriers. Germany claimed that the current post-war air traffic agreement
gave undue advantage to US carriers flying into Germany and had threatened
to abrogate it unless it was changed.
Under the new agreement, Lufthansa will be able to fly directly to 25
destinations in the US. It will be able to operate, via its code-sharing
agreement, up to 500 North Atlantic round-trip flights per week to anywhere
in the US by the year 1997. The German carrier at the moment operates 112
round-trip flights over the ocean per week.
US carriers will be limited to the existing number of North Atlantic flights
between the two countries for two years. The capacity freeze also applies to
US flights out of Germany to third destinations.
In the third and fourth year of the agreement, US airlines will be able to
increase North Atlantic round-trip flights to 14 per week and round-trip
flights to third destinations from Germany to seven a week. At the moment,
US carriers operate an average of 253 flights a week between the two
countries in the winter and 262 in the summer.
The US will be allowed in return to have 140 one-way flights a week operated
between the US and Germany through a code-sharing agreement with another
airline from the EC.
'This a win-win agreement which amounts to three-quarters of an open sky
treaty,' a German government official said.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Poland's largest party calls for debt cut

<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), the former-communist grouping
which emerged from Poland's elections last Sunday as the largest single
party, yesterday called on the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund to support the country's efforts to win a 50 per cent reduction in its
Dollars 12.3bn (Pounds 8.17bn) debt to western commercial banks.
In a meeting yesterday with foreign diplomats, they also reiterated their
commitment to the country's integration with the European Community and to
budgetary and monetary stringency.
However, Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, hinted yesterday, after
the final election results were announced, that the process of forming a new
government would take time and that 'there were equal chances of the SLD
being in government or opposition.'
The election results to the Sejm, parliament's lower house and most
important chamber, show that six parties managed to enter parliament. The
SLD and the PSL farmers' party, both of which have their roots in the
communist past, together won 35 per cent of the votes but gained a 66 per
cent share of the 460 seats.
Some 38 per cent of the almost 14m Poles who voted remain unrepresented
because of the election law which bars entry to parties which failed to win
5 per cent of the national vote. None of the anti-communist right-wing
parties, all of which ran separately, crossed the threshold.
However, their share of the ballot totals 19 per cent, or almost as much as
the post-communist SLD. The election saw a 52 per cent turnout compared to
43 per cent at the last election in 1991.
Mr Kwasniewski said yesterday he was still optimistic about forming a
government, Reuter reports from Warsaw.
'I am not a pessimist at the moment,' he said, 'I think things point now
more to the fact that there must be a government between the PSL and the SLD
and talks are still going on.'

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO WANTS WHAT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
LEFT DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE (SLD): The party, a former-communist grouping,
                                wants to govern in coalition with the
                                Democratic Union (UD), which would give
                                it respectability abroad and strengthen
                                its reforminst leadership in the face of
                                grass-roots populist demands. However,
                                it may be forced by the UD's stance (qv)
                                and against its better judgement into an
                                alliance with the Polish Peasants Party
                                (PSL).
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
POLISH PEASANTS PARTY (PSL):    The party, a farmers' organisation which
                                survived the post-war period by
                                collaborating with the former
                                Communists, is looking to the Union of
                                Labour (UP) and maybe the UD to join it
                                in a coalition which would isolate the
                                SLD and provide urban allies. The party
                                would like to see its leader, Waldemar
                                Pawlak, as prime minister and to avoid a
                                simple pairing with the SLD, which would
                                produce an old-style coalition backed by
                                only 35 per cent of the voters.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
DEMOCRATIC UNION (UD):          The UD is likely to hold the key to the
                                formation of the next government as it
                                is the only Solidarity-based party
                                strong enough to be a coalition partner
                                and able to give either of the
                                election's two main victors both
                                respectability abroad and the support of
                                at least some Solidarity voters.
                                Meanwhile, however, it says it will
                                remain in opposition and is therefore
                                pushing together the SLD and PSL.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNION OF LABOUR (UP):           The party, a left-leaning movement led
                                by Ryszard Bugaj, the fiercely
                                anti-communist former Solidarity
                                adviser, is dismayed at the prospect of
                                having the SLD in power and wants the UD
                                to govern in coalition with the PSL and
                                itself. The UD has so far remained deaf
                                to the appeal.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Taxi war highlights big growth in racketeering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MURDER of a taxi driver this week during the middle of the day on
Wenceslas Square, one of Prague's main tourist and shopping boulevards,
highlights the growing lawlessness sweeping the city's taxi trade, writes
Patrick Blum.
Thursday's victim had come to the defence of a woman passenger violently
ejected from another taxi whose driver felt her destination was not distant
enough to be profitable. According to CTK, the Czech news agency, the victim
was kicked to death by the other driver for suggesting his behaviour gave
taxi drivers a bad reputation and would soon leave them with only themselves
to drive around the city.
The killing was only the latest in a series of violent incidents which have
claimed the lives of several drivers. The rising violence against taxi
drivers, and the control of taxi stands by Mafia-style gangs, have led the
Association of Prague Taxi Operators to call for action by the city
authorities to improve safety and restore law and order but until now little
has been done to improve the situation.
A delegation of taxi drivers yesterday appealed to the mayor, Mr Jan Koukal,
to 'free the Prague taxi service from the influence of people who assert
their right to decide who will or will not use taxi stands and who
recklessly decide on the unprecedented overcharging of customers.'
Last June, the association warned that organised groups were forcing honest
drivers away from the taxi stands through threats and by attacking them and
damaging their vehicles. The association says the gangs consists of former
secret police drivers, illegal money changers, and dealers in black market
goods.
It is not uncommon for taxi drivers to insist on a flat payment - usually
several times the meter fare - or refuse to carry passengers. Dishonest
drivers prey on unwary tourists and often ask for much more than the normal
fare of Kcs12 (27p)per kilometre. This correspondent was thrown out -
verbally - of a taxi on Old Town Square, the heart of the Czech capital,
packed with thousands of tourists on any summer day, for insisting that the
driver switch on his meter rather than pay a pre-set amount representing
five times the real cost of the trip. My threat to report the incident to
the police met with a laugh and a shrug.
But while many honest taxi drivers are driven out of business or face
threats, unwary passengers have also been robbed and attacked by drivers.
For tourists it is best to avoid the taxi ranks in the town centre, and call
a reliable taxi company on the telephone to avoid unpleasant surprises.
As elsewhere in central and eastern Europe, the demise of communism has
opened the door to the emergence of a new underworld involving a variety of
criminal activities including racketeering, protection, prostitution, drugs
dealing, and the illegal trade in arms and radio-active materials. Violence
is not uncommon as gangs fight for control, while an understaffed,
under-resourced, inexperienced and under-paid police force is overwhelmed by
the rise in criminality.

FT  25 SEP 93 / German cartel body to probe car makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Federal Cartel Office is to investigate complaints from automotive
components suppliers that they are being forced by German carmakers to bear
the brunt of the drastic restructuring that is now under way in the German
auto industry.
The cartel office yesterday urged suppliers to submit details of alleged
unfair and improper business tactics.
The call came from Mr Dieter Wolf, the cartel office president, at a meeting
at the office's Berlin headquarters between German suppliers and industry
associations to discuss the mounting problems of the sector.
Mr Rolf Kieker, the cartel office spokesman, said the call to the suppliers
was not directed against any particular company or individual.
All German vehicle makers
are engaged in a far-reaching drive to reduce their costs and improve their
competitiveness in the face of plunging sales of cars and commercial
vehicles.
The most highly-publicised cost-cutting effort is being mounted by the
Volkswagen group, Europe's biggest vehicle producer which suffered a loss of
DM1.6bn (Pounds 646m) in the first half of the year, and is being led by the
group's controversial purchasing and production director Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua.
Volkswagen has been in the forefront of carmakers seeking big price cuts
from suppliers this year. Several suppliers have publicly criticised
pressure from car manufacturers.
The cartel office said that companies affected had complained that they were
having to carry the burden of the structural changes in the automobile
industry.
Complaints would be collected and evaluated, said the cartel office.
The meeting agreed that there was a fundamental need to maintain an
effective and innovative automotive components industry, but the cartel
office said that the necessary structural adjustments must conform with
market rules, and there should be no distortions of competition.

western German and foreign companies to invest more in the chemical sector
in eastern Germany, which he said had the potential to become a base for
research and development, writes Judy Dempsey from Bitterfeld,

But he warned that investments in the sector must be coupled with greater
wage restraint. Productivity in the chemicals industry in eastern Germany is
about 65 per cent below western German levels, leading to losses of over
DM1.2bn a year.

The increase followed a revised decline of 3.1 per cent between June and

FT  25 SEP 93 / G7 ministers look for sustainable growth: Peter Norman
studies the agenda for today's talks in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE elusive goal of sustained non-inflationary growth for the world economy
will be at the centre of today's talks in Washington among finance ministers
and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations.
After a week in which the International Monetary Fund has downgraded its
forecasts for growth in the industrial countries this year and next, the
ministers from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada are
fully aware of the risks to economic recovery.
The US hosts of the meeting will press for more measures to boost global
growth. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, and Mr Larry Summers,
treasury undersecretary for international affairs, are concerned about a
lack of any convincing upturn in continental Europe and doubts about whether
the recent fiscal package and this week's sharper than expected cut in
Japan's discount rate will suffice to prevent full-blown recession in Japan.
Mr Bentsen called this week for more interest rate cuts in Europe and
intimated that he would like to see tax cuts in Japan. But today's meeting
will end without an economic policy communique - partly to allow time to
discuss developments in Russia with finance minister Boris Fyodorov. 'Don't
look for us to pull any rabbits out of hats,' Mr Bentsen said on Thursday.
Differences are sure to emerge between the US and Germany on their
perceptions of economic growth. The German government has rejected as too
pessimistic IMF forecasts of a 1.6 per cent decline in German gross domestic
product this year and growth of only 1.2 per cent in 1994. Bonn officials
say the economic recession has bottomed out and output will drop by only 1
per cent this year to be followed by 1.5 per cent growth in 1994.
The German delegation, led by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, will
counter demands for faster cuts in interest rates with assurances that
measures to cut the budget deficit should create room for further monetary
easing.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, may find himself in a
hotter seat. France's reluctance to cut rates decisively since the widening
of the European exchange rate mechanism's fluctuation margins early in
August has disturbed other G7 countries. In addition, France's obstruction
of progress towards a conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks is viewed as a serious threat to the world economy.
Mr Bentsen made clear this week that the US would not tolerate a reopening
or renegotiation of the Blair House agreement to reduce subsidies in
agricultural trade. Although Mr Alphandery is not a trade negotiator, he
will be given a clear message to send to Paris from the US and the other G7
countries.
It is through such lobbying and persuasion that the G7 finance ministers
hope to influence the world economy. And Mr Bentsen, who has breathed new
life into the group as treasury secretary, is pleased with progress so far
this year.
The past six months have seen significant policy changes in the G7
countries. The US has adopted a Dollars 500bn (Pounds 325bn) deficit
reduction programme. Japan has begun deregulating its economy in addition to
its economic stimulation packages. While there have been complaints about
the pace of interest rate reduction, borrowing costs have come down in all
G7 countries.
It is likely that such steps would have been taken in the absence of the
finance ministers' meetings. But it is possible to argue, as did a senior US
treasury official this week, that the discussions among the G7 ministers
have had a catalytic effect that has speeded policy change.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Congress set for crime crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESS may act to combat crime as early as next month following the formal
introduction this week of crime legislation in both the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
The legislation proposes limits on the right to habeas corpus appeals, new
forms of punishment such as military-style 'boot camps' for young offenders
and authorisation of funding for another 50,000 police officers.
The House version of the bill includes the so-called Brady bill, designed to
curb sales of handguns by imposing a five-day waiting period.
Both bills propose a largely symbolic expansion of the federal death
penalty, but drop a proposal for executing 'drug kingpins' because of doubts
about its constitutionality.
President Bill Clinton yesterday rallied support for crime legislation in
Florida, which has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the US and
has been the scene of a string of recent killings of tourists.
He argued for boot camps, community policing and gun control. 'These are
things we have to do. These three things are preventive, and they're worth a
pound of cure.
'There's no use in us pretending that some national government programme and
money alone will fix it, but there's no use in us pretending that just
preaching at people will fix it either,' he said.
Congressional legislation on crime usually turns into an opportunity for
politicians to show their constituents how tough they are. It also tends to
have little effect, because most crime is the responsibility of state and
local governments.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Yeltsin example prods Ukraine towards polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE yesterday provided a model of political harmony for Russia by
deciding to hold early parliamentary and presidential elections to end
crippling political in-fighting, Leyla Boulton writes.
Inspired by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's forcible suspension of
parliament this week, the parliament voted to hold parliamentary elections
on March 27 and a presidential poll on June 26.
'If we take no decision today on elections, (President Leonid) Kravchuk will
be left with no choice but to act like Yeltsin,' warned Mr Yevhen Sviderski,
a liberal deputy.
Mr Kravchuk agreed the dates from his car-telephone while in Moscow for a
commonwealth summit during which he could not agree to full membership of an
economic union pact without returning to Kiev for consultations with
parliament.
Parliament has opposed closer links with Russia and favoured keeping at
least some of the nuclear weapons on its soil despite international pressure
to give them up.
But most damagingly, the republic has made no progress with economic reform
because of resistance to it from both the president and among deputies.
Opposition parties and trade unions had threatened to stage a general strike
next week if parliament, elected in 1990 before Ukraine became independent,
failed to take action. Mr Kravchuk, elected in December 1991 on the same day
Ukrainians voted for independence, agreed to stand for re-election if
parliament agreed to do the same.
If he decides to run, a very strong candidate in the presidential poll could
be Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister who resigned last week saying
conservatives were preventing him carrying out reforms.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Latin America 'chaos' warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAILURE by Latin American governments to act aggressively against poverty
could lead to chaos, the World Bank argues in a report today.
The region has the most unequal income distribution in the world, with the
poorest 20 per cent of the population receiving about 4 per cent of income,
it said.
'Failures to act aggressively on poverty will likely encourage distributive
conflicts, prompting discontent and perhaps even a return to populism,
dirigisme and chaos,' the report argued.
Economic growth remained the best way out of poverty, but programmes should
be directed towards the poor, both to tackle the short-run consequences of
poverty such as malnutrition and longer-run issues such as poor schooling.
It said three fundamental policy elements were needed: prudent
macro-economic management, further reforms to the structure of the economy
and its institutions, and the alleviation of poverty.
In the overall economy, it was important to monitor the large increases of
capital from investment portfolios. 'There is little doubt for most
countries that the current capital inflows will not continue in the long
run.'
It added: 'If macro-economic management is less than prudent, capital
inflows could grind to a sudden halt, unleashing potentially serious
macro-economic dislocations.'
Other priorities were to devise policies that encouraged domestic,
especially private, savings; to invest in infrastructure; and to develop
institutions such as central banks. It supported the move to independence of
central banks in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela.
It said that only in Chile and Mexico did the economic reforms of recent
years have a low probability of reversal and it was important to avoid
premature exuberance and enthusiasm about recent policy changes. 'In the
rest of the region, the reform process is at different stages of
implementation - with different degrees of political popularity.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Environmental case against Nafta rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A victory for President Bill Clinton, a federal appeals court yesterday
overturned a ruling that US officials must prepare an environmental
assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The unanimous 3-0 decision reversed a lower court's ruling, which had
threatened to delay, if not scuttle, the proposed free trade pact between
the US, Canada and Mexico.
The earlier ruling would also have set a precedent which could have affected
other US trade agreements, including the Uruguay Round. Environmental impact
statements (EIS) take months to prepare, and sometimes years to argue when
they are challenged in court.
On June 30, the US trade community was thrown into an uproar when three
environmental and public interest groups - Public Citizen, the Sierra Club
and Friends of the Earth - successfully argued for US officials to prepare
an assessment of Nafta's impact on the environment.
District Court Judge Charles Richey ruled that the three groups had
'demonstrated that there is a reasonable risk that Nafta may cause
environmental injury'.
The administration swiftly appealed, arguing that while agency proposals
might be subject to the EIS rule, the president is not. It is the president
who submits trade agreements, and his ambassador who negotiates them.
The appeals judges agreed and said the plaintiffs could not even sue until
executive action was final, that Nafta has yet to be sent to Congress, and
the side agreement on environment 'may well change the dimensions of the
conflict over potential environmental damage'.
Although yesterday's ruling is likely to be appealed again to the Supreme
Court, the court is not required to hear the case, and, if it does, is not
expected to reverse it.
While the White House yesterday was claiming victory, the three groups which
brought the suit could claim gains in the court of public opinion. In early
summer, most Americans were just beginning to learn about the trade pact.
The publicity given the court action brought the environmental link into the
news.
Nafta has become the most controversial trade agreement in memory, as
opponents fan the fears of job losses and environmental damage. The
administration is finally pushing hard for the pact, but it will be an
uphill battle.
Free-traders in Congress worry that the unpopularity of Nafta bodes ill for
the more important Uruguay Round. They worry that, if the pact is defeated,
loss of US credibility will hamper the already arduous negotiations in
Geneva and strengthen the forces of populism and protectionism in Congress.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Finns refuse to build fifth nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND'S parliament yesterday voted against building the country's fifth
nuclear power plant. MPs rejected the project by 107 to 90 after a heated
three-day debate, writes Christopher Brown-Humes from Stockholm.
The decision was immediately condemned by Finnish industry and trade unions,
who say the reactor is essential for the country's energy and for jobs at a
time of 20 per cent unemployment. The FM10bn-FM15bn (Pounds 1.1bn-Pounds
1.7bn) plant would have provided up to 10 per cent of Finland's energy needs
by the year 2000.
The vote has a wider symbolic value, with France and the UK now the only
west European countries with reactors under construction.
It will disappoint the international contractors who had already made bids
to build the plant: Sweden's ABB Atom, Russia's Atomenergoexport, and NPI, a
consortium formed by Germany's Siemens and France's Framatome.
The Finnish prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, opposed the plant, although his
cabinet colleagues within the centre-right government gave it the go-ahead
in February.
Mr Tauno Matomaki, chairman of the Confederation of Finnish Industry and
Employers, described the decision as 'a disincentive to industrial business
in Finland'.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Croatian demand over UN troops: Peacekeepers in dilemma
after being told to disarm rebels or leave

UNITED Nations diplomats were engaged in intensive discussions in New York
yesterday after the Croatian government demanded that the UN should either
strengthen the mandate for its 14,000 peace-keeping troops in Croatia, or
withdraw completely.
With the peacekeeping mandate in Croatia due to expire in five days, UN
officials admitted the demand had left the Security Council facing another
Balkan diplomatic dilemma.
The Security Council is due to meet Croatian President Franjo Tudjman next
week to discuss the mandate, established 16 months ago after the 1991 war
between the Croat government and rebel Serbs.
UN officials have also asked Security Council members and the German
government, which has had particular influence with the Croat leadership in
the past, to step up their own diplomatic pressure on the Croat government
to withdraw its demand.
But Mr Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador to the UN, yesterday insisted the
UN forces should withdraw if they did not forcibly disarm the rebel Serbs
who control about a third of Croatia's territory.
'As a last resort there is the military option, although it is not our
intention to attack these areas immediately,' Mr Nobilo said.
Although most observers believe the Serb rebels could inflict serious damage
on the Croats, the Croatians have become concerned that the proposed
partition of Bosnia could herald the secession of the Serb-held areas from
Croatia.
However, UN officials yesterday insisted that though the UN is deeply
reluctant to withdraw from Croatia, the security council was not prepared to
step up its mandate.
One UN diplomat said: 'This has left the secretary general facing some
unpalatable options. We know if we withdraw there will be war. But it is not
the UN's job to risk lives disarming the Serbs.'
Bosnia's Moslem-led army has ordered Croat forces co-defending Sarajevo to
withdraw to barracks or face unspecified consequences, a Croat military
spokesman said, Reuters reports.
Gen Veso Vegar of the Croat Defence Force said 2,500 of its troops had
helped defend the capital against besieging Serbs for 17 months but the
Bosnian government command was now trying to neutralise them because of
Croat-Moslem fighting elsewhere in the republic.
The move appears to mark a serious threat to the Bosnian government's
attempts to maintain Sarajevo as an ethnically mixed city.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Economic union for 10 Soviet republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEN OF the 15 former Soviet republics yesterday signed a treaty of economic
union after nearly two years of trying to manage on their own economically
as independent states.
Although merely a framework, to be implemented only if republics agree on
the details, it marks a drastic sobering up to reality for fledgling
countries which had previously placed their political sovereignty above all
else. A striking illustration of this was Azerbaijan's accession yesterday
to both the commonwealth and the economic union treaty.
The 10 signatories, from Belarus in the west to Kazakhstan in the east,
agreed to 'gradually build a common economic space on the basis of market
relations' via:
the gradual reduction and eventual abolition of all customs tariffs and
other internal trade barriers;
equal legal status for one anothers' companies, to encourage jointly-owned
companies (this would in part enable other republics to pay Russia for
energy supplies with stakes in their industrial enterprises);
a payments union, or multi-currency clearing system to be run through an
Inter-State Bank. This would eventually be transformed into a currency union
under which republics would allow their currencies to float against the
rouble within agreed limits.
Those signatories which retain the rouble would have fiscal and monetary
policy determined by Russia.
War-torn Georgia sent an observer to the Moscow summit, while the three
Baltic states have avoided anything to do with the Commonwealth.
Turkmenistan did not sign, after other members questioned its request to be
exempt from key points of the treaty. Ukraine joined as an associate member
pending full approval from its parliament.
The treaty's most immediate benefit is political, giving Russian President
Boris Yeltsin an important show of recognition from Russia's neighbours as
he struggles to dissolve a parliament which has deposed him.
Many other republics have been driven to the treaty primarily through their
inability to finance energy imports from Russia, and see it as a means to
obtain financial help. The knock-on effects of the insolvency of a country
like Belarus have included a ban by the authorities on even private
Belarussian businessmen from transferring money to Russia.
Although he said yesterday's agreement would help further integration among
six republics which have already undertaken to keep the rouble as their
common currency, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central
bank, warned that the economic union could not be built overnight.
Russia has decided to issue Rbs1,000bn in bonds backed by 100 tonnes of
gold, Commonwealth television said, Reuter reports from Moscow.
It said Russia produced 150 tonnes of gold a year and had reserves of 330
tonnes. It did not say when the bonds would be issued and gave no details of
the interest rate or maturity.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Brittan urges rate cuts to 'kick-start' EC economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the European Community's chief trade negotiator, yesterday
called on member states to take advantage of the newly flexible exchange
rate mechanism to cut interest rates and 'kick-start' their economies out of
recession.
Laying out a policy for closer economic co-operation within the Community
based on agreed monetary growth targets for each of the 12 member states,
Sir Leon sought to salvage European economic and monetary union and restore
confidence in the Community's political ambitions.
Without mentioning France and other countries which have put a higher
priority on maintaining close links to the D-Mark, Sir Leon said interest
rate cuts should take place on condition that inflation risks were limited.
In a speech to the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London, Sir Leon
staked his claim as a contender to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of
the European Commission.
In defiance of UK government policy, he made clear that he did not share the
scepticism of Mr John Major, the prime minister, about the desirability or
likelihood of Emu. It would be 'a grave mistake to assume that this issue
will now slip quietly off the European agenda,' he said. At the same time,
nobody in the continent would try to force the UK back into the ERM or Emu.
Sir Leon also ridiculed the suggestion - floated by Mr Delors a week ago -
that capital controls might be the way to ward off currency speculators and
strengthen the ERM as a vehicle for future monetary union.
Such controls could not seriously be entertained, Sir Leon said. 'Their
reintroduction would be contrary to the commitments which European
governments have made to each other and internationally. They would
undermine price stability goals. They could be a step, not toward a single
currency, but away from it and certainly a step away from the single
market.'
Sir Leon sought to make a virtue out of the August 2 crisis which led to the
introduction of 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the ERM.
He called for a new road to Emu, based on member states adopting tough price
stability and monetary growth targets in common. If applying these targets
led to some countries being able to cut their interest rates, even at the
expense of a fall in the value of their currencies inside the ERM, this
should not be deemed a competitive devaluation, he argued.
Instead, he suggested that the Maastricht treaty's provisions for EC finance
ministers to set down 'broad guidelines' for economic and monetary policies
could underpin such a move.
'Such an approach will give member states a framework within which they can
better respond to their own economic needs. But it will be a step towards,
not away from, the goal of a single currency.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Mandela plea spurs lifting of S African sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRIES around the world began lifting sanctions on South Africa last
night after an appeal from Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress.
Only hours after Mr Mandela's call at the United Nations in New York, the US
Senate approved legislation lifting US sanctions. Canada, Australia and the
Commonwealth leadership said they would follow suit.
Mr Mandela, urging that all economic sanctions against South Africa be
lifted in an attempt to end the country's isolation, said victory against
apartheid was in sight.
Addressing a specially convened meeting of the UN Special Committee Against
Apartheid, which has spearheaded the sanctions drive over the past three
decades, Mr Mandela asked governments 'to take all necessary measures to end
the economic sanctions you imposed'.
His plea came a day after South Africa's parliament approved the creation of
a multi-racial Transitional Executive Council giving blacks a say in
government for the first time.
Mr Mandela called on the international investment community to 'help
regenerate the South African economy'. He said steps should be taken to
prevent South Africa becoming another Somalia or Bosnia. Sanctions had
brought it to the point 'where the transition to democracy has now been
enshrined in the law of our country'.
The passage of the South African legislation has been welcomed by President
Bill Clinton as an 'historic step'. He said the US would launch 'initiatives
to help restore economic growth' to South Africa. These include supporting
South African access to the IMF and World Bank.
Mr Mandela's call comes at the beginning of a crucial 10-day period in which
senior officials of the government and the ANC will be seeking to convince
investors and donors that they should invest in South Africa.
Mr Clinton later announced that the commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown, is to
lead a trade and investment mission to South Africa to explore business
opportunities, particularly with the black private sector.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Yeltsin calls in troops as deputies face ultimatum: Defiant
parliament told to disarm and quit building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday ordered troops and riot police to circle
the Russian parliament in an attempt to break the resolve of deputies who
have continued to defy his declaration of presidential rule.
Hours after an elite corps of interior ministry troops surrounded the White
House, the Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies appeared to be cracking
under the pressure of an ultimatum of 5am local time today (1am GMT) to hand
over weapons and evacuate the building, adjourning its session at about 9pm.
However, in an apparent act of continuing defiance, the deputies were
scheduled to reconvene today at 10am local time.
Within the White House last night the guards who had earlier carried machine
guns and automatic pistols were all without weapons. Later Moscow city
authorities loyal to Mr Yeltsin cut off electricity to the building.
Witnesses said vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, Mr Yeltsin's rival in the
power struggle, could be seen stalking the corridors with a candle. Partial
power supply was later restored with a reserve generator.
Nearby one person was injured when troops in full riot gear used batons to
clear anti-government demonstrators obstructing interior ministry trucks.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a close aide of Mr Yeltsin and first deputy prime
minister, said the proceedings in the White House were a 'tragi-comedy . . .
it is possible to say that the president has won'.
Despite the troop deployment, Mr Yeltsin, speaking at a meeting in Moscow of
leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, promised there would be
no attack on the White House, a pledge echoed by Mr Viktor Yerin, interior
minister, whose troops were surrounding it.
In a possible indication of Mr Yeltsin's strategy, Mr Shumeiko said deputies
would be allowed to leave parliament but not to return.
The parliamentary session ended with squabbling over the leadership of Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. Mr Veniamin Sokolov, head of
the Council of the Republic, said Mr Khasbulatov's 'potential was exhausted'
 -but Gen Rutskoi, named by parliament as acting vice-president, saved him
from defeat by saying that 'changing horses in midstream' would make the
deputies 'the laughing stock of the world'.
As the stand-off between the two power groups continued, attention shifted
to the regions where a number of councils have protested against Mr
Yeltsin's decree banning the federal parliament and threatened continuing
opposition.
Mr Aman Tuleyev, leader of the Kuzbass council, claimed that 24 of the 68
councils had defied Mr Yeltsin and would halt oil and gas exports and refuse
to pay taxes.
Echoing Gen Rutskoi and other parliamentary leaders, Mr Tuleyev called for
simultaneous elections of parliament and president on December 11 and 12 -
the date set by Mr Yeltsin for elections for the lower house of a new
parliament.
Mr Yeltsin has insisted on parliamentary elections first, followed by
presidential elections next June to avoid a vacuum of power, and also to
control the parliamentary process in its early stages. Presidential aides
said last night that regions that defied the president's decree to hold
elections would be forced to have local elections and would have
presidential rule imposed.

FT  25 SEP 93 / European interest rate cuts likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY round of European interest rate cuts looked more likely yesterday
after Denmark cut its discount and key deposit rates by 1/2 point to 8.25
per cent, writes James Blitz.
The Danish authorities may have been encouraged to make the move by the
krone's strong performance against the D-Mark in recent days.
Some dealers also noted that the French authorities had allowed the cost of
overnight funds to drift down by 0.2 points to about 7.15 per cent, bringing
it closer to the intervention rate, which marks the effective floor for
France's rates.
The intervention rate has not been cut since the exchange rate mechanism's
bands were widened last month.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Branson bets on flutter-as-you-fly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Branson is taking a gamble by introducing a new form of
entertainment on long-distance flights.
His Virgin Atlantic Airways plans to launch the first casinos in the sky
when it starts daily services from London Heathrow to Hong Kong next
February with new Airbus A340 airliners.
Not only will passengers in all three classes of the aircraft be able to
play roulette, blackjack, poker and other games of chance on videos from
their seats, but on some flights there will also be live gambling with a
croupier in the lounge area of the cabin.
Mr Branson said there was nothing to stop him from introducing gaming on
board once an aircraft is 20 miles out of the airport. 'You can do anything
you want: you'll get the brothel in the sky next,' he said.
Virgin Atlantic is planning to introduce airborne electronic shopping
facilities at the same time as gambling.
Both will be available on channels on a new, advanced video system fitted to
the back of the seat in front of each passenger. The system, in which Virgin
has invested about Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m), is being developed by Hughes
Avicom of Los Angeles.
Using a credit card, passengers will be able to use the gaming channel or
order goods from the shopping channel and collect their goods either on
board or on arrival.
'We are still working on the software but we expect it to be ready to
introduce on the Hong Kong flights next year,' Virgin said. It said there
would be a credit card swipe in the seat video system to credit or debit
passengers.
Mr Branson sees these facilities as the economics of air travel in the
future. 'If we make Pounds 10 more per passenger it will add Pounds 20m more
to our bottom line,' he said.
'But we will clearly make certain not to take away too much money from
passengers because we want them to come back.'
Upper and lower limits will be built into the system to control how much
passengers can bet, win or lose. Virgin said the idea was not so much to
create a 'gaming palace' in the air but to extend the range of in-flight
entertainment.
However, the airline is clearly targeting the strong gambling penchant of
the Hong Kong Chinese by starting the facility on its new Hong Kong flights,
for which it this week gained slots at both airports.
The airline is also recruiting an additional 500 employees to prepare for

FT  25 SEP 93 / Mandela seeks lifting of S African sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela called yesterday for the lifting of all economic sanctions
against South Africa, declaring that victory against apartheid was in sight.
The US Senate later approved legislation lifting US sanctions and Canada and
the Commonwealth indicated that they would follow suit.
Addressing a specially convened meeting in New York of the United Nations
Special Committee Against Apartheid, which has spearheaded the sanctions
drive over the past three decades, Mr Mandela asked governments 'to take all
necessary measures to end the economic sanctions you imposed'.
Mr Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, called on the
international investment community to 'help regenerate the South African
economy', offering a gloomy assessment of a country 'threatened by a process
of disintegration'.
He said steps should be taken to prevent South Africa sliding towards
another Somalia or Bosnia. Sanctions had brought South Africa to the point
'where the transition to democracy has now been enshrined in the law of our
country'.
Parliament passed legislation on Thursday creating a multiracial
Transitional Executive Council which gives blacks a say in central
government for the first time.
The passage of the legislation has been welcomed by President Bill Clinton
as a 'historic step'. He said the US would launch 'initiatives to help
restore economic growth' to South Africa. These include supporting South
Africa's renewed access to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Mr Mandela's call comes at the beginning of a crucial 10-day period for the
country in which senior officials of both government and the ANC will be
seeking to convince investors and donors that they should invest in South
Africa.
South African government officials and ANC representatives will attend the
annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. Next week will also see two
important South African investment conferences in New York and Washington
DC.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Daimler to take DM1.5bn charge

<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, will take a charge of
DM1.5bn (Dollars 617m) against earnings in the third quarter of the current
year to cover restructuring costs.
This emerged in a document Daimler has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission - the regulatory body for the US securities industry -
ahead of the listing of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange on October
5.
The figure fleshes out comments by Daimler management on Friday, when the
company reported a loss of DM949m for the first six months of the year. This
was after restating its figures in line with US Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (US GAAP) ahead of the listing.
Mr Gerhard Liener, the group's finance director, said then the losses would
be considerably worse at the end of the third quarter, as the costs of
rationalisation had not yet been booked against profits.
Mr Edzard Reuter, the group's chief executive, announced last week that a
total of 43,900 jobs would go this year and next, taking the total shed
between 1992 and 1994 to 60,000. All but between 3,000 and 4,000 of the cuts
had been announced previously. The bulk of the jobs will be lost through
'natural wastage', although there will be redundancies at the Mercedes-Benz
luxury car subsidiary and Deutsche Aerospace, the group's aerospace
subsidiary.
Analysts forecast the group will lose DM2bn for the year under US GAAP.
Turnover is set to come close to DM100bn after DM98.5bn last year.
Mercedes-Benz has agreed to acquire a 13 per cent stake in US-based Detroit
Diesel Corp, the German car and truck manufacturer said, AP-DJ reports from
Stuttgart.
Mercedes, the motor division of Daimler-Benz, said it took the stake through
its US subsidiary Diesel Project Development. The stake is valued at Dollars
40m, the company said.

GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance group, yesterday confirmed the marked
improvement seen in its underwriting business in the second half of last
year with a sharp rise in first-half operating profits to L315bn (Dollars
199m), compared with L186bn in the same period last year.
However, a sharp fall in extraordinary items and asset sales meant the
improvement was not carried through to the pre-tax level, where earnings
fell sharply to L426bn from L733bn last year.
Net extraordinary items or asset sales dropped to just L198bn, some L325bn
less than in the same period last year. Pre-tax profits were also affected
by write-downs of L66bn on the group's securities portfolio, compared with a
similar sized gain on its holdings in the first six months of 1992.
The upbeat trend in underwriting earnings led the group to predict that
full-year profits should exceed the L675.7bn before minority interests made
after tax in 1992, in spite of the fact that extraordinary earnings were
unlikely to match the levels of last year.
Group premiums rose by 13.7 per cent to L4,594bn. Adjusted for exchange rate
movements, the increase was limited to 8 per cent. Premiums on life
insurance jumped by over 17 per cent to L1,848bn, while non-life premiums
rose by 11.3 per cent to L2,746bn.
Generali said underwriting results on its Italian non-life business had
improved significantly thanks to lower claims and a more selective policy
towards new risks.
Performance on the life side continued to be 'fully satisfactory'.
Underwriting results outside Italy remained under pressure, though the
company said there were signs of an improvement.

<TEXT>
THE US health insurance industry, which stands to bear the brunt of price
controls under the healthcare plan proposed by President Bill Clinton, took
a conciliatory approach yesterday, applauding the president's aim of
reducing costs and extending coverage.
However, leading insurance companies continued to oppose the ceiling on
insurance premiums proposed in earlier drafts of the plan.
They claimed that the growth of managed care arrangements in recent years
has already helped to bring down the costs of healthcare and that price
controls would interfere with this process.
Met Life, one of the big five health insurers, said it agreed with Mr
Clinton's belief in managed competition, but added that his plan 'also
contains extensive price controls, payroll-based financing and regulatory
health alliances which would make managed competition unworkable.'
Even so, the insurers offered support for the aims of the Clinton reform
plans.
Their conciliatory tone was seen as an attempt to defuse tensions between
the US administration and the insurers, which have grown in recent days as
the insurance industry has begun intensive lobbying over the plan.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Henri Meier, finance director at Roche, the Swiss healthcare group,
yesterday said: 'We are not concerned at all about the forthcoming reforms.
They certainly won't have a big impact on our bottom line.' Roche generated
about 25 per cent of its sales in the US last year, and holds a significant
position in the US hospital market.
Mr Jan Leschley, of Anglo-American healthcare group SmithKline Beecham,
yesterday said: 'The main transformation has nothing to do with the
Clintons. It's the growth of managed care. Five years ago, it represented 5
per cent of our sales. Now it's 40 per cent. In five years it'll be 60 to 70
per cent.'
Intense competition from generic drugs was a change more significant than
the reforms. 'There is no need for government intervention through price
controls. Prices are already controlled through competition,' he said.

INVESTMENT in water treatment will double from its present level by the year
2000, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassis, the European environment commissioner, said
yesterday.
Germany expects to spend almost Ecu30bn (Dollars 35.4bn) on drinking water
in the next 10 years, the UK Ecu20bn, France Ecu8bn, and Denmark Ecu330m, he
added.
The two-day gathering of European government officials and water companies
marks the start of the Commission's first review of its 13-year-old drinking
water directive, one of the most ambitious parts of its environmental
regulation. The review has been prompted by complaints from water companies
that the standards have been higher than needed on health grounds and have
led to unnecessary expense.
However, Mr Paleo-krassis told the delegates: 'I cannot accept that
Europeans drink fetid, stale and brown water on the grounds that it is not
dangerous.'
This appears to contradict the argument by Mr Tim Yeo, UK environment
minister, earlier this week that 'temperature, taste and odour' of water
were 'not the Commission's business'.
The UK Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large UK water
companies, said yesterday that Mr Paleokrassis was 'using emotive words' and
that it backed Mr Yeo's call for a more narrowly-focused directive.
Mr Paleokrassis indicated, however, that he would 'think very carefully'
about whether to incorporate the World Health Organisation's recent, tighter
guidelines on lead into the directive.
But he emphasised, however, that 'the Commission will take into account the
financial impact'. UK companies have estimated that replacing all lead pipes
could cost Pounds 8bn. The WHO also argued yesterday that a single limit for
tolerable levels of pesticides was inappropriate, as different pesticides
were toxic to different degrees.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (46): Europe's lost
jobs puzzle - Employment / Governments have begun to recognise the economic
waste and threat to social stability posed by persistently high levels of
unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WILL be remembered as the year in which mass unemployment finally rose
to the top of the policy agenda in most developed countries.
Over the past two decades the underlying jobless total has been rising
regardless of the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Every OECD region has
seen a trend rise in unemployment rates since 1960. The OECD's latest
economic forecast says that, by the end of 1994, the jobless total will have
risen to 8.25m in the US and 1.7m in Japan - but 23m in Europe.
But only now are governments beginning to recognise the economic waste and
threat to social stability that persisting unemployment at these levels
implies. At its the June ministerial meeting, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development published the interim findings of its
investigation into the causes of persistent joblessness in its member
countries.
The EC has also recognised the seriousness of Europe's unemployment problem,
devoting much of the time at its June summit meeting to debating the twin
challenges of reducing EC unemployment and reviving jobs growth. Not to be
out done, the Clinton administration is organising a summit on world
unemployment this autumn.
But it is in Europe that the debate appears to have caught the popular and
political imagination, not surprisingly perhaps, given the deepening
recession that Europe's monetary policy deadlock has bequeathed. The OECD's
latest economic forecast says that, by 1994, unemployment rates will have
risen to 6.4 per cent in the US, 2.6 per cent in Japan but 12.1 per cent in
the EC.
Europe also appears to have a more serious medium-term unemployment problem.
While the US unemployment rate did move upwards in the 1970s, it has
remained throughout the 1980s at around two thirds of European levels. Only
6 per cent of North America's unemployed have been out of work for more than
a year, compared with nearly 50 per cent of European job seekers.
But it is in the area of employment growth that Europe's record appears most
dismal. Since 1970, the US has succeeded in increasing the numbers in
employment by 30m - three times as many as the Community. Less than 60 per
cent of the EC working age population is currently in employment, compared
with around 70 per cent in the US and over 75 per cent in Japan.
This employment record touches a sore nerve for European governments.
Euro-sclerosis - the belief, popular in the early 1980s, that excessive
labour market regulation is undermining Europe's economic performance - is a
live issue once more.
The OECD, the European Commission and national governments are all now
asking whether the low levels of employment, as well as high unemployment,
in the EC are the result of the more regulated nature of the European jobs
market.
Perhaps there is truth in the argument that the combination of persistent
unemployment and sluggish job creation in EC countries, relative to other
developed countries, indicates a lack of flexibility and competitiveness.
The US experience suggests that deregulation has unpleasant distributional
side-effects, but the US economy has managed to create a large number of new
jobs in the service sector over the past decade.
Member countries, a Commission paper suggests, need policies which deliver a
more employment-intensive pattern of economic growth. The paper suggests
high non-wage labour costs in some continental European countries,
employment taxes, inadequate training and rigid working patterns might
explain this poor record.
Yet, this analysis ignores an important fact: that employment growth in both
the US and UK has co-existed with low and falling male employment in both
Anglo-Saxon countries. On average over the period 1982-90, and thus
excluding the effects of either British recession, 9.7 per cent of British
workers were unemployed according to the OECD, higher than in both the US,
France and Germany.
Rising unemployment is only part of the story. Male labour force
participation in the US and UK has dropped sharply over the past two decades
as many have shifted from being unemployed to economically inactive. The sum
of these two groups is the non-employed. On average in the 1980s, 12 per
cent of US males aged 25-54, and 14.9 per cent of UK males in the same age
group were out of work compared to 9.1 per cent in France.
Neither the US nor UK have avoided the economic shift which has pushed many
poorly educated men out of employment: the shift towards more sophisticated
technology and the employment of fewer unskilled production workers. By the
end of the 1980s, one in five workers in OECD countries was employed in
manufacturing, compared with one in four in 1960. Between 1970 and 1987 the
share of industrial employment in total employment fell by 7.3 percentage
points in the US, by 8.4 points in France and by 14.9 points in the UK.
The US and UK have been able substantially to increase total employment by
encouraging the creation of relatively low-wage service sector jobs. But
these jobs have been shunned by men and taken up mainly by female entrants
to the market. The proportion of UK women of working age who have jobs rose
by 6.7 percentage points across the 1980s, but male employment fell by 2.6
percentage points. The US and the UK have substantially more women of
working age in employment than, for example, France and Germany - nearly 60
per cent on average in the 1980s, compared with less than 50 per cent.
But neither the US nor the UK experience suggests that a deregulated, more
flexible, labour market is a solution to the puzzle which continues to dog
almost all developed country governments: why do so men not work anymore?
Labour market deregulation may be the fastest route to higher female
employment, albeit at lower wages. But it is not a solution to the OECD's
unemployment problem.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (47): Nightmare for
governments - Foreign Exchange / The problems central banks face in currency
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE banks which deal in the currency markets, the past 12 months have
brought huge volatility in exchange rates and huge profits.
But for government leaders committed to defending exchange rate targets, the
last year has been a nightmare. Events in the currency markets provide the
clearest indication yet that the globalisation of capital - one of the most
striking developments in the world economy in recent years - is making it
difficult for central banks to manage exchange rate movements.
In the late 1980s, the Group of Seven leading industrial countries had much
success managing exchange rate moves by buying and selling their currencies
in intervention operations.
The Plaza and Louvre accords helped to control the movements of the dollar.
Research has shown that of the 17 episodes of co-ordinated intervention
between 1985 and 1991, all were successful at moving exchange rates in the
desired direction.
But, since the last autumn central bank intervention has been a story of
failure. The US authorities failed to prevent a sharp fall in the dollar
last August. And repeated intervention by European central banks failed to
stop the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism.
Discrepancies in national monetary policies partly explain why the ERM's
central banks failed to maintain the system's tight fluctuation bands.
Foreign exchange dealers realised that the goal of sustaining the value of
the French franc through high interest rates was unsustainable at a time of
rising French unemployment.
But a far bigger problem for monetary authorities has been the growth of
cross-border capital flows following the removal of exchange controls in
most industrialised countries. Investment flows in the foreign exchange
market have increased dramatically in recent years, pushing foreign exchange
turnover up to Dollars 1,000bn a day. This dwarfs the reserves of the
central banks and makes it difficult for them to intervene in markets.
As the International Monetary Fund said in a recent report: 'When private
markets, led by the increasing financial muscle of institutional investors,
reach the concerted view that the risk/return outlook for a particular
currency has deteriorated significantly, a defending central bank can be
faced with a run that could easily amount to, say, Dollars 100-200bn a
week.'
Why have flows in the currency markets reached such huge proportions?
The increasing proportion of cross-border holdings of bonds and equities by
institutional investors has led to a huge increase inflows.
The International Monetary Fund recently reported that cross-border equity
holdings in the US, Europe and Japan increased from Dollars 800bn in 1986 to
Dollars 1,300bn in 1991 - and the figure is set to rise further.
These cross-border funds not only dwarf central bank reserves in size, but
fund managers can also successfully hedge exposure to exchange rate
movements by shifting the weightings in parallel currency funds rather than
selling assets outright.
Most of the G7 governments face large budget deficits as a result of
expansionary policies in the 1980s. They have raised government bond issues
in huge quantities to help meet their borrowing requirements - but they may
have undermined their currencies by courting foreign investors in this way.
French bond sales go some way to explaining the vulnerability of the franc.
According to some analysts, while France's total tradable public debt has
recently increased by 50 per cent, non-resident holdings of French paper
have risen 1,000 per cent in the same period.
Foreign exchange dealing is becoming an increasingly attractive way of
taking financial risk without falling foul of central banks' capital
requirements. A dealer can quickly move in and out of a currency, making a
return but not retaining a large outstanding position at the end of the
day's trading.
The growth of foreign exchange volumes - and its impact on exchange rates -
is not something that central banks are happy to ignore.
ERM membership was seen by European countries as a way of importing
Germany's tough anti-inflation policy through the exchange rate. Sharp
fluctuations in exchange rates are seen as a hindrance to trade. In the
summer, the US administration successfully talked down the dollar/yen
exchange rate, thereby beating Japan into submission on the issue of its
trade surplus.
So how can central banks respond to the problem?
Some thoughts were recently suggested by Mr Andrew Crockett, the head of the
Bank of England's international division. He argued in a paper that the
integration of capital markets meant central banks need to come up with more
credible ways to move towards exchange rate fixity.
Mr Crockett says that the route from flexible to fixed rates should not be
the gradual one of progressive hardening through something like an exchange
rate mechanism.
Instead, countries must first establish a track record of price stability
during periods in which their exchange rates are relatively flexible.
'The attempt to use hard exchange rate constraints to enforce price level
convergence when the initial position is one of substantial inflation
divergence has considerable dangers,' he says. 'International portfolio
managers will inevitably be sceptical about whether external disciplines
will be allowed to work when domestic disciplines have proved inadequate.'
Mr Crockett also argues that countries which fully fix exchange rates have
important advantages over those who operate fixed but adjustable policies.
'There are advantages in convincing markets that the instrument of exchange
rate adjustment has ben abandoned,' he says. 'The more markets believe that
other forms of adjustment will always be used in preference to exchange rate
realignment, the less likely is exchange market pressure to arise in the
first place.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (45): Health dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE developed world, the conventional wisdom runs, faces a growing
health-care crisis. Most countries have not managed to halt the growth in
the share of national income consumed by health.
Most face a sizeable gap between demand for healthcare and the funding
available.
But before policy analysts throw up their hands in despair, they should read
the World Bank's recent World Development Report.
The bank's analysis points out that at the root of this healthcare dilemma
lies an important success: the increase in the life expectancy of all of the
world's citizens.
In 1950, a child born in the developing world had a life expectancy of 40
years. Today it is 63 years. The chance of that child dying before the age
of five is now three times lower than in 1950.
The battle to improve health standards is not over. All regions of the world
have seen a rise in life expectancy at birth over the past 40 years. But
infant mortality is still 10 times higher in the developing world than in
the established market economies.
But economic development is the route to closing this gap: the message of
the World Bank's report is that there is a 'mutually reinforcing cycle' from
improved health standards to higher productivity and stronger economic
growth and higher spending on health.
Among developed countries, higher spending does not necessarily mean better
care. The US spends more than twice as much as the UK as a percentage of GDP
but more than 10 per cent of the US population has no assured access to
health care. But higher spending certainly helps.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (44): Asia the main
driving force - Motors / Kevin Done looks at the reasons for the downturn in
demand in the leading industrial countries
</HEADLINE>

THE long upward trend in worldwide new car sales has been halted first by
the fall of demand in the North American market in the late 1980s and then
by declining sales in Japan and now in western Europe in the early 1990s.
Growth in newly developing markets has been unable to compensate for the
downturn in demand in the main industrial countries.
For the rest of the decade, however, the strongest expansion worldwide both
in sales and production is expected to come from outside the leading
traditional car-consuming regions of western Europe, North America and
Japan.
According to a recent study by DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive analysts,
'the 1990s are expected to be a decade of structural changes in the pattern
of global car sales towards newly developing markets'.
The US is already a mature market where new car sales are increasingly a
function of replacement demand, and the same will be true of western Europe
by the end of the decade.
While the DRI report forecasts a 21 per cent increase in global car demand
from 1992 to 1998, the main impulses for this growth are expected to come
from South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and eastern Europe.
The Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) is also expected to be the main
focus for growth in car production for the rest of the 1990s with output set
to jump from 2.25m last year to 4.81m in 1998.
In western Europe new car sales are forecast to fall by 16 per cent this
year to 11.3m from 13.5m in 1992.
The outlook for next year is also gloomy with the prospect of only a minimal
recovery.
The decline in western Europe in 1993 will be steeper than during the
recession following the first oil crisis in the early 1970s.
Japanese carmakers have fallen under unaccustomed pressure in their domestic
market, where sales this year are suffering an unprecedented third
successive annual decline.
In the US fragile consumer confidence continues to threaten the pace of
recovery from recession, but car sales are rising again in 1993 after four
years of decline. Car sales (excluding light trucks) are forecast to rise by
around five per cent to 8.79m in 1993 but will still be nearly 3m units
below the 1986 peak.
New car sales worldwide are expected to contract by 3 per cent to 33.02m
this year, the second significant decline in the last three years. Global
sales are forecast by DRI to recover next year, however, with a rise of
around 5 per cent.
The auto industry plays a crucial role in the world economy in terms of
shaping trade flows, creating employment, contributing to research and
development, and in acting as a customer for other industries.
According to a study prepared for Acea, the European Automobile Makers
Association, the auto industry accounts for around 21 per cent of sales of
ferrous metals, 19 per cent of rubbers and plastics sales, 14 per cent of
metal products and 9 per cent of basic chemicals.
With the enormous growth in importance of the Japanese auto industry in
recent decades, the trade balances of the three main industrial regions of
the world, have been shifted fundamentally.
As the Japanese automotive trade surplus more than tripled during the 1980s
from Ecu13bn in 1979 to Ecu43bn in 1990, the US automotive trade deficit
ballooned from Ecu7bn to Ecu35bn in the same period. The European
Community's automotive trade surplus remained fairly constant at around
Ecu18bn through most of this period, but the EC has a substantial automotive
trade deficit with Japan, and the imbalance has been worsening
significantly.
According to Acea the EC automobile trade deficit with Japan was Dollars 6bn
in 1991, representing some 21 per cent of the total EC deficit with Japan.
The automobile deficit increased by 25 per cent last year and rose to 24 per
cent of the total deficit.
These large and persistent automotive trade imbalances continue to put heavy
pressures on trade relations between Japan and the EC and the US.
The tensions are being intensified by recession in the three regions and by
the growing burden of overcapacity.
Carmakers are being forced to close plants in North America, Europe and
Japan, but the industry has also invested heavily in new capacity with
Japanese carmakers in particular adding new production plants in Japan and
in North America and western Europe.
Mr Jacques Nasser, chairman of Ford of Europe, warned recently that the
problem of overcapacity was 'a major strategic concern' for all carmakers in
Europe. Ford did not expect new car sales in western Europe to return to the
trend level of 1990/91 until the late 1990s.
'The potential for excess capacity in the mid to late 1990s will be around
7m units.' This amount of overcapacity would pose 'severe structural
problems' for the European auto industry.
The wave of restructuring in recent years in the world auto industry is
forcing vehicle makers and automotive components suppliers to eliminate
hundreds of thousands of jobs. The German automotive industry alone must
shed a further 100,000 jobs in the next two years according to Mr Achim
Diekmann, chief executive of the German Automobile Federation.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (42): New
strongholds in the east - Steel / Production and consumption as a proportion
of the world total is falling in the mature markets. By 2000, China could be
the biggest steel producer in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MORE THAN most industries, steel is shifting in its economic importance to
the world economy, in line with the dramatic growth of the developing
countries and the maturing of western economies.
This is a process which can often be overlooked in a recession, which
inevitably focuses attention on issues such as overcapacity in traditional
western producing countries - notably in Europe.
Similarly, developments such as the collapse of the communist regimes of
eastern Europe, and the consequential question marks placed on its steel
production, can obscure the broader global picture.
Mature economies have relatively less long-term need for steel than
developing or industrialising ones. Steel is a basic, mother product used
for automobiles, construction, white goods, factory equipment. These are all
owned in abundance in the west yet - at least in the case of consumer goods
 -still aspired to by the majority of the population in countries such as
India and China.
Technological change also tends to create product substitution, with
plastics, aluminium, or newer composite materials making inroads into
traditional steel markets. Again, this trend is more prevalent in developed
economies.
Because of these factors, growth in steel consumption lags behind overall
economic growth in developed countries. It has been estimated that gross
domestic product in the European Community needs to rise by 1.5 per cent a
year simply to keep steel consumption - about 105m tonnes last year -
static.
Figures from the International Iron and Steel Institute bear out the
changing patterns of steel production, which match the surging economic
growth rates achieved recently by developing countries.
In 1950, the western world accounted for 153m tonnes of total world
production of 190m tons. In 1992, the west accounted for 488m tonnes out of
the 721m tonnes total.
Among main steel producing nations, China is already in third place at 80m
tonnes of crude steel last year, and in 1993 is likely to overtake the US,
which produced 84.3m tonnes last year. By the end of the century, China
could be the biggest steel producer in the world, eclipsing Japan which had
output of 98.1m tonnes last year.
As for consumption of steel, developing countries accounted for 15.1 per
cent of the world total in 1982, and 20.4 per cent last year. The share of
China and North Korea, which are treated by the IISI as centrally-planned
economies rather than developing countries, rose from 6.9 per cent to 11.7
per cent over the same period.
The rise in consumption in developing countries has led to big increases in
employment in the steel industry, partly because productivity has failed to
keep pace with demand and old-fashioned production methods are still used.
In India, for example, the two dominant companies, state-owned Steel
Authority of India (Sail) and Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco) increased total
employment from 197,000 in 1974 to 294,000 last year, according to IISI
statistics.
In western Europe and the US, by contrast, the need for capacity cuts to
reflect steel's relatively declining importance has been accompanied by
heavy investment in modern production techniques and the complete
disappearance of inefficient open-hearth production.
As a consequence, employment in the ten biggest steel producers in the
European Community has fallen from 887,000 in 1974 to 352,000 last year.
Over the same period, employment in the US has fallen from 521,000 to
190,000, and in Japan from 459,000 to 304,000.
Forecasts by US-based WEFA Group for world steel production over the five
years from 1992 bear out all these trends. It predicts that total world
steel production will rise from 714.2m tonnes last year to 763.9m in 1997.
EC production is seen hovering between 126m and 135m tonnes a year, and
North American production is predicted to range between 101m and 105m tonnes
annually.
But production in Latin America is predicted to grow from 43m tonnes this
year to 54m by 1997, while output in developing Asia (mainly South Korea and
India) is forecast to rise from 70m tons to 81m tons over the same period.
Chinese production, WEFA predicts, will rise from 85m tons of crude steel
this year to 95m tons in 1997. This seems a reasonable target even with the
attempts by the Chinese government to cool down the country's sharply rising
economic growth.
The growth in the Chinese market has had a ripple effect in Europe. In the
first half of this year, as European producers and the European Commission
grappled with planned capacity cuts and the thorny issue of state subsidies,
output reductions followed by buoyant demand from China for long products
helping to keep prices firm.
Apart from China, one of the most interesting steel markets over the next
decade could be India. A recent report by Lehman Brothers noted that Indian
GDP could grow by an average 5 per cent a year over the next 10 years, which
could double steel consumption from its current level of 16m tonnes a year.
India is currently the world's 10th largest steel producer - or ninth if
Russian and Ukrainian output is combined. But the report says India could
easily be higher up the list by the early years of the next century as
rapidly growing production overtakes static or declining output in
industrialised countries.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (43): Stuff of
dreams a decade ago - Telecommunications / In developed countries, the
emphasis is on competition, efficiency and new networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF THE WORLD'S larger industries, telecommunications is the fastest growing.
Over the past decade its expansion has far outstripped GNP growth, and it is
set to continue on the upward track for the foreseeable future.
'We are not sure whether improved telecommunications drives economic growth
or vice versa', says Mr Mike Minges, a leading analyst at the lnternational
Telecommunication Union in Geneva. 'But one thing is certain: no country can
sustain growth without a modern telecommunications infrastructure.'
The graph makes the point at a glance. No country with annual GDP of more
than Dollars 7,000 per head has a 'teledensity' of less than 20 - that is,
fewer than 20 exchange lines per 100 people. Virtually all the plus-Dollars
7,000 countries have a teledensity of more than 30.
However, they remain exceptional. The dense grouping of countries in the
bottom left corner highlights the reality that most of the world is poor,
and most of the poor have no telecommunications. Most of the world has a GDP
a head of less than Dollars 2,000 and fewer than five exchange lines per 100
people.
Of the 133 countries covered by the ITU survey, 70 have a teledensity of
less than 5. That means virtually the whole of Africa north of South Africa,
most of Asia and much of central and Latin America. The contrast within some
regions is striking.
Hong Kong has a teledensity of 49 and Singapore 40; whereas the Philippines
languishes at 1.5, Thailand at 2.7, Malaysia at 11. Even within the Europe
Community, Portugal (at 32) and France (at 52) are poles apart.
In terms of policies to enhance telecommunications, the world can be broadly
divided into three camps: developed countries (with teledensities of
30-plus); emerging market countries (with teledensities of between about 10
and 30); and developing countries, with fewer than 10 lines per 100.
In the developed countries, most people who want a phone can secure one at
an affordable price. The emphasis is on competition, commercial efficiency,
new networks (particularly for cellular mobile services) and the
introduction of value-added products and services. For established users in
these countries, the cost of 'fixed line' telephony is reducing sharply as
infrastructure and operating costs tumble and competition forces prices
down.
For the developed world's business sector, advanced telecommunications offer
options which were the stuff of dreams only a decade ago. In Scandinavia and
the US, cellular mobile teledensity is already approaching 10. 'One-stop'
telecoms packages are coming to the market for transnational customers, with
AT&amp;T and BT leading the battle among the main operators to become truly
global companies. Multimedia - the buzz-word for products spanning the
telecoms/audio/computing/entertainment divides - is widening horizons
further still.
In the emerging market countries, the emphasis is on line growth and the
provision of advanced services in main cities so as to keep and attract
inward investors.
Privatisation is coming to be seen as a key tool for both attracting cash
and overseas expertise to carry out these tasks.
Greece, for instance, last year auctioned two licences to build the
country's first cellular mobile networks - granting them to consortia led by
Stet of Italy and Vodafone of the UK for more than Dollars 150m apiece. It
is currently looking for an overseas strategic partner to take a minority
stake in the state telecommunications operator.
Hungary is in a similar position and could become a pace-setter for eastern
Europe. Of countries in the former eastern bloc, only Bulgaria and the
Baltic states have teledensities of more than 20, with most of the region
down at between 10 and 15.
The World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development have investment programmes for the region,
but a main priority is to foster a legal and financial environment conducive
to greater investment by overseas operators.
In developing countries, fixed-line growth is the overriding concern. Again,
however, western investment will play an increasingly important role through
franchise contracts to build, operate and transfer (BOT) new networks. In
Thailand, for instance, Japan's NTT has a stake in a private Thai telecoms
company with a contract to build 1m lines in the provinces; while
TelecomAsia, a consortium in which Nynex, the US regional operator, holds a
15 per cent stake, has a BOT contract to build 2m lines in Bangkok.
'The BOT model will be the modernisation path for developing countries
across the region,' says Mr Andrew Harrington, Asia-Pacific telecoms analyst
with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong.
China, with a teledensity of precisely 1, is the world's biggest boom market
in prospect. China's Minister of Posts has proclaimed a target of 75m new
exchange lines by the year 2000, equivalent to three times the BT network
and more than a quadrupling of existing capacity.
Western operators and equipment suppliers are wide-eyed at the prospect.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (41): Market
unlikely to recover until 1996 - Chemicals / The recession has caused
turmoil in the industry. Overcapacity and poor demand has led to a collapse
in prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's chemical industry is in turmoil. The sector, accustomed to
wickedly cyclical swings in profitability, is at the bottom of a long and
painful recession.
Prices, margins and profits have fallen. So, too, have sales. Worldwide
sales of chemicals fell from Ecu970bn (Dollars 1,144bn) in 1991 to Ecu941bn
last year, according to Cefic, the European chemical industry's trade
association. The decline is in spite of continuing rapid growth in the
Asia-Pacific region.
The fall is a result of the recession in the western economies. The
chemicals sector, representing 2.5 per cent of the European economy, is
highly dependent upon the construction and automotive industry, both badly
affected by the downturn.
The decline in value of chemical sales is not due to a downturn in
production. Rather a combination of overcapacity and poor demand has led to
a collapse in prices. Take PVC, for example; prices of the product, widely
used in vehicles and buildings, have fallen in Europe from a peak of DM1.85
in 1989 to DM1 during the second quarter of this year.
Meanwhile, in the US, the slow, hesitant recovery is also being undermined
by overcapacity. Analysts believe there is not a single manufacturer of high
density polyethylene in the US making money. From a peak of about 45 cents a
pound in 1990, prices have plummeted to 28 cents. Recent attempts to raise
them have been unsuccessful. The market is unlikely to recover until 1996 at
the earliest.
The need for restructuring in Europe has been apparent for at least two
years. But in spite of well-publicised negotiations, progress so far has
been limited.
Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals, the UK group, has said
German manufacturers should cut production. Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman of
BASF, the German company, confidently predicts British and Italian producers
will cut capacity.
However, Mr Cees van Lede, chairman-designate of Akzo, the Dutch group, says
every cloud has a silver lining. 'The recession has allowed us to
restructure and cut costs in a way that was just not possible during the
late 1980s,' he explains.
Whether the end of recession in the western economies will bring an end to
the chemical sector's pain is far from certain.
A significant and fundamental structural shift in the geographical location
of production appears to be occurring. Just as the manufacture of fibre has
for the most part followed the textiles industry to the Far East, so
petrochemicals and plastics production looks to be shifting to low-cost
sites in Asia and eastern Europe.
'A substantial relocation of industry is occurring,' says Mr van Lede. 'A
skilled industrial worker in Germany takes home about DM600 a week. Just
across the border in the Czech Republic he gets DM60, and in Russia it is
DM6. This is going to lead to a fundamental rethinking of the industry and
how this should be managed. We have a choice. We can either import cheap
labour - which is politically impossible - or we can employ them in their
local economies.'
The advantages of manufacturing in eastern Europe is already apparent. Cheap
eastern European imports are flooding into western Europe. The loudest
complaints have come from western European companies manufacturing
fertilisers, soda ash, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), caprolactam (a precursor of
nylon), and melamine (a plastic).
With low inflation, slow growth and improving productivity in western
companies, the outlook for employment in western Europe looks grim unless
they can change to higher growth products such as pharmaceuticals, says Mr
Lede.
Mr Donald Anderson, chief economist of Courtaulds, the UK group, says: 'The
difference in cost levels between Europe, the Far East and eastern Europe,
have really not been addressed by the sector. The adjustment problems will
be very severe and western European companies will be severely tested to
match those elsewhere.'
'The chemical industry is at a critical stage of its development,' agrees Mr
Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of ICI, the UK's largest chemical group. 'The
market has changed forever, and we must learn to cope with a low inflation
environment and globalisation.'
Nearly all European and many US groups plan to respond to the present crisis
in the west by expanding their operations in the fast-growing Asian
economies over the next few years.
Courtaulds, the UK group, still views the UK as an important manufacturing
base, but it sees itself as under-represented in the Asia-Pacific region,
according to Mr Anderson.
'The statistics are unreliable in the Far East, but the growth is more than
10 per cent. Some of the investment substitutes exports, but we are
optimistic. The potential of China is frightening,' he says.
Local production in Asia is growing rapidly but is not without problems. The
pain of growth can be as difficult as the pain caused by recession.
The extraordinary growth of petrochemicals production in South Korea has
upset Japanese and Middle East manufacturers. Ethylene capacity has tripled
in the past three years to 3.25m tonnes a year, 2m tonnes more than domestic
demand.
Korean companies had hoped to sell surplus requirements in China. However,
the Korean Petrochemical Co has recently been granted protection from
creditors and all its liabilities have been frozen.
If even Asian manufacturers are suffering, the outlook for higher-cost
western producers looks bleak.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (40): A productivity
paradox - Industry overview / The gap between accelerating technical change
and weak economic performance is perplexing economists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARADOX could not be greater. The industrialised world is experiencing a
rapid and far-reaching technological revolution. Information and
communications technologies, advanced automation and robotics, and new
engineering materials, such as polymers, composites and ceramics are
revolutionising production processes and products.
Yet the big industrial countries are either struggling to get out of
recession, or still facing declining production and rising unemployment.
With few exceptions (one may be Britain), productivity has shown few signs
of regaining the strong growth demonstrated in the main industrialised
countries in the two decades following the second world war.
This so-called productivity paradox has become a question of growing concern
to governments and economists. Some have suggested that the problem may be
partly statistical: that the contributions to growth and prosperity created
by the new technologies are not properly captured by the data that
governments gather.
The slow emergence of harmonised industrial standards may also be delaying
the application of technology. But many economists believe the reason for
the perceived gap between accelerating technical change and weak economic
performance is social conditions and the organisation of companies.
Such ideas have emerged in research encouraged by the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and carried
out at centres such as the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the
University of Sussex in Britain.
This research highlights the distinction between technical innovation and
its diffusion. New technologies are coming on stream and becoming ever more
sophisticated but they may also be proving difficult to introduce in what
economists call the existing techno-economic system.
The industrialised world is undergoing a difficult transition. At one
extreme, the development of compact personal computers, low-cost modems and
falling telecommunications costs have enabled some workers in
knowledge-based industries to work from home. But much of the productive
apparatus of the big industrial countries would look familiar to anyone who
had seen a factory shortly after the first world war.
Continual rationalisation and innovation mean the car industry, for example,
now produces many varieties of a car model on a single production line: a
huge difference to Henry Ford's day when people could buy the Model T in any
colour 'provided it was black'. But the rigidly organised factory system,
based on the mass consumption of standard products and with a high energy
and raw material requirement, still has not been replaced by any clearly
identifiable new technological style.
The coexistence of old and new is a sign that the industrialised world can
only slowly apply new technologies to its industrial base and that it will
be some time before today's technological revolution becomes a true
industrial revolution. Nor should this be a surprise. The diffusion of
innovations can be a hit and miss affair and history offers many lessons of
slow take-up.
Markets may not be ready to accept inventions. The McCormick reaper, which
later become one of the 19th century's most successful inventions, was
invented in the 1830s but not bought in large numbers until 20 years later,
when the grain farms of the US grew in size and labour became more
expensive.
Bottlenecks can arise because it is difficult for users of a new technology
to see its full potential. The introduction of the electric motor at the end
of the 19th century yielded no rapid rise in productivity. Factory owners
often attached the motors to existing group drive systems of belts, shafts
and pulleys that had earlier been driven by steam or water rather than use
the motors in the most productive way to power individual machines in a unit
drive system.
Such lags in the application of technology can have a positive side.
Companies, which are not in the vanguard of achievement, can still adopt
recent developments to compete effectively. In its recent report
Manufacturing into the late 1990s, Britain's Department of Trade and
Industry observed that: 'While important and fundamental developments in
technology will be seen, no doubt, over the next 10 years, the vast majority
of UK manufacturing companies will be concerned with applying and using
incremental developments of technologies that are already established.'
However, the DTI does expect that the rate of uptake of technology will
increase. This already seems to be happening in the US, according to Mr
Albert Edwards, an economist and global equity strategist at Kleinwort
Benson, the UK investment bank.
US investment in computers surged by 38 per cent last year as the country
pulled out of recession. Spending on computers had also risen in the 1991
recession year. According to Mr Edwards, such a jump in investment at that
phase of the economic cycle is unusual, and could be a sign that the
technological revolution is sweeping smokestack America.
If so, the late 20th century productivity paradox may soon be overcome. But
in so far as it represents the replacement of middle management by machines,
it will open up new social and political problems of which the biggest will
be the redeployment of redundant middle class labour.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (38): Enfeebled
giant burdened by debt - Africa / Only the return of foreign investment, in
partnership with a thriving private sector, will give the economy the boost
it needs

<TEXT>
AFRICA AND its allies are in danger of losing the battle for the recovery of
a continent, now so weakened by years of adversity and mismanagement that it
cannot take full advantage of a stronger world economy.
More than a decade after the World Bank first sounded the alarm about
Sub-Saharan Africa's crisis, and despite some Dollars 170bn in net
development assistance that has followed, the region's problems remain
acute.
Economic reforms that got under way in the 1980s are not measuring up to
expectations, whether due to weak implementation by African governments,
inadequate incentives from western governments and agencies, or flaws in the
structural adjustment policy itself. And on the political front, the
democratisation process that raised hopes in the 1990s is proving divisive
rather than constructive, as ethnicity, rather than policies, determine
voters' allegiances.
Today, Africa is an enfeebled giant, poorer in per capita terms than it was
in 1960, and burdened by an external debt that has soared from Dollars 3bn
to more than Dollars 145bn, and which costs a quarter of export earnings to
service.
Wars in Angola, Sudan, Somalia and elsewhere continue to scar the continent,
foreign investment (outside the oil sector) is negligible, management is
weak, corruption widespread, and Aids is on the increase. 'It is the only
region in the world likely to experience an increase in absolute poverty
over the next decade,' Kim Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for
Africa, told his executive board last February.
Admittedly, Africa will do better in the 1990s than in the 1980s, if the
forecasters are correct. In its World Economic Outlook, published last May,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted real GDP growth at 3.3 per
cent in 1993-94, rising to 4.4 per cent a year between 1995 and 1998.
But the Fund was quick to hedge its bets: 'These projections are subject to
a wider margin of uncertainty than for other regions,' it warned, noting
that 'despite considerable progress in some countries, many obstacles to
stronger growth remain to be tackled, including inadequate infrastructure,
weak administrative capacity . . . and social and political instability.'
Given that Sub-Saharan Africa's four leading economies are all in
difficulties, the caveat is understandable. Nigeria is in the grips of a
political crisis, and its economic reform programme has effectively lapsed;
Kenya is faltering in its promise to root out corruption; the Ivory Coast
cannot implement an effective reform programme as long as the CFA franc
remains overvalued by as much as 30 per cent; and South Africa remains
plagued by political violence, likely to get worse not better as party
rivalries intensify in the run up to next April's general election.
Nevertheless, the IMF forecast may seem encouraging, compared with the
1980s, when growth over the decade averaged less than 2 per cent and per
capita income fell by more than 1 per cent.
The reality, however, is that this rate of growth will only stem, possibly
halt, the rate of Africa's overall decline, for it must be set against a
current population increase of 3.1 per cent annually - which, if sustained,
will double the region's population every 22 years.
Even the most successful example of reform provides a salutary warning of
the long battle ahead if Africa is to make up ground lost during the
disastrous post-independence era. Structural adjustment in Ghana has worked
 -but only up to a modest point. Real incomes per head have grown by an
average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in
the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. But at current
growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population), it would take
20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries.
One important lesson from Ghana is that aid is not enough. Only the return -
on a substantial scale - of foreign investment, in partnership with a
thriving private sector, will give Africa's economy the boost it needs. As
Kim Jaycox points out: 'Even if aid succeeded in generating annual growth
rates of 6 per cent on average, most African countries would still require
25 years to reach acceptable unemployment levels and Dollars 1,000 GDP per
capita. Only the private sector has any chance of achieving higher rates of
growth with greater speed.'
There is little evidence that foreign investors, who saw their rate of
return drop from some 30 per cent in the 1960s to just 2.5 per cent in the
1980s, are about to come back. Net foreign direct investment in Africa has
averaged around Dollars 500m a year over the past few years (mostly into the
oil and mining sectors), less than 1 per cent of the global total according
to the UN's World Investment Report.
Obstacles range from the poor state of the infrastructure in most countries
to the tough competition from other countries in the developing world, such
as Thailand, Indonesia or Vietnam. Above all, Africa has yet to convince the
outside world that it means business.
'Too many African countries have embraced economic reform too hesitantly,'
Sir William Ryrie, outgoing head of the International Finance Corporation
(IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, told a conference in
Nairobi in March this year.
Whether Africa and its allies are prepared to admit that defeat looms in the
battle for recovery remains to be seen. Since the Bank first sounded the
alarm, in its 1981 report, further warnings have come at regular intervals.
Africa 'faces acute economic difficulties', said the Bank's next appraisal,
published in 1984. Five years later the picture remained bleak. The Bank
looked back on 'a decade of falling per capita income' and concluded:
'Overall, Africans are almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years
ago.'
The Bank has been taking stock once again and, in a report due to be
published shortly, is expected to conclude that economic reforms have
stemmed the pace of decline. But at current rates of per capita GDP growth
it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of
the mid 1970s.
Given better implementation of reforms and an improved international
economic environment, and a renewed effort by the international community to
tackle Africa's crisis, prospects could change. But the critical question
remains whether African governments have the political will to adopt painful
economic reforms, or the managerial capacity with which to implement them.
But Africa's allies will also have to take fresh stock of their performance.
No development agency likes to admit failure, for it fears losing its raison
d'etre. No non-government organisation likes to acknowledge defeat, for fear
of funds drying up. No western government wants to add to its problems by
acknowledging that its aid policy is ineffectual. But only a frank appraisal
of the crisis can provide the basis of the fresh initiative the continent
desperately needs.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (39): A tireless
campaigner - Profile, Babacar N'Diaye / The ADB chief has also used his
position to act as diplomat and spokesman for the world's poorest continent,
whose future, he believes, lies with investment rather than charity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FEW EXPERTS can claim to understand Africa's debt problems as well as
Babacar N'Diaye, the Senegalese banker who has headed the African
Development Bank since 1985.
Mr N'Diaye, who joined the ADB as a young graduate straight out of
accountancy school in France, has devoted 28 years to making it one of the
continent's biggest sources of development finance. With a disbursed loan
portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn, the ADB is as important to Africa as the
World Bank or any large Western donor nation.
Under his stewardship, the multilateral bank has acquired a political
cohesion that is sadly absent in other pan-African organisations. This has
given him the confidence to tackle sensitive political issues, such as South
Africa's admission to the ADB. South Africa is expected to become the ADB's
52nd member next year, after holding its first multi-racial elections.
Mr N'Diaye has also used his position to act as diplomat and spokesman for
the poorest continent. He has campaigned tirelessly to find new formulas to
reduce Africa's Dollars 300bn foreign debt. Some admirers even favoured Mr
N'Diaye to succeed Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar as UN secretary- general. In
the event, the job went to a fellow African, Boutrous Boutrous Ghali.
Mr N'Diaye is one of a new generation of Africans who believe that the way
forward for Africa is not to beg, but to persuade investors that the
continent has long-term growth potential. He does not run the bank like a
charity. His main success to date has been to strengthen its lending base by
increasing its borrowing power in the international markets. When he took
over the presidency in 1985, the bank's capital was Dollars 6.3bn; it is now
Dollars 22bn.
But a bank is ultimately only as strong as its customers, and Africa's
worsening economic environment has also created problems for the ADB. At the
last annual meeting in May, Mr N'Diaye devoted a large part of his address
to the issue of arrears, which now total more than Dollars 425m - about 6
per cent of outstanding loans.
Zaire is the worst offender, with unpaid debts of Dollars 140m. Even
borrowers with a good track record, such as Kenya, are now Dollars 15m in
arrears. In spite of a doubling of loan-loss provisions to Dollars 50m,
N'Diaye has begun to turn the screws on delinquent borrowers.
'The insidious accumulation of arrears is disastrous for the institution in
the long run,' he told the annual meeting in Abidjan. He said the bank would
begin to apply tighter lending controls. However, African states are already
finding it difficult to meet the ADB's long list of loan conditions. Only 17
countries borrowed from the ADB in 1992, and Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria
accounted for half of the total loan approvals of Dollars 1.75bn.
There is a growing demand for concessionary grants from the ADB's African
Development Fund, but a concomitant reluctance by western countries to
increase subscriptions to the ADF. Mr N'Diaye, therefore, favours altering
the balance between the ADB's non-concessionary and concessionary financing.
Under his plan, ADF lending would double to Dollars 2bn a year, while the
ADB's operations contracted to Dollars 1bn.
Cost-cutting western governments, however, have dismissed as unrealistic his
call for a 62 per cent increase in the replenishment of ADF funds, which is
due early next year. Mr N'Diaye remains undaunted. He has embarked on yet
another of his international lobbying marathons for the needed funds.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (36): The floodgates
have opened - Latin America / International capital is pouring in after 10
static years, writes Stephen Fidler. Digesting it, rather than attracting
it, is now the main problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICA has made an unexpectedly rapid return to favour in the
international market for capital after a decade of recession brought on by
economic mismanagement and a resultant excessive build-up of debt.
Following 10 years in which access to foreign capital was severely
restricted, many countries are now suffering from the opposite problem: a
surfeit of capital inflows. These inflows have often artificially elevated
exchange rates, thereby helping to suck in imports and hurt exports, and
swollen the money supply, making more difficult the task of curbing
inflation.
In the first six months of this year, borrowers in Latin America raised
Dollars 10.7bn in foreign bond issues alone, more than in the whole of 1992.
Other capital entered the region in the form of equity investment  - into
stock markets, into privatisations and increasingly new share issues and
some into direct investment in new production capacity - and in bank
deposits, this to take advantage of monetary policies which have been
keeping real interest rates high.
A complex combination of factors internal and external to the region has
been behind this change of heart by international capital. Externally, low
interest rates on bank deposits in the US have encouraged an outflow of
funds to Latin America to take advantage of high interest rates.
The flow of funds into banks in most Latin American countries, regardless of
economic performance, has led to suggestions that the phenomenon of capital
reflows to Latin America has had little to do with the region's economic
reform programmes. Instead, a former Latin American government minister has
suggested that interest rate differentials have been high enough to
encourage funds to flow to Mars.
It has also been argued that the weak performance of other traditional asset
markets in the industrialised world has led investors of all types to seek
higher returns in new markets.
This raised the question of the sustainability of these capital flows when
conditions in markets outside Latin America improve.
Fears that the flows would cease have been partly answered by the
continuation of capital flows into the region even as stock and bond
markets, particularly in the US, have been performing strongly. Indeed some
investment specialists argue that the trend towards increased investment
into all so-called emerging markets is, if not a permanent phenomenon, part
of a long-run cycle which will take years to go into reverse.
Mr Michael Howell of Baring Securities in London points out in a study of
cross-border capital flows that: 'Capital left the old world in roughly five
waves from the mid-1840s: 1845-54, 1863-72, 1881-90, 1903-14 and 1919-24.'
Capital flows in 1992 could have more in common with what happened 100 years
ago than in 1982, he suggests.
Supporting this contention, there is growing evidence that traditionally
conservative institutional investors in the US and in Europe are entering
the market for Latin American assets in increasing force.
Inside the region, it is now clear that the debt crisis of 1982 set off more
than almost a decade of recession. It also began a process of economic
reform which has led governments first to improve macroeconomic management,
for example by bringing budget deficits more into check, and second to open
up the economy more to the forces of the market.
In many countries, this has taken the government out of many areas of
economic endeavour. The changes have also brought down tariff barriers and
abolished import quotas, paving the way for the development of regional free
trade arrangements. These trade arrangements, led by the North American Free
Trade Agreement which groups the US, Canada and Mexico, offer the prospect
over time of transforming economic relations among countries in the
Americas.
This has meant that Latin Americans themselves have been an important, if
not the main, source of external capital as they have repatriated money
placed abroad in preceding decades to protect it from arbitrary government
and economic mismanagement.
All this has produced a resumption of economic growth in most countries of
the region. That growth remains positive for most countries, according to a
majority of economic forecasts this year, even though it appears to be
slowing down in a number of important economies.
Still, a July survey of economists forecasts by the British group Consensus
Economics suggests growth for the region this year of 3.4 per cent (3.3 per
cent without Brazil) and 3.0 per cent next year (3.4 per cent without
Brazil). This compares with forecasts of 2.6 and 3.2 per cent for North
America and -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent for Europe.
But if Latin America has turned the corner, it is still in the woods. The
1980s saw a significant drop in real incomes and a deepening of the problems
of poverty so that as many as 180m of the continent's 460m population may
now be in poverty. The 1980s also saw a further collapse in the ability of
government adequately to perform even its slimmed-down role.
In many countries, military rule had already eroded the pillars of
government during the 1970s; governments' ability adequately to fund
educational, health and social programmes deteriorated further in the 1980s
economic crisis. Public investment, especially in education, is widely seen
as necessary to provide skilled labour for the needs of the investors of the
1990s. Only with education, it is argued, can poverty be reduced and
economic growth be converted into development.
Looking ahead, the central question is therefore whether the economic reform
will yield sufficient benefits quickly enough to a broad enough group of
people for them to reject populist economic solutions in countries which, in
contrast to a decade ago, are primarily ruled by elected governments.
The answer to this will in part hang on how much of the renewed capital
flows will be channeled into productive investment and how much will go into
consumer spending which will produce an initial spurt of growth but provide
no long-term prospects for its continuation. Unfortunately, government
statistics in much of the region are not reliable enough to draw firm
conclusions about what these capital flows are financing.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (37): A crop of
failures triggers fears of deepening crisis - African commodities / Natural
and man-made disasters, weak management, and wrong policies have taken a
heavy toll of the heart of Africa's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TARGET has never been reached before in sub-Saharan Africa, yet the
region's hopes for economic recovery depend on achieving it.
If the agricultural sector does not sustain annual growth averaging at least
4 per cent a year, needed to outpace population increase and to make up lost
ground, the region's crisis will deepen. Failure would mean stagnating
export earnings, a widening food deficit, and further inroads by Asian
countries into Africa's falling share of world commodity markets.
Given the right policies, properly implemented, it can be done, say
planners, who take encouragement from China's achievement of 6 per cent
agricultural expansion in the 1980s.
But they acknowledge that given the record of the past 25 years, and the
obstacles ahead, it will be a target hard to meet.
Natural and man-made disasters, weak management, and wrong policies have
taken a heavy toll of what is the heart of Africa's economy, accounting as
it does for about a third of the region's GDP and around 80 per cent of
export earnings.
The average rate of agricultural growth has stayed between 1.7 and 1.9 per
cent since 1965, well behind population expanding at about 2.7 per cent
between 1965 and 1980, rising since then to just over 3 per cent.
Per capita food output has declined, food imports have increased at nearly 4
per cent a year since 1974, and food aid has risen 7 per cent annually.
Meanwhile, Africa's share in developing country exports of food and
agricultural products has halved between 1970 and 1990 - from 17 per cent to
8 per cent.
Nor has the region's export base diversified. Most African economies still
rely on one or two primary commodities, which altogether account for about
80 per cent of Africa's export revenues - roughly the same as 20 years ago.
The fall in the share of the world market has cost Africa dear. Earlier Bank
analysis has shown that if Sub-Saharan countries had maintained their 1970
market share of non-oil primary exports from developing countries and prices
had remained the same, their export earnings would have been Dollars
9bn-Dollars 10bn a year higher in 1986-87, equal to the region's total debt
service payments in this period.
Africa's leaders place at least part of the blame for their countries' poor
performance on external factors, but as the 1990 UN report, Africa's
Commodity Problems, commented, 'other developing countries in other regions
have had to face similar market problems and they have progressed while
Africa has fallen behind'.
Recovering the market share will be difficult. Africa's competitors have
invested export proceeds more productively, and now maintain economic
reforms and hone their competitive edge more effectively than Africa.
Two startling examples can be found in south-east Asia, as World Bank
researchers point out. In 1965 Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than
Nigeria's.
In both countries oil has been the dominant export. 'Who could have
predicted then that Indonesia's GDP in 1990 would be three times that of
Nigeria. Or that Thailand (an agriculture-based economy whose GDP per capita
in 1965 was lower than Ghana's) would be one of the best-performing
countries in the world, while Ghana struggles to regain its position as a
middle income developing country?' comments the Bank in a draft report.
Nevertheless, reforms ranging from realistic exchange rates to improved
producer prices are bringing results in Africa, says Mr Kevin Cleaver*. Ten
countries 'already have met the (4 per cent) target or have come close to it
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, although with considerable annual
fluctuations' citing Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya. Given that the list also
includes Botswana, Comoros and Chad, it may be too soon to draw profound
conclusions.
The most striking success story cited is also a salutary tale. Nairobi's
city market is an African cornucopia, stalls piled high with mangoes and
passion fruit, avocados and french beans, carnations, roses, chrysanthemums
and orchids, bound for the tables of Europe and elsewhere. From modest
beginnings in the 1970s, Kenya's horticultural business boomed in the 1980s,
and now brings in more than Dollars 100m a year in much needed foreign
exchange.
But only about 7 per cent of this trade is accounted for by Kenya's African
companies: 'Kenya's Africans have had difficulty maintaining viable
enterprises due to low capitalisation, management weaknesses, and lack of
links to foreign investors. . . Where African companies have worked, family
members living in Europe have been important in managing imports,' continues
the study.
'Long-term trading relationships between exporters and importers are
therefore critical', it concludes, in the provision of foreign know-how,
market knowledge and investment.
As Mr Cleaver points out, private sector investment in African agriculture
and agro-industry is essential, but this in turn depends on successful
implementation of macro-economic reforms.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (34): Rapidly
growing richer - Vietnam / Victor Mallet examines hopes of another economic
miracle in the making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM is still one of the poorest countries in the world, but it is
rapidly becoming richer. In the imagination of investors, if not yet in
reality, this country with an annual gross national product of only about
Dollars 200 per person is poised to join the ranks of south-east Asia's
miracle economies.
Since 1986, the communist government has pursued an economic reform policy
known as doi moi, or renovation. The reforms have been accelerated by the
collapse of Vietnam's erstwhile ally the Soviet Union and by a surge of
foreign investment from Asian and European companies.
The results are spectacular. Price liberalisation and land reform allowing
farmers effective ownership of their fields have boosted agricultural output
and made Vietnam the world's third largest rice exporter, after the US and
Thailand.
The capital Hanoi, once an elegant but glum northern city of crumbling
French villas and wide boulevards, becomes busier and noisier by the month;
Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), already Vietnam's principal commercial
and industrial centre, is booming.
Last year real economic growth in Vietnam exceeded eight per cent, and in
1993 the figure is likely to be around 7.5 per cent. Industrial production
and exports continued to rise in the first half of this year. The dong, the
Vietnamese currency, has meanwhile remained stable against the dollar and
inflation has fallen.
Until recently the main obstacle to further economic progress was - in the
eyes of the Vietnamese government and foreign donors - the US refusal to
countenance assistance to Vietnam from the international financial
institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the
Asian Development Bank.
Vietnam's transport and communications infrastructure is in desperate need
of repair and expansion. For market-oriented industrialisation to succeed,
the country and its foreign backers will have to spend billions of dollars
on everything from ports and airports to telephones and power stations.
The Clinton administration finally yielded to pressure from other IMF
lenders and withdrew its objections to multilateral aid for Vietnam in July.
This should allow the 'Friends of Vietnam', led by Japan and France, to pay
off Vietnam's IMF arrears of some Dollars 140m through a combination of
bridging finance and bilateral aid.
A recent meeting of the support group in Paris was unable to agree on how
much of the arrears should be met by the bridging loan (which would be
quickly repaid by funds from the first, short-term IMF programme for
Vietnam) and how much by the donors, but the participants are due to meet
again at the time of this month's IMF/World Bank conference.
Multilateral and bilateral donors are then expected to meet in Paris on
November 9 and 10 for a pledging session for Vietnam - the country's first -
which could raise Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.5bn.
Vietnam's difficult transition from a communist command economy to free
enterprise is greatly assisted by its existing oil industry (which accounts
for two thirds of exports). At the same time the country's promise as a
future Asian economic 'tiger' is enhanced by the well-deserved reputation of
its people as hard-working and literate.
It was perhaps, inevitable that a reaction would set in among investors as
they began to realise that Vietnam had a long way to go before its reached
the level of say, Thailand or Malaysia.
'It's a little too easy to get too excited about Vietnam's prospects,' says
Mr Bradley Babson, the Bangkok-based regional World Bank chief. 'It's not
going to be a piece of cake and I think we should be quite up front about
that.'
Wages are attractively low for businesses but Vietnam does not have the
capacity - in terms of officials, local entrepreneurs or physical
infrastructure - to absorb immediately all of the capital that foreigners
want to invest.
The US economic embargo which remains in place - President Clinton eased it
on September 13 to allow US companies to compete for projects funded by the
World Bank and the ADB - is of more concern to frustrated US companies than
to the Vietnamese, who are struggling to absorb investment capital from
other sources as far apart as Taiwan and France.
Vietnam has licensed more than Dollars 6bn worth of foreign investment
projects so far, but only a quarter of this amount has actually been
committed by the investors.
Privatisation is moving much more slowly than expected, and Vietnam is
encountering problems with its state industries which are typical of the
former Soviet block.
According to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the number of state
enterprises has been reduced by mergers and liquidations in the last 18
months to 7,000 from 12,000, but economists say only a quarter to a third of
state enterprises are profitable. Many of the rest are so run-down that
no-one wants to buy them. Unemployment is one of the government's biggest
concerns.
Private Vietnamese companies have emerged since the government relaxed its
grip on the economy, but most of them are tiny businesses involved in the
retail trade and other services rather than manufacturing.
Large projects, whether they are wholly Vietnamese or joint ventures with
foreign partners, still tend to be the preserve of state or semi-state
organisations; the army, for example, owns one of the best-known hotels in
Hanoi, and the city's new fleet of metered taxis comes under the control of
the city's communist people's committee.
Corruption, as the government has acknowledged, is becoming increasingly
widespread as wealth increases.
Foreign donors and reformist Vietnamese officials say two of the most urgent
priorities to ensure continued economic growth are the establishment of
commercial laws - to cover bankruptcy procedures and contractual
obligations, for example - and the deve-lopment of a strong financial
sector.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (35): Fingers
crossed for soft landing - China / Alexander Nicoll sees positive signs in
the country's reform programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 15 years since Mr Deng Xiaoping launched China's economic reforms,
the country has repeatedly lurched from boom to bust and back again. Each
burst of reform has let loose economic forces which have run riot because it
is impossible simply to replace one system of control with another.
The old central planning machinery cannot cope with the market forces
unleashed by reform, but new methods of macroeconomic control suited to a
market economy are still missing. Periodic bouts of austerity - and
political setbacks for reformers - have been the inevitable result.
This time, however, many fingers are crossed that it will be different. The
government has since the middle of the year been seeking to restrain growth
after another extraordinary boom caused evident over-heating, with inflation
and the trade deficit rising, the currency declining on unofficial markets
and spending on new fixed assets running out of control.
Officials who strongly back reform, instead of being forced to take
responsibility for faster inflation and shortages of goods as in the past,
have managed to remain in charge of the economy's slowdown.
So far - it is still too early to make a reliable judgment - the signs are
positive. Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier in charge of the economy, may be
able to achieve a soft landing while at the same time advancing the cause of
reform. He has curbed activities which were causing speculative and
inflationary bubbles - property, construction, stock markets - by exerting
much tighter control over finance. Rather than stopping reforms he has taken
the opportunity to begin significant changes to the financial system.
Success in this very difficult task would be a step forward of inestimable
value for China. It would narrow the wild fluctuations in economic growth
which cause disruption and hardship for many Chinese. It would also lay the
foundation for the country to become an economic superpower.
China's progress so far is becoming a familiar story. It averaged 9 per cent
annual growth in the 1980s even after two bouts of austerity. Reform resumed
quietly soon after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, and was given a
shove forward by Mr Deng's visit in early 1992 to southern China, which has
seen the fastest growth. Economic growth last year was 12.8 per cent and is
likely to be around the same this year.
Last year alone, China contracted for foreign investment worth Dollars 58bn
and actually used Dollars 11bn, according to official figures. Even allowing
for exaggeration in official figures, this represents a substantial inflow
which has come largely from ethnic Chinese businesses outside the mainland -
though many western companies are also keenly interested.
Investment from Hong Kong and Taiwan has led to the term greater China being
applied to the tri-partite area, though the three territories remain
politically and economically separate.
Hong Kong and Taiwan companies have been seeking to transfer manufacturing
capacity on to the mainland to take advantage of cheap labour. China is keen
to welcome the investment both for commercial reasons, and with its aim for
political re-unification in mind. Hong Kong, which reverts from British to
Chinese sovereignty in 1997 though it will retain economic autonomy, is
increasingly linked to the mainland by two-way investment and trade.
Foreign companies are attracted to China by its huge potential both as a
low-cost producer and as a market for goods. Increasingly, they have
confidence that the opening of the economy will be durable and will go
further.
China's industrial growth is being generated mainly by the non-state sector,
chiefly involved in lighter industries. It has been assisted by relaxation
of most price controls, greater mobility and availability of labour, freedom
to deal directly with foreigners and in foreign currencies, and a host of
other reforms.
However, this is taking place when a great deal of the economy is still
subject to old constraints. State-owned enterprises still depend largely on
central control and financing by state-owned banks. The budget deficit is
large and rising because of public sector spending and the need for sweeping
tax reform. The financial system is struggling to learn disciplines which
were unnecessary when it existed simply to bankroll the state system.
One of the chief challenges facing the Chinese government is to introduce
new means for macroeconomic control without backtracking on reform. This is
what Mr Zhu is attempting. Backed by advice from the World Bank, he
identified the central bank as the best place to start and took over as its
governor in July with the aim of beginning a complete overhaul of the
banking system. He has raised interest rates and demanded that banks call in
speculative real estate loans.
Mr Zhu has acted to close down thousands of areas designated by local
authorities as development zones. These were sucking in huge amounts of
fixed asset investment - contributing to heavy demand for goods such as
steel - as well as weakening the state's financing by avoiding taxation, and
enriching local officials. Fixed asset investment increased 70 per cent in
the first seven months of 1993, compared with the same period of 1992, and
Mr Zhu has announced that it should be restricted to important
infrastructural projects.
Even assuming that the measures to cool the excesses of the boom are
successful, much remains to be done. The government has begun the social
reforms needed to separate state-owned enterprises from their obligation to
provide an iron rice bowl to employees and their families. The enterprises
need to learn management and marketing skills, and the haemorrhage of their
finances has to be stopped.
Though China's reformers do not have to answer to an electorate, their whole
agenda is fraught with political uncertainty. A power struggle will loom
when the frail, 89-year-old Mr Deng departs the scene. Mr Zhu is a forceful
man with an evident grasp of the economic requirements, but his own
political position could come into question, particularly if Mr Deng were to
die soon.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (32): Success brings
problems - South-East Asia / Victor Mallet doubts whether the world's
healthiest economic region, performing robustly this year, can still take
exports for granted as the engine of its progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LAMBASTED FOR the failure of their lending programmes in Africa, World Bank
and IMF officials have an understandable habit of pointing to their present
and former proteges in Asia and saying: in the right conditions, the recipe
works.
South-east Asia, already a byword for export-led economic growth, is
performing robustly this year, in spite of the sluggish state of the
region's main export markets in Europe, Japan and the US.
Exports continue to increase, and debt service ratios are falling. The Asian
Development Bank estimates south-east Asian debt service, as a proportion of
exports, will decline to 11 per cent in 1994 from 13.3 per cent this year
and 15 per cent in 1992. At the start of the decade the figure was 18.5 per
cent.
Growth is strong, too. Excluding China and Japan, average real gross
domestic product (GDP) growth across Asia is expected to rise from 5.2 per
cent in 1992 to 6 per cent this year and 6.8 per cent in 1994, according to
a forecast from Merrill Lynch. The Philippines, suffering from chronic
electricity shortages, is a dismal exception to the generally rosy picture,
and is expected to grow by only about 2 per cent in 1993.
Part of the resilience of these economies in the present global economic
climate can be explained by the increase of trade within Asia, especially
with China.
South-east Asian countries have also become important markets in their own
right, and the growth of some economies owes more to the state of the
domestic market than to the performance of exports.
Thailand, for example, is now a bigger market for new cars than Australia.
'In the second half of the 1980s, a third of growth was due to exports,'
says Mr Narongchai Akrasanee, who heads Thailand's General Finance group.
'Now it's one tenth.'
Having long ago embraced the basic tenets of capitalism and actively
encouraged inward foreign investment, south-east Asian economies are
becoming increasingly sophisticated. As they do so, the World Bank becomes
more important as an adviser than as a lender. Local capital markets have
grown rapidly and become more complex, and Thailand and Malaysia have
recently established commissions to regulate the securities industry.
Outward investment - with China and IndoChina as the main targets - has also
become a regional phenomenon; the Singapore government, for instance,
encourages its emerging multinationals to invest overseas as a way of
diversifying the country's sources of income. Thailand's Charoen Pokphand
group is one of the largest foreign investors in China and has stakes there
in everything from motorcycle factories to feedmills.
South-east Asia's dazzling GDP growth rates, however, are accompanied by
several serious problems and challenges which have yet to be addressed in
most of the countries concerned. Some of these worries are simply the result
of competition for investment and trade from countries a few rungs lower on
the economic ladder. Officials in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are
concerned about falling foreign investment, which they blame on competing
demands for funds from China and Vietnam.
Apart from its enormous and attractive domestic market, China offers a
plentiful supply of cheap if relatively unskilled workers. In Malaysia,
labourers and skilled workers are in short supply and wages are rising fast;
in Thailand, too, wages are rising more quickly than productivity.
Ceaseless export growth can therefore no longer be taken for granted as the
engine of economic progress in south-east Asia.
The value of Thai exports in the first half of this year rose only 10.6 per
cent over the same period in 1992, well below official predictions. A fall
in agricultural exports such as rice and tapioca is partly to blame -
electronics exports are still rising - but economists are now making more
modest predictions for future Thai export growth.
As Asian exports of various products increase year by year from the
insignificant to the substantial, they typically encounter greater
resistance and protectionism from the governments, industries and trade
unions of importing countries, and thus become the victims of their own
success - a success often based, it must be said, on the exploitation of
cheap and under-age labour, unsafe factories and a willingness to violate
intellectual property rights.
Success creates other problems, too. Asian countries are carrying out an
industrial revolution - which took decades in Europe and America - in a
matter of years.
From Manila and Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, infrastructure is
creaking under the strain. Power shortages have become widespread. It can be
difficult to have a telephone installed and then difficult to make calls.
Traffic jams are the bane of the region's capitals. Economic success has
brought pollution and other environmental damage.
The economic effects of infrastructure bottlenecks are hard to gauge. On the
one hand, industrial investors are deterred by clogged transport and
communications networks. On the other, such problems are common throughout
the region; and the need for everything, from roads and sewage farms to
better universities, creates business opportunities and further accelerates
economic activity when construction begins.
Throughout south-east Asia - with the exception of Singapore - governments
are also accused of failing to invest in the secondary and tertiary
education that will be vital for the region's economies in the years ahead.
Nor has the new-found wealth been evenly spread. Asia's nouveaux riches pay
little tax, and the rich have usually been getting richer much faster than
the poor - a tendency forgotten in times of generalised prosperity, but one
which may cause political instability in a recession.
South-east Asia's industrialisation has depended on a marriage between cheap
local labour and the money and technology of Japan and the West. As wages
rise and investors turn to China, the Thais, Malaysians, Indonesians and
Filipinos are beginning to ask themselves what they have to offer that
cannot be found elsewhere.
They have land and they have growing domestic markets, but pollution and
congestion in big cities are making life grimmer for Asia's burgeoning
middle class. Above all, schools and colleges are not teaching the skills
that business and industry say they need. Such problems will have to be
solved if the spectacular economic growth of the last decade is to be
sustained into the next millennium.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (33): Cleaning up,
slowing down - Korea / The vigorous anti-corruption campaign being pursued
by the new president is likely to delay a full-scale recovery until next
year
</HEADLINE>

THE ONCE-BOOMING South Korean economy is suffering its slowest period of
growth since 1980. The GNP growth rate in 1993 is expected to fall below 5
per cent for a second consecutive year, making Korea one of the worst
performers on the Asian mainland.
Last year's sluggish economic growth rate of 4.8 per cent resulted from a
tight monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation. But economists believe
that Korea is on the road to recovery, having hit bottom in the last quarter
of 1992 with a dismal growth rate of 2.8 per cent.
The government since then has eased monetary controls. Growth has been
gradually accelerating, with rates of 3.4 per cent and 4.2 per cent in the
first and second quarters respectively.
However, the vigorous anti-corruption campaign being pursued by the new
president, Mr Kim Young-sam, is likely to delay a full-scale recovery until
next year, when the growth rate is expected to exceed 6 per cent. In
particular, the president's sudden decision in mid-August to ban the tax
dodge of using false names for financial transactions has had an adverse
impact on growth.
The prohibition on false names strikes at the heart of the country's large
underground economy, whose size is estimated to be 20 per cent of GNP.
Although the underground economy deprived the government of needed tax
revenues, it also played a constructive economic role by providing scarce
capital for small businesses and supporting consumer spending.
President Kim's programme to root out the underground economy will
consequently cause economic disruption in the short-term by reducing
domestic demand, which is already weak.
Industrial investments have shrunk by 7.2 per cent during the past year
after a long period of facility expansion since the mid-1980s that resulted
in excess production capacity.
The Kim government earlier this year tried to revive industrial investments
by cutting interest rates, but to little avail. Sagging domestic consumer
demand has convinced most companies that sizeable plant investments are not
necessary immediately. Moreover, interest rates are climbing again, with the
three-year bond rate reaching 14 per cent.
Holders of false-name bank accounts largely financed the informal kerb
market that is a main source of credit for small businesses, which have
difficulty acquiring bank loans due to a lack of collateral. But the
crackdown on false-name accounts has caused a drain of liquidity from the
kerb market, resulting in a rising number of bankruptcies among small
concerns.
Big companies have also had difficulties in raising capital recently as the
false-name ban has dampened activity on the bond market.
Consumer spending is unlikely to be much help in boosting growth this year.
Consumer confidence is weak as the unemployment rate rises to almost 3 per
cent, a high figure for Korea. Although the government has succeeded in
curbing wage growth in 1993 to around 11 per cent against an average annual
rate of 16.4 per cent during the past six years, it also means that consumer
purchasing power has shrunk.
In addition, the government has been promoting an austerity campaign since
1991 in an attempt to persuade the public to work harder and spend less. The
campaign has affected foreign goods in particular since the government
regards them as being luxuries.
The economic slowdown has had one beneficial effect in that it has curbed
the inflation rate to around 5 per cent from a decade-long peak of 9.3 per
cent in 1991. Price stability has been supported by weak consumer demand,
lower wages and stagnant property prices. But even this achievement is under
threat. The government is increasing the money supply to provide small
companies with more capital and save them from possible bankruptcy.
The one bright spot in Korea's economic picture is an export boom that has
been caused by an almost 20 per cent fall of the Korean won against the
Japanese yen since the beginning of the year. This has restored price
competitiveness to Korean products, which have lost market share abroad in
recent years as wages climbed to the highest level on the Asian mainland
while productivity lagged behind.
Korea has seen recent gains against Japanese competitors in the areas of
cars, semiconductors, consumer electronics, shipbuilding, and iron and
steel. The trade surplus is likely to post a slight surplus this year after
four years of deficits.
But the country is still in danger of falling behind foreign competitors,
such as Japan and Taiwan, in the global export market, because it has done
little to secure cheaper production bases abroad or building international
marketing networks. Korea's total direct foreign investment of Dollars 4.9bn
represents only 1.6 per cent of GNP, while Taiwan has invested more than 3.5
per cent of its GNP overseas.
One reason for Korea's slow investment expansion abroad is that it has
suffered current account deficits during most of the past two decades, which
has depreciated the value of the Korean won and made it more expensive to
invest overseas. Moreover, the government has encouraged companies to invest
at home rather than abroad in order to boost economic growth.

tops agenda - India / After 40 years of avowed economic self-reliance, India
is opening up to the outside world

IN TWO SHORT years, the Indian economy has been dragged from the verge of
international bankruptcy and put firmly on the road towards sustainable
growth.
But the further the country has moved from the economic crisis it faced in
mid-1991, the more it has lost speed in its economic restructuring
programme.
For a combination of political, economic and social reasons, the government
of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, has allowed the momentum to
slow. Ministers have made many reforms designed to free the economy, notably
liberalising trade rules, reducing the public deficit and introducing a
market-based exchange rate. They also plan to do more - including reforming
the debt-encumbered banks. But they have shied away from
politically-difficult decisions - such as closing loss-making state-owned
enterprises and abolishing jobs-for-life labour laws.
In part, the reformers have fallen victim to their own success. From a low
point of 1.2 per cent in the year to March 1992, economic growth has
recovered remarkably fast to 4 per cent in 1992-93, and a forecast 5 per
cent in the current year. Inflation has fallen from an annual peak of 13.6
per cent to about 6 per cent. Foreign currency reserves have jumped from a
nadir of just over USDollars 1bn in mid-1991 to USDollars 7.3bn. Exports are
soaring - by 27 per cent in the four months to July, according to the latest
figures. In these circumstances, it has been difficult for Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister, to persuade his colleagues in the ruling
Congress (I) party of the urgency of the need for further economic reform.
Ministers have also had other things on their minds. Last year's Rs40bn
scandal in the Bombay securities market has been an immense distraction and
will continue to occupy time until a Parliamentary inquiry into the affair
is finally completed, possibly early next year.
The destruction of the Ayodhya mosque by Hindu militants last December, and
the inter-religious unrest which followed has shaken the government to the
core. Mr Narasimha Rao's top priority has been to contain the political
damage. He cannot risk alienating the public with painful economic
restructuring when the Bharatiya Janata Party, the radical Hindu opposition
party, seems to be gathering support through its appeal for greater
self-assertiveness for Hindus. The immediate challenge comes later this year
when elections are due in the four northern states where BJP-controlled
assemblies were suspended last year.
In theory, economic reform should have immense political appeal. Only about
25-30m workers and their families - perhaps 150m people altogether - have
benefited fully from the socialist-inspired economy built after
independence. These are the people who are protected by law from being
sacked and who enjoy reasonable standards of living, healthcare and
education for their children. The remaining 700m-plus of India's population
of 880m largely live beyond the reach of the organised economy and of the
organised welfare network. These poor could be the long-run beneficiaries of
the increased economic opportunities created by liberalisation.
However, even though India is a democracy, poverty and ignorance prevents
the poor from exercising much broad-based political pressure. They have been
too easily divided by religion, caste and language. By contrast, organised
workers, acting through trade unions and employers' organisations have been
able to apply pressure - notably through strikes in support of demands that
liberalisation should not put their jobs at risk.
Nevertheless, even trade union pressure cannot put the clock back. After 40
years of avowed economic self-reliance, India is opening up to the outside
world by cutting import duties, reforming the exchange rate and promoting
exports and inward foreign investment. The licence raj, a panoply of
industrial controls, has mostly been dismantled. Despite the securities
scandal, financial deregulation has gone ahead, including the liberalising
of foreign institutional investment.
Businessmen are planning new projects at an unprecedented rate. Foreign
companies are reviving links with old affiliates and partners, and
establishing new contacts. Big groups are restructuring operations to cope
with the challenge of foreign competition and of raising exports.
So far, this surge in activity has not resulted in any concomitant leap in
investment. Industrial production in the year to March grew by a mere 3.8
per cent. Only a modest 5-6 per cent is forecast for 1993-94. Foreign
investors have won approvals for projects worth USDollars 3bn, but there is
no rush to actually invest the money.
Certainly, large schemes are not completed overnight, or even in a year or
two. However, at least part of the delay is due to the fact that companies
are not yet convinced of the government's commitment to further reform.
The main obstacle for many companies is the grip that the bureaucracy
continues to maintain on the economy. While instructions have gone out from
the Cabinet for the abolition of swathes of controls, the officials carrying
out the orders are dragging their feet. Also, the very process of reform
itself creates new opportunities for bureaucratic intervention. For example,
the opening up of investment in power to private companies has generated
mountains of documents dealing with the terms under which such companies
might operate.
Investors are also concerned about the future of public-sector enterprises
which account for about two-thirds of workers in large-scale employment and
an even higher share of the nation's industrial capital. The government's
policy has been to starve loss-making units of funds to force them either to
seek private capital (which very few are strong enough to attract) or cut
costs. But the government is unwilling to permit large-scale job reductions.
Indian law greatly restricts employers' rights to dismiss workers. Ministers
late last year came close to reforming labour legislation - but retreated
just before the Ayodhya outrage. Without reform, the public sector will
drain resources from the rest of the economy. It will also hold back private
companies because of the inefficiency of many of its services - such as
telecommunications and banking.
Finally, India's growth potential will be limited without further investment
in infrastructure and in social services such as education. The government
has made infrastructure investment a priority but it lacks the money to
fulfil its aims because of the general squeeze on public spending. The
position in power is particularly acute - capacity rose just one per cent
last year. The government would like private companies to help close the
yawning gaps in India's infrastructure. But the provision of public services
is precisely the area which the bureaucrats and public sector trade unions
hold most dear.
Spending limits on education and other social services are equally tight.
India has long spent less on primary schools than many other developing
countries, including China, and is only now beginning to redirect its
resources. The result is that India's literacy rate is still only 48 per
cent against China's 73 per cent. Without better education, the poor cannot
get jobs nor learn about basic health care, including birth control.
India has done enough in the last two years to encourage fast growth in
important cities such as Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore and Madras. But without
further reforms - and infrastructure investment - it is difficult to see how
fast growth can be sustained even in these centres let alone spread into
less prosperous regions.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (31): Economist who
turned the tide - Profile, Manmohan Singh / India's finance minister has
skilfully maintained the momentum of the most radical programme of reform in
the country's independent history
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TO REVITALISE and open up an economy such as India's is a massive task.
First, there is its sheer size. Then, there is the scale of inefficiency and
corruption resulting from more than 40 years of Nehruvian policies of
socialist self-sufficiency. Finally, there is the pressure arising from
deep-rooted social problems and fever-pitch politics.
Since June 1991, this has been the lot of Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance
minister. A quietly-spoken civil servant who had held top economic posts, he
was the only non-politician appointed to Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao's 58-member
cabinet. India faced a financial crisis, and as an internationally respected
technocrat, Mr Singh was the man to deal with it.
His manner of dealing with the crisis, however, was to initiate the most
radical programme of economic reform seen in India's independent history. It
is still proceeding, and he is still in charge of it. Commentators inside
and outside India have been ready throughout Mr Singh's tenure to write the
obituary of yet another half-hearted attempt to clean up the economy. But
they remain frustrated.
Born in 1932 at Gah in the Punjab - now in Pakistan - Mr Singh won the Adam
Smith prize at Cambridge in his early twenties. In 1972 he was appointed
economic adviser in the finance ministry and in 1982 became the governor of
the Reserve Bank of India.
His career took an international turn in 1987 when he became
secretary-general of the South Commission. By 1991, when Mr Rao selected him
to deal with the balance of payments crisis, he had retired to the calm of
the University Grants Commission.
Mr Singh's career had put him, therefore, in a key executive role enacting
government policies of which he must have been at least dubious. According
to Professor Jagdish Bhagwati, of Columbia University, Mr Singh had long
favoured export promotion as the best means of producing economic growth and
efficiency.
However, successive governments pursued policies of import substitution,
characterised by high tariff barriers, protection for Indian industries, and
a large state presence in the economy - overseen by all-powerful ministers
and bureaucrats.
The potential for inefficiency and corruption in such a system was amply
realised. Although it had been devised to protect the poor, they had
suffered while the privileged professionals and protected tycoons prospered.
Mr Singh, a man of unquestioned integrity, had seen this process at close
quarters. At the same time, he had admired the success of countries such as
South Korea which had depended upon export growth. When the task fell to
him, he was evidently all the more determined to turn the tide.
The wind has been behind him. Three factors have been in his favour. When he
took over, India was bankrupt, with foreign exchange reserves exhausted and
Indian state-owned banks having trouble meeting their commitments in the
international money markets. If a Mexico-style debt crunch was to be
avoided, drastic and immediate measures were needed. Both Mr Rao and Mr
Singh clearly decided India could not afford a debt default.
Mr Singh has also enjoyed the support of Mr Rao throughout. Although the
tenure of Mr Rao, an experienced party hand appointed to lead the Congress
party after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, has sometimes appeared shaky,
he has managed to hold on.
Finally, there has been little significant opposition - in spite of
nationalist noises made by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party - to the
principle of opening up the economy and reversing a malaise which had been
generally recognised by the Indian elite.
Mr Singh's achievements are considerable. He has abolished the 'license raj'
under which virtually every corporate decision needed bureaucratic sanction.
He has removed most barriers to foreign investment. He has lowered tariffs
and floated the rupee. Much more is under way, including urgently needed
reforms of the financial sector and of the tax system.
The economic effects of these changes have been slow to come through. Growth
has accelerated, although not spectacularly, inflation has come down and the
rupee has been remarkably stable since it was freed. But industrial
production and exports have been slow to pick up. Foreign investors have
been cautious, although signs are emerging of steadily growing interest.
Moreover, Mr Singh has been slow to tackle some areas of reform because of
entrenched political opposition - principally labour reform and
privatisation, both of which would shake up the bloated public sector as
well as introducing keener competition in the private sector.
Mr Singh's skill, however, has been in never underestimating his task. He
has correctly judged the political forces against him, carefully sought to
build a consensus for needed reforms, and enacted them as he could.
Although this has meant that progress has sometimes been slow, the
government has not lost the momentum of reform. This is partly because in
some areas, such as the convertibility of the rupee, Mr Singh has been
prepared to force the pace.
Perhaps most surprisingly, Mr Singh has shown himself an adroit politician.
His third budget, unveiled in February after a period of brutal social and
political strife, won praise as a political conjuring trick. He managed to
cut interest rates and import duties while boosting spending on education,
agriculture and infrastructure, without increasing government borrowing.
Many economists believe it would be virtually impossible for India to turn
back to its old ways, even if reforms suffer setbacks in future years. If
this is true, Mr Singh will have played a key role in changing India's
destiny.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (28): Peace dividend
may be delayed - Middle East / The structure of most economies in the region
has so far remained immune to the wave of liberalisation elsewhere in the
world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN JUST a month, the cast of Middle Eastern politics has been transformed.
The signature of an outline peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation on September 13, unthinkable a little more than a
fortnight before, broke the deadlock in the Middle East peace talks and
accomplished the necessary first step for a full and comprehensive regional
peace.
Much remains to be negotiated before that dream is reached. Syria and
Lebanon must follow Jordan in signing even documents of principle to guide
their own talks. But enough has been achieved already to raise serious
questions about the future economic cast of the region. Will nascent peace,
in particular, encourage greater regional economic integration than
hitherto? And might this in turn lead to stronger trade and investment ties
with other trading blocs - most particularly with Europe?
History suggests that progress in both cases is likely to be glacial. The
first impediment will be political will, which has traditionally been found
wanting in any of the few attempts to date to forge meaningful economic
blocks, grouping, particularly, the countries between the Gulf and North
Africa. Moreover, as the example of the cold peace between Egypt and Israel,
now more than a decade old, shows, peace alone is no guarantor of enhanced
economic integration. Trade and investment flows between Egypt and Israel,
the two biggest economies of this block, remain small and to some extent
grudging. As an instance, only 3,000 Egyptians have travelled as tourists to
Israel during the whole 14 years of peace.
Another impediment is the very structure of most economies in the region,
which has remained steadfastly immune to the wave of liberalisation,
privatisation and deregulation which has eroded previously dirigiste
economies elsewhere in the world. As Mr Mohamed El-Erian and Mr Shamsuddin
Tareq, two International Monetary Fund economists, stated in a recent
independent report: 'No country in the region may be regarded as having
implemented a comprehensive program of wholesale divestiture of public
sector enterprises - in contrast to the experience in Asia, central and
eastern Europe and Latin America.'
As their report emphasises, most countries in the region have been
characterised by policies of import-substituting industrialisation, heavy
reliance on the state sector and restrictive trade practices. 'The private
sector came to perform an increasingly residual role in a number of economic
and financial sectors, with administrative allocation of resources replacing
market signals.' Trade regimes, meanwhile, are 'characterised by extensive
quantitative restrictions, nominal tariffs and cumbersome administrative
procedures'.
Profound internal reforms would, therefore, be the pre-requisite of any
attempts, even given sufficient political will, towards greater regional
economic integration. But progress here has also been tentative at best.
Of the countries in the region - excepting North Africa - only Jordan and
Egypt have undertaken formal reform programmes under the auspices of the IMF
and World Bank. In this respect the Gulf economies are something of a
special case, although recent high deficit spending in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait have received IMF attention, even if they have not quite accepted IMF
prescriptions.
The course of Egypt's reform programme offers modest hope for optimism.
Since resuming previously fractious relations with the IMF in 1991, Cairo
has succeeded in completing one agreement and will this month commence a
second. In the financial economy, the results have been striking: budget
deficits have been slashed from above 20 per cent of gross domestic product
to below 3 per cent, inflation has been halved to around 12 per cent, the
exchange rate has been stable for two years, interest rates now imply a real
cost of money - and are gradually falling - and reserves have accumulated to
around Dollars 16bn. Import restrictions and tariffs have been considerably
eased. New banking and capital market laws have been passed.
These macro-economic gains are likely to be built upon during the three
years of the second programme. But deeper structural reforms to the economy
have been harder won and far more limited. Indicatively, the government's
privatisation programme - thrashed out at great and painful length with the
World Bank - is well behind schedule, somewhat mired in bureaucratic
complexity and still to address the core public sector industries which
dominate at least 70 per cent of Egypt's manufacturing output. 'The
financial economy is going quite well, but reforms to the real economy are
going rather badly,' remarks Mr Rodney Wilson, a specialist in Middle
Eastern economies at the University of Durham.
The reasons for this are complex and deeply rooted. One is the leaden nature
of Egypt's bureaucracy, the poverty of public sector wages and the attendant
shortage of high-calibre administrators capable of implementing
sophisticated reforms. Another is governmental caution in carrying through
reforms which, in the short run, are likely only to increase joblessness in
an economy which cannot, already, keep up with the need to create upwards of
500,000 new jobs a year. There is also a structural resistance to opening an
economy the closedness of which has created deeply entrenched vested
interests - many of them close to the regime itself.
Egypt, therefore, appears unlikely to become any sort of powerhouse for a
regionally-based economic revival in the near term. The appetite for reform
elsewhere is also limited. According to IMF officials, Lebanon has hinted at
the possibility of undertaking some form of Fund assistance. Syria has shown
little taste for such yet - although President Hafez al-Assad has in the
last year or so gradually begun to dismantle some of the statist economic
controls bequeathed by the state's pseudo-socialist Baathist ideology.
But whatever the political, social or structural impediments, there is a
desperate need for some shift in economic thinking. Few of the region's
economies presently meet fully their peoples' needs - and, in some
countries, the worsening shortcomings of the economy provide only an
improving platform for anti-government activism, including Islamic
fundamentalism. Messers El-Erian and Tareq remark; 'The need for sustained
and comprehensive policy actions becomes more important in the context of
some countries' rapidly growing populations, uncertainties about the
prospects for a natural resource base, and the tendency outside the Middle
East toward preferential regional trading blocs.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (29): Algeria is
being left behind - The Maghreb / Economic reform is being tackled
energetically in Morocco and Tunisia. But their neighbour has a long way to
go to catch up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE contrast between the economies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia is now
more marked than at any time since these three North African states became
independent more than 30 years ago.
Since the mid-1980s Morocco and Tunisia have made considerable progress in
restructuring and liberalising the management of their economies. But
Algeria, by far the largest, is stuck in a spiral of economic decline and
political strife from which its military and civilian leaders appear unable
to escape.
Algeria's economic reforms, launched during the prime ministership of Mr
Mouloud Hamrouche, aimed at freeing foreign trade, at reinstating the
private owners of lands nationalised in the early 1970s, and liberalising
the management of a tightly run command economy.
But these policies foundered when the prime minister was dismissed in June
1991. His successor, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, scuppered the agreement with the
International Monetary Fund signed in June that year. A year later, the fate
of the reforms was sealed by the resignation of Mr Abderrahmane Hadj Nacer,
whom Mr Hamrouche had made governor of the central bank.
Mr Belaid Abdesselam, who succeeded Mr Ghozali as premier in the wake of the
assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf in June 1992, was unwilling to
usher in the essential economic reforms needed to reach a new agreement with
the IMF. Mr Abdesselam, who was sacked last August, was too much a prisoner
of his past - he was economic overlord from 1965 to 1978 when Algeria
launched a huge but abortive programme of industrialisation and
socialisation of agriculture.
His belief in strict state control of the economy, his highly publicised war
on corruption, and his largescale subsidies for bankrupt state companies fed
a spiral of economic decline.
His successor, Mr Redha Malek, is Algeria's fifth prime minister in five
years. Mr Malek seems to have greater prospects of success. But he faces a
daunting challenge.
In contrast with Algeria, her western and eastern neighbours, Morocco and
Tunisia, are making rapid strides.
For Morocco, the past 18 months have been difficult. GDP fell in 1992 by 3.5
per cent, largely because of drought. But Morocco has now reached the stage
at which the IMF would like other countries, such as Egypt, to be.
Since being forced to reschedule its foreign debt 10 years ago, the Moroccan
government has cut taxes, tariffs and subsidies. Its budget deficit, as a
percentage of GDP, has declined from 12 per cent a decade ago to below 3 per
cent. Inflation has been kept below 10 per cent.
Morocco has also avoided the kind of financial dislocation that, in Latin
American countries, kept risk premiums on interest rates and currency at
high levels long after the original financial problem had been resolved.
More recently, foreign investment in Morocco has risen fourfold to Dollars
500m since 1988 and a privatisation programme has been formulated and
launched.
The sale of a 51 per cent stake in the Scior cement company to Holderbank of
Switzerland earlier this summer was a watershed. So far this year, two
thirds of the government's Dirham 2bn (Dollars 214m) target for income from
privatisations in 1993 has been met. The next companies to be privatised are
expected to be the 40 subsidiaries of the sprawling Societe Nationale
d'Investissement. For the first time last year, receipts from foreign
investment into Morocco were equivalent to the deficit on the current
account.
This is a far cry from the situation in September 1983, when Morocco it was
forced to reschedule its foreign debt. At Dollars 21.5bn, the present
foreign debt remains asignificant burden - total external debt represents 80
per cent of gdp. However, the debt service ratio has been halved to about 34
per cent of exports of goods and services. This was helped by Saudi Arabia's
forgiveness of nearly Dollars 3bn worth of loans as a mark of gratitude to
King Hassan for his support during the Gulf war.
However, Morocco still has much more to change in order *something in here
(HP) *
to consolidate its gains of recent years. A confidential World Bank report
earlier this year pointed out a number of weaknesses:
The manufacturing base remains at a low 18 per cent of GDP, a level
unchanged for the past decade and much smaller than in most fast growing
industrialising economies;
Foreign investment remains limited, accounting for a 10th of total equity;
Exports are too narrowly based - mostly garments - and have too few markets,
notably France.
The report sees two other constraints on business expansion - finance and
information. Better business financing means more foreign direct investment,
more investment and term lending by foreign and domestic banks, stronger
institutional saving to increase the supply of long term deposits. There is
also a lack of skilled labour reflecting the fact that the rate of
illiteracy among men is only 55 per cent.
Tunisia's path to reform has been smiled on by the gods. In 1987, the
elderly and senile President Habib Bourguiba was ushered out of power by his
interior minister, Mr Zine el Abidine Ban Ali. In the previous year,
Tunisian leaders had been forced by severe balance of payments crisis to
grasp the urgency of economic reform. Mr Ben Ali's steady hand has since
given senior ministers the political stability essential to successful
economic reform.
Four seasons of good rains and bountiful crops have helped Tunisia raise GDP
by an average of 6.6 per cent a year over the past three years. That is more
than three times the annual population increase and gives the authorities
reasonable room for manoeuvre. Buoyant tourist receipts have also helped.
A 6 per cent annual average growth to 1996 will be needed to create the
313,000 new jobs required by the labour market. This is an ambitious target.
It must be achieved by rising exports to recession-hit Europe, which takes
77 per cent of Tunisian exports. It also coincides with the economic
restructuring which is cutting deeply into the soft underbelly of Tunisian
industry.
Tunisians also have a higher standard of education than their neighbours and
a better average standard of living.
Critics are concerned, however, at the lack of economic information
available to the Tunisian public, the snail like pace of privatisation and
the dispersion of economic management among too many different ministries.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (26): Year of hope
and disappointment - Russia / John Lloyd looks at a country both moving
forward and stuck, trembling on the brink of development, yet still with a
deep inhibition at every level

RUSSIA'S reforms have stalled. Inflation in August reached nearly 30 per
cent, production continues to fall (though at a slower rate than earlier
this year),foreign investment is estimated to be no more than Dollars 1bn in
this current year, oil production continues to decline, the budget is in
huge deficit and the tax take is falling.
The history of the past year has been one of hope and disappointment - a
typical cycle in Russian reform since the late Eighties, when a turn to the
market was first adumbrated in the reform-Communist period ushered in by Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev. In this context, the hope was the apparent victory within
the cabinet for the renewal of a tough macroeconomic policy under the
leadership of Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister in charge of finance,
with the support of other reformers in the cabinet: a policy which had the
explicit support of President Boris Yeltsin and, abroad, of the Group of
Seven industrial countries, which pledged a headline figure of Dollars 44bn
to support Russia.
The hopes were raised by the convincing victory won by President Yeltsin in
the referendum on trust in himself and his policies on April 25: and further
strengthened by his declaration of intent to move to a new constitution and
new elections in the near future. A timetable had been mapped out, a
structure given, a sense of confidence engendered.
The disappointment has come when these hopes have not been realised. The
static conflict between president and parliament which the referendum was
thought to have broken has re-formed, more intractable than ever. Inflation,
said to have been curbed and brought down to 15 per cent a month, has gone
back to 30 per cent: the main reason, say the reform economists, is the
continued issuing of credits by the Central Bank in defiance of an agreement
with the government to keep credit advances on a declining curve through the
end of the year.
Sure it is that a Central Bank with a different philosophy from that of the
government is a source of instability: however, it is fair to say that the
government itself has lost what coherence it had. At least two rival
conceptions of how to run the economy fight it out within the cabinet: one,
put up by Mr Fyodorov and nominally accepted by the president, would
continue the line of relatively tight controls, while the other, put up by
Mr Oleg Lobov, the first deputy prime minister for the economy, calls for
extra state investments, an end to voucher privatisation and an explicit
acknowledgement that reforms cannot continue through the macroeconomic means
once favoured.
In such conditions, the IMF, which has since the beginning of 1992 acted as
the facilitator and watchdog of the reform process, has considered itself to
have had no choice but to delay implementation of the programme agreed by
the Group of Seven in spring of this year. Though no final decision has yet
been announced, it seems clear that the second tranche (Dollars 1.5bn) of
the Systemic Transformation Facility created as a way of injecting support
into the Russian budget quickly will not be paid this year - and will not be
paid at all until the Russian house is put in order. This may concentrate
the minds: and it is possible that reforms will be put back on track.
A clutch of reform-minded Ministers besides Mr Fyodorov - chief among them
Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation -
continue to fight, and sometimes to win, battles for the cause of creating a
market economy. However, the balance of power seems to be swinging against
them: and even if they remain in the cabinet, their authority is narrowing
and their useful political lives - at least this time round, for these are
young men - appear to be shortening.
It is hard to say, however, how far the demise of this reform group will
destroy reform. Clearly, stabilisation of the currency, a real lowering of
inflation and the imparting of a renewed dynamism to Russian enterprises are
not likely in the near future. Clearly, too, the men who wait to succeed the
reformers are those who would continue, albeit in modified form, many of the
central-command-economy practices with which they still feel most familiar.
The doubt concerns what has already been released from central control - or
rather how amenable it is to coming under control once more. Russia is, at
least in part, a European country with a relatively well educated citizenry
 -the most well educated of which, moreover, are now picking up new methods
of work and study as the old system decays about them.
Privatisation, above all, continues - albeit fitfully. Large numbers of
small businesses and shops have been privatised. Enterprises of medium and
large size are also now coming under the hammer, and some giants are now in
the private sector. It is the case that the shops are still as surly as ever
and (to Western eyes) uninviting: it is the case, too, that the enterprise
culture remains the same, with 'private' managers still demanding soft
credits from the state to keep often unviable enterprises, or unwanted
production, on the road.
But private enterprises are not the same as state ones. The onus has passed
to the government to wean the plants off the state by refusing easy credit.
Managers may still be kept afloat, but they must also make deals and even
find markets in ways they did not before.
It is far from a consumer or an enterprise society: to the new arrival, it
appears forbidding, grimy and obsolescent: the barriers and impediments
accumulated over decades are too great for a revolution of that kind to
happen quickly. But the fact that some movement is visible from below
moderates the pessimism gained from the view from above: it gives the
observer a double vision, of a country both moving forward and stuck:
trembling on the brink of development, yet still with a deep inhibition at
every level.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (27): Back on the
road to economic growth - Eastern Europe / The economic prospects for the
former communist states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON

<TEXT>
POLAND, only four years ago a communist basket case par excellence, will
this year win accolades as the fastest growing economy in Europe.
Had it not been for a clutch of special factors - the recession in Germany
and western Europe, the second consecutive year of drought in Hungary, the
one-off negative effect of the divorce between the Czech and Slovak
republics, and the impact on Slovenia of the collapse in the former Yugoslav
market, Poland would have been accompanied around the top of the European
growth league by its neighbours in central Europe as a whole.
Next year, barring disasters, the whole of post-communist Europe outside
former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union, but including Albania,
Romania and Bulgaria, and probably the Baltic states, should return to the
path of economic growth.
Statistics prepared by PlanEcon Europe indicate that GDP growth in the
region next year will range from a low of 2.6 per cent in Romania to more
than 5 per cent in Slovenia and Bulgaria and 6 per cent in Poland and the
Czech republic.
If so, next year should mark the start of what could be a prolonged period
of self-sustaining growth capable of stimulating the development of a
pan-European market from the Atlantic to the eastern borders of Poland.
At that point, the political leaders of the European Community, who were
able to escape ultimate responsibility, and the need to offer real
leadership during the 45-year Soviet-American hegemony over a divided
continent, might finally switch their focus away from the cold-war version
of a united Europe enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, towards serious
contemplation of the kind of confederal structure required to accommodate an
additional 105m people, and a dozen new member states into an enlarged and
re-structured European economic and defence community.
Even if they do rise to the occasion, however, the politicians will be far
behind the bankers, businessmen and entrepreneurs of Europe, North America
and Asia, for whom a pan-European market is already a reality. First prize
for market awareness perhaps goes to the German ice-cream manufacturer who
now routinely labels the ingredients of his humble ice-lollies in Czech,
Hungarian and Polish, in addition to German, French, Dutch, Spanish and
English.
This example of pan-European marketing helps to illustrate the thinking
which has made the multinational food and consumer goods corporations the
spearhead for integrating the former communist states into the global
economy.
Throughout the region a raft of new plants have been, or are being built by
the big food and detergent groups such as Unilever, Procter and Gamble,
Henkel, Nestle and Sara Lee, rival tobacco companies, such as Philip Morris
and BAT, consumer durable companies, such as Electrolux, and the big
automobile makers led by Volkswagen, Fiat and General Motors.
Production from new greenfield plants, or from restructured, former
state-owned facilities, privatised in the biggest sell-off of state property
ever seen, is rising rapidly.
The elimination of subsidies, introduction of internal currency
convertibility and adherence to tight IMF-monitored budget deficit limits
has also helped shape a macroeconomic framework in which many of the former
loss-making state enterprises have been down-sized and made more efficient
by asset sales, the closure of loss-making sections and job losses.
Relatively few state enterprises have yet been closed down completely,
especially in the Czech republic where tight control over public sector
wages has enabled state enterprises to keep workers on their books rather
than the unemployment register. But throughout central Europe the scale of
losses from state-owned enterprises awaiting privatisation has been cut, and
in a few spectacular cases, such as the Szceczin shipyards on Poland's
Baltic coast, managers have been able to turn round loss-making state
enterprises before the introduction of a form of privatisation which
includes a strong management and worker buyout elements.
General awareness of the scale and speed of the economic transformation of
central Europe has been masked to date by the official statistics, the
accuracy of which is limited mainly to recording the speed and extent of the
decline in output from the big state sector plants.
Perversely, the most rapid transformers, Poland and Hungary, show the
steepest rise in unemployment and more than 30 per cent declines in
industrial output over the last four years. At the same time rapid
inflation, especially in Poland, has wiped out the savings of millions of
people.
The emergence of a lost generation of managers and workers who have been
sacked from their former secure jobs, lost their savings and found
themselves virtually unemployable in the new economy, has placed a huge
pension and unemployment payment burden on state budgets.
At the same time, the bad debts of many state enterprises continue to limit
the ability of under-capitalised and inexperienced banking systems to
satisfy the rising credit demands from the rapidly expanding private sector.
All this means that the transition process is far from complete, while
nostalgia for the lost security of the age of socialist mediocrity, coupled
with resentment at the emergence of many from the old communist nomenklatura
as the new capitalists and entrepreneurs, has embittered the political
atmosphere. In Poland, for example, the post-Solidarity parties most closely
associated with market reforms, have been unable to capitalise on Poland's
current rapid recovery from three years of wrenching recession. Polls show
that voters have been swinging back to support for parties with roots in the
collectivist past because unemployment remains stubbornly high while the low
incomes of millions of ordinary workers keep the new consumer goods
tantalisingly out of their grasp.
In Hungary, the main recipient of foreign capital but the most indebted
country in the region, the delayed resumption of growth after so much macro
and micro-economic change is also undermining the popularity of the
conservative government and re-awakening a frustrated nationalism.
Only in the Czech republic, where Mr Vaclav Klaus, the economist turned
prime minister has made a deliberate effort to explain the merits of
capitalism and the advantages of privatisation to the electorate, have
voters clearly given their support for those in charge of still painful
reform.
What remains to be seen is how far Nato and the European Community respond
to the desire of central Europe's new market-based democracies for full
integration.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (24): Braced for a
bruising battle - France / After the currency crisis in August, Alice
Rawsthorn assesses the problems facing Mr Balladur as his government tries
to kick-start the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN Mr Edouard Balladur, France's usually unflappable prime minister, must
have winced when he read a recent letter from a group of bankers in
Liberation newspaper, attacking the 'ayatollahs of the strong franc' for the
damage they had wreaked on the French economy.
Mr Balladur, who had cast himself in his first four months as prime minister
as the chief proponent of the franc fort policy of protecting the French
currency, had just emerged from the humiliation of the August currency
crisis when the speculative assaults on the franc had left his monetary
policy and the European exchange rate mechanism in tatters.
France, like its fellow European Community member states, had been forced to
broaden its ERM fluctuation margins from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent. So
far the franc has proved to be surprisingly stable in the wake of the
crisis. Moreover, Mr Balladur's popularity has remained intact. He still has
the highest approval rating at this stage in his tenure of any prime
minister in the Fifth Republic apart from Mr Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who
reigned over the Hotel de Matignon during the 1970 economic boom.
The critical question is whether Mr Balladur can continue to command the
public's support in the 18 months until the presidential elections in spring
1995. The conventional wisdom is that both his conservative coalition's
hopes of remaining in power - and his own chance of ousting Mr Jacques
Chirac, the head of the RPR party and mayor of Paris, as the right's
presidential contender - will be contingent on his success in revitalising
France's sluggish economy and halting the rise in unemployment.
So far Mr Balladur has had no success on either front. The economy, squeezed
by high interest rates and a strong currency, slid into recession during the
opening months of this year, when it registered a second successive
quarterly decline in the real rate of growth for the first time since the
Gulf War.
Consumer spending and industrial investment have remained weak in spite of
the reductions in interest rates since the conservative victory in the March
parliamentary elections. The fall in the franc's value has not been
sufficient to trigger a significant recovery in exports. Salomon Brothers
forecasts a 1.5 per cent fall in the real rate of GDP growth during the
course of this year. The latest surveys of business confidence suggest that
industrialists do not expect to see an upturn in the economy until the
fourth quarter at the earliest.
In the meantime unemployment, which was already at a record level of 3m
people when the right came to power in the March parliamentary elections,
has since risen steadily to around 3.2m, or a record 11.7 per cent of the
workforce (the highest of any G7 country) and is expected to reach 12.5 per
cent by the end of this year.
Mr Balladur's response has been to try to kick-start the economy through a
combination of employment reforms and public sector expenditure. Mr Michel
Giraud, the labour minister, recently unveiled a series of measures intended
to make it easier for employers to create new jobs by liberalising France's
infamously strict employment law. These include waiving employers' social
security payments for the first three new workers they hire and making the
39-hour working weeks more flexible.
Meanwhile, the success of the 'Balladur bond', the special bond issue
launched this summer which raised FFr110bn, rather than the FFr40bn
originally forecast, has enabled the prime minister not only to step up his
public expenditure plans but to promise income tax cuts next year for middle
income employees.
However, the government's room for manoeuvre is restricted by a number of
factors. One is the budget deficit. Mr Balladur, who inherited a sizeable
deficit from the previous socialist administration, hopes to limit this
year's deficit to FFr317bn. However, most private sector economists suspect
it will be rather higher at around FFr350bn.
Another inhibiting factor is the structure of the present recession which
has had a devastating effect on consumer confidence partly due to fears of
joblessness and partly to the high rate of real interest rates, or the
discrepancy between retail price inflation and bank base rates.
In past French recessions inflation has been higher than base rates, thereby
encouraging consumers to spend money for fear of being caught out by rising
prices.
But inflation has been at least six percentage points below base rates
throughout the current slump, a scenario that has encouraged consumers to
save rather than spend. Societe Generale estimates that the personal savings
ratio rose from an average of 10.9 per cent in 1987 to 12.8 per cent last
year and is now well over 13 per cent.
The success of the 'Balladur bond' illustrates just how nervous French
consumers have become. A large chunk of the FFr110bn used to buy the bonds
had been lying idle in savings accounts or SICAV money market funds. The
bond holders could just as easily have spent their money, but had chosen
instead to save it and then to invest in government bonds.
Mr Balladur from this autumn hopes to take advantage of this 'saving spirit'
by encouraging both the Balladur bond holders and other savers to
participate in the government's privatisation programme.
But his government has to balance its desire to secure the success of the
share sales against the need to regenerate the consumer side of the economy.
Moreover, it faces a tough task in rebuilding consumer confidence given that
the toll of job losses shows no sign of stopping and that real interest
rates remain high in spite of the recent reductions in borrowing costs.
Finally, the government is hidebound by monetary constraints: by its desire
to maintain a reasonably strong franc and to safeguard the process of
European monetary union which has made it cautious about cutting interest
rates. These issues are also complicated by additional factors such as the
uncertainty over France's economic and strategic relationship with Germany,
the doubts about the EC's future and the tangled arguments over the Gatt
trade agreement.
The economy ministry recently reassessed its growth projections for 1994. It
stuck to the initial estimate of 1.4 per cent growth made in June, although
it dramatically revised its view of the underlying state of the economy. The
ministry has upgraded its expectations for export growth, due to the recent
fall of the franc, but has downgraded its forecasts for consumer spending
because of the low level of confidence.
All in all Mr Balladur - and the French economy - face a bruising 18 months
before the 1995 presidential elections with, or without, the critics of the
'ayatollahs of the strong franc'.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (25): Signals
continue to be ambiguous - Italy / The recession has coincided with a
significant restructuring of the economy and unprecedented budget austerity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESENTING the 1994 budget before the summer break, Mr Piero Barucci, the
Italian treasury minister, claimed the recession was 'coming to an end'.
Yet the economic signals continue to be ambiguous and only on the most
optimistic of scenarios will the signs of recovery be detectable in early
1994.
The bottoming out process could well be long and painful. This is largely
because, unlike other G7 countries, the recession has coincided with a
significant restructuring of the economy and unprecedented budget austerity.
When the recovery begins it is likely to be export-led. Italian companies
have really taken advantage of last September's devaluation of the lira and
its 'temporary' exit from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). They
have offset a sharp drop in domestic demand by switching to exports. As a
result in the first half of 1993 sales to the EC, Italy's main market, rose
11 per cent in value; while overall trade swung from deficit to surplus by a
staggering L22,000bn compared to the same period in 1992.
Without the oxygen of the export boom, the effects of recession would
undoubtedly have been more keenly felt. Italy has not experienced such a
sharp switch to negative growth since the early seventies. The downturn
began in mid-1991; but it was not felt until nearly a year later and this
year negative growth is projected of around 0.3 - 0.5 per cent.
Demand during the first half of this year, especially for investment goods
and consumer durables, dropped 10 per cent. Industrial production for the
six months was down 4.2 per cent with an even more pronounced dip in June
bringing the index to the levels of mid-1987. As yet, there is no evidence
of stock-building.
Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, hopes production levels
have come close to touching bottom but is reluctant to say anything
definitive until more data is available. The key to the coming months will
be the ability of Italian goods to sustain their competitiveness in export
markets.
The cost of the recession has been reflected in squeezed profits and a steep
rise in unemployment. In 1992, more than 200,000 jobs were lost in industry
and the service sector, and unofficial estimates suggest the figure will be
greater this year. Officially, 2.4m people are unemployed, 1m of whom are
seeking jobs for the first time. Although the unemployed represent 10.5 per
cent of the workforce, this distorts the picture since in the north the
jobless rate is down to 6.5 per cent while in certain parts of the south it
is more than 23 per cent.
The picture is further distorted by the Italian practice of temporary
lay-offs, funded jointly by the government and employers, which can extend
for up two years. In the first six months the number of hours covered by
lay-off payments increased 26 per cent.
The increase in unemployment has obliged the unions to opt for wage
moderation in return for job security. Aided by tight curbs on public sector
pay, the level of wage increases has fallen, averaging 4.7 per cent last
year and likely to be about 4.4 per cent this year. The trend was formalised
in an historic four-year tripartite pact between the government, unions and
industrialists on July 3.
The essence of this deal was an agreement that wages cannot match inflation
unless increases in pay are directly linked to productivity. This eliminates
one of the most damaging aspects of traditional Italian wage bargaining -
the automatic linkage of wages to inflation. The next step will be to hold
down overall production costs by removing rigidities in the labour market
and introducing temporary employment contracts, and ending national pay
structures. This promises to be much harder to achieve.
If wage-fed inflation now looks like being a phenomenon of the past, Italy
still has one of the highest inflation rates in the EC. Recession has helped
curb price increases and largely offset the negative impact of devaluation
through most costly imports, (notably energy products paid in dollars). But
this year the inflation rate will not come down much below 4.5 per cent with
a projection of 3.7 per cent for 1994. This rate of inflation reflects high
service costs and inefficiencies in the country's infrastructure.
The fight against inflation will be helped by the Ciampi government's 1994
austerity budget. This plans to hold down the public sector deficit to
L144,000bn (L155,000bn in 1993) mainly through cuts in spending rather than
new taxes as in the current year. The cuts, raising L28,000bn, will come
from cuts in the generous state pension scheme, streamlining the civil
service, reductions in health benefits and a virtual block on public sector
pay rises.
The budget aims to provide a small primary surplus, underlining that the
deficit is essentially the product of the heavy burden of debt service. The
mountain of Italy's debt, one third of all the EC debt, remains the weakest
point of the economy. The debt stock is due to increase from 110 per cent of
GDP to nearly 120 per cent before stabilising in 1996.
The cost of debt service has been helped by the fall in interest rates, each
one percentage point saving some L15,000bn in a year. However, the
authorities remain caught in a vicious circle.
The business community is clamouring for a further cut in interest rates and
a narrowing of the spread between Italian real rates and those among its
main trading partners. At present real interest rates in Italy are nearly 5
per cent. Until the difference is narrowed and rates fall further the cost
of borrowing remains prohibitive. But equally, Italy needs to maintain
attractive rates on government paper to fund the public sector borrowing
requirements.
This emphasis on retaining the attractiveness of government paper prejudices
the development of the stock market at a time when the bourse needs to
expand to cope with at least part of the ambitious plans for privatising
state-controlled banks and industries.
The privatisation programme has been far too hastily conceived, with a
series of bold announcements to be followed by slow implementation and
frequent changes. At last the treasury appears firmly in control of the
process and there should be progress.
However, Italy is likely to hold general elections next spring, under a new
and predominantly first-past-the-post system. While the government will do
all to lock its successor into a continuing policy of austerity and
liberalisation, this may not prove so simple.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (23): Down-to-earth
 -and blunt - Profile, Eddie George / As the new governor of the Bank of
England settles into his job, in a sense it is business as usual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Eddie George settles into his new role as governor of the Bank of
England, the winds of change are blowing through Threadneedle Street.
A postman's son who grew up near a sewage works in south London, Mr George
became governor on July 1, taking over from the patrician-mannered Robin
Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord Kingsdown). While his predecessor lives on a
country estate in Kent, Mr George inhabits a modest suburban house in
Dulwich, south London, with a car showroom and toddlers' club at the end of
his road.
The new governor's down-to-earth lifestyle fits in with a blunt approach to
organising the Bank's operations, particularly in the crucial area of
monetary policy. Here the Bank advises the Treasury on day-to-day management
of exchange rates and interest rates and has been given a new mandate to
publish a quarterly report on how it views inflationary pressures.
This idea - put forward by Mr George at the end of last year when he was
deputy governor - is designed to improve public confidence in the UK's
economic policies after the trauma of last September's exit from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr George has been at the Bank for 31 years and has been the key influence
on Threadneedle Street in the past five years. One close observer of the
Bank says: 'No one pretended that Robin Leigh-Pemberton had anything very
original to say on monetary policy. Eddie was always there at his elbow to
help out. The move up to governor is the apotheosis that Eddie has been
looking forward to for the past five years and so in this sense it is
business as usual.'
The view that life at the Bank was not going to change because of Mr
George's appointment is backed up by his own remark just before the Thursday
in July when he stepped up to the top position. His laconic comment was that
it would be 'just like any other Thursday'.
It is true, the world hardly fell out of bed when Mr George took over.
However, one big fan is south London estate agent Mr Hendrik Bossman, who
also runs the Dulwich traders' association.
Mr Bossman, who wrote to the new governor when he heard of his promotion and
received a 'courteous' reply, says of Mr George: 'I think he's going to be a
success. He may be uncharismatic, but that doesn't bother me: he should get
on with his job, not worry about appearing on TV shows.'
Mr George's promotion cannot be seen in isolation. Senior Bank officials are
increasingly willing to take arguments to the outside world, and - as with
the inflation report - expose some of its economic thinking to the public.
Even though the Bank remains less important than the Treasury in UK economic
management, its position has become more powerful partly because of the
errors made by the Treasury in misjudging the inflationary burst of the late
1980s, failing to recognise the seriousness of the recession which followed
and the poor management of Britain's response to last September's ERM
crisis.
Helping this shift to greater openness is that, of the top six Bank
officials, three are relative outsiders to the institution - the new deputy
governor Rupert Pennant-Rea, economics director Mervyn King, international
director Andrew Crockett - leaving the three 'insiders' as Mr George,
banking director Brian Quinn and monetary guru Tony Coleby.
Prior to the recruitment of Mr Pennant-Rea from his job as editor of the
Economist and the retirement of the previous governor, the outsider/insider
balance was two to four.
One person with close knowledge of Bank activities says: 'It may not seem
all that significant, but the change has definitely altered the personal
chemistry at the Bank. There is a strong sense that the Bank is more willing
to engage in a discussion with the outside world.'
One of Mr George's preoccupations in the next few months will be to build up
stronger links with the business community.
There is a plan afoot at the Bank to involve Mr George more than his
predecessor with informal discussions with business leaders, possibly
through arrangements such as dinners. Since he took over in July, Mr George
has already had one dinner with top executives who are members of the
Confederation of British Industry's economic affairs committee.
This committee is chaired by Sir David Lees who, as well as being chairman
of the engineering group GKN, is on the Bank's court or board of
non-executive directors.
Mr George can also be expected to participate in an initiative under
discussion at the Bank looking into the relationships between commercial
banks and small businesses.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (22): The limits of
perfection - United Kingdom / Although all the key indicators are pointing
in the right direction, Emma Tucker says seasoned watchers are wondering if
the good news will last
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UK economy is enjoying a perfect recovery; output is up, unemployment is
falling, and price increases are at their lowest levels for 30 years.
That, anyway, is the story told by official figures. But many seasoned
watchers of the UK are not entirely convinced that the good news will last.
Twelve months out of recession the cynics are sceptical that the next few
years will bring a sustained economic recovery with inflation firmly under
control.
As it emerged from the economic downturn of the early 1990s, the UK had a
head start over the rest of Europe. Official data shows the recession ended
in the middle of last year, but the incipient recovery was accelerated by
the massive monetary easing that followed September 16, 1992, when the UK
was ousted from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Interest rates were cut from 10 to 6 per cent and sterling devalued by about
13 per cent, providing a kick to most sectors of the economy, but mainly to
manufacturing industry.
Manufacturing, which was almost 2.2 per cent up on a year ago in the first
half of the year, fuelled a 0.4 per cent rise in gross domestic product in
the first quarter, followed by a 0.5 per cent increase in the second.
The depreciation of sterling, which made UK goods more competitive at home
and abroad was one factor behind the rise in manufacturing. Restocking by
wholesalers has also picked up as has capital spending by companies.
Consumer spending progressed more cautiously. It improved only modestly in
the first six months of the year apparently held back by fear of
unemployment, continued high levels of debt and a squeeze on real wages.
Jobless data took economists by surprise, falling for five consecutive
months in the first half of the year. A number of explanations were put
forward for the unusually early drop in unemployment. These included:
The more flexible labour market following the scaling down of union power
during the 1980s;
A possible over-shedding of labour towards the end of last year as companies
took a pessimistic view of the economy. They are now having to re-hire after
the substantial relaxation of monetary policy that followed the UK's exit
from the ERM.
A reduction in the jobless total due to government policies to get
unemployed workers on to training schemes.
News on inflation has also been encouraging. In June the retail prices index
 -the headline rate of inflation - dropped to 1.2 per cent, its lowest level
for 30 years. The underlying rate of inflation, the RPI excluding mortgage
interest rates, has dropped to below 3 per cent, within the government's
target range of 1-4 per cent.
Although inflation has since crept upwards, there are few pressures on
prices. The combination of a slow recovery in domestic demand, low unit
labour costs, and a recent appreciation of sterling probably means that
underlying inflation will stay within the government's target range this
year. Furthermore, manufacturers have apparently been able to absorb the
higher cost of imports following devaluation, mainly because the cost of
labour has been easing at the same time.
Recent trade figures show some improvement in the UK's trade performance. In
the first quarter the current account deficit was Pounds 4bn, little changed
on the previous quarter, but more recent data on non-EC trade (which
accounts for just under half the UK's total trade) show that in the second
quarter the non-EC visibles deficit was Pounds 2.3bn, Pounds 1.1bn lower
than in the first quarter.
The outlook for the economy, according to the consensus among economists, is
that GDP will continue to grow at roughly the same rate in the second half
of this year, but will slow next year. The official Treasury forecast, made
in March, is for growth of 1.25 per cent this year, although the Treasury
has hinted this forecast will be revised upwards in the November budget.
Certainly the consensus is slightly higher at about 1.6 per cent.
Next year, the Economist Intelligence Unit believes the economy will grow by
2.2 per cent, slightly less optimistic than the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development which puts it at 2.9 per cent. The official
forecast is for the economy to grow by 3 per cent in the first half of 1994.
Why though, given the encouraging story told by current figures, are
forecasts for growth next year relatively lacklustre? The caution among
economists reflects awareness of a number of factors that could act as a
restraint on activity. These include:
Tax increases. In the Spring budget Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor,
announced tax increases to raise Pounds 6.2bn in extra revenues, to come
into effect in 1994/95. Further fiscal tightening is likely to be signalled
in the autumn budget as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, grapples with the
public sector borrowing requirement, forecast to reach Pounds 50bn in this
financial year.
Recession in Europe. Although interest rates in Germany are gradually being
reduced, economic activity in Europe is sluggish. With more than half of the
UK's overseas trade accounted for by the European Community, exporters face
a tough struggle to sell their products, even after the devaluation.
Debt overhang. Household debt is still about 100 per cent of the annual flow
of disposable income, and although the savings ratio has dropped, personal
saving is still high. Survey evidence suggests consumers are either
generally unable or unwilling to take on new debts.
Not all economists are as cautious about medium-term prospects. The
optimists argue that excess capacity, resulting from reduced output during
the recession, will allow for strong non-inflationary growth.
Much depends on the behaviour of the government. In its latest report the
EIU said it remained 'convinced that the government's medium term aim of
bringing inflation down to the bottom of the 1-4 per cent target range will
be forsaken in favour of stronger economic growth'.
Such a strategy would help bring unemployment down in the short run but as
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, warned in a recent
interview: 'If we go for rapid expansion now, which brings back inflationary
pressures very soon, we will experience what we had in the past which was a
period of good years followed by three or four lean years.'
With the latest 'bust' behind it, the UK does not appear to be heading for
another boom. But the perfect recovery may yet be derailed by an unpopular
government struggling to keep a particularly small parliamentary majority
happy.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (20): Rough weather
continues - Japan / The 'clear skies' forecast has proved to be optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S forecasters have taken to studying cloud formations to increase
their understanding of the economy's poor health. The Economic Planning
Agency said an unusually wet summer had led to 'unanticipated' falls in
consumption, and the Bank of Japan has partly blamed the weather for driving
away an expected recovery.
The EPA presumes that a promised recovery is overdue, not that its original
'clear skies' forecast was overly optimistic, although the agency predicted
3.3 per cent growth for the fiscal year and most private institutional
estimates are for 1 per cent or less growth.
Causes - other than the meteorological - of the prolonged downturn are
described in the EPA's own investigation into the 'bubble economy' of the
late 1980s, when asset prices, capital investment and corporate profits
reached unsustainable heights, from which they have descended for the past
three years.
In the report, the EPA conceded that the 1980s excesses had left a 'huge
scar on the Japanese economy' and that recovery 'will likely remain more
moderate than past recovery phases'. The EPA also suggested that the 'last
adjustment phase' before recovery began in 1991, meaning that the economy
has been 'bottoming out' for more than two years.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, arrived in office to find
his advisers at the EPA predicting an imminent recovery, while the flow of
economic statistics headed in the opposite direction. New car sales in July
fell 10.8 per cent from a year earlier, the ratio of job offers to
applications slipped from 81:100 to 74:100 during June and the trade surplus
in July expanded 24.9 per cent, as import demand remained weak.
Mr Hosokawa's response was a Y6,150bn spending and deregulation package,
also designed to pass on the benefits of yen appreciation to consumers.
The yen's rise had put extra pressure on manufacturers still flabby after
their investment excesses of the late 1980s. Instead of relocating more
production in lower-cost east Asian countries, many manufacturers added
capacity in high-cost Japan.
The increase in capital spending in the late 1980s, when capital was raised
at almost no cost, was highlighted by a 24.4 per cent rise in new machinery
orders during 1988. Companies which put on extra production capacity and
staff were, in some cases, also indulging in speculative property and stock
investments which have since turned sour.
These companies are now facing their fourth successive year of falling
profits. The New Japan Securities Research Institute estimated in early
September that the combined pre-tax profits of companies listed on the Tokyo
exchange would fall 17 per cent in the year to March, while their sales
would shrink 3 per cent.
A senior manager at a Japanese brokerage said the Bank of Japan and the EPA
had apparently failed to comprehend the eventual effects of the asset price
fall on the 'real economy'. In the months after the stock price slide begin
in 1990, bank officials argued that the effects would be isolated,
afflicting only those companies and individuals speculating in property and
stocks.
As well as discovering that speculation was more prevalent than they had
expected, Bank of Japan officials conceded that they had underestimated the
effects on consumer and corporate confidence of the market crash.
Two years ago, the bank insisted that companies were 'unnecessarily gloomy',
but their profits have fallen a long way since then.
The bank is concerned that the yen's appreciation has made companies even
more gloomy, and capital spending will continue to fall. Mr Yoji Inaba,
economic research director at the Japan Development Bank, said companies had
generally presumed that the yen would strengthen, but the pace of
appreciation has surprised them.
He warned that the currency movements would encourage cost-conscious
companies to lay-off staff on a scale not seen in modern Japan. 'Another
year of falling profits and companies will have to start getting rid of
excess workers in middle management,' he said.
There are signs that labour cutbacks have already entered a new phase.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone wants to reduce its workforce by 10,000 in
the next year through voluntary retirement and its longer-term goal is to
trim employees from 230,000 to 200,000.
Toshiba, the electronics group, followed the NTT announcement with a plan to
shed 5,000 workers over the next three to five years. On the day Toshiba
explained its cutbacks, the Machine Tool Builders' Association reported that
machine tool orders fell 27 per cent in July, against a year earlier.
The yen's appreciation, halted momentarily by concerted intervention, has
stirred debate about a 'hollowing out' of Japanese industry, a theme popular
during the bout of appreciation in the mid-1980s. The fear is that profit
production capacity will be shifted to cheaper Asian locations, a point made
by the Bank of Japan in its most recent quarterly outlook for the economy.
'The current stagnant investment in the assembly industry is a reflection of
low profitability in the industry, and the possibility that a further
appreciation of the yen could trigger a massive substitution of overseas
investment for domestic production cannot be ruled out,' the bank said.
The seven-party coalition is divided over how much time should be spent on
economic policy, as its first priority is supposed to be reforming the
political system.
But the coming of coalition government has not been as disruptive as
Japanese business organisations had feared.
A consensus quickly emerged within the coalition that another stimulatory
package was needed, and the Bank of Japan appeared to agree that lower
official interest rates were also necessary to encourage investment and
private consumption.
Meanwhile, the finance ministry is delighted that Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the new
finance minister and a former bureaucrat, has quickly fallen into policy
line. Mr Fujii is already arguing that the country cannot afford a tax cut
and that a spending package must be calculated with an eye on falling tax
revenues.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (21): Vacuum at the
heart of the EC - European Monetary Union / The Brussels compromise
transformed the ERM from a semi-fixed exchange rate system into a 'dirty
floating' operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST Black Wednesday, then Lundi Noir. The de facto suspension of the ERM
agreed on Monday, August 2, marks a turning point in Europe's plans for
monetary union.
Few dare to predict the outcome. But it is clear that EC leaders have begun
to reassess the approach to EMU as set down in the Maastricht treaty.
The two core assumptions in Maastricht were that the ERM could evolve
smoothly into a monetary union before the end of the decade, and that the
Franco-German alliance could drive the rest of Europe forward into a full
political union. Both these assumptions now look dubious.
The strains between the Paris and Bonn governments are evident, even if
there is no suggestion of a breach. Germany resented French pressure to
lower its interest rates in the run-up to the ERM crisis.
Tensions increased when France pushed hard for the D-Mark to leave the ERM
temporarily, against the advice of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The Brussels compromise transformed the ERM from a semi-fixed exchange rate
system into a 'dirty floating' operation, with currencies allowed to
fluctuate up to 15 per cent before central banks are obliged to intervene.
The result is a vacuum at the heart of European monetary co-operation.
The Community appears to be dividing into several camps, with no obvious
consensus on procedure.
The first camp contains the 'purists'. Led by the European Commission, this
group argues that it is vital to stick to the EMU game-plan set out in the
Maastricht treaty.
The purists include Belgium and Ireland and, broadly speaking, Italy and
France. Each puts a premium on EC solidarity; each would like Stage Two of
Emu to begin on January 1, 1994, along with a deal on a location of the
European Monetary Institute, the precursor the European Central Bank.
The purists believe the European Monetary System's structures remain intact,
thus allowing a reconfiguration of the narrow fluctuation bands once
economic conditions become more favourable.
The second group contains the 'sceptics', of which Britain is the
self-appointed leader. Mr John Major declared last month that the EMU
timetable was 'totally unrealistic' - words which might have carried more
weight had the UK prime minister not chosen to utter them on the day Britain
formally ratified the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Major and his Cabinet colleagues are convinced that history is on their
side. They believe they are winning all the arguments in favour of a more
flexible approach to European integration.
The third group constitutes the 'radicals', of which Spain is the most
obvious leader. Having suffered three successive devaluations of the peseta
(one in the middle of a general election campaign), Spain was so frustrated
during the ERM crisis talks in Brussels that it called for a full suspension
of the system.
There are now fears in some European capitals that the Spanish may in future
propose some form of capital controls as the best method of defending
currencies and punishing the speculators, no matter the damage to the single
European market.
The fourth group, which is probably the largest, contains the 'pragmatists'.
Led by Germany, the group includes the Netherlands, Denmark, and Luxembourg;
it may also extend part-time membership to the UK and France.
The pragmatists believe that there needs to be much more realism about EMU.
If there is slippage in the EMU timetable, so be it.
Chancellor Kohl specifically raised the prospect of a delay of up to two
years during a post-crisis television interview, and other officials are now
wondering privately if the 1999 target date for automatically locking
exchange rates is viable. At the same time, the pragmatists, particularly
Germany, insists that the 'convergence criteria' for EMU on inflation,
budget deficits and government debt must be adhered to.
Already some EC leaders have absorbed the lessons of the crisis. In the
early hours of August 2, Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, spoke
eloquently about the risks involved in exporting the discipline of price
stability to the rest of the EC. Some countries had obviously concluded that
the resulting high unemployment was too high a price to pay, he said.
Mr Kok was too diplomatic to mention names, but he was clearly referring to
France, whose government was forced to abandon its preferred franc fort
policy because it could not bear to raise interest rates higher to defend
the currency. The same lesson applied to the UK last September, and it
continues to be valid for the poorer 'Club Med' countries grouped around
Spain.
The tension between what might loosely be called the German and Latin
economic models is as old as the European Community itself. But it becomes
sharper during a recession, or when the Community embarks upon an enterprise
as ambitious as monetary union.
In the coming months, it is safe to predict that the EC will enter a
vigorous debate about EMU. The starting-point will probably be the 'White
Paper' on employment and competitiveness being prepared by Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, likely to appear under the
grand title of 'Entering the Twenty-First Century'.
The original impetus for the paper was growing evidence that Europe was
failing to create jobs at the same rate as the US and Asia, leading to an
inexorable rise in unemployment.
The ERM debacle makes the White Paper even more relevant. It will allow the
EC to focus minds on the 'real economy' and its relationship to EMU, says
one Brussels official involved.
The implication is that EC leaders need to focus on today's problems rather
than tomorrow's aspirations. No doubt the intellectual case for a single
European currency operating in a single European market is as powerful as
ever; but from now on, EMU will have to win the political argument, too.

US ECONOMIC growth seems likely to accelerate in the second half of the year
after a disappointing first six months, reflecting the positive impact on
consumer and business spending of a decline in long-term interest rates to
the lowest levels since the late 1960s.
The most spectacular sign of cheaper borrowing costs was the recent decline
of the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond to below 6 per cent
for the first time since it was issued in 1977. Yields on most long-maturity
bonds are at their lowest levels in a generation, reflecting investors'
confidence (possibly misplaced) that inflation will not pose a threat for
the foreseeable future.
The trend toward lower long-term interest rates, under way for several
years, should steadily improve the outlook for interest-rate sensitive
sectors, such as cars, consumer durables, business equipment and residential
housing. It seems likely to outweigh the slightly negative impact on growth
of the mild fiscal contraction imposed by the Clinton administration's first
budget, signed last month.
But growth will probably remain subdued by historical standards, reflecting
low rates of domestic saving and investment, weak consumer confidence and
relatively high debt burdens. The contraction still under way in
defence-related industries and the uncertainty associated with the planned
radical overhaul of healthcare (one seventh of the economy) could also
reduce growth in the short run.
Real gross domestic product is likely to grow at an underlying annual rate
of 2.5 to 3 per cent, double the 1.3 per cent rate in the first half but
well below the 4-5 per cent rates typical in past US recoveries. The
consensus is that GDP will continue expanding at this steady pace, or
perhaps a shade faster, next year.
The pattern of growth, however, will be distorted by the extensive flooding
in the mid-west in July and August. Crop damage and disruption of business
activity could reduce growth by 0.5 percentage points in the third quarter.
But rebuilding of damaged infrastructure and a rebound in farm output will
probably add at least this much to GDP in the final quarter of this year and
in the first period of 1994.
Confidence in the economy's underlying health has been bolstered by the
largest upward revisions to past growth rates in 20 years. Last month, the
Commerce Department announced benchmark revisions which showed that the
1990-91 recession was shallower, and the subsequent recovery stronger, than
previously estimated.
The peak-to-trough decline in GDP was only 1.6 per cent, not 2.2 per cent.
Since the recovery began in the spring of 1991, GDP growth has averaged
nearly 2.5 per cent, rather than the 2 per cent previously reported.
The scale of revisions was huge. The estimate for GDP in the second quarter
released in August, for example, was 1.6 per cent higher than the estimate
published in July. Thus, although growth was lower than expected in the
first half, the level of national income was actually higher.
The recent slowdown has to be seen as a reaction to unsustainably rapid
growth in the second half of last year (when GDP grew at an annual rate of
4.6 per cent), which in turn reflected the bringing forward of bonus
payments to avoid the expected increase in personal taxes in President
Clinton's first budget. Over the last four quarters, growth has averaged
just under 3 per cent.
The composition of growth is encouraging. In the year to the second quarter,
the volume of gross private investment grew by 8.8 per cent, far outpacing a
3.4 per cent increase in real consumer spending. The capital formation,
moreover, was concentrated in productive business rather than residential
housing, which expanded only modestly.
Led by a surge of investment in computing equipment, business spending on
durable equipment rose 14.6 per cent in real terms. Government spending, by
contrast, was flat, reflecting the fiscal inhibitions imposed by a decade of
record budget deficits.
The popular notion that the US is experiencing a 'jobless recovery' is
hardly supported by the data. The unemployment rate has fallen more than a
percentage point to 6.7 per cent in the past year. Weekly claims for
unemployment insurance fell to 316,000 at the beginning of September, the
lowest level in four years and far below the peak of over 500,000 reached
during the recession.
Employment figures confirm this picture of a steadily improving labour
market. Since its trough in February last year, non-farm payroll employment
has risen by 2.2m to 110.3m, comfortably surpassing the previous peak in
1990. What the overall trend masks, however, is variations between sectors.
Service sector employment (especially in healthcare) has risen
substantially, but manufacturers have steadily eliminated jobs: at 17.7m,
the current level of manufacturing employment is nearly 10 per cent below
its pre-recession peak.
But this is more a reflection of efficiency gains in US factories than of a
broader malaise in US manufacturing: productivity has risen by more than 5
per cent in the past year, and the length of the average workweek is at its
highest level in 25 years.
The forecast of steady US economic growth is not without risks. Some
analysts believe US share prices have risen too fast and could tumble,
undermining consumer and business confidence. The weakness of foreign trade
continues to sap the economy's domestic vitality: but for a rising trade
deficit, the US would have grown by 3.6 per cent in the year to the second
quarter, rather than the 2.9 per cent actually record. But, two years into
the recovery, the best guess is that the business cycle's natural momentum
will keep the economy rolling forward.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (19): The ground
feels more stable - Germany / The economy's high-cost base is under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WORST of the German recession may be past, but no one is cheering. After
four consecutive quarters of nil or negative growth, gross domestic product
in the west showed a 0.5 per cent increase in the second quarter of this
year, compared with the first three months.
However, aggregate output was still 2 per cent below year-earlier figures,
and industry especially reported that there was a long way to go before the
peaks registered in 1991 and early 1992 could be matched. On a wider front,
the economy is emerging from the trough with its key structural problems
unresolved. Inflation, at an annual 4.2 per cent rate, is virtually the same
as when the recession hit. In the east, chronic unemployment remains to be
tackled.
No one expects either a rapid recovery or a speedy solution, but there is
growing confidence that at least the ground underfoot is stabilising,
allowing long-standing problems to be tackled in a calmer atmosphere.
'We are in neither a dramatic nor a traumatic situation. . . We are in a
difficult recession which came very quickly and went very deep,' according
to Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche Bank.
Apart from GDP figures, there is ample evidence that the tide has turned.
The west German business confidence index of the respected Ifo economics
institute in Munich has been climbing, with some hesitation, since January.
In the east, meanwhile, little has changed. Most industrial companies are
running losses, while services, skilled trades and construction are
expanding, as they have since unification in October 1990. But they are
still growing mainly on the back of demand from the public sector, funded
mostly by transfers from the west, estimated this year at DM170bn. Total GDP
in the east is expected to grow 6.5 per cent this year and 6 per cent next,
although, as Ifo points out: 'This cannot be called a self-sustained
upswing.'
Such optimism as can be found for the immediate future of the overall German
economy stems from general perceptions rather than hard and fast trends.
Conditions in export markets are not at their best, but at least they are no
longer deteriorating, says a recent report from Paribas Capital Markets, for
example. It also notes that despite fears of a rapid appreciation of the
D-Mark - and damage to German products' international competitiveness - as a
consequence of the effective suspension of the European exchange rate
mechanism, the German currency, on a trade-weighted basis, is no stronger
now than it was six months ago.
Ifo, on the other hand, says there is cause for concern in the fact that
improvements in foreign demand are not coming from Germany's traditional
west European markets, but from hitherto neglected niche areas such as
south-east Asia where trade relationships are less stable. This, coupled
with expected average economic growth of 1 per cent next year in Germany's
nearby trading partners - compared with a forecast 5 per cent expansion in
world trade - suggests a less telling contribution to export-led recovery
from recession than in past downturns, the institute says.
The return to normal is also expected to be slowed by falling private demand
within Germany. After dropping by an estimated 1 per cent this year, the
trend is expected to continue into 1994.
Although the new year's wage round has yet to start, there is an air of
resignation about early suggestions from leading trade unions, which say
they are prepared to accept pay rises for the new year equal to inflation
plus productivity gains. Civil servants, meanwhile, can expect no increase -
equivalent to a real 3 per cent decline.
Whatever the outcome of free-market pay negotiations, consumers' pockets are
likely to be severely squeezed by the federal government's budget
consolidation programme. The budget will reduce disposable incomes by DM40bn
next year alone. Ifo suggests average disposable incomes will fall by a real
2 per cent as inflation of 3 per cent sweeps away nominal gains of just 1
per cent.
The government's consolidation measures represent one side of a concerted
effort to attack Germany's high-costs base, which is widely acknowledged as
the overall economy's main and most debilitating weakness. Industry, too,
has set about the job of cutting costs with an unaccustomed vigour. In the
12 months to the end of June this year, manufacturing shed 7 per cent of its
total workforce, and there is no sign of the trend relaxing, least of all in
the automotive and engineering sectors, the country's main export
industries.
The need for further savings was underlined in the government's
second-quarter GDP report, which showed overall productivity still falling
and unit labour costs still rising.
Industry's attack on its inflated costs base is as bold as it is wide. Just
as the government is chipping away at the welfare state, companies are also
slicing into time-honoured employee benefits. That Daimler-Benz should risk
confrontation with its unions over cuts in perks such as Christmas bonuses,
spa cures and first-communion clothes for employees' children, demonstrates
the intensity of the search for economies.
But the main target is the workforce. More jobs have been lost in western
industry since mid-1991 than were created in the post-unification period.
Unemployment will continue to rise next year as the search for higher
productivity continues. Even though GDP is expected to grow by 0.5 per cent,
the proportion of the workforce unemployed is widely forecast to hit new
records, above the 8 per cent peak recorded in 1985. Little improvement is
expected in the east, where the rate is expected to continue hovering just
under 16 per cent.
Longer term, worse is to be expected if industry fails to press ahead with
the process now under way, and current pay and conditions agreements in the
east remain unchanged. A projection from Goldman Sachs suggests no relief
from high unemployment in the west for the next three years, while the rate
in the east charges upwards to peak in 1996 at a staggering 37 per cent.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (17): An
intellectual goad at the US Treasury - Profile, Lawrence Summers / The World
Bank is coming under strong pressure from one of its former employees to
reform itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN administration which seeks to make economics an essential component of
its foreign policy, Mr Lawrence Summers has found a central role as
undersecretary for international affairs at the US Treasury.
A talented academic economist with a broad list of publications on
everything from tax policy to women's education, Mr Summers has seemed to be
waiting for a Democratic president to come along so that he could enter
government.
Although he worked for former president Ronald Reagan's chief economist, Mr
Martin Feldstein, he was also the principal economic adviser to the
unsuccessful presidential campaign of Mr Michael Dukakis in 1988, before
taking leave of absence from his Harvard University professorship to serve
as chief economist of the World Bank.
In his third floor office overlooking the east wing of the White House,
immaculately restored to its 19th century splendour during the Bush
administration, Mr Summers has come back to haunt his former employers at
the World Bank.
One of the tasks assigned to him at the Treasury is goading the
international financial institutions into reform designed to make them more
effective instruments of development.
The issue has been a popular subject in the US Congress. Spurred on by tales
of excess at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, members
have regularly summoned the Treasury to explain why the US should contribute
more money to these institutions.
Senator Jesse Helms has pursued his quest to cut down on first class air
travel at the International Monetary Fund, while Mr Barney Frank, chairman
of the House of Representatives sub-committee in charge of international
financial issues, has harassed the World Bank into improvements in its
disclosure policy and appeals processes.
Mr Summers has urged the World Bank to sharpen its focus on poverty relief
and on the effective implementation of projects, not sparing it criticism -
to the point that some of his former colleagues have accused him of playing
to the congressional gallery.
Such criticisms go down well with the vocal US environmentalist community -
usually hostile to the World Bank - which retains, nevertheless, an abiding
suspicion of Mr Summers.
But Mr Summers's principal role is in the co-ordination of economic policy
with the other members of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
The US's ability to lecture its partners with good grace has been modestly
improved by President Bill Clinton's efforts to pass a budget that would at
least slow the growth of the federal budget deficit. G7 finance ministry
officials have, perhaps, been more appreciative of these efforts than Mr
Clinton's domestic audience.
But the administration's handling of its economic relationship with Japan
has at times been less than masterly. Mr Summers's carefully drafted
declarations that the US is not seeking to talk up the yen have become
almost routine.
The financial markets have taken the opposite view, as a string of Mr
Summers's colleagues in the Treasury as well as in other departments has
spoken yearningly of how helpful a stronger yen might be in redressing the
US trade deficit with Japan.
And some Japanese officials complain that there is little difference between
Mr Summers's lectures on the need for fiscal expansion and those of his
predecessor in the Bush administration, Mr David Mulford.
Mr Summers has also expanded his job to include a broader articulation of US
trade policy, where his predecessors at Treasury tended to limit themselves
in this field to trade in financial services.
The G7 finance ministers often make earnest declarations at their regular
meetings about the need for swift movement on trade liberalisation talks,
but their colleagues responsible for these negotiations do not attend the G7
meetings.
That seems unlikely to change, but Mr Summers is seen as a prominent voice
in the creation of an intellectual framework for the Clinton trade policy '
a policy that has at times appeared to foreign partners to pull in different
directions: committed to multilateral trade negotiations but at the same
time aggressively pursuing bilateral trade measures.
But the administration argues that the two approaches are not incompatible:
that tough enforcement of trade laws and international agreements is not
just necessary to placate domestic opinion, but actually helpful to the
pursuit of a new and more liberal Gatt.
In particular, US officials distinguish efforts to gain access to markets
they regard as unfairly closed to US goods and services, notably in Japan,
from efforts to close US markets to imports.
The burdens of office have compelled Mr Summers to adopt a less provocative
approach to economic argument than was his wont. He has kept, however, his
intellectual agility, and is picked by many in Washington as a rising star
in the Clinton administration.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (16): When crystal
balls cloud over - International forecasting / Stephanie Flanders examines
the accuracy of economic predictions and finds that although accuracy has
improved, the record since 1991 is patchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a fact of life for international macroeconomists that one of their
least successful product lines is the one which interests the customer most:
economic forecasts.
Non-economists generally judge the profession to be worse than useless at
predicting what economies will do next. They often go on to ask: what on
earth is the point of analysing the world economy if not to help us to do
just that?
As it turns out, the most prestigious international economic forecasts are
generally a good deal better than nothing, and improving over time. In any
given year, however, they are indeed likely to be wrong, and to that extent
the popular perception is warranted. Some of the errors are avoidable, but
given the number that are not, the organisations concerned might do well to
downgrade the importance of forecasts altogether.
Of all economic predictions, those of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development and International Monetary Fund are undoubtedly
the most influential. Both institutions have an unparalleled access to the
workings of a large proportion of the global economy. As a result, their
considered judgment on the future path of output and inflation carry the
force of first-hand experience. Not to mention, at least where the combined
international forecasts are concerned, the advantage of having something of
a monopoly.
The OECD assessed the accuracy of its economic predictions for the seven big
industrialised economies in the June issue of its Economic Outlook, and
compared the OECD's record with that of the IMF. The authors of the study
concluded that since 1971, the OECD's forecasts have, on average, been more
accurate than 'a random-walk projection' - simply assuming that inflation
and economic growth next year will be exactly the same as this year.
Moreover, the accuracy has generally improved over time: from an average
error of - 0.5 per cent for year-ahead growth forecasts 1971-82 to 0.3 per
cent 1983-91. The IMF's forecasts began rather better, and are made earlier
in the year, but show a similar pattern of improvement.
Nevertheless, their recent record is still patchy. Projections may now be,
on average, more accurate. But in 1991, for example, both the OECD and the
IMF were further off in their predictions for economic growth than they had
been since 1982. The OECD predicted 2 per cent real GDP growth for the seven
biggest economies in 1991, while the IMF plumped for 2.4 per cent. But
actual growth turned out to be only 0.7 per cent.
So what went wrong? Both organisations claim that the mistakes of 1991 were
only a particular example of a common forecaster's elephant trap: predicting
turning points in the economic cycle. As the OECD's recent article
explained, there are two reasons why large errors occur.
First, the forecasters may not have been using all the information available
to them at the time, something which could presumably be avoided in future.
But a second explanation could be that, in the OECD's words, 'all
information is used, but its predictive power declines sharply close to
cyclical turning points'.
A plausible reason why economic data becomes less useful at these critical
moments could relate to delays in gathering statistics. National economic
data is usually several months behind reality, and it is reasonable to
believe that the lead time becomes more crucial if the real economy is just
beginning to turn itself around.
Unfortunately, the record since 1991 has not been much better. Real GNP
growth of the seven countries in 1992 was 1.6 per cent, 0.6 percentage
points less than either the OECD or the IMF had predicted the preceding
year. And in recent publications, both organisations have been forced yet
again to lower their predictions for 1993. Repeated over-estimates such as
these would seem to indicate a second - more fundamental - problem is
involved: namely a turning point, not merely in the economic variables
themselves, but in the long term relationship between them.
A change in underlying economic relations is much more serious for
forecasting models, all of which rely on the assumption that past
statistical links are stable enough to be a guide to the future. It may be,
as the IMF suggested in its April 1992 World Economic Outlook, that economic
forecasts did better in the 1980s, not just because economic modelling
became more sophisticated, but in large part because the world economy
itself followed a simpler and more stable path during the 1980s than it had
in the turbulent 1970s. If this is the case, then the ability of IMF, OECD
and other forecasting bodies to overcome their recent setbacks could rely
more on the behaviour of the world economy than on the depth and
sophistication of their models of it.
The OECD and the IMF are at pains to explain this in their economic reports.
In June, for example, the OECD described the past and future uncertainties
which have recently hung over their world output projections. Broadly
speaking, the unpleasant surprise for the OECD's forecasters was the private
sector behaviour in many of the member states. Personal and corporate
balance sheet adjustment has continued far longer than most thought
possible. The biggest question marks hanging over the current forecasts, the
OECD argued, related more to public sector agents: above all, on when and
how a number of governments felt able to tackle the state of their own
balance sheets.
In the face of such imponderables, some say that the detailed health
warnings attached to current forecasts, and regular post-mortems of past
mistakes, only serve to bring home the futility of the exercise. Ultimately,
argue the critics, the current method of forecasting will never quite be a
match for the complex and unpredictable workings of the world economy. As a
result, both producers and users of forecasts should have a fresher, more
realistic approach to them.
To respond fully to these arguments, the OECD and the IMF would have to
extend their current practice of providing forecasts under a number of
alternative scenarios, to the point of refusing to offer any 'bottom line'
forecast for economic growth and inflation. But their readers would also
have to stop asking for one: something which they show very little sign of
doing.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (15): Malaise
follows a golden age - The Group of Seven / Why the doubts and uncertainties
surrounding the Tokyo meeting were in marked contrast to mood of the mid to
late 1980s
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THEY are the most exclusive club in the world.
But the Group of Seven - comprising the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada - is riven by self doubt.
The recent Tokyo world economic summit - the 19th year such annual meeting -
highlighted the G7 malaise. To the untutored eye, the fact that the leaders
of the most powerful industrialised democracies were prepared to take three
days out of their schedules to discuss problems of mutual concern seemed a
sign that international policy co-operation was in good fettle.
But even before the talks began it was clear that not all the G7 heads of
government relished the prospect. And the Tokyo summiteers, spurred on by Mr
John Major, the UK prime minister, spent part of their time working out how
to make future occasions less unwieldy.
The doubts and uncertainties surrounding the Tokyo meeting were in marked
contrast to mood of the mid to late 1980s. That was the golden age of the
G7, when some observers predicted that the group would grow into a
directorate for managing the world economy.
In high profile agreements such as the February 1987 Louvre Accord, G7
finance ministers aspired to control the world's most important exchange
rates with the aim of promoting trade and furthering prosperity. As the
1980s progressed, the leaders met yearly in conditions of escalating pomp
and grandeur to celebrate strong economic growth, falling unemployment and
the spread of free market ideals.
True, there were some discordant events such as the global stock market
crash of October 1987, while some cassandras began to grow alarmed at the
growth of public and private sector debt in the big Anglo-Saxon economies.
But these worries were not allowed to interfere with the perception that the
1980s, culminating as they did in the fall of the Berlin Wall and the
collapse of communism, were a living testimony to the west's economic and
political success.
The subsequent spread of recession from the US, Britain, and Canada to
continental Europe and Japan was slow to dent such optimism. Last year's G7
annual economic summit in Munich grossly exaggerrated the ability of the
industrial world to resume growth and create jobs and failed completely to
anticipate the past year's upheavals on world financial markets.
So it was a sadder group of leaders, many of whom were preoccupied with
domestic difficulties, that met in Tokyo's Akasaka Palace in July. All faced
political problems and poor opinion poll ratings at home. One G7 leader, Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, had lost a general election
shortly before the summit and was soon to lose his job.
But recent setbacks do not mean that the G7 is finished. The increasingly
interdependent world economy is a powerful reason for maintaining a forum in
which leaders and finance ministers can meet and get to know each other.
At ministerial level, the G7 is still capable of action. The finance
ministers, together with foreign ministers from the group and
representatives of the European Community, hammered out a package of
measures to assist Russia in April of this year.
True, the support was criticised by many as small compared with the huge
economic problems faced by Russia and other members of the former Soviet
Union and eastern bloc countries. But it was followed at Tokyo by agreement
to mobilise more funds and technical assistance to aid privatisation in
Russia. Over the past year, arrangements have also been made under G7
auspices for a nuclear safety programme to deal with the hazards in
Chernobyl-style nuclear reactors in former communist states.
Although the G7 finance ministers have long since abandoned any idea of
closely co-ordinating economic policies, their meetings, usually three times
a year, provide a valuable occasion on which to swap notes and experiences.
Since taking over as US Treasury Secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen has been keen
to encourage the G7 finance ministers' meetings. Participants report that
the atmosphere has improved and that the discussions are less quarrelsome
than before.
At least once a year, the G7 finance ministers carry out 'mutual
surveillance' of each economy's performance. This economic 'weight watchers'
club' can, through peer group pressure, act to prevent one or several G7
members adopting policies that threaten overall economic prosperity.
The G7 can also promote ideas. The finance ministers' last meeting in
Washington in April focused on long term structural problems such as health
care costs, education and training and the ageing of populations. The
discussions are thought to have helped Mr Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance
minister, win the argument in Germany for later moves to limit sickness
payments and open a debate in Germany about making its labour market more
flexible.
Viewed over the long term, there is little doubt that the G7 meetings since
the early 1970s have helped prevent the world falling prey to protectionism.
But the G7 nations have failed to build on this achievement sufficiently to
secure agreement among themselves on the ambitious trade liberalisation
package which is being negotiated under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the Uruguay Round.
G7 leaders have called for a successful conclusion to the round in
successive annual summit meetings since the end of the 1980s. Their words
have been repeated in the many communiques issued by their finance
ministers.
Yet in spite of all the huffing and puffing, G7 trade negotiators and farm
ministers have been unable to stitch up agreement. It remains to be seen
whether more than seven years of negotiations can be completed by the most
recent deadline of mid-December this year.
The G7 summit in Tokyo, like the preceding summits in Munich, London and
Houston, ended with a ringing declaration on the need for a successful
completion of the trade talks. It is the group's 'highest priority', the
Tokyo communique said.
The statement was rather more credible than past G7 utterances on trade
because talks among the so-called quad countries (the US, Japan, the EC and
Canada) immediately ahead the summit had produced an agreement to reduce or
eliminate tariffs on a wide range of manufactured products.
Difficult detailed trade discussions lie ahead. What is certain, however, is
that the future of the G7 has become linked to that of the Uruguay Round. A
failure to conclude the Gatt talks could deal a mortal blow to the
credibility of the G7 after its leaders have so often pledged to liberalise
world trade.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (14): Hair-raising
rides - International financial institutions / The IMF and the World Bank,
facing new challenges in the former Soviet Union, have had to make cultural
leaps

<TEXT>
FOR TWO old ladies approaching their 50th anniversary, the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund have had a hair-raising ride over recent
months.
Dealing with new members in the former Soviet Union seeking to make the
transition from central planning to the market economy has posed a challenge
different both in type and in size from the kinds of problems the two
Washington-based institutions have been accustomed to.
At the same time, the rich industrialised countries have all, to varying
degrees, been going through periods of fiscal penury which in the richest of
them, the US, has been acute and lasting. As a result, they have looked
increasingly to the IMF and the World Bank to handle the financing questions
raised by Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
In their different ways, both institutions have made cultural leaps to
adjust to the problem.
For the IMF, the adjustment took the form of the Systemic Transformation
Facility (STF), a temporary loan fund designed to help countries with the
balance of payments difficulties arising from their move to trade at market
prices, enabling them to bridge the gap until they could get their economies
in shape to qualify for funding from a normal IMF standby facility.
Although IMF officials insist that the STF is conditional on a coherent
economic adjustment strategy, and deny that they were simply responding to
pressure from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, it is clear
that G7 officials had been urging the Fund to loosen its conditionality in
order to help Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
'This is not a situation where aid can be delayed until every 'i' is dotted
and every 't' is crossed,' a US Treasury official said earlier this year in
discussing the STF.
For the World Bank, the answer to easing Russia and its neighbouring
republics into the market economy came in the form of the rehabilitation
loan, a Dollars 600m facility designed basically to secure needed imports.
A second Dollars 1.5bn drawing on the IMF's STF is under negotiation, as is
a second rehabilitation loan from the World Bank. Russia's relations with
both institutions, however, have been strained since the Russian central
bank's controversial move in July to cancel all pre-1993 roubles.
In many ways, the rehabilitation loan represents the same sort of leap for
the World Bank as the STF does for the IMF - profound cultural changes in
institutions that are often accused of being culturally hermetic.
In both cases, the institution has had to loosen or alter some of its
traditional lending principles, and runs the risk of criticism from other
customer countries in the developing world that it is giving preferential
treatment to Russia.
Such criticism has, in fact, been curiously muted. In the World Bank's case,
this is at least partly because Russia does not compete for the concessional
funds of the International Development Association, although some of the
poorer republics, along with Balkan countries such as Albania and Macedonia,
may qualify for IDA soft loans.
In addition, the World Bank's finances are strong enough - in spite of
having to make a Dollars 610m loan loss provision last year, mainly to cover
its exposure in Yugoslavia - that it can absorb some additional risk in its
lending to Russia without cutting back on loans elsewhere.
In the case of the IMF, however, some developing countries are starting to
worry that the increased concentration on Russia could hinder the renewal of
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, a concessional loan fund for
poorer countries, when it expires later this year.
But the IMF escapes the public criticism that awaits its sister institution,
largely because it does not lend for individual projects and so does not
attract the attention of the vocal environmentalist groups who closely
monitor the World Bank's lending for dams and power stations in the
developing world.
Both institutions remain gloriously lacking in cost consciousness, but the
World Bank has at least cracked down on first class air travel, while IMF
staffers complain bitterly that they are now allowed only the cheapest first
class fare on any route - usually obliging them to fly with the national
airline of the country with which they are negotiating - and can no longer
keep the frequent flyer miles they accumulate for their personal use.
The World Bank, meanwhile, has this year undertaken a sincere if still much
criticised effort to improve its effectiveness and increase its
transparency.
Responding in part to prodding from the US Congress, the Bank has agreed new
standards for disclosing its documents to the public and for setting up a
form of appeals process.
At the same time, it has taken a set of initiatives in response to an
internal report showing an alarming decline in the quality of its loan
portfolio; these measures, it is hoped, will shift the culture of the Bank
away from one which rewards managers for generating loan volume and towards
a greater emphasis on following projects through to their completion.
'Central to the plan is the commitment to make the management of projects
under implementation as important as making new loans. Only sound, on the
ground results - the development impact of projects - are true measures of
the bank's contribution to sustainable development,' said Mr Ernest Stern,
one of the World Bank's managing directors.
Outsiders can detect little of such self-scrutiny at the IMF, even though
the organisation has at times seemed to be in search of a role since the
debt crisis faded.
But perhaps the greatest self-scrutiny should be exercised by the richer
shareholders of the IMF and the World Bank, who have increasingly shirked
their own share of the burden of handling the world's economic problems in
countries such as Russia and its fellow republics in the former Soviet
Union.
The demand for the IMF and the World Bank to take up the slack seems likely
to grow for many years to come, in areas such as Vietnam, Palestine and
South Africa.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (13): Fortress
mentality is a fiction - Regional blocks / Economists are right to be
concerned, but they are worrying about the wrong threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL

<TEXT>
ONE OF the mightier fictions of the 1990s has been that the world is
dividing into trade blocks.
Proponents point to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which looks
likely to come into being at the end of 1994, and the supposed emergence of
a 'yen block' focused on the Japanese economy, to underpin their claim.
They point to the parlous state of Uruguay round negotiations aimed at
multilateral liberalisation of world trade, and argue that if the talks
fail, or reach 'second-best' solutions to problems in international trade,
then leaders will seek regional deals instead.
The warning is that trade barriers would then be raised between 'Fortress
Europe', 'Fortress North America' and 'Fortress Asia', forcing companies to
retreat behind the fortress walls. The risk of trade conflict between
regions would then be high, with many of the gains of trade liberalisation
over the past 40 years in jeopardy.
But the facts do not support so neat and dramatic a trend. Asking
specifically whether trade blocks were emerging in Europe, North America,
and East Asia, Mr Jeff Schott, at Washington's Institute for International
Economics, comments: 'The short answer is: yes, maybe, and no.
'A European trade block is clearly in existence, and developing further; a
North American block is evolving, although with a distinct outward
orientation; and an East Asian block remains a remote prospect.'
The world's only true trade bloc at present is the European Community.
Internal trade for member states accounts on average for two thirds of total
trade. Countries such as Ireland and Portugal rely on the EC market for
almost three quarters of total trade. The EC's tentacles reach into the Efta
countries on its borders, and have begun to move into east and central
Europe.
Mr Schott identifies four basic characteristics for a trade block: similar
levels of per capita gross national product, geographic proximity, similar
or compatible trading regimes, and political commitment to regional
organisation. The EC alone appears to match all four of these.
The EC also illustrates the best and the worst aspects of trade blocks,
which are allowed under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on condition
that they result in removal of barriers to substantially all trade within
the block, and as long as they do not result in barriers being raised to
third countries.
As the creation of the single European market in January this year
illustrates, the EC has moved far in removal of barriers to trade among
member states. But its trade with third countries is riddled with the worst
kinds of discrimination. As Martin Wolf, a former leading trade economist
and now a colleague on the Financial Times, wrote in a recent paper: 'Only
in discrimination can the EC claim to be a world leader. It is not only
itself a huge trading block: it spreads discrimination worldwide. It finds
trade tolerable, except where its producers find imports uncomfortably
cheap.'
He notes how in 1991, 40 per cent of all EC imports entered the market under
preferential arrangements: 22.4 per cent under agreements with Efta
countries; 7.1 per cent on preferences given to Mediterranean countries; 3.9
per cent under the Lome convention with developing countries mainly the
Pacific and the Caribbean, and 6.2 per cent under general system of
preferences (GSP) agreements.
In net terms, this means that four fifths of cross-border commerce for EC
member states is either subject to single market rules, or to preferential
import arrangements.
At the very least, therefore, the EC's growth has had a trade diverting
effect: many companies that might otherwise have exported to Europe have
invested locally, and have chosen to supply the EC market from within.
There is also evidence that consumers in the EC, and companies sourcing
components from within the EC, have paid a high price for the creation of
'Fortress Europe', and the discrimination embodied in Brussels' policies.
Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), pointed out in a recent study that transfers to EC
farmers under the common agriculture policy cost consumers about Dollars
156bn - or Dollars 450 a year for every man, woman and child in the
community.
'It is high time that governments made clear to consumers just how much they
pay - in the shops and as tax payers - for decisions to protect domestic
industries from import competition,' Mr Sutherland commented.
These high costs have damaged the export competitiveness of European
manufacturers, forcing on them a vicious circle in which they have no option
but to seek protection in their domestic markets against imports from
less-encumbered manufacturers in Asia and the US.
It was such a vicious circle that eventually brought the trade block of all
trade blocks - Comecon - to its knees.
The US has nevertheless begun to flirt seriously with the idea, partly out
of pique over the glacial progress of the Uruguay round negotiations. First,
its free trade agreement with Canada in 1989, and now its plans to create a
North American Free Trade Agreement embracing Mexico, provide the fruits of
that flirtation.
In certain respects, Nafta is no more than a description of economic
reality: the US provides the end market for three quarters of all exports
from Canada and Mexico. It is not ambitious as the EC has been in trying to
create a single integrated market. But at the same time, it seems unlikely
to discriminate so powerfully against outside markets: the US relies on
outside markets for almost 75 per cent of its exports. It is also home to
the majority of the world's globally integrated companies, none of which
would welcome fresh barriers to its intra-company trade.
All three countries maintain large trade deficits with the rest of the
world, and thus need to improve exports to outside markets if they are to
reduce the imbalance. This could not be done by withdrawing inside a
Fortress North America.
Mexico has sought membership of Nafta as a means of cementing a wide range
of policies aimed at economic liberalisation, and has no desire to see the
Nafta rules reverse these.
Neither Canada nor Mexico have any desire to have their economies any
further dominated by the US. They continue to call for a strong and
rule-based multinational trading system - in short a strong Gatt, and a
successful Uruguay round outcome - if they are to achieve any sort of
equilibrium in their relations with the US.
As Mr Schott notes in a recent book on the Nafta: 'The trade effects of the
Nafta on third countries depend on the extent of liberalisation achieved in
the Nafta itself, and on trade reforms negotiated in the Uruguay round . . .
Trade diversion is likely to be greatest if the Nafta reforms proceed in the
absence of a successful Gatt round.'
If Uruguay round negotiations do indeed flounder in this critical final
quarter of 1993, then the US is likely to explore carefully the prospects
for cementing closer economic relations across the Pacific region. A
ministerial meeting in Seattle in October of the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation grouping is likely to assume great importance.
In the recent past the Apec group has come to be seen by some economists as
an Asian trade block in embryo. They see strong flows of Japanese investment
across Asia, and rising levels of intra-regional trade, as evidence
supporting their view.
It is nevertheless mistaken. Japanese investment across parts of east Asia
has indeed been strong, at least up to the recent bursting of the 'bubble
economy'. But Japanese investment flows to the US, and to Europe have been
equally strong. According to Mr Gorota Kume, secretary-general of the Japan
Institute for Overseas Investment, Japanese foreign investment rose sixfold
between 1985 and 1989, peaking at Dollars 67.5bn in 1989. But less than 15
per cent of this went to Asia.
Looking at individual east Asian countries, Malaysia attracted 25 per cent
of its inward investment from Japan between 1988 and 1990, according to the
UN's World Investment Report. But other countries in the east Asia region
accounted for 42 per cent, while investment from North America or Europe
accounted for 33 per cent.
In Thailand and Korea, Japan accounted for 45 per cent and 49 per cent of
investment respectively, but in Singapore it accounted for just 35 per cent,
in Indonesia 18 per cent, and in China a mere 12 per cent.
Intra-regional trade has grown strongly - from 19 per cent of total trade in
1970, to almost 30 per cent today. But this growth says more about
increasing wealth in the region, and its growing importance as an end market
for consumer goods than it does about any tendency towards a trade block.
Preconditions for a trade block barely exist: markets are geographically far
apart; they range from poor, to extremely prosperous; they maintain
divergent trade regimes; and they have shown no powerful political
commitment to economic integration.
They have direct experience of the gains to be reaped from maintaining
liberal trading regimes. As Mr Wolf notes: 'As the world's most successful
economies, those of east Asia are unlikely to follow the path of
discrimination soon.'
If in the wake of a collapse in Uruguay round negotiations the US recoils,
and turns to the Asia-Pacific region, the consequence is unlikely to be a
fragmentation of the world into three blocks. Rather, it could result in two
 -the greater European region, focused on the EC and looking inward; and the
rest of the world, increasingly interdependent and looking outward. The
threat is thus not of the emergence of trade blocks, but of European
withdrawal from international trade, and the consequent erosion of the
Gatt's multilateral trade rules. Economists are right to be concerned, but
they are worrying about the wrong threat.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (12): The eleventh
hour has arrived - Trade / It remains unclear whether the Uruguay Round can
be concluded by December 15, when the US administration's negotiating
authority expires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PETER Sutherland, the newly appointed director-general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), has no doubts about the urgency of
concluding the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
'We can't allow the process to drift aimlessly. We simply don't have the
time,' he said. 'If we are to succeed in December, the eleventh hour is
now.'
That was in July.
Since then, he has set a series of tight deadlines, intended to galvanise
progress; he has lobbied shamelessly in support of trade liberalisation; he
has ear-bashed leaders directly - ranging from President Bill Clinton, to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and France's prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur.
Yet it remains unclear whether the 116-nation round, which is already three
years overdue, can be concluded by December 15, when the US administration's
negotiating authority expires.
There is very little doubt that the price of failure will be high. It would
frustrate the ability of leaders of the industrial world to revive the
global economy from its current dogged recession.
The danger is great that countries may retreat into conflict-creating
regional trade blocks; equally, an outburst of trade disputes would be in
prospect, ranging from steel and farm trade to pharmaceuticals and
procurement.
The scores of governments in the developing world that have committed
considerable political capital to rapid economic liberalisation will be in
danger. At the very least, their plans for further market opening would be
in jeopardy.
But perhaps most important of all, consumers will continue to carry the
heavy - and rising - costs of protection. A recent study by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development calculated that protectionism in
agriculture alone cost consumers Dollars 450 a head in the European
Community, Dollars 360 a head in the US, and Dollars 600 a head in Japan.
In a hard-hitting Gatt study, subtitled The sting - How governments buy
votes on trade with the consumer's money, Mr Sutherland recently commented:
'It is high time that governments made clear to consumers just how much they
pay - in the shops and as taxpayers - for decisions to protect domestic
industries from import competition.
'If governments were to announce that they were deliberately keeping prices
high, there would be a public outcry - but that, in effect, is what they are
doing by failing to conclude the Uruguay Round.'
By the end of this month it will be clear whether there is any realistic
chance of Mr Sutherland's tough timetable being met. The deadline for
agreeing the text of a services agreement passed on September 20. The
deadline for agreeing tariff cuts in manufactures and farm products, and
opening markets to trade in services, falls in one week's time.
The results of this week's critical 'jumbo' meeting of EC farm and foreign
ministers, addressing French demands to re-open negotiations with the US on
liberalisation of farm trade, will have been properly digested. Re-opening
the talks would almost certainly derail hopes of any farm trade agreement
this year, and so would at the same time effectively derail the Uruguay
round.
A 'substantive stock-taking meeting' is planned in Geneva for October 15,
and will be a moment of truth for those who hoped the breakthrough in Tokyo
in July, where leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries agreed a
deal to reduce or eliminate tariffs on 18 categories of goods, would provide
a springboard for successful completion of the Uruguay Round.
Numerous difficult obstacles to agreement remain. Critical issues, such as
market opening for farm products, or tariff cuts across the thousands of
categories of traded textiles and garments, face ferocious opposition from
powerful lobbies in the EC and the US.
In farm trade, farm exporters from Cairns group countries such as Australia,
Argentina and Thailand are adamant that the EC in particular must make a
significant market access offer. They insist that, if they are to open their
markets further to manufactured exports from the US or the EC, then greater
opportunities to sell farm products to Europe must be made available.
Mr Jesus Seade, the former Mexican Gatt ambassador, talked of textiles as a
'highly unstable dossier'. Many developing countries - prominently India -
need better export opportunities to the US and the EC if they are to bow to
pressure to open their markets to services, and tighten enforcement of
intellectual property protection.
At the same time, many developing countries have been alarmed by western
demands that they make market opening offers comparable to those made by the
G7 countries in Tokyo. They insist that the 'special and differential
treatment' granted to poor countries under the Gatt should be protected.
This asserts the right of countries to make commitments that match their
financial and economic capacities.
the Gatt proposal for 'tariffication without exception': the demand that
importers remove all non-tariff barriers, and replace them with tariffs
which are more transparent, and more easily reduced over time. It is a
demand particularly precious to farm exporters, but has been resisted
fiercely by countries such as Japan and South Korea, which block all imports
of rice on food security grounds, and Canada, which has for decades
maintained a supply management system in dairy products which limits
imports.
Perhaps the last issue to be resolved will be that of proposed amendments to
the draft final act, tabled at the end of 1991. This draft may not be carved
in stone, but most countries insist that the minimum of changes should be
allowed, for fear that the entire balanced package of commitments embodied
by it will crumble.
Washington caused consternation late last year by calling for extensive
changes, linked with concern to protect its sovereign discretion to apply
unilateral trade sanctions where it deemed them necessary.
Perhaps it was fitting, therefore, that Mr Sutherland challenged this issue
head-on during a recent visit to Washington, and warned: 'Any conclusion in
this round requires everybody to take into account that they're not the only
people in the world.'
As EC officials, and the young and uncertain administrations of Mr Clinton
in Washington, and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo, feel the heat generated by
lobbyists who argue just the opposite, they will face a test of
statesmanship that predecessors have failed for the past three years.

services it is important to keep in mind the generally lower quality of
the services data. While improvements in the coverage of the services
data since the early 1980s have reduced the significant downward bias
of the services data, they have also imparted an upward bias to
estimates of growth rates since the previous year's figures generally
have not been revised to reflect the expanded coverage. The shares in
this table were calculated using only data for countries that reported
commercial services trade to the IMF on a balance of payments basis

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (13): Market
upswing sparks a revival - The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US venture capital industry, which enjoyed a feast of funds in the
1980s, followed by a famine in the early 1990s, is now enjoying growth once
more.
During 1992, US venture capital funds raised Dollars 2.54bn, double the
Dollars 1.27bn of 1991, which represented a 10-year low for the industry,
according to figures from Venture Economics, a New Jersey based statistical
service. And in the first six months of this year funds raised totalled
Dollars 1.29bn.
Disbursement of funds to US entrepreneurial companies, which usually follow
a roughly similar pattern to the amount of money raised, totalled Dollars
2.54bn in 1992, up 54 per cent on the Dollars 1.65bn of 1991.
Why the revival? The main reason is the upswing in US equity markets over
the past two years and the particularly strong markets for small company
stocks and for initial public offerings of stocks in small company
flotations.
The sight of shareholders in small companies which have come to market
making huge gains on their investments has spurred portfolio managers to
take a fresh look at putting money into venture funds.
A healthy public offering market, which enables fund managers to liquidate
their portfolios more easily, also encourages them to put new money into
this area.
Many fund managers argue that they have leant a lot from the problems they
experienced in the late 1980s, when so much money was poured
indiscriminately into venture funds that returns from many were poor. They
intend to be much more selective this time round.
Others add that with conventional stock and bond portfolios expected to show
much more modest growth in the 1990s than in the preceding decade, venture
capital funds hold out the hope of relatively attractive capital
appreciation.
A recent survey of venture capital fund performance by Venture Economics
showed an overall industry internal rate of return of 13.9 per cent in 1992.
Another factor which could provide some stimulation to the industry is the
budget package recently pushed through Congress by President Clinton, which
gave tax breaks to individuals who invest in small companies for a five year
period.
The sector able to attract most funds is software and services, which drew
in Dollars 561.8m in 1992, up 67 per cent over 1991. However, its share of
disbursements fell from 24.8 per cent to 22.1 per cent, thanks to the
strength of some other fields.
Medical and healthcare businesses received Dollars 442m, nearly three times
the 1991 total, and accounted for 17.4 per cent of 1992 disbursements,
according to Venture Economics.
Keen investor interest in the area was underlined by the fact that it
produced the greatest number of venture capital initial public offerings in
both 1991 and 1992. However, uncertainty over the Clinton Government's
healthcare reform package may have slowed growth in this sector in 1993.
TELEPHONE and data communications companies received Dollars 366m in 1992 as
the US geared up for the much-forecast multi-media revolution which is
supposed to transform communications practices over the next few decades.
Biotechnology companies gathered Dollars 261m in 1992, more than double the
previous year, with their share of total outlays advancing from 8.2 per cent
to 10.3 per cent.
By contrast, computer hardware companies attracted only 5.4 per cent
outlays, down from 12.4 per cent. The latter figure points up a long-term
change in the US industry, which began just after world war two with the
foundation of ARD, a venture fund established in Boston by a group of
entrepreneurs involved in Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
The single most important event in ARD's history - and a landmark in the
growth of the entire venture capital business - was its investment in the
late 1950s in the then tiny Digital Equipment, which grew into the world's
second largest computer manufacturer.
Other important landmarks in the growth of the sector included providing the
seed money for Apple Computer, and at one point computer hardware companies
accounted for almost 40 per cent of venture capital disbursements.
The change in the sectoral distribution of funds has been matched by changes
in the type of investor involved in the industry, and the age of company in
which they put their funds.
Initially, wealthy families and individuals provided the main source of
funds, but legislative changes in the late 1970s - to capital gains tax
rates and investment guidelines - encouraged institutional investors to
enter the arena much more aggressively. Pension funds now account for over
40 per cent of venture fund pools, compared to around 10 per cent for
endowments and foundations and roughly similar proportions for individuals
and corporations.
Large US corporations have been reducing their exposure to the venture
capital sector, due in no small measure to the global recession of the past
few years and a need to cut costs.
A survey by Venture Economics shows that 79 big US international
corporations still have formal, strategically-oriented venture capital
investment programmes, compared with 100 identified in 1990.
Mr Robert Mast, vice-president of Venture Economics, explains that 'the
economic climate of the past few years has been hard on corporate venture
programmes, which tend to be strongly impacted by acquisitions, management
changes and other shifts in corporate strategy.'
However, the survey did identify 15 new venture capital programmes formed
since 1990, led by investments in medical and healthcare companies.
THE bulk of venture capital funds is going into already established
companies which need money for expansion, rather than into pure start-up
businesses.
So-called ' later stage' deals gathered three quarters of disbursements last
year, compared with 68 per cent in 1991.
Some analysts say the move away from early stage deals reflects the strength
of the initial public offering market, with investors keen to take a stake
in businesses not long before they are floated.
Others complain that the prominence in the market of institutional funds,
with their eyes on short-term returns, has meant a 'perversion' of classic
venture fund investing, with its focus on start-up companies and patient,
long-term investing.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (12): Caution
prevails - Japan / The growth in new Japanese investments is being hampered
by the stagnation of the economy

THE recent stabilising of the Tokyo stock exchange and a spate of public
offerings by smaller companies are encouraging Japan's venture capital
sector.
However, the bursting of the country's asset bubble and the squeeze in
capital flow, prompting rapid restructuring of investment portfolios at
venture capital companies, has scarred relationships with businesses in
which they invested in the late eighties.
Venture capital in Japan has taken a different form from that in the US and
Europe, where capital is invested in high-risk companies starting up.
Japanese venture capital companies search for mature companies with
potential to be listed publicly and look for future profits through
flotations and underwriting.
During the sharp appreciation of share prices in the late eighties, venture
capital companies made vast investments into businesses preparing to go
public, accumulating shares ahead of listing.
But the sharp fall in listings and the slump in the stock market has hurt
most venture capital companies, and some groups have been forced to
liquidate due to the increase in bankruptcies and bad loans. Yamatane
Investment, a venture capital subsidiary of Yamatane Securities, was
dissolved earlier this year, with the investments shifted to the parent.
Many venture capital companies are now looking to sell off their
investments. Businesses are increasingly frustrated as the venture capital
groups are forcing businesses to buy back shares, or selling the shares to
larger companies, forcing the businesses to become a part of a keiretsu, or
industrial grouping.
According to a survey by Nikkei Venture, a business magazine, venture
capital investment in fiscal year 1992, posted a decline for the first time
since the survey started 10 years ago. The outstanding investment balance at
the end of last March fell 1.7 per cent to Y876.1bn, while the loan balance
fell 9.6 per cent to Y1,362bn.
As for new investments, growth is being hampered by the stagnation of the
economy. 'We have the capital and are intent on investing, but there is a
lack of worthwhile businesses,' says an official at a second tier venture
capital company.
Venture capital companies are more cautious of the rising risks from
investments due to the rise in bankruptcies. Last fiscal year, venture
capital companies faced 71 bankruptcies in businesses in which they had
invested up 69 per cent from the previous year.
Some venture capital companies, in the meantime, have started to focus on
start-up companies which are not necessarily looking for a public listing,
but need financing. Mr David Wilson, at 3iBJ, a joint venture capital
company between Industrial Bank of Japan and 3i, the UK development venture
group, says, 'Investment activity relating to young companies is moving up,
and there are many new companies wanting to do new things.'
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is also trying to encourage
the start up of new companies and last year set up a commission to study new
ways to promote venture capital investment in new high-risk but small
businesses.
The commission, composed of university professors and bankers, is studying
tax breaks for venture capital companies and the deregulation of
over-the-counter listings of the stocks of venture capital companies.
Mr Takatoshi Takahashi, deputy director of Miti's machinery and information
industries bureau, says that the current economic situation is a chance for
the smaller venture companies.
'The Japanese economy is going through a structural change, and smaller
companies have an advantage,' he says.
Larger companies are finding difficulty in coping with the end of life time
employment, the gradual unravelling of the keiretsu, and traditional
relationships, and the shift from mass production to limited versions of
products.
However, he also acknowledges the financing problems facing start-up
companies, and adds that Miti is aiming to support entrepreneurs and new
businesses through new loan programmes.
The recent emergency economic package announced in September, included an
increase in loan facilities to small and medium companies by over Y1,000bn
over the next year, and tax incentives for machinery and equipment purchased
during the year to September next year.
The easing of various bureaucratic restrictions by the new government under
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, is also expected to eliminate regulatory barriers
barring new businesses, and may stimulate a number of start-up companies.
The cabinet wants the 11,000 regulations of the bureaucracies decreased by
10 per cent in the near term.
Meanwhile, areas in which venture capital companies currently see growth are
those in businesses related to environment conservation, health, and medical
and bio-technology.
Venture capital companies are also focusing on the sharp growth in
south-east Asia. Overseas investments by venture capital rose 6.2 per cent
last year to Y130.5bn, as the recent rallies in the Asian markets and the
number of new listings encouraged capital to flow into countries such as
Malaysia and Indonesia.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (10): Resilience
in a tough climate - France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S venture capital industry, like a child, may find that it grows up
more quickly in a more difficult environment.
The recession which has hit French industry over the past year has limited
the resources available to venture capital funds while making life much more
difficult for small and medium-sized companies.
So far, the industry has been resilient to the harsher economic climate
which is expected to bring a contraction of about 1.5 per cent in Gross
Domestic Product this year.
Mr Dominique Peninon, president of AFIC (the French Association of Capital
Investors) says that in 1992 - the latest year for which industry-wide
figures are available - the total amount of new investment in venture
capital projects slipped only slightly to FFr6.63bn, from FFr6.9bn in 1991.
'This was surprisingly high in the face of economic conditions' said Mr
Peninon. 'It suggests investors continue to have confidence.'
This was particularly the case in the technology and consumer goods sectors,
which were the largest recipients of funds amongst the 1,888 venture capital
investments in 895 separate companies.
The current year, however, is proving more difficult. Insurance companies
and banks, the principal providers of external finance for venture capital
in France, have been tightening credit in response to problems in the
property market and their expansion plans.
'Insurance companies feel they cannot afford to invest in unquoted high-risk
investments at the moment,' says Mr Denis Mortier, director for France of
the European venture capital association.
Despite leaner times, some venture capital activities remain fairly brisk.
'Buy-outs are fairly active,' says Mr Mortier who adds that the need for
replacement capital has also been boosted by the need on the part of
institutional investors to realise capital gains.
The ability to exit from investments, however, has become more difficult -
'from the end of 1992 it started to become more and more difficult to
realise investments,' says Mr Peninon. He blames the weakness of Paris'
secondary stock market as well as the slowdown in the economy and in mergers
and acquisition activity for the trend.
THE various pressures facing the French venture capital industry may well
accelerate its pace of development.
'There are going to be very big changes in our industry over the next two to
three years,' says Mr Mortier.
One such change will be an increasing consolidation of the number of venture
capital firms. There are more than 150 venture capital firms in France, more
than in the UK. But the value of money they manage is about half of the UK
total.
The discrepancy reflects the fact that the French market is less mature than
its UK counterpart - 'in a younger market you have a lot of funds,' says the
manager of one venture capital group. 'It is only when investors can
recognise the quality companies that the number is limited.'
The difficult conditions now being experienced are expected to hasten the
trend to a fewer more powerful players through the failure or merger of
struggling funds.
Most members of the French venture capital industry welcome such a process.
But they argue that further reforms are necessary to ensure the continued
development of the industry in France.
The two most important are the development of pension funds and the creation
of a stronger market on which venture capital investments can be floated.
The weakness of the French pension fund industry is perceived as an
important problem by venture capital firms. 'It deprives us of a source of
finance which is available to counterparts in the UK and US,' says one
investor.
Mr Motiet estimates that the difference between the FFr7bn received as
external funds by UK venture capital companies in 1992, and the FFr3.2bn
received by French businesses in the same year, is accounted for almost
completely by the strength of UK pension fund investments.
Moves are afoot in France to encourage the development of a pension fund
system, prompted by the crisis in the state pensions system. The
implementation of new laws, tax incentives and regulations is expected to be
a gradual process. But, as Mr Peninon, points out, even one per cent of the
funds which go towards pensions in France would represent an enormous
stimulus for the French venture capital industry.
ANOTHER boost for the industry is sought in the area of stock markets. After
a brief flurry of activity in 1986 and 1987, venture capital companies have
found it almost impossible to float their investments on the French stock
markets.
'There is no appetite on the stock market at the moment,' says Mr Peninon,
who argues that investors were disappointed by the first wave of venture
capital listings on France's secondary market.
The solution, according to many of the players in the industry, is the
creation of a 'European Nasdaq' - a computerised off-market trading system.
They argue that this would resolve the weaknesses of Europe's secondary
stock markets, raise liquidity, and tempt international investors,
particularly from the US.
For the moment, however, the industry must continue to struggle with the
grim economic conditions. Even here, some industry members see benefits.
'The crisis has forced venture capital managers to become much more
'hands-on,'' says Mr Mortier. 'It will create much more experience
investment teams.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (11): Flotations
return to favour - UK regional funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY

<TEXT>
THE LAST six months have been the most profitable in the 33-year history of
3i in Manchester. Mr Phil Goodwin, local director of operations says it is
the ideal illustration for the recent improvement in venture capital exit
routes.
The best performer was Metrotect, a pipeline coating company bought out by
management for Pounds 6m in 1988 with the backing of 3i Manchester and the
local office of NatWest Ventures. This summer it floated on the stock
exchange for Pounds 30m.
Taco, a manufacturer of plastic film in Cheshire, was subject to a Pounds
10m management buy-out last year. It was sold to Briton, an emergent
packaging group, for Pounds 27m, further swelling 3i Manchester's bottom
line.
This November Mr Goodwin, together with Murray Johnstone's Manchester
managers, expects to do well from the flotation of Canadian Pizza, a Salford
food company which has achieved the rare distinction of successfully selling
chilled pizza cases to Italy.
November will also see the flotation of Lilliput Lane, the Cumbrian
miniature model maker rescued by North of England Ventures and Lazard
Ventures in 1990 after a diversification programme ran into trouble because
of rising interest rates.
Mr Peter Folkman, managing director of NEV who is generally regarded as a
guru of regional venture capitalism in Britain, is expecting to receive
Pounds 7m for the sale of 25 per cent of the company. NEV is keeping 5 per
cent to ensure future returns and influence when Lilliput expands.
ACROSS the north and Scotland - the areas of Britain least damaged by
recession - management buy-out teams have been delivering good returns to
venture capital backers, merchant bankers and lenders.
Mr Charles Richardson, who this month joined 3i's London office from his
post as its northern regional director, says: 'There was a worry that
flotation might have lost its attractiveness as an exit route because not
long ago the market was not interested in anything worth less than Pounds
50m.
'Some of the managing directors of companies we had backed were beginning to
wonder if the game was worth the candle. All that has changed. We have been
involved in 12 flotations in the north and in Scotland this year and we have
several more coming up. Most were management buy-outs three or four years
ago.'
Mr Folkman adds: 'In the last six months the stock market boom has helped us
all feel better. Portfolios are looking stronger.'
This is none too soon for most regional funds. In spite of being well backed
by institutions and larger national funds, most are relatively small by
London standards. Their portfolios are limited in size and it does not take
many failures to make them look unhealthy.
One or two small funds have disappeared from the FT's yearly list of
principal sources of regional capital, having been absorbed by bigger
parents or neighbours. New entrants are usually backed by national
institutions with deep pockets.
Profits are now being made, but the scope for reinvestment in new projects
appears to be limited. At the same time, senior debt - the working capital
element of most deals - is less freely available because the clearing banks
which provide it are still cautious.
'The great irony is that at the present low cost of borrowing, leveraged
buy-outs should be easier to do than ever before, but they can't be done
easily because the banks are still worried about lending,' says Mr Paul
Mitchell of Rickett Mitchell, the Manchester corporate finance boutique.
Mr Mitchell also warns of the problem presented by prices. Private companies
have always sold for about five times earnings but the price of public
companies - in this instance usually subsidiaries within large groups - has
been more variable.
The returns being achieved by the flotation of some management buy-outs are
so good partly because managements bought their businesses cheaply: their
parents were slimming down quickly to cope with recession.
Many companies were sold for less than 10 times earnings, at a time when
earnings were depressed. Earnings are now rising and Mr Folkman says 10
times earnings is regarded as a the starting point for negotiations.
As venture capitalists aim to float at 15 times earnings to recoup their
investment at a tidy profit, margins and opportunities look limited.
Mr Lindsay Forbes, manager of the British Linen Bank - the merchant arm of
the Bank of Scotland - in Manchester, says: 'We are certainly not seeing a
great increase in the number of do-able deals coming across the desk.
'There is now too much money available for the number of good projects worth
backing - and possibly everything is still too geared up for management
buy-outs. It is the people who run businesses who count and there is a
limited number who are really good enough to deliver.
IS the management suitable? This is the question that Mr Forbes and his
colleagues always ask.
If a buy-out is relatively cheap, a moderate management must look promising
in terms of return on capital for venture capital backers. In more expensive
buy-outs the management must be very good to make a deal work for its
backers.
The economic climate is also a factor. 'In good years you have more chances
of a bad decision working,' says Mr Forbes.
Most of the regional venture capital industry has moved in the relatively
easy market of management buy-outs from motivated vendors for the past few
years, and fund managers now face a stern test of their mettle. To make good
returns they will have to do what everyone thinks venture capitalists are
supposed to do - back entrepreneurs with new businesses or back existing
companies which need to advance with risk capital rather than potentially
crippling borrowings.
Given Mr Forbes's warning about the perpetual shortage of good
entrepreneurial managers, nerves will be tested, especially if people feel
under pressure to do something - anything - with the piles of money they
will be sitting on from this year's flotations.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (10): Volume rises
to record levels - Derivatives / The growth in the use of these complex
financial instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLATILE market conditions have helped boost volume in the world's futures
markets to record levels this year.
Turmoil in the foreign exchange markets, as currencies within the European
exchange rate mechanism came under repeated pressure during the past 18
months, has encouraged greater use of derivative products among speculators,
for whom volatility represents an investment opportunity, and among
companies and institutions persuaded by the swings in the markets of the
need to hedge their exposure.
The proliferation of these complex financial instruments has attracted the
unwanted attentions of regulators, particularly in the US, who fear that the
level of systemic risk is growing as a result.
However, this year the pressure has eased following a series of reports, for
example by the Bank of England, which have adopted a more conciliatory
approach towards the derivatives industry. The derivatives market divides
into two distinct parts: the over-the-counter market in swaps and options
which consists of specially tailored, but often illiquid, instruments
created by banks and sold directly to companies and financial institutions;
and the highly liquid market in homogeneous futures and options contracts
traded and cleared through exchanges.
The growth in over-the-counter business has fuelled growth in the futures
market - although exchanges have tended to view the growth of OTC business
with some suspicion. Banks active in the OTC market use liquid contracts
traded on exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Trade and the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange to lay off their risk.
Futures exchanges have a number of advantages over the OTC market: they
generally offer greater speed, at lower cost. In addition, institutions
dealing on an exchange do not take on credit exposure to a counterparty,
since contracts are settled through a central clearing house.
However, many users prefer to buy products in the OTC market which are
specially tailored to suit their individual needs. But the line between
these two markets is becoming increasingly blurred, as exchanges try to
emulate the flexibility of OTC products, and banks consider ways of
replicating the clearing mechanisms of exchanges.
The expansion of the world's futures markets has transformed the way
financial markets function. Ten years ago there were only a handful of
exchanges and a few liquid contracts; now, it is hard to think of any
developed cash market which does not have an active futures market attached
to it. More than that, futures markets have become more than an appendage of
the cash market: frequently, the tail wags the dog.
The idea that futures markets drive cash markets can appear disconcerting,
or even worrying - for example, some regulators have tried to pin the blame
for the stock market crash of 1987 on futures traders. The dominance of
futures over cash market trading is partly due to their greater liquidity:
volume in S &amp; P futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for example, is
nearly twice the turnover in the underlying stocks.
But in many cases futures trading has helped boost liquidity in the
underlying cash market. For example, institutional investors are more likely
to buy foreign stocks if they know they can hedge or adjust their positions
using derive instruments.
Futures also demand a smaller outlay than the cash market and allow traders
to express more complex market views - for example, to position themselves
to gain from a falling market, or from the narrowing of a margin between two
markets.
Futures markets have grown fast in the last decade, particularly in Europe,
where the market only started 10 years ago. According to a recent report by
the Group of 30, the Washington-based think-tank, the notional amount of
futures traded every year is Dollars 140,000bn. The volume in the OTC market
is much smaller, at around Dollars 2,000bn.
However, regulatory concerns centre on the OTC market, both because of the
intrinsically greater credit risk, and the larger amount of contracts
outstanding: G30 estimates notional outstandings of Dollars 4,500bn in the
OTC market compared with just Dollars 1,000bn in the futures market.
The growth of the swaps and futures markets has consistently surpassed
expectations for the past 10 years, and there is some doubt about how much
longer such growth rates - still around 40 per cent annually at European
exchanges - can be maintained. In particular, many market participants say
the US market has now reached maturity in a number of areas.
In the exchange-traded market, growth has been supported in part by the
steady addition of new products - Italian bond futures, and short-term
German interest rates, for example. The array of products available on
principal markets now appears virtually complete. Attempts at innovation in
new areas - such as insurance futures and swap futures in Chicago - have yet
to flourish.
While there is no shortage of innovative ideas, it seems difficult to spur
further growth in volume from the creation of new products.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (9): Hunt is on for
better returns - Equities / The Continent is finding favour with investors
as the United States and UK stock markets lose their bloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN SPITE OF expectations of only sluggish economic growth in OECD countries,
stock markets have been booming this year, with record highs for the UK's
FT-SE index and the US Dow Jones Industrial average.
Low interest rates are expected to fuel further stock market gains, as
developed economies emerge from recession. In addition, the current low
interest rate environment has encouraged investors to favour stock markets,
switching out of bonds and money markets in search of better returns.
'Anyone looking for strong GDP growth in Europe in the next 12 months is
likely to be disappointed, but that is not to say that the combined effects
of lower interest rates, weaker currencies against the US dollar, and, in
particular, restructuring of European industry, cannot produce big gains in
corporate profits and a continuation of the shift towards cyclical stocks',
argues Mr Richard Davidson, an economist at Morgan Stanley International.
In Europe, financial stocks, the first to benefit from lower interest rates,
have already rallied strongly, up 41.9 per cent in Europe since the start of
the year. But cyclical stocks, after three years of underperformance have
also bounced back by 30 per cent since the start of the year. Consumer
stocks on the other hand have risen just 3.5 per cent since the start of the
year.
'Cyclicals in Europe are back in fashion and, as might be expected, the
rubbish has risen with the tide, on expectations of reduced debt problems
and exponential growth in earnings per share next year,' reports Mr
Davidson.
Ms Sophie Blancpain, European equity strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston, believes that Europe is 'the hot place to be.' She argues that the
US stock market cycle is two years ahead of Europe, since real interest
rates have already fallen to very low levels. Real rates in Europe on the
other hand still average around five per cent, ranging from an extreme of
around 10 per cent in Denmark to just 2 per cent in Germany.
When real interest rates available on bank accounts fall below dividend
yields, there is a clear incentive for investors to take the additional risk
of buying stocks. With average dividend yields ranging from 4 1/2 per cent
in Spain to about 2 per cent in Germany, that stage is not far off.
Although the prospects for dividend growth remain muted, as companies
rebuild their balance sheets, many analysts believe that there is room for a
pick-up in earnings, despite low economic growth.
'One of the positive aspects of Europe is that there will be a cyclical
rally, due to re-evaluation as (European economies) come out of recession,'
said Ms Blancpain. She expects to see 'a better performance than growth
expectations suggest. They have the potential to show earnings growth
through restructuring.' The restructuring of European companies, many of
which are currently less competitive than their US counterparts, is already
under way, helped by labour reforms, she believes.
In fact, continental Europe has already outperformed the US and UK so far
this year. Although the UK and US markets have hit the headlines by reaching
record highs, they have actually offered relatively low returns: 7.7 per
cent for the US and 10.5 per cent for the UK, compared with 25.9 per cent
for Germany, and over 40 per cent in local currency terms for Sweden, Italy
and Spain, according to figures from Salomon Brothers International. 'The
FT-SE may have breached the 3000 mark, but it is the second worst performer'
of the 10 leading stock markets tracked by Salomon Brothers, according to
international equity strategist Mr Marcus Grubb.
The Japanese market, which is still viewed as sick since it is still 48 per
cent off its highs, has also performed well this year, and is up 24.5 per
cent.
The prospect of further cuts to already low Japanese rates is helping to
fuel renewed interest in the market. 'The government is more concerned about
recession than inflation,' said Mr Philip Wostencroft, an equity strategist
at Smith New Court, who expects further easing of rates this year. However,
he admits that price/earnings ratios are very high in Japan, because
earnings have been marked down by recession.
High price/earnings ratios - 24 times in Germany and 22 times in France -
are also a cause of concern in Europe. Chartists are beginning to worry that
high p/e ratios, given the relatively poor growth prospects, could mean that
markets are heading for a crash.
However, Mr Grubb argues that p/e ratios are not currently a good indicator
of value, partly because earnings are cyclically depressed.
His argument is that the current outlook of low inflation, low interest
rates and low economic growth is actually positive for stock markets, as in
the UK in the 1960s.
He believes that the flow of cash into equity markets caused by low interest
rates has only just started and will buoy the market for some time to come.
'A lot of people looking at past levels of earnings and economic growth are
concerned about the current level of stock market valuation. They forget
that there is a cycle of asset class rotation,' said Mr Grubb. 'Relative to
earnings, profits and growth, equities are expensive; but relative to cash
and bonds, they are cheap.
However, within this context, most analysts favour continental Europe,
suggesting a broad consensus that the US and UK have lost their bloom. 'As
the US and UK economies went into the pit of recession in 1990, their stock
markets performed well, because the green shoots of recovery were priced in
very early. The same thing is happening in Germany now,' believes Mr Grubb.
There has also been growing interest in emerging markets in Asia and Latin
America, where economic growth is running well ahead of the developed
countries.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (11): The focus
shifts from fraud - Banking supervision / The new challenges facing
supervisors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST as the past five years have proved a turbulent period for banks, in
much the same way supervisors have also faced a generous share of
challenges.
The effects of the biggest upsets - crises of state banking systems in the
US, and the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International - are
still being felt.
Yet, the fact that the main subject to be discussed by international bank
supervisors at the IMF/World Bank meetings will be derivative financial
products, rather than fraud or loan quality, indicates that they are
gradually turning their attention to future rather than past challenges.
The Dollars 4 trillion over-the-counter swaps and options market from which
banks and securities houses have gained large profits this year exercise
supervisors for obvious reasons. There has not yet been a mishap, but the
extent of risk is unknown, and derivatives link many financial markets.
The problem for bank supervisors is that derivatives are being used by a
growing number of companies to hedge their risks. Some risks may simply be
eliminated, but others are being taken on by banks. This raises the
possibility of the supervisor's worst fear: systemic financial failure.
The difficulty for supervisors is twofold. They must assess the systemic
risk, and ensure that banks control individual risks. Despite the optimistic
tone of the recent G30 report on derivatives, Federal Reserve supervisors in
particular have expressed doubts whether banks are wholly in control.
The increasing use of derivatives has led to more weight being placed on the
capital strength of banks that take on counterparty risk. That builds on a
trend established by the Bank for International Settlements in 1988 when it
laid down minimum capital adequacy standards for credit risk.
Work is still under way by the Basle committee on banking supervision to
establish the amount of capital which banks will have to set aside against
risks in foreign exchange, securities and derivatives trading. That could
add up to a percentage point to the capital held against risk-weighted
assets.
The protection of the world financial system is the motive offered for such
work. But the other reason is the pressure to establish a level playing
field between regulatory regimes. There is pressure to level regimes among
countries and among financial institutions.
The development of a single European market is one factor stimulating
harmonisation across borders. A series of EC banking directives will take
effect in the next few years, one of the most important being the large
exposures directive that could limit some underwriting exposures.
However, the BCCI collapse has thrown up tricky problems in harmonising
regulation across borders. One is the difficulty of matching standards of
who is a fit and proper person to run a bank; the second is the fact that
countries have different laws on claims on insolvent banks.
The directors of BCCI were clearly not fit to run a bank in hindsight. But
drawing up common definitions of competence and probity to apply in
different countries with widely varying financial customs is a stiff task.
Basle supervisors are now trying to do so, with modest expectations of
success.
The second problem is that US law regards the parts of an insolvent bank
within its borders as separate entities from the core of the bank in another
country. This means that US creditors are regarded as having separate claims
on the US assets and overseas assets of a bank such as BCCI.
European countries, including Britain, treat cross-border insolvent banks as
single entities into which all assets are pooled for distribution to
creditors. If different countries regard their creditors as having varying
rights, this will undermine attempts to harmonise supervision.
Apart from these obstacles to cross-border harmonisation, US banks in
particular complain that they are hindered by stricter burdens of regulation
than other companies. They also chafe at the lack of regulation of
institutions such as GE Capital and AT&amp;T, which offer financial services.
Discontent at unevenness between the strict supervision of banks and at lack
of control over other types of company offering financial services is likely
to grow in Europe. This will, in turn, increase the pressure on banking
supervisors to justify their activities, and the way they restrict banks.
Together with the troubles of national banking systems, and debates about
the monetary independence of central banks, this has contributed to
questions over whether central banks should combine depositor protection and
supervision, or even whether they should carry out the latter.
The Federal Reserve has faced criticism from Congress over its supervisory
role and calls have been made for it to be hived off; the Bank of England's
competence as a supervisor has been attacked over BCCI; in New Zealand,
there has been a move to replace supervision with stricter financial
disclosure.
In contrast, Scandinavian countries have moved to put bank supervision back
under the control of central banks rather than separating it under
commissions following the region's banking crisis. Central banks are now
seen as more reliable observers of systemic risk in the financial system.
The new thrust of concern on market rather than credit risk may help central
banks to retain supervisory powers because of their oversight of financial
systems. But it could also lead to more calls for banking and securities
regulation to be harmonised under a single supervisory structure.
The barriers to achieving such an aim were illustrated in May when the Basle
committee published separate proposals on allocating capital to market risks
because it had failed to agree common standards with securities regulators
under the International Organisation of Securities Commissions.
All this suggests banking supervision may have emerged from crises of credit
risk and fraud in the past five years only to face more complex tasks. The
rise in the range of products traded on financial markets means supervisors
could struggle to keep up.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (8): A potent mix
of skills - Venturer of the year, Michael Peagram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLLIDAY Chemical Holdings is one of those companies that venture
capitalists frequently dream about, but only rarely hold in their
portfolios. Very rarely.
The returns to institutional investors which backed Holliday's original buy
out in February 1987 have been mouth watering by any standards.
Led by NatWest Ventures - and supported by Citicorp Venture Capital, 3i,
Thompson Clive and Apax - they subscribed Pounds 3m of capital to what was
then at best a small and convalescing specialty chemicals group.
When Holliday came to the stock market earlier this year their money had
been turned into a stake worth Pounds 58.7m, equivalent to an annual
compound rate of return of 73.6 per cent. The shares, floated at 195p, were
last week trading at around the 220p mark.
More than most companies of its size - its market capitalisation is now
around Pounds 185m - today's Holliday is the creation of one man, Michael
Peagram.
His achievements have also earned him the distinction of being the fourth
overall winner of the Venturer of the Year award, sponsored by the Financial
Times, Cartier the jewellers, and the British Venture Capital Association.
Michael Peagram's story is all the more remarkable in that it lacks any
visible high technology wizardry or mould-breaking innovative spark.
Holliday's enviable record of sales and earnings per share growth, indeed,
has been based on a range of relatively unexciting products sold into niches
of mostly mature UK and international markets.
These products include dye stuffs and dyestuff intermediates for textiles,
plastics and ink, hair dyes, photographic chemicals and sulphur dyes,
sulphur dioxide and iodine derivatives, and fine chemicals for
pharmaceutical and veterinary products.
It is not as if Holliday's strategy - as developed before and after the buy
out - even sounds exciting on paper. Any number of companies have tried to
concentrate on higher margins, aimed to be more market led, attempted to
source more cheaply, and vowed to expand on to the continent into related
product areas. Far fewer actually deliver on the promise.
Mr Peagram recalls thinking to himself a week after he arrived as managing
director in October 1985 that he had probably lost his own money. Holliday
Dyes and Chemicals, as it was then called - a family company with a proud
history dating back to the 1830s - had been in receivership once and was in
deep trouble again. Wooed away from the relative safety of Croda Chemicals -
where he had also been managing director - Mr Peagram subscribed Pounds
50,000 for a 25 per cent stake (and an option on a further 24 per cent).
Those early months, he says, were touch and go - 'it was a year before I
really felt safe. Even so, if the recession had struck in 1986 we would
probably have gone. There wouldn't have been time to build up enough fat.'
Losses of Pounds 1m on sales of Pounds 8m in 1985 demonstrated just how dire
things were, and Peagram needed all his natural persuasiveness and
negotiating skill to convince Holliday's local Inland Revenue inspector at
that stage not to pull the plug.
After the initial turnaround the opportunity arose to buy out the majority
shareholder - a Jersey businessman - which is when Peagram approached
NatWest Ventures. Significantly the deal included ratchet terms which had
the effect of boosting his personal equity stake - and reducing the holdings
of the venture capitalists - if certain profit targets were hit - 'they
never thought I'd make them,' grins the man whose personal stake in the
business is now worth Pounds 37m.
Holliday's success since the buy-out has stemmed from a combination of
organic growth and a series of well conceived acquisitions, of which the
1991 takeover of Lancashire based William Blythe was by far the biggest.
All in all, Holliday has spent Pounds 44.9m on acquisitions since September
1987.
'I've always had the philosophy that before we acquired a company we should
do a very thorough investigation,' says Peagram.
'We generally try to identify 10 things that we can do when we take over.
Trying three would make a difference, but we tend to go for all ten and end
up succeeding with seven. In a nutshell, that's why the returns are so
good.'
Common features of Holliday companies include an industrial customer base,
flexible plants, batch-based processes and high capital barriers to entry.
But it has been that uncommon ability to breathe new life and ideas into
underperforming businesses which has distinguished Peagram and his team from
the run of ordinary companies.
AS the Venture Award judges observed: 'Michael Peagram has a highly
analytical approach to both the market and to acquisitions. He is a genuine
entrepreneur and a fine manager, combining clear thinking, vision and
strategic skills with excellent man management.'
Mr Peagram admits his own style may not be everyone's cup of tea - but the
enthusiasm and commitment are infectious and have undoubtedly helped him
recruit and retain talented managers in the operating businesses.
He acknowledges, though rejects, the fears of some City analysts that
Holliday is a one man band, and has made it known that the roles of chairman
and chief executive will be split within the next couple of years - 'this is
not because of some theoretical corporate governance charter,' he explains.
'It's because there's plenty of work for two people.'
Relations with the City have been good so far - a small dip in first half
profits has not damped expectations of around Pounds 15m for the full year
(against Pounds 12.4m in 1992) - and he comes across as strongly motivated
by the challenge ahead.
'We've given the venture capitalists what they wanted. The big pressure now
is from the new shareholders, with whom I have to establish a new track
record over the next two to three years,' he says.
Peagram is nonetheless conscious that managing a medium sized company may
require new skills - given its historic record Holliday's turnover could be
double 1992's Pounds 97m in a couple of years time.
'In many ways we are not a small company any more. Our factory here in
Huddersfield, which has around 270 people, has much the same professionalism
as the bigger ICI plant next door.
'But I don't see why larger companies can't apply many of the features of a
well-run small business.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (9): A trio of
success stories - Previous award winners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE former winners of the FT's enterprise award are still winners in their
business worlds so far. Not surprisingly, they all agree that the
competition is A Good Thing, writes Catherine Milton.
'I could recommend it to anyone,' says Mr Peter Vassallo, managing director
of Vassallo Sea Foods, winner in 1991.
The judges' record speaks for itself. Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, the first
winner, is now managing director of Hodder Headline, after a Pounds 48.9m
takeover this year of Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Mr Vassallo is still managing
director of Vassallo Sea Foods, which has grown through the recession. Last
year's joint winners, Mr Adrian Breger and Mr Jamie Gibson, of Breger
Gibson, remain joint managing directors of their disposable nappy company,
which has also remained profitable through the downturn - and in a market
dominated by multinationals.
The high profile Mr Hely Hutchinson, then of Headline Book Publishing, was
winner of the overall award and winner in the 'large start-up' category.
With Pounds 1.3m of start-up capital and two subsequent fund-raisings
totalling Pounds 2.1m, Headline penetrated an already crowded field
dominated by established publishing groups. In 1990 it made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 609,000 on sales of Pounds 7.8m.
Mr Hely Hutchinson thinks he missed out on the publicity that his successors
have attracted: 'It was a morale booster rather than anything else. It
further raised my standing in the City, among venture capitalists and in the
investment community. I didn't get the publicity of last year's winner,
though. The award has built up over the years. But I like the watch and was
happy to win.'
The award serves 'some kind of purpose,' he admits - 'they are good for the
winner and venture capitalists themselves are very interested in showing
their successes. I heard about the award through my backers.' But he adds:
'You don't suddenly get a lot more orders, or authors, just because of one
award and there is always the superstitious fear that if you win an award
you hit trouble the next day.'
He also enjoyed helping select his successor: 'There was every attempt to
make things fair. I think we picked a good winner.' That was Mr Vassallo,
who agrees the award brought him publicity and also that helping to judge
the following year's candidates gave the added bonus of some useful
insights. He says: 'The award gave me exposure to a great number of people
who have achieved. They gave me an insight into what is and is not
achievable in business and what is and is not achievable in management.
'Being involved in judging the following year's candidates was an
illuminating experience. I enjoyed being privy to conversations between top
industrialists and top people in the City.' He says it is difficult to say
whether the award 'changed' anything: 'It certainly was a talking point, a
focus for local interest.'
Mr Vassallo exudes the confidence of one who believes in the future of his
company. Two years after winning the award everything in the world of
seafood is going swimmingly.
HE WON the award for the transformation of what had been a family
fishmongering business into one of the main suppliers of fish to Britain's
supermarkets.
The judges praised his business vision - the way he seemed able to
anticipate the changes taking place in the sourcing, processing, marketing
and sale of fish and exploit them to his company's advantage.
He sold the business for Pounds 13m to Albert Fisher in 1991, choosing the
food and vegetables wholesaler over several other suitors. On the profits
from this deal, struck before the award was won, Mr Vassallo has realised
his dream of becoming a rally driver. But he has not taken his eye off the
road through the tricky landscape of recession. Since 1987, when venture
capital funds were injected into the business, employment has grown from
about 70 to about 260 with average sales per employee rising over the last
two financial years to Pounds 155,172 from Pounds 139,405.
Latest annual sales are approaching Pounds 40m, compared with Pounds 33.4m
in the year to August 1992 and Pounds 27.9m over 13 months in 1991 - a sharp
increase since 1987 when turnover was under Pounds 3m. With margins tight in
the food industry, profits have been a more modest Pounds 2.19m in 1992 and
Pounds 1.81m in 1991. The company has just received confirmation of a
further investment from Albert Fisher - 'this will continue the growth
potential of this company,' says Mr Vassallo.
AT Breger Gibson, a spokesman for the two MDs says: 'The award meant a lot
to both Jamie and Adrian. They worked very hard and it really was the
highlight of the success of the business.'
Turnover for the year to March 1992 increased to Pounds 21.8m compared with
Pounds 19.5m the year before while pre-tax profits fell a little to Pounds
1.02m from Pounds 1.11m. The last two years were a step change from 1990
when sales were Pounds 11.7m and profits just Pounds 693,000.
The whole company enjoyed the award: 'We were all very very thrilled and the
associated publicity was a help. As soon as the information was released in
the FT all sorts of people that we would not have thought would have known
about us started contacting us.'
Breger Gibson also enjoyed the visit by one of the judges - 'the visit was
actually very interesting. He was very interested in us, which makes a
different. It was worthwhile meeting someone from outside the sector.'
The 325-stong company is now working towards the 'ultimate flushable diaper'
 -'it is our belief that not now but in the next century, that will be used
generally across the board.'
