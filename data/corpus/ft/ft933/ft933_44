FT  09 JUL 93 / Russian bank's missing millions: Coopers &amp; Lybrand report
highly critical of accounts

A REPORT on the Russian central bank by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy
firm, highlights 'distortions, mistakes. . . and possible abuses' which may
run into thousands of millions of roubles.
The report, commissioned by the Russian parliament for presentation with the
central bank's accounts for the past year, is frank in its assessment of the
bank's shortcomings. It states that, as a matter of urgency, the bank needs
to improve the information it receives from its branches and from within its
operations.
The report says that information has been so scanty in some areas that 'we
cannot give a final opinion on whether the accounts. . . reflect all
payments coming in and going out of the bank'.
The analysis of the accounts does not conform to international auditing
standards because of the historic lack of such standards in Russian banks
and companies.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand staff found they could not reconcile the accounts of 1991
with those of 1992 in many instances. The report says the unexplained gaps
in figures for many transactions could be explained by mistakes 'and also
abuses connected with a very high level of unexplained sums, both for
accounts within Russia and between members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, in roubles and in hard currency'.
The accounts for 1991 are viewed by Coopers as incomplete because of many
'secret' accounts, usually military, which were not disclosed. However, Mr
Jeremy Foster, a senior Coopers executive in Moscow, said yesterday he now
believed the 1992 accounts had no such secrets.
He said that funds from the formerly banned Soviet Communist party which had
been allegedly spirited abroad might have passed through the central bank
but there was now no means of tracing these movements.
Mr Foster said: 'The management of the bank has been trying to concentrate
its efforts in the main areas where there are problems, for example, in the
clearing systems. We believe that in order to fulfil its role fully it must
strengthen its internal reporting functions, for example, making it clear
what is the status of its loans.'
He said that part of the burden on Russia's central bank was the legacy of
the former Soviet Gosbank, with its responsibility for the Soviet debts of
more than Dollars 80bn and an expectation by many politicians that it would
continue its practice of automatically advancing credit to industries.
Commercial banks and enterprises are now loud in their criticism of the
central bank, saying that clearing can take months and that interest rates
charged to commercial banks are too high. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the bank's
chairman, is expected to appear before parliament today to present the
accounts for 1992.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Italian parties favour 1994 poll
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS party alliance in the Italian parliament has hardened in favour of
holding national elections in 1994 instead of autumn this year.
This would allow time for new electoral laws to be approved. It would also
allow for matching legislation on new constituencies, broader constitutional
changes as well as a proper debate on the 1994 budget plus a stable
framework to speed privatisation.
Deputies and senators would also be assured of generous pensions if the life
of the present legislature lasts two years through to next spring.
But the populist Lombard League and the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) have insisted on autumn elections.
They have argued the present parliament with one in six deputies under
investigation is discredited and no longer reflects the changing fortunes of
the political parties.
The two also believe they would boost their share of the vote in autumn
elections since the other parties would not have sufficient time to
reorganise or form new alliances.
Over the past few days the PDS leadership appears to have changed its mind.
In part this represents PDS concern over the rise of Mr Umberto Bossi's
Lombard League, which has established itself as the main force in the north.
The PDS sees the League as divisive and potentially destabilising for the
unity of Italy and is accordingly reluctant to allow Mr Bossi any further
electoral advantage.
At the same time the PDS is anxious to try and put back on the agenda some
of its ideas on electoral reform.
Both the senate and chamber of deputies have agreed their individual reforms
for the system of proportional representation; but these could still be
changed as each house must approve the other's legislation.
If a deal is struck on elections in 1994 with the Christian Democrats and
their allies in parliament, who still represent the albeit discredited
majority, there is less rush to complete electoral reform before the summer
recess.
Independent of the PDS change of heart, Mr Marco Panella, the Radical
leader, has managed to gather more than 200 deputies of all parties behind
his own pressure group to prevent elections in the autumn.

<TEXT>
MR Francesco Susini, the director-general of the Culture Ministry and for
more than a decade the most influential official in the Italian arts world,
was yesterday arrested on charges of corruption and abuse of office.
His arrest coincided with the arrest of Mr Fernando Pinto on charges of
masterminding the October 1991 fire that severely damaged the Bari opera
house of which he was the director. Mr Pinto was alleged to have acted in
concert with two local mafia bosses to reap benefit from the destruction of
one of Italy's best known and recently refurbished opera houses.
Magistrates have been investigating the Culture Ministry for three months. A
former minister has already been implicated. However, Mr Susini, who helped
establish the ministry in 1977, has been the most powerful figure
controlling its large budget.
He was arrested in connection with an allegedly inflated L28bn (Pounds 12m)
contract to restore an 18th-century castle at San Nicoal Arcella, near
Cosenza in Calabria. Also involved in the same investigation is Mr Maurizio
Misasi, the son of the principal Christian Democrat boss in the region.
In another development, Mr Adriano Aragozzini - the former organiser of the
San Remo song festival, Italy's most popular song competition - was held
after allegedly having paid kick-backs to political parties over the
organisation of the contest.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Optimism fuels jump in German markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S stock market surged to a year's high yesterday amid an outbreak of
optimism about the outlook for the country's economy.
The DAX index of 30 leading shares closed yesterday afternoon at 1,783, a
rise of nearly 64 points, or 3.7 per cent, on the day.
This alone was more than twice the gains achieved by Europe's other leading
stock exchanges yesterday and in after-hours trading it rose further to
1,799, a gain of more than 17 per cent since the beginning of the year.
'This is not the beginning of the second great economic miracle in Germany,'
said Mr Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, Germany's second
biggest bank. 'But it shows that market assessments about the German
business cycle have been overly pessimistic.'
Economists and stockbrokers said that the increase reflected a number of
factors, including the likelihood of further cuts in interest rates
following the Bundesbank's decision to lower its official rates last week
and a growing sense that the low point of the German economic cycle has been
reached.
'When we look back on the German economy from the vantage point of 18
months' time, it will be clear that the low point in the economic cycle was
reached in the first quarter of 1992,' said Mr Ulrich Schutte, a managing
partner of Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a German bank majority-owned by
Lloyds Bank of the UK.
This was one of the reasons given by the Bundesbank for its cuts in its
Lombard and discount rate to 8.25 and 6.75 per cent respectively last week.
It has subsequently been born out by the news this week that new industrial
orders rose by 4 per cent in May compared with the previous month.
Economists are hopeful that the economy will grow from the first to second
quarter, although for the year as a whole it is likely that GNP will drop by
at least 1 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN Far East region yesterday declared itself a republic, the second
region to do so in the past 10 days in what has become a dangerously
centrifugal trend in Russian politics.
The region's parliamentary deputies, quoted by the Interfax news agency as
saying that they had taken the action to get equal rights in the new
constitution, insisted that their decision was dictated by 'economic
necessity'.
The region, with its capital in Vladivostok, receives some Japanese
investment and could expect to be a significant beneficiary from Japanese
and other Pacific Rim investment.
Republican status would give it more control over foreign deals. The move
would also strengthen the tendency for the Russian regions to escape from
what they see as a high tax and inflation regime imposed by a remote Moscow
government which can no longer give them much in return and can no longer
exert discipline on them.
The move came, ironically, as Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, met
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, in Tokyo yesterday at the Group
of Seven summit - a meeting long delayed by Mr Yeltsin.
Japan has effectively limited investment and aid while the issue of the four
Kurile islands seized from it by the Soviet Union at the end of the last war
are returned.
Last week, the region of Sverdslovsk declared itself the Urals Republic  -
the first of Russia's regions to claim the same status as the 20
'ethno-territorial' republics. In the draft constitution now being thrashed
out, republics have greater representation and rights than the country's
often richer and more populous regions.
Discontent among regional leaders is now much more dangerous for Mr Yeltsin
than the opposition of the parliament, where splits and backbiting among the
deputies and the parliamentary leadership have allowed Mr Yeltsin to ignore
it with impunity.
The government is desperately seeking to convince both the regions and the
outside world that inflation and the fall in production are under control.
Inflation is down to around 15 per cent a month, the rouble strengthened
slightly yesterday to 1050 to the dollar, and production falls are abating.
However, the underlying engine of inflation, the printing of money by the
central bank as credit to enterprises and agriculture, has been muffled
rather than slowed.

FT  09 JUL 93 / EC and Ireland closer to solution on funding row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for a solution to the row over the European Community's regional
aid funding rose yesterday, as Ireland appeared to be softening its demands
over its share.
According to senior European Commission officials, Dublin is signalling a
willingness to settle, raising hopes that next week the European Parliament
can endorse the aid package in time to start disbursing it next January.
But there has been considerable confusion about what share Ireland is
claiming over exactly what period.
The Ecu157bn (Pounds 120bn) aid package, to replace the 1989-93 Structural
Funds worth Ecu63bn, is spread over two periods, one of six and one of seven
years. Ecu141.5bn in new Structural Funds - for backward and industrially
stricken regions and for training the unemployed - is for 1994-99. But the
Ecu15.5bn Cohesion Fund for the EC's four poorest member states - Ireland,
Spain, Portugal and Greece - was started up this year and runs to 1999, or
over seven years.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said at the Edinburgh summit
last December when the overall package was agreed that he had guarantees
from the Commission of IPounds 8bn for Ireland over seven years.
Senior Commission officials in Brussels say that Dublin this year submitted
a demand for nearly that figure, but over six years - the 1994-99 period -
and that this was rejected, leading to the Irish veto.
A senior Irish official in Brussels categorically denied this yesterday,
saying 'there was never any time when we were looking for a figure except
over seven years.'
If the seven-year formula is stuck to, Mr Reynolds' government can add in
the EC aid of IPounds 956m already committed to Ireland for this year,
although this allocation was set four years ago.
That addition could get Dublin reasonably close to its bottom line, but it
is still not clear whether it will be close enough.
One senior Commission official said that even with the addition, and on the
most generous interpretation of the weighting system for allocating the
funds earmarked for the poorest states, it was difficult to arrive at a
figure above IPounds 7.5bn.
Irish sources said Dublin was willing to see the relatively high percentage
share Ireland got out of the last programme diluted in the new package, but
probably not below IPounds 7.8bn.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is due to talk to Mr Reynolds
today.
The Lisbon government will seek Es3,500bn (Pounds 14.4bn) in structural
funds from the European Community for the period 1994 to 1999, Mr Anibal
Cavaco Silva, prime minister, has announced, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
The bid, which will be submitted to Brussels in the near future, is thought
to have been prompted as an early move in the face of the Irish rejection of
the planned division of EC structural funds among the four poorest members
states, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain.

Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, wins a round of applause from
colleagues in parliament following a speech yesterday promising a policy of
deregulation and decentralisation during his fourth term. He said he
expected members of the Catalan and the Basque nationalist parties to join
his Socialist-led cabinet. Many of the policies outlined by Mr Gonzalez in
his speech bore the mark of Mr Carlos Solchaga, the liberal-minded economy
minister in the outgoing government. He fought bitter battles to contain
public spending and to loosen Spain's rigid labour laws.

FT  09 JUL 93 / G7 agrees Dollars 3bn Russian fund: Compromise package aims
to help privatisation and support reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and JUREK MARTIN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S leading industrialised nations yesterday provisionally agreed a
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) fund to help Russian privatisation as President
Boris Yeltsin arrived in Tokyo for the end of their summit.
The fund, to be disbursed over the next 18 months, was put together under US
leadership by Group of Seven finance ministers from a mixture of new funds
and money already committed to other programmes. It represents a compromise
between the original Dollars 4bn proposed by the US and calls by Japan and
the European Community for more modest initial help.
The fund was proposed by President Bill Clinton at the US-Russian summit in
Vancouver in April as an addition to a Dollars 43bn package of aid, loans
and debt rescheduling.
The package, intended to help privatise Russia's large communist-era state
companies, is an attempt to demonstrate support for Russian reforms without
digging too deeply into western pockets.
Most G7 countries are pleading recession and budget constraints of their
own.
The Dollars 3bn includes Dollars 1bn in western credits for Russian
enterprises to import western capital equipment, Dollars 500m in technical
assistance from G7 countries, and a further Dollars 500m from the World Bank
for aiding areas which have been particularly dependent on state-owned
enterprises for public services.
A further Dollars 1bn will come from the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, the World Bank and its private investment arm, the
International Finance Corporation.
Mr Clinton last night called the package 'a real success' and complimented
European willingness to 'come forward'.
Mr Larry Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs
and a strong backer of the fund, called it a 'shot in the arm' for Russia's
mass privatisation programme.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, warned that ways would be sought to tie
the assistance to progress with economic reform. But he said there was
little point in strengthening the Russian private sector unless the country
gained better access to western markets - an issue which Mr Yeltsin intends
to raise when he meets G7 leaders today.
In response to western and Russian complaints that aid is not being
delivered efficiently, the G7 countries plan to set up a system for
co-ordinating it through representatives of their embassies in Moscow.
The new fund gives the embattled Russian leader a tangible result to take
home, despite the rejection of his request to sign the political communique
issued by the G7 leaders yesterday.
In a letter sent to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, a week
before the summit, Mr Yeltsin said issuing the statement with Russia's
signature would be 'an important testimony that the co-operative
relationship between Russia and the G7 was not stalemated but qualitatively
developed'.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Shake-up of Welsh agency likely after criticisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAKE-UP of the management of the Welsh Development Agency is expected
after yesterday's swingeing criticism by the Commons public accounts
committee of the way it has been run.
The MPs say in a report that management practices at the publicly funded
agency were 'well below' what parliament has a right to expect.
The matters criticised include:
an unapproved redundancy scheme with overpayments of Pounds 1.4m;
the appointment of a fraudster, Mr Neil Smith, who is now in prison, as
marketing director;
the hiring of models for promotional work who had been interviewed in an
hotel room by Mr Smith;
the so-called Operation Wizard to consider privatisation in which more than
Pounds 300,000 was paid to consultants;
an attempt to buy the silence of a director who left with an early
retirement package valued at Pounds 228,000; and
the failure to get approval for a free petrol scheme for personal cars.
The Welsh Office is also blamed for lack of supervision. 'We regard it as
unacceptable,' state the MPs, 'that the Welsh Office took no action against
anyone in the top echelons of the agency who presided over a catalogue of
serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of control and
accountability.'
Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, who took over last week as WDA chairman, said
yesterday: 'We take this report very seriously and we will see that
appropriate remedial action is taken in every aspect.' While he would not
comment on whether there would be any resignations, he said: 'Clearly
personnel has to be part of any investigation.'
Some procedures, he said, had already been changed and he would investigate
whether they were the correct changes.
Mr John Redwood, recently appointed as Welsh secretary, said he took the
criticisms very seriously and the charges would be investigated. If they
were fair, he would explain to parliament what action had been taken and, if
necessary, what action would be taken to discipline the people involved.
Mr Alan Williams, the Labour MP for Swansea West and a member of the public
accounts committee, protested yesterday that no disciplinary action had yet
been taken.
'If no action is taken, one is bound to question what it takes this
government to sack its placemen in its ever expanding empire of
unaccountable quangos,' he said.
The WDA, which was set up in 1976 and has a Pounds 171m annual budget,
partly self-funded, was chaired until the end of last month by Dr Gwyn
Jones, who was appointed in October 1988 by Lord Peter Walker when Welsh
secretary. Among his other interests, he is now the BBC governor for Wales
and a non-executive director of Tesco.
Dr Jones is at present on holiday with his family.

<TEXT>
COUNTERFEIT trade in brand names is no longer limited to Gucci bags and
Cartier watches. Italian police have uncovered fake Ferraris - sports cars
so expertly manufactured that enthusiasts in four countries bought them as
the real thing.
Raids on three workshops near Modena and Cremona, the heartland of the
genuine article, turned up 10 counterfeit cars either finished or being
built. One was a copy of a 1954 Testarossa 250 model - an original of which
can fetch close to Pounds 1m.
'They are extremely good copies right down to the chassis work, numbering
and interior finish', a Modena policeman said. 'Often there is a only a
millimetre of difference in the size and parts. Only by looking closely at
the metals used was it possible to tell the difference from a genuine
Ferrari.'
The operation was run by two ex-Ferrari mechanics who had access to original
designs. They concentrated on prestige models of the 1950s and '60s. Two
Swiss citizens are wanted for questioning about their alleged role in
selling the cars.
Ferrari alerted the police to its suspicions of a sophisticated counterfeit
operation after it received repeated requests for parts to rebuild a car
which happened to have an unexplained number of accidents.
Modena police say the business began legitimately, rebuilding damaged
Ferraris. But when the price for period Ferraris rose rapidly, the
car-builders decided to cater to this market. Fakes were sold to collectors
in Japan, Switzerland, the UK and US.
Police are tracing how many copies have been put on the market: 'It could be
a good 40 but we don't know - each one worth several hundred million lire.'
Ferrari said yesterday it was awaiting developments to see if it should take
legal action to prevent its cars being copied.
Mr Robert Brooks, head of the international auction house of the same name,
said: 'The replica lark has been going on for some years. But usually . . .
whether they are Ferraris, Jaguars or whatever, they are known to be
replicas and priced accordingly at about one-tenth the value of an
original.'
So far, the original purchasers of the fakes would appear to have made no
attempt to pass them on. Mr Brooks said it was unlikely they would have
slipped through the verification net.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Owners Abroad warns of steep profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS ABROAD, the holiday company which narrowly escaped being taken over
by rival Airtours less than four months ago, yesterday caused concern in the
City with the forecast that profits this year would be half market
expectations.
Mr Howard Klein is to resign as chairman and Mr Roger Allard will step down
as director in charge of tour operations.
The profit warning cut a third off the company's market value. Shares fell
32 1/2 p to 66p, less than half the 149p price at which Airtours was buying
shares at the end of the fiercely contested Pounds 294m bid.
Mr Klein said the profits collapse had two immediate causes. One was severe
pressure on margins. The other was that Lunn Poly, the travel agency chain
which is one of Owners Abroad's largest outlets, had sharply increased its
sales of holidays provided by Thomson, the UK's largest tour operator and
Lunn Poly's owner.
The Office of Fair Trading last month began an investigation into whether
ties between travel agents and tour operators limit the choice of holidays
to consumers.
Shareholders and corporate financiers said they could not remember when a
successful defence against a hostile bid had been followed so suddenly by
such a profit warning.
The turnround is likely to lead to an inquiry by the Takeover Panel and
raises questions about representations made by advisers at the time of the
bid.
Samuel Montagu, adviser to Owners Abroad, said its client had not issued a
profits forecast as part of its defence. 'The trading results continued to
be in line with budget up to the end of April and substantiated the
extensive due diligence we did in the bid defence,' the merchant bank said.
While some of the UK institutions that supported Owners Abroad were
embarrassed yesterday by the collapse in share price, the group's largest
shareholder - Thomas Cook, the travel agency which, with its German sister
company LTU, is controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank
 -was more sanguine.
Owners Abroad said its first-half loss, including the cost of the defence
had been Pounds 38.6m, up from Pounds 27.1m in the same period last year.
Many holiday companies lose money in the first half and try to offset this
with bigger profits in the summer months of the second half.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Revenue 'gave details to Exchange'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue provided vital information to the Stock Exchange on
extensive undisclosed share purchases by overseas vehicles of Mr Asil Nadir,
the fugitive businessman, a senior Revenue investigator claimed yesterday.
Mr Michael Allcock, suspended head of SO-2, the Revenue's special
investigation unit, yesterday detailed extensive links between the Revenue
and the exchange since 1984. The information gathered by the two
organisations was channelled via the exchange to the Serious Fraud Office.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Allcock said the exchange gave
the Revenue details of share transactions in exchange for information on a
network of Swiss companies allegedly linked to Mr Nadir.
Mr Allcock says the exchange's regulatory powers during the 1980s were 'a
joke' and its powers to investigate the money trail behind suspected illegal
share dealings was too restrictive.
The exchange has confirmed that its information gathering powers are
extremely limited. It refused to comment on the Nadir case. The Revenue said
information could only be given to other agencies in exceptional
circumstances, when it could receive details in return that furthered its
own inquiries. The SFO confirmed it received information from the exchange
on Mr Nadir, but denies collusion with the Revenue on the Nadir case, as
alleged by MP Mr Michael Mates.

FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Looking to computer technology for growth -
After centuries of papermaking, Portals sees a future in electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTALS has been producing banknote paper since 1712 when Henri de Portal, a
French refugee, set up a paper mill in Hampshire. Twelve years later the
company was supplying the Bank of England with its banknote paper, a
contract which it still holds today.
After the first world war the Bank of England allowed Portals to manufacture
paper for other banking and trade authorities and the group won its first
foreign government contract in 1921.
This century the demand for security paper has been fuelled by monetary
inflation, the emergence of post-colonial independent nations and most
recently the break-up of the Soviet bloc.
Security papermaking, augmented more recently by other specialist
papermaking activities such as teabag manufacturing, has proved an
appropriately mature niche business, delivering a steady performance. Last
year the division generated just over half of Portals' Pounds 194m turnover
and 70 per cent of profits.
But since 1988, when Portals acquired the Paragon electrical engineering
group and a new chief executive, Mr Michael Morley along with it, the
management has looked increasingly to the emerging protection and control
division to provide future growth.
This relatively new division groups together a handful of environmental
services, engineering and computer technology businesses. It has grown
quickly over the past five years although its profit contribution has
lagged, mainly because of of Airol-Flaregas, the lossmaking manufacturer of
low-emission burners for the petrochemical industry which was finally sold
in January.
That sale should enable Mr John Cope, a main-board director since September,
to pursue the goal of turning the division, and the Portals Computer
Technology businesses in particular, into Portals' 'engine for growth'.
Servelec, a small company based south of Sheffield, symbolises this
aspiration. The company which employs 220 people, three-quarters of them
engineers, provides its customers with highly sophisticated software
products and fully integrated systems built around a core software package
called 'Scope', which runs on desktop computers and workstations.
Servelec's products 'enable its customers to better control and manage their
businesses', says Mr Cope, one of the company's founder shareholders.
That means not only providing them with the information tools to improve
cost effectiveness and efficiency, but also enabling companies to meet the
growing burden of legislative, environmental and safety requirements.
Servelec, which posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 1.56m) on
turnover of Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 12.2m) last year, began in the late 1970s
designing and building process control systems for British Steel - an
industrial heritage which Mr Cope believes gives the small company a
distinct advantage over some of its larger rivals which include Logica and
EDS Scion.
Since then it has substantially broadened its customer base to include many
blue chip customers in the water, oil and gas, and food industries as well
as those in more traditional industrial sectors.
Building integrated systems around standard computer hardware platforms,
together with specialised microprocessor-based equipment supplied by two
smaller sister companies - Seprol and Technolog - Servelec has been
particularly successful winning customers for its telemetry systems in the
water industry.
All of the regional water authorities already have computer-based telemetry
systems, which enable managers and supervisors to monitor and control remote
sites like pumping stations or water treatment plants. However, the need to
upgrade and refurbish these systems provides a continuing source of
business.
More importantly in terms of growth, Servelec won a Pounds 2.8m contract
last year from Anglia National Rivers Authority for a regional telemetry
system which is integrated with a flood forecasting system. Other river
authorities are expected to follow suit and some analysts, including Mr
David McCrossan of Kleinwort Benson research, have estimated that this
market alone could be worth between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m over the next
10 years.
However Servelec's information gathering, control and analysis systems
potentially have many other applications.
Under one new contract worth Pounds 3m the company is building a
'supervisory control and data acquisition' system for the BBC which is
designed to monitor automatically almost 400 transmitter sites throughout
the UK.
The system contains predictive facilities to enable the BBC to anticipate
technical, security and other problems at transmitter sites and take
precautionary action.
Under another large contract Servelec is designing a replacement control and
monitoring system which will cover all the main utility services - including
the runway lights - at Heathrow airport.
Both Mr Cope and Mr Alan Gilby, Servelec's managing director, believe there
is a substantial pent-up demand for systems which combine the features of
traditional process control with management information systems. These can
then be integrated with other computer-based systems like financial
accounting and database systems to provide managers with a more
comprehensive view of their business.
But by designing the system from bottom-up, rather than from top-down, Mr
Cope insists Servelec can provide more effective products than many of its
competitors.
However, he accepts that if Servelec has a weakness it is 'in terms of our
marketing skills.' This, he says, is now being corrected.
Driven by recession-resistant factors like environmental and safety
concerns, as well as the desire for greater efficiency, Mr Cope believes
Servelec and Portals Computer Technology can deliver the kind of accelerated
growth Portals is seeking to offset its maturing papermaking business.

FT  09 JUL 93 / Management: Rolling out the contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversy has raged over the British practice of giving many company
directors three-year rolling service contracts since the UK's largest
pension fund declared war on them a month ago. But few people have stopped
to question the difference between rolling contracts and three-year,
fixed-term ones.
It is not always as great as it seems.
Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, who is leading the
campaign, says that 'a fixed (and renewable) contract of up to three years
gives us no qualms'.
Why not, when quite a number of three-year 'fixed' contracts are actually
renewed every year?
This makes them, in effect, rolling contracts of between two and three
years, depending how much time has elapsed.
The practice of such annual renewals is well-known to the highly-respected
Monks Partnership, which specialises in boardroom pay.
In a study undertaken a year ago, two-thirds of the chairmen and chief
executives of a sizeable sample of large companies said they were on notice
periods of exactly three years. Less than a fifth were on between one year
and three, 7 per cent were on less than a year, and almost a tenth were on
three years plus.
There has been little change since 1992, says Monks, although a few
companies have cut notice periods from three years to two. Most of the
36-month notice periods are of the truly rolling variety, but some seem to
be 'fixed', the firm adds.
With the emergence of this further quirk in British executive
feather-bedding, one can only admire last week's action of one large
company, GEC, in replacing three-year rolling contracts by a three-year
fixed term for new appointees; thereafter, they now get only a one-year
rolling contract.
Other companies should follow suit.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Canadian combination creates new
CDollars 20bn unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S financial services deregulation, coupled with the long recession
and rising competition, have forced the big Desjardins credit union movement
to consolidate with the publicly-held Laurentian Group.
Together, the newly-formed group will have corporate assets of around
CDollars 20bn (USDollars 15.6bn) and a further CDollars 50bn under
administration through its subsidiaries. It will rank as Canada's fifth or
sixth biggest financial services conglomerate, including units in banking,
trust services, life insurance and mortgages.
Desjardins will have majority control of the new Desjardins Laurentian
Financial Corp, taking in the financial services units of both groups.
However, Laurentian General, a property and casualty insurer, is excepted
from the deal. Laurentian Group's 50 per cent holding in this unit is being
sold to its partner, La Victoire of France, for an undisclosed sum. The
French company paid about CDollars 50m for its 50 per cent share in 1990.
Both Mr Claude Beland, head of Desjardins, and Mr Jacques Droin, chairman of
Laurentian, said the consolidation had been dictated by the heightened
competition resulting from globalisation of financial markets.
Laurentian had been seeking a strategic partner for more than a year, partly
to inject new capital in its life and general insurance unit. It negotiated
with several Canadian institutions. Desjardins operates 1,500 banking units,
mainly in Quebec, while Laurentian Bank operates in both Quebec and Ontario.
The two main life insurance subsidiaries of Desjardins and Laurentian will
be merged, although this arrangement excludes Imperial Life in Toronto.
Laurentian Group minority shareholders will receive a combination of cash
and common shares of Desjardins Laurentian Financial.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (8): Compromise specialist / Profile of
Vasso Papandreou
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHE HAS kept a low profile since returning from Brussels in January after
serving as the European Community's commissioner for social affairs. But if
the Panhellenic Socialist Movement returns to power, Vasso Papandreou may
find herself responsible for trying to improve Greece's relationship with
its EC partners.
'The climate towards us is still negative, both because of the economic
situation and our policy on Skopje (Macedonia),' she says. 'The only thing
that's changed is there are so many other pressing problems, there's less
time for getting upset with Greece.'
She notes that in spite of the conservative government's avowed commitment
to European union, Greek attitudes towards the community are still based on
taking rather than contributing. By way of example she names two prominent
cabinet ministers who have never bothered to attend an EC ministerial
council, preferring to send an under-secretary instead.
Ms Papandreou, an economist by training, is sharply critical of the
government's attempt to reform the economy. She argues that the present
stabilisation programme was too ambitious in its targets for cutting
inflation and the public sector deficit.
'What was needed was a medium-term approach. It's just not possible to bring
inflation down from 22 per cent to single digits in the space of two years,'
she says.
A more coherent policy is needed to reduce tax evasion, she says. Rather
than simply reducing the tax burden for high- and low-income earners, as the
government did last year, in the hope that the wealthy will be encouraged to
declare more of their income, a different approach is needed.
'With the highest proportion of self-employed earners in the community,
about 30 per cent, we have to use objective criteria of income. How about a
property tax, for example?' she says.
Ms Papandreou is sceptical of Greece's chances of meeting the Maastricht
targets for economic convergence, though she is by no means convinced that
other EC members will manage to keep the current timetable for economic
union.
'But in any case, it's not just a question of fulfilling macroeconomic
targets, but of real convergence, which means that Greece's per capita
income must rise to the EC average,' she adds.
When Pasok was in power in the 1980s, Ms Papandreou - who is not related to
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the socialist former prime minister - held a
succession of junior ministerial posts, from research and technology to
trade.
Despite a reputation for being a radical, she became popular with scientists
and businessmen alike for her willingness, rare in Greek politics, to build
compromises.
If Pasok comes back to power, she would join the moderate faction that calls
for a consensus approach to government, in contrast to the fierce
polarisation of political life cultivated by the socialists in the 1980s.
'Coming back to Greece this year, I was aware of a sense of frustration,
that the politicians were failing to offer anything substantive. There is
much more discontent than there used to be. On the other hand, there's a
greater maturity, especially among the business community which is now much
better equipped to compete in Europe,' she says.
For all Ms Papandreou's studied composure, there is a definite glint of
enthusiasm in her eyes at the prospect of an election, not to mention the
longer-term changes it will set in motion.
'There's going to be a period of uncertainty over the next year or so as
things are shaken out. But the departure of the old political leaders will
make it possible for attitudes to change,' she says.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (7): Streamlined food producer / Profile of
Delta Dairy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ITS matt grey floor and stainless steel fittings, the office of
Dimitris Daskalopoulos, chief executive of Delta Dairy, bears more than a
passing resemblance to a streamlined milking unit.
In fact, Delta has moved on from being Greece's largest fresh milk producer
to become its biggest food processor, adding ice-cream, chilled fruit juices
and frozen foods to the product list.
Turnover reached Dollars 235m last year, up from Dollars 160m in 1990, the
year that the company launched a Dollars 210m investment programme to expand
its dairy output. Pre-tax profits totalled Dollars 28m in 1992, a 5 per cent
decline from the previous year.
Last year, the company added new lines in juices and a series of milk
products aimed at the children's market, where consumption of tinned milk
has remained surprisingly high.
Sheep and goats used to be the main source of milk supplies. The fresh milk
supply was often limited to the surpluses from cheese and yoghurt-making.
Although output of cow's milk has soared, Delta is still obliged to offer
producers incentives and considerable back-up.
'Getting hold of enough fresh milk to meet steadily rising demand is a
constant problem,' Mr Daskalopoulos says. 'Fresh milk is a basic product but
it's still a big struggle to get our EC production quota increased, and we
haven't yet raised the issue of importing milk from the Balkan countries
with Brussels.'
Under Delta's vertically integrated system for milk production, Greek
farmers are offered favourable terms for buying cows imported from the
Netherlands.
To help standardise production, Delta acquired an animal feed plant which
sells to its milk producers at subsidised prices. Refrigerated milk tanks
are supplied free of charge and the company also runs seminars for farmers,
as well as a veterinary service.
Delta will start competing seriously in the yoghurt market at the end of
1993, when its new Dollars 30m plant outside Athens is due to start up.
'It will be tough at first because we're entering a mature market, competing
against well-established rivals. But it was the next move to be made,
considering that we also plan to export yoghurt,' Mr Daskalopoulos says.
Juice production has grown by leaps and bounds since Delta introduced
chilled orange juice to the Greek market four years ago. Its Life brand has
built up a 30 per cent share of the overall fruit juice market. This year,
Delta started exporting chilled fruit juices to France under its own label,
Delios, which are distributed by a French-based subsidiary.
'We're in all the main French outlets, and we're doing quite well,
especially with small packs,' Mr Daskalopoulos says.
However, the difficulties of transporting refrigerated juices across Europe
have worsened following the ban on transiting the former Yugoslavia, imposed
when UN sanctions were tightened in April.
Faced with a 25 per cent increase in transport costs and a loss of up to
five days in the product's shelf life, Delta decided to move some production
to Switzerland. A Swiss food processor, Milco, is to produce chilled fruit
juice under the Delios label for sale in France, Switzerland and northern
Italy.
The decision underlines Mr Daskalopoulos's uncertainties about prospects for
export growth to western Europe, 'where it's really very difficult for Greek
companies to compete successfully'.
He thinks the outlook is brighter in the Balkans, in spite of low consumer
spending there. Delta has invested about Dollars 4m in a joint venture to
produce and distribute ice-cream in Bulgaria.
'We've started sending ice-cream to Albania and Romania, where we're looking
for production facilities. We're developing a master plan for expanding into
the Balkans that will also cover fruit juices and yoghurt,' Mr Daskalopoulos
says.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Reprieved Sharif faces new perils: Farhan Bokhari interviews
the beleaguered Pakistani prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, is battling to survive in office
six weeks after his remarkable political comeback.
Sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on April 18 and re-instated by the
supreme court on May 26, Mr Sharif is trying to rebuild his relationship
with the president, one of his political mentors. They became foes as Mr
Sharif tried to reduce the president's powers. Mr Khan's attempt to dismiss
him on grounds of corruption and mismanagement was ruled illegal by the
court.
'I have never allowed considerations of personal ego or personal preferences
to guide my relations with other office holders such as the president,' says
Mr Sharif in an interview. 'It is now up to the other side to adjust
accordingly to the situation that has emerged after the restoration of the
national assembly and my government.'
In recent weeks, the leaders have had two meetings, their first for two and
a half months. Mr Sharif's hope that they will lead to an improved working
relationship is already being put to the test.
Last week the president demanded an explanation from Mr Sharif for his
declaration of federal rule in Punjab province. The provincial governor,
loyal to the president, had dissolved the Punjab assembly. A similar power
struggle is taking place in North Western Frontier Province.
Fears of intervention by the army were raised last week when General Abdul
Waheed, chief of army staff, advised Mr Sharif either to end the deadlock or
call fresh elections. However, most western diplomats and senior officials
discount the possibility of direct army rule or martial law.
Mr Sharif says: 'On account of past experiences, many people often express
unholy fears and needless concerns regarding the role of the army, although
the army has played a most commendable role of remaining neutral during the
recent political crisis.
'I have no doubt that in the future, the army will continue to remain above
the political fray and pursue a role of neutrality and not taking of sides
in national politics.'
Mr Sharif has been trying to woo the opposition parties, saying that a
better understanding between them is necessary to avoid any possibility of
another military coup.
'Our politics has suffered in the past due to confrontation,' says Mr
Sharif. 'In the ultimate analysis, it is the anti-democratic forces who
benefit. . . .'
Mr Sharif has failed to find common ground with the opposition People's
Democratic Alliance, led by Ms Benazir Bhutto.
Ms Bhutto, in a meeting with Mr Khan yesterday, urged the president to
dissolve the lower house of parliament, the national assembly, sack Mr
Sharif's government and hold fresh elections.
'A call for fresh elections is premature since at this point in time, such a
call will aggravate political instability and political uncertainty,' says
Mr Sharif.
Some ministers say privately that he will be open to calls for elections
once the president has reached the end of his term in November. (Mr Khan has
not yet made clear whether he intends to stand for re-election.)
While political stability is top of Mr Sharif's agenda, he also recognises
the need to make further progress with economic reforms. The budget deficit
for 1992-93 was a record Rs95bn (Pounds 2.4bn), compared with a target set
last year of Rs65bn. Part of the problem is the size of the defence budget
and the cost of debt servicing, which together accounted for Rs189bn of the
total budget of Rs305bn for 1992-93.
Mr Sharif's future will depend on how he tackles the hard political choices
and economic realities. His performance at home could determine the course
of democracy in a country gradually overcoming its bitter legacy of military
rule. He is hopeful: 'I will try and to put the country back on its
democratic path. There are certain difficulties, there are certain problems
in our way, but I hope these difficulties and problems will be overcome very
soon.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / Yeltsin to get power to agree credit terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian parliament yesterday sent Mr Boris Yeltsin on his way to the
Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo by proposing a decree giving the president
power to agree on the terms of foreign credit.
The resolution, proposed by Mr Sergei Mikhailov, deputy chairman of the
foreign affairs committee, and a hardliner, also set out that any new
obligations had to be agreed in advance with the parliament.
Despite parliament's unremitting hostility to the government's programmes
and actions, the government has continued with its efforts to press towards
further liberalisation.
Yesterday, it announced that punitive taxes on sales of oil over the
official ceiling of Rbs4,000 a tonne would be lifted, theoretically allowing
any price to be set. However, domestic industry will exert pressure which is
likely to ensure that the price is still kept lower than world levels. To
further cloud the price lifting, there was doubt whether the decree
abolishing taxes had received final approval.
The government yesterday also stressed the success of its anti-inflationary
policy. Inflation has fallen to around 15 per cent a month from around 30
per cent earlier this year.
Separately, the rouble appears to have stabilised at around 1,100 to the
dollar. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance,
optimistically predicts that inflation will continue to decline and that the
rouble rate will be held for some time.
In an interview in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta yesterday, Mr Fyodorov
pressed the case for Russia to join the G7 and said that the
responsibilities of reform rested with Russia. 'We maintain the firm
position that we do not ask for any help. We do not need anything free of
charge. Credit, yes, we will take what we need and we will not take what we
do not need,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk said yesterday Ukraine should claim
ownership of the nuclear weapons on its territory.
The statement suggests that Mr Kravchuk, who in the past has blamed
Ukraine's failure to ratify disarmament treaties on a hard-line lobby in
parliament, is shifting to a more hawkish stance on the nuclear issue.
On Friday parliament declared the 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles
stationed on Ukrainian territory to be national property.
American officials in Tokyo for the G7 summit yesterday voiced concerns that
the legislature's decision was another instance of Ukrainian foot-dragging
on disarmament, but they said they were reassured by Mr Kravchuk's continued
commitment to ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1)
and accession to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
However, Mr Kravchuk's comments could begin to erode his carefully
constructed image of a dovish leader under siege from a hard-line
legislature.
While that perception has eased Mr Kravchuk's relations with western
leaders, it could be a liability for the president in the national
referendum scheduled for September 26.
'My feeling is that it should be set down that Ukraine must be the owner of
nuclear weapons on its territory pending their destruction,' he said at a
meeting with collective farm chairmen.
Ukraine should, however, abide by its pledge to become a non-nuclear state
and ratify the Start 1 and NPT treaties, he said.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Recycling 'economically sound': German waste management
chief defends stance on plastics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Wolfram Bruck, chief executive of Duales System Deutschland (DSD),
Germany's national waste recycling venture, yesterday defended the country's
waste management scheme.
Mr Bruck said that DSD had conducted its own studies and could prove that
plastics recycling was economically and environmentally efficient. The
survival of DSD depends on the controversy regarding recycling plastics.
Germany, which has some of the strictest environmental laws, is currently
rethinking the high recycling quotas it is imposing on plastics packaging
collected by DSD.
The federal environment office, the principal think-tank behind
environmental policies in Germany, is conducting a study on whether plastics
should be incinerated rather than recycled and what is to be done with the
280,000 tonnes of plastics packaging for which there are no recycling
facilities in the country.
The problem of plastics waste disposal has become all the more urgent in
recent months following bitter attacks from France and the UK against German
waste exports. France has threatened to ban imports of German waste.
Mr Bruck pointed out the two plastics recycling methods - hydrogenation and
gasification - used in Germany.
Both methods, which consist of burning plastics and re-using the energy for
oil refineries or power plants, are environmentally controversial. Many
claim that the net effect on the environment is not positive because a high
amount of energy is used to burn the plastics.
Germany's federal environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, yesterday also
defended Germany's recycling scheme, adds Tim King in London.
Mr Topfer was speaking in London at the launch of a two-day seminar on
Britain, Germany and the new environmental agenda. He suggested the key to
improving environmental performance was to create, either by regulation or
price, bottlenecks in the market.
Excess of packaging waste amounted to a bottleneck which he hoped would be
solved by technological innovation.
There was now a stimulus for new technological processes, he said.

law

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Lennart Meri yesterday asked the Estonian parliament to reconsider
and amend a contentious aliens law that has strained relations with Moscow
and angered ethnic Russians here, write Matthew Kaminski in Tallinn and
Anthony Robinson in London. The Council of Europe has criticised the
proposed law as failing to give minorities the level of protection laid down
in the European Convention of Human Rights.
The law requires a language test for Estonian citizenship, a clause which
excludes most Russians, around 40 per cent of the population.
The president's move came shortly before the Estonian Defence Force
headquarters claimed that Russia had begun concentrating troops across the
river from Narva, the Russified eastern border city. The Russian parliament
voted last week to impose economic sanctions and halt troop withdrawals from
Estonia, fanning Estonian fears that Moscow wants to turn Estonia into
another Transdniestr, the contested region bordering Romania.
Estonians are also nervous about a decision by ethnic Russians to hold a
referendum on regional autonomy on July 16 and 17 in Narva and the nearby
town of Sillamae.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Europe becomes flashpoint for increase in armed conflicts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN the new world order, Europe, a region with virtually no military
conflicts during the Cold War, has become its main arena. In contrast a
number of protracted conflicts in Africa are ending and in Central and South
America they are declining in number.
According to the report, 'Armed Conflict at the End of the Cold War,
1989-92', by the Oslo-based International Peace Research Institute, the
number of global armed conflicts - particularly minor ones - increased in
1992, while the number of major conflicts remained virtually unchanged.
During the four-year period ending in 1992, a total of 82 armed conflicts in
60 locations involving at least 64 governments were identified in the
report. The most marked shift in the location of armed conflicts is that
Europe has again become a major arena. An escalation of conflicts outside
Europe has not occured.
The number of armed conflicts in Central and South America has decreased,
creating fragile but still less violent conditions. In Africa, solutions
have been found, notably in Western Sahara - but not without setbacks, as in
Angola.
The report warns that the pattern of 1992 - the only clearly post-Cold War
year - augurs badly for the future with a sharp rise in minor armed
conflicts.
The report defines armed conflicts as contested incompatibilities which
concern government and/or territory where the use of armed force by two
parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in a
minimum of 25 battle-related deaths during one year.
It says that during the four-year period, over one-third of all United
Nations member governments were directly involved in at least one armed
conflict. Of the 82 armed conflicts, 35 were recorded as wars, resulting in
at least 1,000 battle-related deaths in a single year. The report estimates
more than 70,000 battle-related deaths occurred in 1992 alone while for the
fouryears the number of deaths is likley to run to six digits.
Last year the number of minor armed conflicts showed a clear increase as the
number of intermediate armed conflicts - the more protracted ones - slowly
decreased. During the period the number of wars increased slightly. The
number of major armed conflicts remained virtually unchanged. The report
says the increase in low-intensity conflicts in 1992 may signal future
protracted conflicts. Some, including those in Georgia and Moldova, are
likley to intensify.
'Nevertheless the number of wars has been kept at a lower level - suggesting
that the international community has at least some capacity to contain
conflicts. The number of protracted conflicts testifies, however, to the
inability to find lasting solutions to well-known conflicts.' The report
notes a clear increase of armed conflicts in Europe. In 1989 there were two
conflicts, one new and very brief (Romania) and on very old and protracted
(Ireland). 'Since then new conflicts have been added continuously.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Field at premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Field Group, the packaging company, made a very impressive market debut. The
shares were offered for sale at 250p a share and more than seven times
oversubscribed.
The stock began trading at 276p, with buyers moving in and pushing the
volume up to 13m. It was the market's third most heavily traded stock
yesterday. The shares ended the day at 279p.
Field's warm reception had been expected. According to one trader, a premium
of 10 per cent on the offer price had been anticipated, while it closed just
short of a 12 per cent premium. 'There is a healthy demand for well-managed
companies such as this,' said the trader.
The company is the leader in the paper/packaging market and was part of a
Reedpack management buy-out in 1988 and underwent a second MBO two years ago
from SCA. The company intends to complete a Pounds 6m acquisition soon.
Policy Portfolio, a marketmaker in second-hand endowment policies, joined
the market with a placing of 3.6m shares at 130p. It began trading at 143p
and ended the day 3 down at 140p.
Sun Alliance was the best performer in the composite insurance sector, with
the market increasingly suspicious that Transatlantic, the insurance group
owned jointly by Liberty Life, of South Africa, and UAP, of France, may have
been quietly adding to its 3.01 per cent stake in the UK group. The shares
moved up 7 to 360p.
Transatlantic revealed what is described as a 'strategic' stake in Sun early
last month, triggering a rush of specula-tive buying in Sun shares, although
some analysts dismissed talk of imminent bid moves as premature.
Dealers said there had been persistent support for the stock yesterday, with
turnover reaching 1.9m shares, the highest single day's activity since the
middle of June.
Any increase of a percentage point or more above the 3 per cent level has to
be notified to the Stock Exchange.
Big exceptional provisions, largely against a US subsidiary, took the shine
off Dixons' results and the shares fell 15 to 195p in exceptionally heavy
turnover of 10m, the second largest in three years.
The restructuring charges set against Silo confirmed the worst fears of many
in the market. 'Dixons should cut and run on Silo,' said one disgruntled
analyst. While the UK business was holding up well, stores specialists said
Dixons' determination to put the business to rights will probably continue
to overhang the shares for several months.
Strong two-way business in Forte was prompted by a downgrade and reinforced
negative stance from NatWest Securities. The broker cited discounts being
offered by the hotel group in its business class hotels as evidence that
discounting was more widespread than was previously thought.
The shares, which have enjoyed a good run in recent weeks, initially dropped
on the news, but recovered as investors continued to believe the recovery
story. The stock closed unchanged at 226p after a hefty turnover of 11m
shares.
A 'take profits' recommendation issued by Kleinwort Benson Securities on the
insurance broking leaders upset companies such as Sedgwick and Willis
Corroon.
Ms Julianne Jessup, Kleinwort's analyst, highlighted the strong
outperformance of the stocks over the past three months and recommended a
switch into the smaller broking issues. Willis lost 7 at 217p and Sedgwick 4
at 196p.
International trading group Lonrho, which earlier this week appointed James
Capel as its joint broker with Strauss Turnbull, added 3 1/2 at 129 1/2 p on
talk of an imminent disposal.
Inchcape shed 12 1/2 to 545p, with Robert Fleming said to have turned
cautious on the stock. Further reflection on the recent restructuring plans
benefited Rothmans International, sending the stock forward 15 to 669p.
Sellers of Chubb Security, notably of a line of 6m at 300p, brought volume
to 11m as the shares dipped 3 to 310p.
Shares in British Aerospace recovered from an early retreat after the
release of a government study supporting its proposed regional jets joint
venture in Taiwan.
The stock declined last week on fears that the deal signed early this year
may have to be aborted due to a lack of funding. One analyst said: 'This
will be good news if it means the joint venture can now go ahead, otherwise
the regional jets division faces closure.'
Sentiment yesterday was also boosted by talk that Airbus Industrie, in which
BAe has a 20 per cent stake, was about to win a lucrative order for 44
Airbus aircraft. BAe shares closed 7 up at 399p after trade of 2m.
The big sell note from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken on Rolls-Royce continued to
exact a heavy toll on the stock and the shares relinquished 3 to 138p as
volume rose to 3.8m.
British Steel was the subject of a tax-related 'bed and breakfast' deal
which brought total turnover in the stock to 29m shares, including a block
of around 9m. The shares hardened 2 1/2 to 91p, with a leading US securities
house said to have recommended the stock.
Fears that the Vickers subsidiary Rolls-Royce Motor Cars will not break even
this year as expected, due to poor car sales, brought an early slide in the
shares. At the day's worst, Vickers was down 9 at 140p, before bargain
hunters helped to trim the decline. The shares were finally 4 off at 145p.
A squeeze in VSEL following an agency cross of around 100,000 shares at 845p
left the stock 20 stronger at 830p.
Bank of Ireland weakened 9 to 241p after announcing a one-for-six rights
issue that is intended to raise IPounds 100m. The bank said it would use the
funds to strengthen its capital base.

FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Weak foods rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The expected downgrades in the food retail sector began in earnest yesterday
as James Capel reduced its profits forecasts for the leading stocks. The
gloom over the sector for the past six months deepened on Friday following a
bearish statement accompanying Asda's results, which predicted tough trading
conditions in the sector for several years to come, prompting a rethink on
company profits by several brokers.
Capel reduced its food price inflation figures over the next three years,
with corresponding reductions in profits estimates for leading stocks. J.
Sainsbury, Tesco, Argyll and Kwik Save forecasts were reduced by Pounds 10m
for the current year. While the agency broker said the stream of negative
news on the sector may inject some buying activity on weakness, it remained
negative in the long term. Shares were also cheered belatedly yesterday on
the back of Sainsbury's agm statement. It gained 2 to 456p, as did Tesco, to
209p. Asda shares slipped  1/4 to 62 1/4 p, while Argyll steadied at 313p.
Kwik Save lost 6 to 715p.

FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tagamet boost for Beecham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement from UK drug authorities that an ulcer treatment from
SmithKline Beecham would be considered for over the counter (OTC) approval
boosted the shares, which advanced 11 to 436p with 3.5m traded.
Pharmaceutical analysts said the decision on Tagamet by the Committee on the
Safety of Medicines, which came after the stock market session on Tuesday,
was a good development for the group.
Tagamet, an important product in SmithKline's armoury, is the first drug in
its area of anti-ulcer treatment to receive this level of approval, and full
official blessing for sales without prescription will greatly enhance its
market share.
SmithKline's advance was mirrored in a perky health and household sector.
Wellcome jumped 20 to 678p, dealers attributing this largely to a technical
correction after recent weakness.
Bespak surprised the sceptics who had been forecasting a dent in the group's
profits, posting a good increase and improving the dividend. The shares made
some recovery from the dramatic losses incurred in recent sessions and
closed 56 up at 518p.

FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN stock index futures started on a weak note and deteriorated
throughout the morning, with dealers nervous from the previous day's Wall
Street performance and a dearth of economic indicators, writes Christine
Buckley.
In mid-morning trading the September contract on the FT-SE 100, which opened
the day at 2,841, touched a low of 2,828 - a fall of more than 100 points
from a brief high point last week of 2,933.
Its generally poor fortunes were exacerbated by one trader selling 500
contracts. There was also some unwinding by arbitrageurs.
But as dealers began to anticipate a reasonable early performance from
yesterday's Wall Street session the contract mustered a slight rally.
With that hope realised there was a sigh of relief and it moved up to close
at 2,851.5 - the same point at which it finished the previous day - in a
reasonable volume of 8,288 lots. There was additional bolstering of
confidence with the steady performance of US bonds.
The contract continued to trail its fair value premium to cash of 7 points -
ending 4 points below.
Traded options were lacklustre with volume down considerably - standing at
22,075 lots against Tuesday's 31,189. The FT-SE 100 option saw 7,752 lots
traded and 3,897 changed hands in the Euro FT-SE. Asda was the largest
traded stock option at 2,023.

FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally leaves shares just ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market success-fully resisted another bout of downside pressure
yesterday, as it clawed its way back from an unhappy opening, with the
upturn fuelled by a general advance by international stock markets.
The early weakness in London stemmed from a steep decline on Wall Street
overnight, following on the US market's poor performance last Friday, some
disappointing results from high street retailer Dixons, and yet more worries
about cash calls on the market.
Wall Street's 34-point Dow drop overnight was said to have been caused by
worries that the US Federal Reserve may move to tighten monetary policy in
response to growing worries about rising inflation in the US.
Adding to the market's discomfort was the latest upsurge in the bullion
price, which launched another attempt at piercing the Dollars 400 an ounce
level before backing off. Ris-ing gold prices are tradition-ally linked with
inflationary pressures.
The US market's sharp decline on Tuesday set the tone for London, with the
FT-SE 100 Index opening 6.5 lower at 2,841.6 and moving down to the day's
lowest point of 2,829.2 in mid-morning.
Dealers insisted, however, that there had been no heavy downward pressure on
the cash market and that the real pressure was being felt in the FT-SE
future, which traded at a discount during the morning.
A rally in the future set in just before Wall Street opened, dragging the
underlying market with it. The Dow Industrial Average opened on a firm note
and gradually moved up to stand around 19 Dow points higher as London
closed.
Another bullish factor for London was the sharp turnround by the leading
European bourses, notably in Germany where equities and bonds made rapid
progress in the afternoon, responding to persistent hints that a further
German interest rate cut is possible before the autumn. The encouraging news
on international trade emerging from the G7 meeting in Tokyo was seen as a
helpful factor in the rebound by world markets.
The FT-SE 100 nudged into positive territory only minutes before the close
of trading, ending a net 0.2 higher at 2,848.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index
fared less well, finishing a generally depressing session 12.2 lower at
3,219.9.
Turnover in equities was a respectable 586.2m shares, ahead of Tuesday's
554.3m and well up from Monday's meagre 384m shares. Yesterday's total
included 318.7m non-FT-SE 100 shares.
The big pharmaceutical stocks continued to attract strong support, on the
view that the sector has been heavily oversold in recent months. SmithKline
Beecham featured after being granted permission to sell its anti-ulcer
Tagamet drug over the counter.
Wellcome was well supported, as was Glaxo, although the latter lagged behind
the other two drugs leaders after reports of renewed selling from the US.
Utilities raced higher with the exception of the English generators, which
were affected by switching into the regional electricity stocks.
BT edged higher; the final stage of the BT3 share offer gets under way this
morning with the opening of the Global Book for the international offer.

FT  08 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks gain as inflation
worries abate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A RETREAT in commodity prices eased investors' inflation fears yesterday and
helped leading US stocks post solid gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.74 at 3,475.67. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.40 firmer at 442.83, but
the Nasdaq composite weakened 3.43 to 698.79. Trading volume on the New York
SE totalled 253m shares.
At the end of last week shares were hit by economic worries following a poor
June employment report; and at the start of this holiday-shortened week
prices fell further on inflation fears as the Commodity Research Bureau
index rose sharply.
Investors yesterday put their economic worries aside - news of a 1.7 per
cent rise in May wholesale sales provided some rare cheer - and, aided by a
decline in the CRB index, began buying stocks again. Demand, however, was
not particularly strong, with much of the buying restricted to investors
looking for bargains among the bigger-capitalised companies. There was no
lead from the bond market either, with Treasury prices ending little changed
yesterday.
Advanced Micro Devices firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 24 after the company
reported that net income in the latest quarter jumped 55 per cent. AMD also
unveiled a micro-processor product.
Elsewhere in the technology sector stocks were mixed. IBM eased Dollars  1/4
to Dollars 46 5/8 after Mr Louis Gerstner, the company's chairman, was
reported to have decided against a major restructuring of IBM's sales force.
Among other leading technology issues, Hewlett-Packard advanced Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 77 1/4 , but Digital Equipment lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
39 1/4 .
Airline issues continued to be hit by selling amid concern about demand for
air travel. AMR, parent of American Airlines, declined Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 59 5/8 , USAir slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 15 1/4 , Delta shed
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 3/8 and UAL fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 124 3/8 .
Also in the transportation sector, Airborne Freight dropped Dollars 3 1/2 to
Dollars 21 5/8 after broking house Robertson Humphrey lowered its short-term
rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'.
Newmont Mining, which on Tuesday jumped on higher metals prices, retreated
sharply by Dollars 3 to Dollars 55 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 83 3/8 in
volume of 5.6m shares after Goldman Sachs reduced its earnings estimate for
the company. Sequent Computer Systems plunged Dollars 5 to Dollars 11 3/4 in
volume of 7m shares following the profits warning from the company late on
Tuesday.
Canada
TORONTO ended lower after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index slipped
11.6 to 3,972.7 and falls outscored rises by 452 to 300. Volume came to
64.2m shares valued at CDollars 660.5m.
Only six of the 14 sub-group indices, however, lost ground. The energy group
had the day's biggest decline, 1.41 per cent, making a retreat over the past
four sessions of 6.1 per cent. The mining group shed 0.99 per cent as Inco
fell CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 28 7/8 and Alcan eased CDollars  1/8 to
CDollars 25. Both stocks were downgraded in ratings by SG Warburg. The golds
and industrial products sectors posted fairly sizeable declines.

FT  08 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt sees a strong rise
in post-bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXCITEMENT moved from Zurich to Frankfurt yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT moved from a negligible rise at midsession, with the FAZ index
2.16 higher at 663.65, through a gain of 18.89 to 1,719.76 in the DAX at the
close to a DAX level of 1,739.67 in the late post-bourse, up by 2.3 per cent
overall.
Turnover soared from DM5.2bn to DM8.3bn. Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in
Frankfurt, said that there had been forecasts a month ago of an extended
consolidation, taking the DAX as low as 1,550, and wide expectations more
recently of a 1,680 to 1,720 consolidation range.
However, there had been indications that the economy has touched bottom,
including this week's news of month-on-month gains (and reduced year-on-year
declines) in the pattern of manufacturing orders in west Germany. 'Some
stocks broke out of the range', said Ms Altmann.
BMW rose DM11.70 to DM521 and Daimler DM13.10 to DM617.60, the latter
accelerating to DM628 in the post bourse; and Volkswagen, which lagged
behind on the session with a DM2 gain to DM355.50, went on to DM364 after
hours.
Mr Christopher Will of Lehman Brothers, a consistent bull of the sector,
said that while sales to date in 1993 had been 'dreadful', and earnings this
year are likely to be non-existent, some things were getting better;
interest rates had come down and the D-Mark had weakened against the dollar.
He calculated that carmakers would be able to price their exports to the US
more competitively since the yen is rising against the dollar and the
Japanese are raising their prices in that market; BMW is likely to raise its
US sales ratio this year from 11 per cent to about 15 per cent of the total,
getting better profits out of a recovering market and the stronger dollar.
PARIS was lifted by technical trading late in the session, the CAC-40 index
ending 8.61 higher at 1,943.73 after a day's low of 1,920.
Turnover languished at FFr2.2bn. Peugeot featured with a gain of FFr14 to
FFr594, partly on hopes for recovery in 1994-1995. SocGen showed a rise of
FFr15 to FFr593 ahead of the launch of its ADR's in New York today.
Kuwait's interest in signing a deal with a French defence group came too
late to lift Matra Hachette or Thomson-CSF, which showed respective losses
of FFr2.20 and FFr4.40 to FFr132.00 and FFr168.10.
MILAN featured a strong performance from Fiat as rumours re-emerged of a
possible strategic alliance with another car manufacturer and/or imminent
asset sales.
Fiat gained L294 or 4.8 per cent to fix at L6,400, and then rose by another
L60 on the kerb.
Analysts remarked that there was nothing new in the rumours and that the
gains may reflect recent weakness. The shares remain some 9.5 per cent down
on the year's high of L7,070 reached in April.
The Comit index ended 0.30 lower at 533.27.
Among insurers, Ras put on L416 to L27,108 and Toro L500 to L28,980.
Benetton, which eased back slightly at the fix, came back with a L20 gain on
the kerb to L18,539. The group repeated at a presentation on Tuesday its
forecasts of a 8-9 per cent earnings growth this year, with sales rising to
L4,000bn by 1996 from L2,500bn in 1992.
AMSTERDAM saw a rise in the CBS Tendency index of 0.6 to 113.8.
KLM firmed Fl 1.10 to Fl 28.80 on an improvement in June load data while
Fokker went the other way, losing Fl 1.00 to Fl 16.00 on news of a Fl 334m
convertible bond issue.
ZURICH subsided on profit-taking, and selling of Nestle following Tuesday's
Goldman Sachs downgrade in New York. UBS fell SFr17 to SFr1,170 after
Tuesday's speculative gain of SFr53, and Nestle registered shed another
SFr29 to SFr1,089 as the SMI index fell by 17.5 to 2,373.0.
STOCKHOLM rallied after a weak opening helped by strength in Volvo and
Ericsson. The Affarsvarlden index closed 8.30 higher at 1,097.90 in turnover
of SKr777m.
Volvo B shares advanced SKr9 to SKr422 on reports from France that the
government there hoped a merger between the Swedish car maker and Renault
would be ready by August.
Ericsson put on SKr5 to SKr340 after a broker's upgrade.
MADRID remained muted, the general index losing 0.17 to 257.66 in thin
turnover. Banesto, which launched its Dollars 1.2bn equity offering, slid by
Pta60 to Pta1,970.
TEL AVIV fell for the third consecutive day, this time on mutual fund
selling. The Mishtanim index closed 3.52 lower at 190.78.
DUBLIN saw a 3.2 per cent drop in financials, and a 34.87, or 2.1 per cent
fall to 1,594.46 in the ISEQ overall index, following rights issue news from
the Bank of Ireland, which fell 11p to 250p; Allied Irish Banks fell by 10p
to 262p, although analysts said that a cash call from AIB was unlikely.

SHARE prices were dragged down by late position adjustments by dealers in
the futures market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 109.11 to 19,720.67 after fluctuating between
19,634.26 and 19,828.88. Profit-taking depressed stock futures after
Tuesday's rise on speculation about a discount rate cut following the G7
summit.
Buying by public pension and insurance funds helped volume to rise from 180m
to 240m shares. Declines outnumbered rises by 578 to 365, with 194 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 8.52 to
1,584.38, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was a slight 0.97 firmer at
1,200.91.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, indicated that he was still
pessimistic over an imminent economic recovery. In a press conference after
the stock market closed yesterday, he said it was premature to declare that
the economy had bottomed out and was heading for a full recovery.
Profit-taking depressed issues which had gained recently. Shionogi, the drug
maker which replaced Nikkatsu as a Nikkei index component stock, fell Y20 to
Y1,070. Oil refiners, which had risen on reports of lower crude oil prices,
lost ground, with Cosmo Oil down Y8 to Y844 and Nippon Oil Y4 off at Y802.
Mining shares were higher on the rise in gold prices overseas. Sumitomo
Metal Mining, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y10 to Y1,060 while
Mitsui Mining and Smelting rose Y5 to Y522.
Banks were hit by technical trading. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y30 to
Y2,950 and Mitsubishi Bank weakened Y30 to Y2,730.
Consumer electronics companies were depressed by profit-taking, with Toshiba
shedding Y4 to Y669 and Matsushita Electric Industrial dipping Y20 to
Y1,240. Car makers were also weaker. Toyota Motor fell Y30 to Y1,520 and
Honda Motor lost Y30 to Y1,260.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 65.93 off at 21,725.88 in volume of 15.5m
shares. Shimano, the bicycle parts maker, climbed Y40 to Y2,640 on
expectations of firm profits.
Roundup
THERE were more gains than declines around the Pacific Rim, mostly for
reasons individual to each market.
AUSTRALIA saw buyers scrambling for gold stocks as bullion prices held firm
after a surge in New York overnight. The gold shares index climbed a further
61.9 to 2,218.3, helping the All Ordinaries index to gain 8.8 at 1,773.0.
Turnover was ADollars 394.2m.
Among gold issues, Newcrest Mining moved forward 21 cents to ADollars 5.09,
Poseidon 16 cents to ADollars 4.06 and Placer Pacific 15 cents to ADollars
3.65.
MANILA broke the 1,600 barrier, spurred by Philippine National Bank, which
rose 12.50 pesos to 295 on its change of management. The composite index put
on 12.99 at 1,606.50 as combined turnover expanded from 340.7m to 501m
pesos.
BANGKOK rose through 900, the SET index ending 15.58 higher at 903.00 in
heavy turnover of Bt10.52bn. Small speculative stocks were active in early
morning trade but buyers then turned to the bigger counters. First Bangkok
City Bank firmed Bt1.75 to Bt21.25 in Bt1.41bn volume and was the most
active stock.
KARACHI's multinationals posted fresh gains on foreign buying as the KSE
index added 9.40 at 1,253.54.
HONG KONG saw mild afternoon profit-taking, and the Hang Seng index
retreated 27.23 to 7,141.11. The most active stock was takeover target
Miramar Hotel, which appreciated 30 cents to HKDollars 16.50 in morning
volume of nearly 200m shares.
SINGAPORE fell on the weakness of a few index stocks. The Straits Times
Industrial index lost 16.48 to 1,802.49, led lower by Singapore Press,
Keppel Corp, Inchcape and Sembawang Shipyard.

FT  08 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Global emerging markets reveal
ascendant form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMERGING stock markets put in a strong showing in 1992, according to data
released this week by the International Finance Corporation in its annual
factbook*.
The figures reveal that emerging markets took eight of the top 10 places in
a list of 54 countries, including all of the mature equity markets in the
world. The greatest gains, measured in dollar terms, came from Jamaica, Peru
and China.
Market liquidity and high performance do not exactly go hand in hand. None
of the top three appear in the IFC's investable indices, launched earlier
this year, which take into account restrictions on foreign investment. The
data also confirm that emerging markets remain among the most volatile in
the world, taking nine of the bottom 10 places.
The IFC, a subsidiary of the World Bank, comments that there has been rapid
growth among the world's emerging markets over the past decade. Taken as a
group, market capitalisation has increased by about 11 times, and trading
volume by 25 times, while the Mexican, Korean and Taiwanese markets are
among the 15 largest markets in the world as measured by market
capitalisation.
The IFC notes a number of trends which have fuelled growth in emerging
markets recently and are likely to maintain the momentum in the 1990s.
These include:
the adoption by many dev-eloping countries of more market-orientated
policies;
the opening of hitherto closed sectors, such as commercial banking, to
overseas investors;
the restructuring of the corporate sectors in many markets;
privatisation of state-owned companies, especially in Latin America and
south-east Asia.
So far this year Turkey leads the field, showing a gain in dollar terms of
more than 120 per cent; and in spite of a setback this week following a
resurgence of violence by the Kurds, most analysts believe that its record
run remains on course.
The market has been encouraged by the election of Ms Tansu Ciller as prime
minister on hopes that she will be able to push through economic reforms
aimed at reducing inflation and controlling the budget deficit. A series of
privatisations is also being anticipated.
Schroder Securities in London, in its monthly commentary on the Turkish
market, notes that during the week in which Ms Ciller was elected to office
 -June 13 to June 18 - the composite index appreciated by some 18 per cent.
'Excess liquidity and Ms Ciller's success in forming a cabinet seems likely
to keep the bull market running for at least the rest of the year; while the
prospect of half-year results due out by the end of July is likely to create
speculative buying this month,' the report observes.
Given the more optimistic economic, political and corporate picture, the
brokers forecast a level of between 14,000 to 15,000 for the composite index
by the end of the year.
Asian markets have generally performed positively this year. However, Asia
Equity in its quarterly review cautions against excess enthusiasm.
Mr Stephen Brown writes that while headline GDP growth among the Asian
economies looks impressive, 'it is far from balanced within each economy
and, as each country's equity market is far from being a representative
cross-section of the respective underlying economies, this is translating
into intermittent and sectorally orientated growth'.
He favours Hong Kong and Singapore over the next quarter, underweighting
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
In Latin America, Peru eased back a little on profit-taking after reaching
an historic high, according to Latin American Securities in London.
The market has been encouraged by the recent launch of the first private
pension funds, success in securing new international loans, the reduction of
various import and luxury taxes and good economic data.
In addition, the normalising of relations between Venezuela and Peru, says
Latin American Securities, will ensure that Peru can now take part in
regional trade discussions.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen rises on official comments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN enjoyed a strong rally against the dollar in early European trading
yesterday after a Japanese government official suggested that exporters in
his country would not feel constrained by the current exchange rate, writes
James Blitz.
The official, who was unnamed, said the pain threshold for Japanese
exporters could be on the Y105 to Y95 range against the US dollar. Such
comments have been made by officials before. But the US-Japanese trading
relationship is an important issue at the G7 summit in Tokyo, and the market
was sensitive to any news affecting the yen/dollar exchange rate.
Another factor which pushed the yen higher was reported at the Tokyo summit
on completing the Uruguay round of the Gatt. A move away from trade
protectionism would initially give a strong boost to Japanese export
penetration in western markets, improving their current account surplus.
Both of these factors gave the yen a strong lift at the start of European
trade. At 7 am London time the yen was at Y108.70 to the dollar, and had
moved to a high for the day of Y106.77 within 3 hours.
However, in the afternoon, the Japanese currency lost ground. Political
turmoil in Japan remains a strong constraint on the yen's rise and there are
fears of a hung parliament following elections this month. The yen closed in
London at Y107.70 to the dollar, up Y0.50 on the day. It finished New York
trading at Y107.55.
The yen's strength came in spite of a firm performance by the dollar against
the D-Mark. The US currency may have been boosted by the sharp rise in
commodity prices in recent days, following continued flooding in the US
Midwest. This has raised speculation of an upturn in US inflation, something
that would have to be countered by a rise in short-term interest rates.
The dollar ended at DM1.7075, up  3/4 pfennig on the day. The US currency
also pushed the pound back through the Dollars 1.50 barrier to close in
London at Dollars 1.4925, down 1 3/4 cents. In New York the dollar closed at
DM1.7070 and Dollars 1.4935.
Sterling's strong rise against the D-Mark in the past week was also checked.
One dealer said yesterday that there had been strong selling of the pound in
the US on Tuesday night after the UK currency hit DM2.57.
After the powerful rise of recent days some profit-taking was to be
expected. Another factor undermining sterling was the concern registered by
EC officials over what was seen as the UK's huge structural budget deficit.
The pound closed at DM2.5475, a fall of 2 pfennigs on the day.
The French franc was a fraction weaker against the D-Mark, in spite of
continuing speculation that the Bundesbank might cut its short-term interest
rates again before its summer recess begins on July 29. The franc ended at
FFr3.382 from a previous FFr3.381.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH franc interest rate futures enjoyed a small rise yesterday following
the curr-ency's slightly stronger per-formance on the foreign exchanges,
writes James Blitz.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said earlier this week that
German inflation was slowly moving towards the bank's target level of 2 per
cent.
This comment continued to have a strong effect on the market, and dealers
continued to speculate that the Bundesbank might cut its official interest
rates before it starts its summer recess on July 29. France might then be
able to reduce its intervention rate, currently at 6.75 per cent.
The September French franc contract rose 8 basis points to close at 93.55,
while the December contract moved up 6 basis points to finish at 94.27.
Three-month French cash also dropped back slightly after appreciating
strongly earlier in the week: yesterday it closed at around 7 per cent on
the bid side, having been at around 7.06 per cent earlier in the day.
There was little change in German markets following what appeared to be a
neutral money market operation by the Bundesbank.
A fixed rate repo of 7.30 per cent had already been announced last week for
shorter dated maturities, and the variable rate facility was put at 7.33 per
cent. The only issue concerning dealers yesterday was the size of the
allocation of funds: but this amounted to a net drain of DM5.6bn, which was
widely seen as a neutral move.
The bullishness in UK markets about another base rate reduction continued
yesterday, with futures dealers looking for another  1/2 percentage point in
the winter.
However, the short-dated contracts took a small fall after Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor, said at the G7 summit that cuts in German rates
did not imply cuts in UK rates. The September contract closed 4 basis points
down at 94.29, and the December contract was 3 basis points off at 94.44.
There was little change in three-month money, which again closed at 5 7/8
per cent. But again there were difficulties removing a Pounds 1.55bn
shortage, because dealers were unwilling to offer bills to the Bank of
England amid rumours of base rate cuts. The overnight rate was as high as
7.70 per cent at one stage.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rare pest threatens UK wheat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK WHEAT farmers are reporting attacks on their crops by a rare pest at
levels that have not been seen for 100 years.
The orange blossom midge, a flying insect whose larvae attack developing
grain, was last seen in the UK in Yorkshire in 1976-78, according to Mr
Peter Limb, chairman of the National Farmers Union cereals committee. 'We
are getting reports from Wiltshire through the grain growing areas to
Yorkshire, right round the coast,' said Mr Limb, who estimated the area
affected at half the UK grain crop.
In badly affected areas crops could be reduced by 25 to 30 per cent, he
said, although nationally the yield should be reduced by only between 2 and
5 per cent. However, the milling wheat used for bread making suffers more
from the insect than feed wheats.
UK bread wheat prices are already forecast to end this year at the same
level as last year in spite of reforms to the European Community's common
agricultural policy aimed at cutting cereal prices. The Home Grown Cereals
Authority is quoting bread wheat for delivery in the final quarter at Pounds
135 a tonne, unchanged from the 1992-93 final quarter.
The sharp devaluation in the green pound and a tight balance between supply
and demand in the coming harvest have combined to keep prices high. The
green pound - the artificial exchange rate at which EC guarantee prices are
converted into sterling - has suffered a net devaluation of around 19 per
cent since July last year following the withdrawal of sterling from the EC
Exchange Rate Mechanism. This has helped to offset the cut in EC grain
intervention prices from Ecu 150 to Ecu 117 (Pounds 89) a tonne this year.
Observers point out that grain prices in EC countries with strong
currencies, such as France and Germany, will see a marked reduction in
cereal prices.
The CAP reform provisions for setting aside productive land have led to a
fall of 13 per cent in the area of UK land sown to wheat. But the area for
bread wheat is down by less than 1 per cent. According to the HGCA, if
milling variety yields average 6 tonnes a hectare, production will be more
than 2.5m tonnes, while demand is expected to be between 2.5m and 3m tonnes.
The National Association of British and Irish Millers has already warned
that bread wheat supply could be very tight this year, especially if the
weather is poor at harvest.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taiwan's state sugar company in
Vietnam refinery plan
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN SUGAR Company, the island's state-owned processed food maker, plans
to invest in a Dollars 58m sugar refinery in Vietnam. The project may help
Taisugar cope with growing competitive pressure to lower sugar prices just
as declining acreage and higher wages are boosting production costs.
A new fair trade statute and Taiwan's proposed accession to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are opening the market to more local and
international competitors, thus eroding Taisugar's domination.
Farmers are now more reluctant to grow sugar, while local businessmen are
calling on Taisugar to turn some of its landholding for use by other
industries and housing. The result is a decline in land devoted to sugar
cultivation.
Vietnam offers Taisugar an opportunity to ease the pain of transition. 'We
need to import sugar and need land to grow it. Vietnam needs both investment
and sugar,' said Mr Cheng Hung-tsai, deputy general manager.
Mr Cheng noted that Vietnam now imported all of its sugar, even though its
climate was favourable for sugar cultivation and wages were relatively low.
'If we can proceed with the project, the Vietnamese government will welcome
us,' he said.
The proposal is now under review by the the ministry of economic affairs'
commission of national corporations. If approved, the plan will be included
in Taisugar's budget for the 1995 fiscal year, begining July 1 1994) for
review by the legislature, Mr Cheng said.
The plant would initially produce 99,000 tons of raw granulated sugar
annually. Most of the output would be sold in Vietnam but Taisugar aims to
export a portion back to Taiwan for refining.
According to the present plan, the Vietnamese government would contribute 25
per cent of the required capital, with Taisugar providing 37.5 per cent and
other Taiwan-based food companies adding another 37.5 per cent.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash squeeze chokes Chinese
copper trade - A problem caused by efforts to cool the overheated economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERT ATTEMPTS by the Chinese government to cool its overheating economy
have come at a bad time for some of the country's big raw materials
suppliers, who are unable to sell more than 50,000 tonnes of copper now
clogging the eastern port of Shanghai.
Traders and brokers in Beijing and Hong Kong say the copper could be sitting
on ships until the end of the year or even longer because Chinese buyers
have no cash to pay for it. Until recently, China was the world's biggest
purchaser of copper, last year importing more than 500,000 tonnes of the
700,000 tonnes it needed - and maintaining inflated prices.
Copper began the year as high as USDollars 2,400 a tonne but China's
about-turn from buyer to seller saw the price plunge in early April to its
lowest point in five years, Dollars 1,756 a tonne.
On the London Metals Exchange the three months delivery price is hovering
around Dollars 1,950 a tonne and brokers say it is unlikely to break the
Dollars 2,000 mark for months to come as the market has come to terms with
the fact that supply now outstrips demand, stocks are high and China can no
longer buy.
Now China's severe cash-flow problems, compounded by the volatility of the
yuan currency and uneasiness about macroeconomic policy direction as the
government has finally recognised the need to slow growth, are keeping the
country's metals trade 'desperately quiet', analysts say.
'Sellers in China are generally cash sellers and if they can't see the
colour of your money, they won't give credit,' says a broker based in
Beijing with an international company.
He notes that the copper stuck in Shanghai has been purchased by large state
and regional corporations that can 'afford to ride out the storm' even
though they may not be able to redeem their outlay before the end of this
year or possibly early in 1994.
The head of a Hong Kong trading company says all available cash for imports
has been spent on steel in the first half. A hundred ships carrying steel
for China's booming construction industry were unloaded in Shanghai's
Huangpu Port in May and June, he says, 'consuming all the available US
dollars'.
Beijing announced last weekend a 16-point plan to control inflation, now
running close to 20 per cent in the cities, which includes curbing bank
lending and delaying some infrastructure projects. The hit-list was revealed
soon after Vice Premier Zhu Rongji took on the extra job of governor of the
central bank, the Bank of China, replacing Mr Li Guixian.
Whether or not Mr Zhu's plan for economic stability can break China's almost
traditional boom-bust-boom cycle remains to be seen. Previous attempts, such
as in 1988 when runaway inflation led to panic buying and, eventually, to
the anti-government demonstrations that were quelled by the army on June 4
the following year, saw imports all but halted.
This time China is expected to keep its markets open, but with credit drying
up, it is difficult to see how the government can bring the economy in for
the 'soft landing' it is now promising.
Provincial importers have had to deal with a more than 25 per cent
devaluation of the yuan since the government removed the ceiling on exchange
rates on June 1. The yuan has only stabilised in recent days on the
semi-official swap markets, which handle about a third of all trade-related
currency exchanges.
On Monday the rate against the US dollar strengthened for the first time
since the deregulation, closing at 9.8583. It had fallen to as low as 11.
The official exchange rate remains 5.7 yuan to the dollar.
Domestic copper prices have only recently fallen to match the LME price, a
sign analysts agreed pointed to a broad and welcome tightening that could
see construction and capital works slow and soaring property prices soften.
'When prices are unrealistically high, it's like a house of cards that needs
to fall down,' says the Beijing broker. 'I don't think the economy will go
into a meltdown, but it needs to come down across the board and the current
tightening is healthy.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lack of incentive locks up
Mongolia's gold - Restrictive investment laws that are discouraging mine
developers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SAMBUUGIN Gereltuya, director of Mongolia's mineral processing
technological centre, has a problem. His organisation owns a
commercially-viable gold mine, but because of his impoverished country's
restrictive gold acquisition policy, there is no incentive to develop the
mine.
As in neighbouring China, the Mongolian central bank is empowered to acquire
all gold produced at a price well below that prevailing internationally,
with the result that gold mining is not commercially viable. The recent
heavy depreciation of the local currency, the tugrik, after it was floated
has exacerbated the problem.
'No official has said anything about changing the price. If the old price
doesn't change, we cannot develop the mine,' says Mr Gereltuya ruefully. The
exploitation of mineral resources, particularly gold and platinum, would
seem to offer Mongolia, which is believed to be rich in such resources, the
best prospect for improving its disastrous foreign exchange position.
The country's new foreign investment law also acts as a disincentive to
much-needed foreign participation in the capital-intensive gold mining
sector. The law, passed in May, obliges foreign companies to pay the full
tax rate from the outset on profits gleaned from the production of precious
metals. There is no provision for tax holidays or other incentives.
Tough laws relating to gold production stand in marked contrast to the
relatively favourable terms being offered for the exploitation of most
minerals and oil and gas, under which companies are being offered a
five-year tax holiday, to be followed by a further five years at 50 per cent
of the full tax rate.
Mongolia's stumbling approach to providing incentives for development of its
gold sector is typical of this landlocked country's uncertain progress
towards the international mainstream after being almost totally dependent on
Moscow for the past 70 years.
When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991 Mongolia lost the life-line that
had provided everything from food, clothing, oil and electricity to chewing
gum, teapots and light bulbs. After the collapse, Mongolia's GNP shrank by
10 per cent, foreign trade volume fell by 60 per cent and national income
fell 13 per cent to USDollars 10bn. Foreign debt has reached Dollars 12bn
and aid last year totalled Dollars 220m.
Adding to the disastrous situation were the losses incurred by officials of
Mongolia's Central Bank, who squandered about Dollars 80m, virtually the
whole of the country's foreign exchange reserves, in ill-advised currency
speculation.
Mr Wilhelm Nahr, resident representative in Ulan Bator, the Mongolian
capital, for the International Monetary Fund, which last year negotiated a
reform package with the government, says simply: 'They are faced with a
complete lack of foreign resources'.
Commitments entered into under a typical IMF assistance programme included
undertakings to move the local currency towards convertibility, controls on
the deficit and liberalisation of trade policies. Mongolia's trade is at
present almost exclusively in copper barter deals. Last year's production of
about 250,000 tonnes was, as usual, swapped with Russia for spare parts, oil
and consumer goods.
Among the areas where Mongolia is in desperate need of assistance is
infrastructure. The country's phone system is appalling, many of its roads
are impassable for much of the year and its rail links are extremely
limited. Mr Lawrence Lien, a consultant to the United Nations Development
Programme, believes that Mongolia needs to do much more to encourage foreign
investment in both the resources area, where prospects are good, and in
infrastructure. 'You need to have an arrangement for the recovery of
investment quickly,' he says. 'Mongolia must, if it want foreign partners
for infrastructure development, create a situation that allows for faster
return.'
Among the steps that he suggests should be adopted immediately to encourage
infrastructure development are more generous tax laws and a provision that a
foreign partner gets paid before the local partner. 'All these things look
like exploitation,' he admits, 'but in reality these are incentives for
foreigners to come and take substantial risks for substantial return.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With no wool being held in the main wool producing countries, prices are
static. In wool-using countries holidays are beginning to have their usual
effect, underlining dullness due to the recess in the wool selling season.
Sales from the Australian stockpile continue, at a low but not discouraging
rate, with the emphasis on superfine merino fleece but some support
elsewhere. The feeling is that at present wool prices production in primary
markets will decline more than already forecast. Recovery in the UK and US
economies is not seen as sufficient to offset recession in Japan and Europe
which used to buy large quantities.

COPPER prices burst higher at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon
after a bear raid linked to July traded options declarations had pushed
values lower in earlier trading. The three months position, which had been
as low as Dollars 1,920 a tonne, closed at Dollars 1,956.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 10 on balance, and moved on to Dollars 1,974 a tonne in after-hours
trading. Dealers attributed the late surge to the weight of investment fund
and speculative buying. ALUMINIUM's weaker trend continued, with three
months metal closing Dollars 13.75 down at Dollars 1,240.75 a tonne. Dealers
said upside momentum had run out in the absence of follow-up production
decisions after Aluminum Company of America's announcement of cuts last
week. The NICKEL market ended steadier after becoming oversold in the
morning's fall to six-year lows. Technically-inspired buying saw the three
months delivery price rally to Dollars 5,252.50 at the close, up Dollars
37.50 on the day. COCOA and COFFEE prices recouped early losses at the
London Commodities Exchange to end little changed on the day. Fears of a
July cocoa squeeze had evaporated, traders said.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold surge falters at Dollars
400
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD price was only 75 cents away from Dollars 400 a troy ounce at one
stage in London yesterday. But the precious metal's attack on the
psychologically-important level faltered in the face of profit-taking by New
York funds and it closed in London at Dollars 394 an ounce, up Dollars 2.25
on the day.
Dealers suggested it would not be long before gold was driven through
Dollars 400 by the weight of money behind recent options buying and other
technical factors.
Silver, the best performer in the recent precious metals rally, traded near
three-year highs, reaching Dollars 5.20 before determined selling after the
New York market opened saw it retreat to close unchanged in London at
Dollars 5.08 1/2 an ounce. Platinum touched a 28-month peak before closing
at Dollars 406.25.
'Low interest rates are forcing hot money into fairly thin markets such as
those for precious metals and gold shares,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at
the Union Bank of Switzerland. 'We must not try to attach any logic to it.'
He pointed out the gold market was ignoring what should be bad news such as
'discordant noises from Beijing about cooling the Chinese economic boom, US
long bonds flat at all-time lows, oil prices at their lowest for more than
two years and Taiwan's announcement today that gold imports in June plunged
by 40 per cent'.
Other analysts saw the gold market in a different light. Mr Jeffrey
Christian, managing director of the New York-based CPM consultancy group,
insisted the recent rise was 'not merely a 'paper' rally but there is a
strong, broad-based physical demand'.
More important, according to Mr Christian, there were a wide range of
reasons given by investors for their present interest in gold 'which
suggests the rally might continue longer than would be expected if only one
or two reasons were given'.
Nevertheless, in CPM's latest Market Timing Advisory publication, he warns
that in August and the third quarter some holders of long gold futures
positions could reverse their tactics and knock prices back. Also, 'some of
the central banks which sold call (buying) options over the past two months
are prepared, even eager, to allow these positions to be exercised. Should
this happen, there could be several million ounces of bullion entering the
physical market, helping to halt any further rally'.

market

OIL PRICES slipped by 30 cents in light trading in London yesterday as many
traders stayed out of the market because of uncertainty over the Iraqi oil
talks in New York. The Baghdad government is talking to the United Nations
about a one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil to pay for humanitarian
aid.
North Sea Brent crude for August delivery dropped from Dollars 17.20 a
barrel to Dollars 16.90 a barrel after edging upwards on Tuesday as traders
took profits on short positions following large falls last week.
The talks broke up yesterday with the leader of the Iraqi delegation saying
they had been 'in a spirit of co-operation'. Iraq is believed to have
softened resistance to some conditions attached to the sale. Talks resume
today and could take over a week.
'The market is nervous and thin,' said one trader. Buyers have been
reluctant to stock up ahead of the Iraqi oil talks as if they are successful
and Iraqi oil returns to the market, prices could plunge.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is monitoring the
situation carefully and would probably call an emergency meeting if the
talks proved successful.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Treuhand auction gives impetus to bund
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WELL-RECEIVED bond auction in Germany provided an impetus for bund
investors yesterday.
The DM4.25bn auction of bonds issued by Treuhand, the state agency
responsible for privatising companies in the former east Germany, resulted
in an accepted bid price of 99.49 and a yield of 6.7 per cent. There was no
official statement of the demand but dealers said it was well-covered with
considerable domestic interest.
Traders said investors were selling bund futures to buy the Treuhand bonds,
which form part of a DM10bn issue announced on Tuesday.
The sale was the main factor in a generally quiet day with no signals coming
from the repo rate announcement - the variable rate was left unchanged at
7.3 per cent - and little indication that the Bundesbank intended to cut
rates when it next meets on July 15.
However, economists hope to glean some information from the next money
supply growth figures, due at that central bank meeting. The last M3 figure
of 6.7 per cent was above the central bank's target range and if next week's
figure is within the range there is a greater chance of a further monetary
easing at the final council meeting before the summer break on July 29.
Futures selling to buy the Treuhand bond saw the bund contract for September
lose earlier gains and close only 2 basis points higher at 95.39.
THE UK government bond market ran out of steam yesterday as both sterling
and gilts had been considered overbought.
With no economic data on the horizon and the tap of 9 per cent stock dated
2008 said to be finally exhausted, the gilts market drifted. Any support
that it received was psychological and came from overseas. Gilt futures for
September were down on the previous close but  1/8 up on the day.
FRENCH government bonds held steady yesterday despite a growing belief that
they have hit a short-term high and are ripe for profit-taking.
Bond prices were helped by a slightly stronger franc, which recovered from
recent weakness against the D-Mark. The yield spread between French and
German 10-year government bonds remained very low, closing at 6 basis
points, according to JP Morgan. On the Matif, September futures rose 0.18 to
119.78.
JAPANESE debt prices were weaker in Tokyo as the Bank of Japan sought to
pour cold water on increasingly heated rate cut rumours.
Speculation has gathered pace that the central bank will cut its official
discount rate, presently at 2 1/4 per cent, by as much as 50 basis points.
Although it is considered unlikely that the bank will ease before the
general election on July 18, traders have been busily discounting any
change.
At its money market operations yesterday, the central bank provided far less
supply than expected and forced short-term rates higher.
The yield on the JGB No 145, which has been below 4.3 per cent in the past
few days, rose to 4.35 per cent and when Japanese bond futures began trading
in London, the September contract slipped 7 basis points to 109.13.
Following comments from a Japanese government official that the pain
threshold for Japanese exporters could be Y95 to Y105 against the dollar,
the September contract recovered to close at 109.30.
AFTER posting early gains on cheaper commodities, US Treasuries fell back as
commodity prices retraced their steps.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 105
11/32 , yielding 6.679 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.992 per cent.
After Tuesday's steep rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index had
deflated Treasury prices, yesterday morning's retreat in the index prompted
some buying among market participants, mostly the professional dealers.
Treasuries fell back from their early gains, however, when the CRB index
began to recover.
Otherwise, attention was focused on the Federal Reserve's Open Market
Committee, which was meeting to discuss monetary policy. Although the rise
in the CRB index raised some fears that the FOMC would keep its strategy
tilted towards tightening monetary policy, most analysts believe it will
vote to return the bias to neutral in the wake of weak employment data.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Benetton launches L200bn deal with
'knock-out warrants'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL bond market saw plenty of activity yesterday as borrowers
 -consisting mainly of corporate names - launched an assortment of
equity-linked and straight bond issues.
Benetton, Italy's best-known maker of casual clothes, issued L200bn of
Eurobonds with 'knock-out warrants' through its Dutch subsidiary, Benetton
International NV.
The money raised will be used mainly to refinance maturing medium-term debt
and outstanding short-term debt.
Benetton is following in the footsteps of Roche Holdings, the US financing
arm of the Swiss drugs group, which did a Dollars 1bn issue in March with
knock-out warrants.
The deal is intended to 'offer participation in the upside potential of the
Benetton share whilst affording conditional protection against downside
movement, at a discount of approximately 3 - 5 per cent to the share price',
according to Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager of the issue.
The bonds have a five-year maturity and a coupon in the range of 4.5 to 5.0
per cent. Each principal amount of L5m of bonds has between 57 and 65
knock-out warrants attached, with each warrant corresponding to one ordinary
Benetton share.
Several Japanese borrowers tapped the market using convertible bonds and
bonds with warrants yesterday.
However, dealers stressed that the timing of these issues had been arranged
several weeks in advance and were 'not opportunistic' in terms of the
underlying market conditions.
Elsewhere, Asea Brown Boveri International Finance, part of the European
power engineering group, tapped the Eurolira sector with a 10-year L250bn
deal.
The bonds have a 10 per cent coupon, reversing a recent trend away from
double-digit coupons in this particular sector.
ABB has a credit rating of AA/AA2, but in recent days some triple-A names
have come to the Eurolira market with coupons of 9.5 to 9.75 per cent.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: HK removes transaction levy
on share dealing

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HONG KONG govern-ment has moved to reduce the costs of dealing in
exchange-traded securities by formally proposing that a special transaction
levy be scrapped, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong.
Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said removal of the
0.03 per cent tax on share trades, which was imposed following the collapse
of the futures market in 1987, would be the final step in clearing up the
last outstanding issue related to the stock market crash.
According to the government, some HKDollars 256m remains outstanding from
the original HKDollars 1.93bn lifeboat loan that bailed out the futures
market.
Last month, the Securities &amp; Futures Commission, Hong Kong's stock market
regulator, said it would seek to have the levy removed because the loan had
been almost completely repaid. It said it did not want to create a surplus.
The government said that strong turnover in the stock market would have
pushed the surplus to HKDollars 100m or HKDollars 200m by the end of this
year if the special levy were not to be repealed.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: CME expands pit as trading
soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange is celebrating record trading volume as it
opens its second trading floor, making this the fourth time in two decades
that the futures exchange has had to expand to accommodate new business.
Nearly 74m futures and futures options contracts changed hands at the
exchange between January and June, and if this sort of pace can be
maintained the exchange will finish with a record year.
The CME still ranks second in outright futures trading volume to its
neighbour, the Chicago Board of Trade but because of its vast Eurodollar
contracts, it is the world's largest exchange in terms of underlying
notional value of contracts traded.
Last year the CME traded Dollars 85,000bn. The London International
Financial Futures Exchange traded Dollars 27,000bn while the CBOT had
turnover valued at Dollars 13,000bn. This compares with Dollars 2,000bn in
notional value of stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange last year.
The CME, unlike some of its competitors, has planned for this expansion in
business, building and mothballing a second trading floor when it built in
1982 its existing Wacker Drive office towers in Chicago's financial
district.
The new 30,000 sq ft space sits one level above the existing trading floor,
and brings trading room at the exchange to 70,000 sq ft. The Dollars 27m
outfitting of the floor was completed last month and currency futures
traders moved in last weekend. Eurodollar futures and options will open on
the floor on July 26.
Like the world's other big futures exchanges, the CME's products are growing
in tandem with the off-exchange swaps and derivatives markets in a general
movement toward financial risk management. This growth belies predictions
that open outcry trading would fade as electronic transactions became
fashionable.
Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, says the expansion will allow product
innovation held back for lack of space. The CME plans to extend its rolling
spot foreign exchange futures to D-Marks soon.
The old trading floor will remain home to the CME's agricultural products
and its expanding menu of stock index contracts. While action in the
exchange's meat and livestock sector is lacklustre, equity derivatives
volume is growing.
The CME has the benchmark S&amp;P 500 stock index contract, and four less
successful indices, including futures on the FTSE-100 and the Nikkei 225.
Later this year it expects to add Major Market Index futures to that list.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: BellSouth in novel telecoms plan

<TEXT>
BELLSOUTH, the Baby Bell regional telephone company serving south-eastern
US, yesterday announced an unusual plan to allow outside parties to attach
new telecommunications services to its advanced computer-based network.
US telecommunications companies usually deny outsiders access to their
computer networks and BellSouth, the largest of the Baby Bells, claimed
yesterday that it was the first to propose 'significant opening of its
reservoir of advanced technologies to other service developers'.
The plan provides further evidence of the rapid convergence of the
telecommunications, computer and media industries and the decline of the
monopolies enjoyed by US local telephone companies.
Under the BellSouth plan, customers and developers of enhanced
telecommunications services would be able to plug in to the company's
Advanced Intelligent Network, the telecommunications industry's equivalent
of a computer's basic operating software.
Mr Duane Ackerman, president of BellSouth telecommunications, said the move
would spur the development of new services, such a voice recognition and
personalised telephone numbers which followed individuals wherever they
went.
'Doubtless we'll create competition for some of our own advanced services,'
he said. 'However, our extensive research clearly indicates that increased
growth of our network by our own customers, coupled with usage growth
generated by new enhanced service providers, will increase our AIN revenues
overall.'
The company stressed that the plug-in capability would not allow an outsider
to delve deeply into the network and compromise the integrity of the
network.
BellSouth filed its plan yesterday with the Federal Communications
Commission, the government agency which oversees the industry and must first
approve the proposal.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Acom an acronym for moderation -
A cautionary tale of Japanese consumer lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN explaining the principles of his consumer finance company, Mr Kyosuke
Kinoshita, president of Acom, displays the Japanese love of lofty sentiment.
It is, he suggests, all in the name: 'A' stands for affection, 'CO' for
confidence, and the 'M' for moderate.
Regardless of whether Japanese-speaking customers understand the acronym's
nuances, the emphasis on caring and confidence is an understandable reaction
by Mr Kinoshita against the image of an industry once famed for extortionate
interest rates and gangland loan officers.
Acom, and two other large consumer finance companies, Promise and Sanyo
Shinpan Finance, will help the industry take another large step towards
respectability by listing on Tokyo's over-the-counter market in coming
weeks. The move will also be a test of strength for the Tokyo stock market.
The emphasis on 'moderation' has become even heavier in the aftermath of the
boom lending era of the late 1980s, when even venerable Japanese banks lent
heavily to less-than-respectable property developers and stock speculators,
leaving them with a pile of non-performing loans.
Mr Kinoshita said his company, founded in 1978, was careful in its lending
during the late 1980s. Property-related loans account for an estimated 7.7
per cent of Acom's total lending, which at the end of March was Y586.3bn
(Dollars 5.47bn), an increase of 9.4 per cent over a year earlier. Consumer
lending by risk-conscious banks fell 3.2 per cent in the last fiscal year.
'We have a risk system called Man and Machine. We have all the important
data in our machines, but it will be the man who finally decides on the
loan,' Mr Kinoshita said. 'We check very closely as to why a person needs
money. We explain to them what it means to accept credit.'
Acom, which estimates that non-performing loans totalled Y17.6bn at
end-March, needs this sort of strong screening process since 88.6 per cent
of lending is unsecured personal loans. And its collateral-backed business
is directly linked to asset markets badly bruised by three years of falling
prices.
The collateral includes property, securities, paintings and golf club
memberships, for which there is a large market in Japan. Share prices are
still half their level of December 1989, to judge by the Nikkei average, and
the price index for golf memberships has fallen even further. Property
prices are still weak.
Acom, which also has video, compact disc and furniture rental shops, is
retreating from the art-backed lending market, with loans down from Y4.3bn
in 1990 to Y600m last year. However, it still retains an obvious interest in
fine art - a Renoir, a Matisse and a Monet hang in one of its conference
rooms.
Atasteful array of French Impressionists is intended to show that the
company is very different to the sarakin companies, the last-resort lending
shops of the 1970s, whose unsavoury practices prompted the finance ministry
to limit interest rates in 1983.
Apart from distancing his company from the sarakin, Mr Kinoshita's emphasis
on educating customers is also a response to a surge in personal
bankruptcies in Japan, particularly among the young. Court filings for
bankruptcy rose almost 80 per cent last year.
Acom produces a 'money plan' handbook, its cover showing an ideal young
couple in the company of a red sports car. Inside there is guidance on
'having a happy life', a cautionary tale about the high costs of consumers'
brand consciousness, and an explanation of the importance of planning
finances.
'Japan is the same as other countries. There are some people who understand
credit and other people who don't,' Mr Kinoshita said. He sees potential for
increased lending in regional Japan, where, he says, the effects of the
economic downturn are not as noticeable, and competition from larger
commercial banks is less intense.
There is, however, debate among government economists over whether the
downturn in regional areas may be less severe, but longer-lasting, than that
of larger cities. Acom's lending to customers outside the Tokyo and Osaka
districts accounts for 54 per cent of total lending, while 313 of its 601
offices are in provincial areas.
'I don't think the Japanese economy has yet hit the bottom, but I hope that
the next few months will be brighter. The political confusion may delay a
recovery. Before this crisis, I thought the recovery would come in the
autumn,' said Mr Kinoshita.
The timing of the stock market listing, expected to be formally approved
next month, will partly depend on the health of the Tokyo market. Investors'
response to the listing will be a measure of the industry's attempts to
rehabilitate itself, and of perceptions of the company's exposure to the
excesses of the late 1980s.
'We have to be careful how we refer to the listing, as only God knows when
it will take place. In the end, the market will determine the day.'

NORTH Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining group, has joined with
Sociedad Minera Pudahuel (SMP), the Chilean copper producer, to evaluate the
El Abra copper prospect in Chile.
North is the second Australian company to participate in a joint evaluation
of El Abra, offered for tender by Codelco, Chile's state-controlled mining
company. About 20 international companies are believed to have registered an
interest.
In June, BHP, which already operates the Escondida copper mine in Chile,
announced it would join with Magma Copper, the US miner, to consider a
tender for El Abra.
North directors indicated yesterday the company would manage the joint
evaluation with a view to lodging a tender by September 20. If successful,
SMP, which has experience in leaching copper ores for the solvent extraction
process, would have an option to purchase a 5 per cent stake.
Resolute Resources, the Australian mining group, has bid for Equity In
Industry, offering 16 shares for seven Equity In shares. The bid values
Equity In at ADollars 140m (USDollars 93m), Reuter reports. Resolute
currently has 13 per cent of Equity In.

Dollars 200m flotation

<TEXT>
BARITO Pacific Timber, one of the world's largest wood products companies,
plans to go public with a Dollars 200m share offer that values the company
at about Dollars 2bn.
The company, which will float later this year, is the flagship of the Barito
Pacific Group led by Mr Prajogo Pangestu.
BPT has banking, real estate and petrochemical subsidiaries, as well as
2.46m hectares in timber concessions of its own and access to a total of 5m
hectares. This latter figure represents almost 8 per cent of Indonesia's
natural production forests.
The company, set up in 1976, estimates its assets at Dollars 1bn, although
this excludes the full value of forestry concessions which, under Indonesian
law, remain the state's property.
Last year BPT recorded a gross profit of Dollars 114m on sales of Dollars
380m. For 1993 the company forecasts sales of Dollars 599m and a gross
profit of Dollars 309m. Although exact figures are not available, company
documents show first-quarter sales this year of nearly Dollars 90m and a
gross profit of about Dollars 50m.
The surge in profits will result, company officials say, from a
restructuring of debt, estimated at Dollars 560m, and a sharp increase in
the world price of timber. BPT exports 95 per cent of production to Japan
and Taiwan.
The company also confirmed it had recently made a private placement of
shares, amounting to a 20 per cent stake, to Taspen, the largest state
pension fund.
While Indonesia, with the third largest natural forests in the world after
Brazil and Zaire, has a competitive advantage in wood products, brokers
attribute BPT's growth in part to Mr Pangestu's political connections.
Bankers say it was Mr Pangestu who in 1990 helped cover losses of Dollars
419m suffered by Bank Duta, majority-owned by three charitable foundations
chaired by President Suharto.

DAEWOO Electronics, South Korea's third-largest consumer electronics
manufacturer, yesterday reported a 25 per cent rise in net profits, to
Won14bn (Dollars 17.5m) during the first half of 1993, on the back of brisk
domestic sales, writes John Burton in Seoul.
Sales grew 15 per cent to Won997bn, including a 17 per cent rise in domestic
sales to Won425bn. In the Korean market, sales of microwave ovens were up 58
per cent; washing machines 28 per cent; and televisions 17 per cent.
Exports, which rose 13 per cent to Won572bn, were bolstered by the Korean
won's depreciation against the Japanese yen. Microwave ovens, washing
machines and refrigerators all posted growth above 30 per cent in foreign
markets.
Daewoo also announced it had acquired for Dollars 1.4m an audio production
facility in the Chinese province of Shandong which it had leased since last
August. The facility has capacity to produce 50,000 sets of cassette
stereos, CD players and headphones annually.
The company plans to transfer the production of cheap audio products from
South Korea to the Shandong plant to take advantage of low labour costs.

MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, has placed the
long-term debt ratings of two leading Japanese heavy electronics makers
under review for possible downgrading.
Moody's said it was reviewing the Aa3 ratings of Toshiba and its
subsidiaries, Toshiba America and Toshiba International Finance. Also under
review are Mitsubishi Electric, and offshoots Mitsubishi Electric Finance UK
and Mitsubishi Electric Finance America.
Japanese electronics makers have been hurt by the prolonged weakness of
consumer demand and sluggish capital spending by companies. Depreciation
costs from heavy capital expenditure during the late 1980s are also
squeezing the industry's profits.
Responding to the announcement, Toshiba said it expected improved earnings
for the year to next March. It based its hopes on a recovery in the US
computer industry, and the Japanese government's emergency economic package.
The agency said it would focus on both Mitsubishi and Toshiba's ability to
improve profit margins and cash flow of weak sectors, as well as debt
reduction and efforts to cope with the strengthening yen.

Codelco has indicated it wishes to maintain a significant, but probably

The prospect was considered uneconomic before the introduction of oxide

TSINGTAO Brewery, the first of nine mainland Chinese state-controlled
companies to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, yesterday said its
HKDollars 889m (USDollars 114.9m) public offer had been subscribed 110.5
times.
Anheuser-Busch, the largest US brewer, has taken 5 per cent of the issue for
HKDollars 126m, which suggests that Hong Kong and other foreign investors
have put up HKDollars 84.3bn in their attempt to win stock in the Chinese
brewer.
Tsingtao's 'H' shares will begin trading on the Hong Kong exchange on July
15.
The company offered investors 317.6m new shares, at HKDollars 2.80 each, or
35 per cent of the company's enlarged capital. A further 11 per cent of
Tsingtao's shares will be issued as 'A' shares to mainland investors at a
future date.
The company's profits are forecast to rise to Yn193m (USDollars 33m) this
year, compared with Yn44m in 1992. However further strong growth in profits
may have to wait until 1995, when the company's fourth brewery comes on
stream.
The level of oversubscription for the Tsingtao issue fell well short of that
achieved in February by Denway Investment, a Hong Kong-based mainland
company with automotive assets in southern China. Denway sought HKDollars
402m, but speculators applied for HKDollars 240bn of stock.
Since then, Hong Kong's monetary authorities - fearing a risk to the
colony's banking system - have tightened regulations governing bank lending
for new issues.
However, in spite of this, market expectations were for Tsingtao to be
subscribed by up to 300 times.
China Everbright, a Chinese state-owned company, has acquired 25m shares of
HTP Holdings. The investment represents 15 per cent of HTP and is the
Chinese company's first large investment in the Singapore stock market.

L15,000bn

<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the diversified industrial group which is in
financial difficulties, owes about L15,000bn (Dollars 9.7bn) to Italy's 10
biggest banks.
Mr Vincenzo Desario, the deputy director general of the Bank of Italy, who
revealed the information to a parliamentary committee yesterday, did not
specify how much individual banks had lent.
Ferfin, which has total borrowings of about L31,000bn, is being guided by a
committee of its five principal bank creditors, led by Mediobanca.
The other banks involved, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Credito
Italiano, Banca di Roma and Banca Commerciale Italiana, have not all
revealed their exposures. However, Credito Italiano lent L1,300bn, while BCI
lent about L700bn.
Mr Desario said the 10 biggest domestic banks had lent in aggregate about 21
per cent of their capital to Ferfin. However, he said the figure was within
the 25 per cent limit set by the European Community. About L6,500bn in
Ferfin's total borrowings came from about 110 foreign banks.
Mr Desario said San Paolo, believed to be the biggest creditor, had lent
about 31 per cent of its shareholders' funds. That was in line with the
current 40 per cent limit, due to fall to 25 per cent in 1998. Six other
banks had lent more than L1,000bn, while seven had lent between L500bn and
L1,000bn and 14 more than L100bn.
Mr Desario said the Ferruzzi family should not shirk its responsibilities in
the crisis affecting the group. The family, which owns about 48 per cent of
the group, should be the first to 'pay' as a 'minimum condition for the
restructuring plan to go ahead'.
A long-awaited shareholders' meeting of Serafino Ferruzzi, the family
holding company which owns the Ferfin stake, has not yet taken place, amid
signs of possible division between the family and Mediobanca.

WANG Laboratories said it expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection by the end of September.
The US office computer company, which is refocusing its operations on
software and services, said it planned to file an amended reorganisation
scheme with the US bankruptcy court yesterday.
'Rarely, if ever, has a Chapter 11 case of this magnitude and complexity
moved forward as smoothly and as rapidly,' said Mr C. Hall Swaim, counsel to
the creditors' committee. Wang filed for bankruptcy protection in August
1992.
The company also named a new nine-member board. Mr Michael Mee will resign
as chairman when the board takes over but will remain chief financial
officer. The new board will then elect another chairman.
The company said the amended plan called for no additional staff reductions
beyond the 3,300 job cuts announced in March. It currently employs about
6,000. Under the reorganisation, Wang's cost structure would be
significantly reduced.
It expects revenues of Dollars 1.24bn for fiscal 1993 and a net loss of
around Dollars 199m, including restructuring charges of about Dollars 89m
and reorganisation fees of about Dollars 29m.
For fiscal 1992, Wang suffered a net loss from continuing operations of
Dollars 358.2m , or Dollars 2.11 per share, including pre-tax restructuring
and other charges of Dollars 277.3m, after a gain of Dollars 33m from the
sale of real estate and pension changes.
Anticipating that it would emerge from bankruptcy at the end of September,
the company projected revenues of Dollars 955m for the year beginning
October 1, with net profits of about Dollars 26m.
Under the plan, ownership of the company would be transferred to creditors.
Secured creditors would be paid in full the Dollars 50m they are owed, while
unsecured creditors, owed about Dollars 1bn, would be issued 30m shares of
common stock in the reorganised company.
Holders of Wang class B and class C common stock would be issued seven-year
warrants to purchase about 20 per cent of the new common stock.
The amended plan calls for up to 12.5 per cent of the common stock in the
reorganised company to be owned by Wang employees through a stock option
scheme.
Wang said it would continue to seek funds through a combination of internal
financing, further sales of non-strategic assets and external financing.
Last week it asked the court for authority to obtain a credit facility of up
to Dollars 50m.
The reorganisation plan must be approved by Wang's unsecured creditors and
stockholders as well as the court.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nucor boosts sheet steel output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NUCOR, the leading US steel mini-mill group, yesterday announced plans to
expand substantially its production of sheet steel. The move increases the
threat it poses in this sector of the US market to traditional, integrated
steel manufacturers.
Nucor is to increase production at its Hickman, Arkansas, mill by 67 per
cent, from 1.2m tons a year to 2m tons a year by the third quarter of 1994.
The company said this would cost less than Dollars 35m, and would require
only a 15 per cent increase in the number of employees at the plant.
Hickman, which began operations only last year, is the second Nucor plant to
use a new method of making sheet steel, called thin-slab casting.
The method was pioneered at the company's plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana,
which began operations in 1989. The plant makes steel much more cheaply than
conventional methods, since it cuts out several stages of the manufacturing
process.
This has presented new competition to the large, integrated US steel
companies. Until Crawfordsville began operating, the smaller, low-cost
mini-mills had not had the financial muscle to break into the sheet market,
which enjoys some of the industry's highest margins.
Nucor announced last April that it was also expanding Crawfordsville's
annual capacity, from 1m tons a year to 1.8m tons.
The company said yesterday that by the end of 1994 the total steel-making
capacity for all of its seven steel mills should be close to 8m tons a year.
This could make it the third-largest steel manufacturer in the US, after US
Steel and Bethlehem Steel.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mexican contractor plans IPO and
seeks listing in New York
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO Trituradores Basalticos (Tribasa), Mexico's second-largest
construction company, is poised to make an initial public offering of
between Dollars 250m and Dollars 350m of shares, and obtain a New York Stock
Exchange listing.
While weakness in the Mexican stock market could still delay the offering,
those familiar with the transaction were hopeful yesterday that it would go
ahead as planned.
The company expects to offer about Dollars 60m of equity in Mexico, between
Dollars 125m and Dollars 185m in the US, and between Dollars 65m and Dollars
105m in Europe, for a total equivalent to around 30 per cent of its capital.
Tribasa recorded profits of about Dollars 100m last year and revenues of
Dollars 585m, more than 90 per cent of which came from the construction of
Mexico's privately-financed toll roads.
The company has built several profitable toll roads around Mexico City, and
has significant stakes in the Cuernavaca-Acapulco road (263km), the
Mazatlan-Culiacan road, and the unfinished Mexico City-Guadalajara road
(340km).
Tribasa's heavy exposure to toll roads worries some analysts, since the
programme is in trouble after traffic on existing roads failed to meet
projections. While the margins on the construction of toll roads have been
around 25 per cent, Tribasa has been unable to sell off its equity stakes in
any new roads since the successful securitisation of the Mexico City-Toluca
road.
Tribasa will use the proceeds from the equity offering to reduce debt it has
taken on to finance toll road construction, and to expand into other
infrastructure areas.
The Mexican government is hoping that private sector construction companies
will build and help finance new ports, airports, power and petrochemical
plants, water and irrigation systems.
The equity offering is being managed by Interacciones in Mexico, Lehman
Brothers in the US, and SG Warburg in the UK.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Molson chief optimistic on
first-quarter result
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOLSON, the diversified Canadian brewing group, said beer profits this year
would be hit by the slow economic recovery in North America and price wars.
The group's special chemicals, retailing and entertainment operations,
however, should do better.
'Our first quarter ended June 30 will equal or better the year earlier
level, when profits were CDollars 38.4m (USDollars 29.9m), or 66 cents a
share, on sales of CDollars 799m,' Mr Marshall Cohen, president, told the
annual meeting.
For the full fiscal year, Molson should improve on its fiscal 1993
performance, he added, when final net profit was CDollars 164.7m, or Dollars
2.76 a share, on revenues of CDollars 3.08bn.
Molson, Canada's biggest brewer, last year abandoned efforts to develop a US
market on its own and concluded a CDollars 350m deal with Miller, the
brewing arm of Philip Morris of the US.
Miller bought the US marketing and distribution rights for the Molson brand,
aiming for a US market share of 2.5 per cent in five years, up from the
current 1 per cent.
Molson Breweries is 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's of
Australia, and 20 per cent by Miller. Mr Cohen said it would take between
five and seven years for the full benefit of the Miller deal to offset
Molson's smaller share in its international brewing business.
He said that Diversey, Molson's international cleaning chemicals subsidiary,
had overcome problems with integrating Du Bois Chemicals in the US.
However, European, Asian and Latin American operations were doing well and
Diversey overall now contributed more revenue than the brewing business.
'Diversey can be Molson's most profitable business and yet develop strong
competitive positions in all its markets,' Mr Cohen said. 'We see an
improvement in the US operations in the second half this year.'
Molson is speeding up its five-year programme to build 28 large hardware
stores in Canadian cities after two pilot units had exceeded expectations.
Older hardware stores are being rationalised and overall retail results are
improving.
Molson also owns the Montreal Canadians ice hockey team which won the 1993
National League Stanley Cup, and the sports and entertainment outlook is
favourable.
Mr Cohen said the group's new strategy and improving performance should be
reflected in Molson's share price.

Both transactions are expected to be completed in the third quarter.
The company said its Tribune Newspaper subsidiary would be renamed Tribune

<TEXT>
TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and metals trading group, is aiming to cut
debt by SKr3bn (Dollars 416.7m) in the next 12 months as part of a recovery
strategy and renewed focus on core operations.
The group, which has net debt of about SKr10bn, has sold assets worth
SKr1.4bn this year.
Mr Kjell Nilsson, president, said the group aimed to concentrate on mining,
metals trading and rubber. It would not be a long-term participant in
forestry and construction related activities, he added. 'A 10 per cent
increase in metals prices is worth more for the group than the profits of
four of our construction related businesses in a top year,' Mr Neilsson
stated.
Operations which could be sold include Munksjo, the paper and packaging
operation, and Svedala, the mineral processing and materials transport unit.
Munksjo alone could fetch several billion kronor.
Cutting debts by SKr3bn would lift the group's equity to assets ratio above
30 per cent from 24 per cent today. This would make it easier to raise new
equity to support the long-term development of core activities.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Austrian Airlines sees wider
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIAN Airlines expects this year's pre-tax loss from operations to jump
60 per cent to about Sch700m (Dollars 61.4m) in spite of substantial
reductions in operating costs.
Mr Herbert Bammer, joint chief executive, made the gloomy forecast at a
press conference in Vienna yesterday to disclose first-half results.
It will be the third successive operating loss for the partially privatised
airline. The dividend was passed last year and the group has made clear that
none will be paid this year.
In the first half, Austrian suffered a pre-tax loss of about Sch400m
compared with a loss of Sch251.7m on flat revenues of Sch5.3bn. The net loss
expanded to Sch290m from Sch126m, mainly because of severe price
competition. The number of passengers carried was up 3 per cent to 1.4m.
Mr Bammer said the airline would consider scrapping loss-making long haul
routes, possibly including transatlantic ones. 'We have no prestige routes
which we have to fly at any cost,' he said.
On the other hand, Austrian was continuing to build up its profitable
services to eastern Europe, with plans to add Tirana and Odessa to its
schedule this winter.
Austrian is in discussions with Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Scandinavian Airlines System aimed at combining forces to increase their
market power. Austrian's management expects to make a recommendation to its
board on the proposed co-operation or on alternative tie-ups by the end of
August.
Swissair denied reports that it would buy the 36 per cent of the shares of
Balair that it does not own. Balair is a quoted Swiss charter airline.
Swissair said that it was possible that it would make an offer for the
shares, but no decision had been made and it would not happen in the near
future.

<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, is to cut up to 15 per cent of the
workforce employed in its German pharmaceuticals divisions.
Claiming that the domestic drugs companies had fallen deeply into the red in
the first half, Mr Hans-Uwe Schenck, chairman of the group's Knoll division,
said all cost-cutting possibilities were being examined in collaboration
with workers' representatives.
He calculated up to 600 of the 4,000 German workforce would have to go.
Other BASF officials complained recently that government health service
reforms had led to drugs turnover falling by as much as 18 per cent. Mr Ingo
Paetzke, a group director, forecast a decline in domestic sales for the full
year and even heavier falls in profits.
The group recently announced plans to restructure its pharmaceuticals
business, partly in response to rumours that it planned to dispose of it,
and partly to equip the business better for international competition.
Provided the board approves, all activities will be focused in a new
division, BASF-Pharma, from the start of next year. The main components of
the new division will be Knoll, Nordmark and Minden Pharma.
BASF employs 7,800 worldwide in pharmaceuticals. More than a quarter of its
DM2bn (Dollars 1.25bn) turnover last year came from the German market, with
a further 30 per cent each from North America and elsewhere in Europe.
A management consultants' study on which the project is based recommended
that BASF reduce the number of research projects under way, and focus on the
most promising products, especially those with international marketing
prospects.

Es32.3bn

<TEXT>
THE Portuguese government has raised Es32.3bn (Dollars 209.7m) from the sale
of 17.5 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, following the announcement
yesterday of results for the third phase of the privatisation of the
country's largest commercial bank.
A core of 15 Portuguese investors, led by Mr Belmiro de Azevedo, increased
their stake in the bank to 26 per cent from 22 per cent to remain the
largest investor group.
As part of this third phase of privatisation, three stakes of 2.5 per cent
each were sold to three European banks but the names of the banks, called
strategic partners, are not likely to be revealed until October. The project
is being negotiated by Credit Comercial de France for the Portuguese
government. Demand for shares exceeded supply by 21 per cent. The state has
a 24.3 per cent stake in the bank.
The rules for the privatisation stipulate that no entity, single or
collective, may acquire more than 15 per cent of the institution. Shares
must be held for a least a year. Foreigners are limited to purchasing 7.5
per cent of the bank and Portuguese companies are prohibited from buying
shares on behalf of foreign companies.
Bankers Trust, the US merchant bank, yesterday made the first derivative
issue for Portugal to help the problem of supply and demand in the
Portuguese debt market.
The bank pre-placed the bulk of 3m warrants for 12.5 per cent domestic fixed
rate bonds dated January 1998. Each warrant has a face value of Es10,000.
Mr Antonio Beck, who is responsible for the bank's Portuguese business, said
that overcoming the liquidity problem was the main motive behind the issue.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: German flotations may rise
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are between 1,500 and 2,000 German companies likely to go public on
the German stock markets in the long term, a leading German banker said
yesterday.
This prediction, from Mr Ronaldo Schmitz of the Deutsche Bank, compares with
about 425 listed German companies at present and suggests that there is
potential for the development of Germany's equity markets.
It is optimistic in view of a dearth of new issues on the German equity
markets. Last year only eight companies came to the market.
However, Mr Schmitz, board director in charge of corporate finance at
Germany's largest bank, told a conference in Frankfurt yesterday that there
were significant hurdles to overcome before there could be a significant
rise in the number of new issues.
These include better attention being given to the pricing of new issues,
tougher rules on minimum requirements for new issue candidates, as well as
better investment analysis from the stockbroking community.
Mr Schmitz acknowledged that the slowdown in new issues over recent years,
down from a peak of 26 in 1990, reflected more than just a deterioration in
the German economy or the poor performance of the German stock market. He
noted that since the end of the 1980s the price performance of new issues
had been markedly worse than for the market as a whole. This had made
investors reluctant to take shares in new issues.
Mr Schmitz, a former finance director of the BASF chemicals group who is
rapidly acquiring a reputation for outspokenness on issues concerning
Germany's capital markets, said Germany industry as a whole was
undercapitalised compared to international competitors.
He said that this was especially true of Mittelstand companies, medium-sized
companies which had an average ratio of equity capital to total balance
sheet assets of about 20 per cent, compared with over 25 per cent for German
companies as a whole and more than 40 per cent for US and UK companies.
This shortage of capital could damage companies chances of growth and their
competitiveness, Mr Schmitz said, giving them an obvious incentive to come
to the stock market.
Another impulse to new issues on the German market could come from larger
companies spinning off minority holdings in subsidiary companies, a process
Mr Schmitz noted was under way at groups such as Metallgesellschaft.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ruhrkohle confirms cut in jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUHRKOHLE, Germany's largest coal producer, confirmed yesterday that 14,000
jobs would be axed in the next two years because of the worsening steel
crisis.
Sales for 1992 fell DM900m to DM12.8bn (Dollars 8bn). The company, which
receives heavy state subsidies, reported a loss of DM78m against a DM20m
loss the previous year.
Ruhrkohle said it was hard hit by declining orders from steel groups, with
unsold stocks in 1992 amounting to between 3m and 3.5m tonnes of coal.
It said it was particularly affected by the closure of a coke plant by
Klockner, the steel group which recently agreed to capacity cuts to push
through a debt-relief scheme.
The company reduced its production capacity by 9.5 per cent to 42.8m tonnes
of coal, coke and lignite. Over 6,000 jobs were cut in 1992.
Last month, Ruhrkohle closed a coke works in Essen, in the Ruhr valley,
where 1,000 workers were employed. It plans to shut down the largest part of
a coke works in Hassel by the end of October.
The threat of closure continues to hang over the Aden/Monopol mine in
Bergkamen, where 8,000 coal miners are employed.
The company said it had to speed up its restructuring.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa expects sharply
reduced losses for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JURGEN WEBER, chief executive of Lufthansa, yesterday said the German
state-controlled airline had broken even in the second quarter of the year
and was on course for sharply reduced losses for 1993 as a whole.
Looking ahead to the year as a whole, Mr Weber told the annual shareholders'
meeting in Hamburg, that he expected losses at the Lufthansa parent company
to drop to DM200m (Dollars 125m) this year from DM391m in 1992. In the first
half, the parent company loss was likely to be DM250m, compared with DM542m
lost in the same period last year.
This reflected what Mr Weber described as the crisis in the world airline
industry, where 'the whole sector is bankrupt'. He reiterated his complaint
against Chapter 11 laws in the US - that allow insolvent companies to carry
on trading with protection from creditors - which acted as a form of subsidy
to the North American airline industry.
He tempered the note of optimism on profits with a call to staff to maintain
the group's battle to cut costs, a battle which he said was entering a
second phase after saving more than DM1bn against budget last year.
Further cost-cutting was the only way for the company to survive in
increasingly competitive world markets, he said. The airline would press
ahead with plans to cut 2,900 further jobs by the beginning of next year,
taking the total reduction in jobs since last June to 8,400. At the end of
last year the airline employed 48,251 people.
He said the airline would need a further injection of capital next year,
given that the airline's ratio of equity capital to total assets fell to 21
per cent last year from 26 per cent in 1991.
Lufthansa intends to extend the global reach of its operations via the
increased use of co-operation agreements with other companies. It is also
likely to increase its 11 per cent stake in Deutsche Reiseburo, a German
tour operator.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Thomson asked to consider
CSF-TCE merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government has asked Thomson, the state-controlled electronics
group, to consider merging Thomson-CSF, its defence electronics arm, with
Thomson-TCE, its consumer electronics subsidiary, as part of the shake-up of
France's public sector.
Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, said in an interview with Les Echos,
the financial newspaper, that he had asked Mr Alain Gomex, chairman of
Thomson, to examine 'how to bring together the two sides of the group'.
Thomson said it could not comment.
The two businesses are in different areas of electronics and are different
in terms of their relationship to the Thomson group and their financial
condition.
Thomson-CSF, which specialises in defence electronics, is controlled by
Thomson, with a 60 per cent stake. The remainder of its shares are quoted on
the Paris stock market. It made net profits of FFr1.52bn (Dollars 281.5m) in
1992, a fall of 35 per cent on the previous year due to the losses on its
holding in Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group.
Thomson-TCE is involved with consumer electronics and wholly-owned by
Thomson. It has been badly affected by the competitive state of the European
consumer electronics industry and last year made a net loss of FFr1.77bn,
thereby contributing to the Thomson group loss of FFr544m.
Mr Longuet said he was aware that the two sides of Thomson had different
cultures and of the contrast in terms of product sector and financial
condition. However, he said he could not exclude merging them and then
privatising the combined CSF-TCE group.
Thomson, scheduled for sale to the private sector in the mid-1980s by the
last French centre-right government, is one of the current privatisation
candidates.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider over Pounds 17m on UK growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in the UK cider market helped Taunton Cider to a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 17.6m for the year ended May 1 1993. The group was floated
on the Stock Exchange a year ago.
The outcome compared with Pounds 6.58m, and reflected a strong operating
performance, positive cash flow and the reduction in interest costs
following the flotation. Net interest charges fell to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds
11.2m).
Earnings per share increased to 12.2p (8.1p) and a final dividend of 3.6p
makes a total of 6p,
Commenting on the results, Mr Michael Cottrell, chairman, said: 'The
benefits of our commitment to marketing are particularly evident at the
present time when most drink categories, other than cider, are in decline.'
Turnover from continuing operations rose 19 per cent to Pounds 124.9m, from
Pounds 105.3m previously when discontinued operations generated an
additional Pounds 4.09m. The bulk of the increase came from volume gains in
line with the overall UK cider market which grew by 12 per cent to 85m
gallons last year.
Taunton's share of the fast-growing packaged sector continued to increase,
mainly as a result of the strong performance of its premium brands,
including Diamond White and the Brody brand which was launched last year. In
contrast, its share of the more mature draught cider market, which is
growing by about 5 per cent a year, slipped slightly. Volume sales of Dry
Blackthorn draught rose by 3 per cent last year. Operating profits from
continuing activities increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds
16.7m), buoyed by the growth of the higher margin premium brands.
Despite capital investment of more than Pounds 8m the group eliminated the
borrowings that remained after the flotation and ended the year with a net
cash balance of Pounds 2.2m.
Mr Peter Adams, chief executive, said the group was discussing the
possibility of marketing and distributing foreign premium beers in the UK,
and was also investigating the possibility of selling its premium cider
brands overseas, particularly in the US.
COMMENT
Taunton is well positioned to take advantage of the growing popularity of
cider in the UK, and to exploit new opportunities overseas. It already has a
33 per cent share of the overall domestic market, has captured 57 per cent
of the high-margin premium cider segment and has spare capacity. As well as
launching new premium brands the group is now turning its attention to
arresting the decline in its share of the more mature draught cider market.
Volume growth is likely to be somewhat more subdued this year - Taunton is
predicting about a 5 per cent gain. However, pre-tax profits should expand
to approximately Pounds 21.5m, producing earnings of about 13.4p per share
and a prospective multiple of 16.4.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Quadramatic price set at 123p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Quadramatic were yesterday priced at 123p, putting a flotation
value of Pounds 36.4m on the coin-handling and optical group.
Based on pro-forma forecasts for the year to September, the shares are on a
prospective multiple of 13.5 and offer a notional dividend yield of 4.6 per
cent.
The placing and intermediates offer, with Granville Davies as broker, will
raise about Pounds 20m to pay off debt. No existing shareholders are selling
shares, and 25 per cent of the shares on offer will go to retail investors.
Quadramatic is backed by Mr Tony Gartland and Mr Jeff Whalley, two deal
makers who during the eighties expanded FKI, the electrical engineering
group.
The company currently comprises Coin Controls International, an Oldham-based
maker of coin-handling equipment, and Combined Optical Industries, a
Slough-based company which moulds plastic optical products. It plans to grow
by acquiring high-margin engineering companies, with a broader spread of
products and markets.
Mr Gartland, chairman, said the offer had been comfortably subscribed, but
admitted that the shares had been priced a little more keenly than he had
hoped for. He said: 'The traffic is quite congested out there in the
fund-raising market for small companies. It makes some of the institutions
quite picky.'
Quadramatic predicts it will make pro-forma profits of at least Pounds 4.4m
in the 12 months to September.
Mr Gartland hopes to make an acquisition in the first year which would boost
profits by 50 per cent. That, combined with organic growth, would increase
earnings by 20 per cent.
Applications for the shares will close on July 14 and dealings start on July
20.
COMMENT
Like General MacArthur, Mr Gartland has told City institutions: 'I shall
return.' The group plans to expand and does not want to incur significant
gearing, so further share issues are on the cards. This enthusiasm for
acquisition explains the coolness of some institutions, but the group has
specified its areas of interest and had no real difficulty in finding
sufficient support. The core businesses are in high quality niches with good
management, and the Oldham factory has sufficient spare capacity to offer a
rapid pay back on the right acquisitions. The limited scope of the retail
offer might help push the shares to an initial premium, but the long-term
performance of the shares will depend on the quality of future acquisitions.

SHAREHOLDERS of MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, have taken
up 97 per cent of the Pounds 221.9m rights issue announced last month.
MEPC said that the rate of take-up was the highest achieved by a large
property company this year. It demonstrated shareholders continued support
for MEPC and its policies, said Mr James Tuckey, managing director.
The group plans to use the new funds to accelerate its refurbishment and
redevelopment programme and to expand its portfolio by selective property
and corporate acquisitions. Over the medium term, it wants a gradual
increase in the retail content of its portfolio and a reduction in its
exposure to central London offices.

A return to profitable trading enabled Hadleigh Industries, the USM-quoted
specialist supplier of transport and storage products and services, to
reduce losses from Pounds 1.43m to Pounds 187,000 pre-tax for the year to
April 3.
The group returned a Pounds 170,000 profit in the second half and benefited
from a Pounds 224,000 reduction in full year exceptional provisions to
Pounds 98,000 and a Pounds 203,000 fall in interest charges to Pounds
499,000.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 27.3m. However, the forward
order book is 'the strongest it has ever been' and the directors looked
forward to a 'successful year'.
Losses per share were cut to 1p (11.2p). The interim dividend was omitted
(1.25p) but a final of 0.5p (nil) is proposed.
Year-end gearing was reduced from 73 per cent to 44 per cent.
The share price improved by 5p to end the day at 80p.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tops Estates suffers from interest cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the year to March 31 rental income at Tops Estates, the shop property
investment group, was slightly reduced to Pounds 10.6m, while pre-tax profit
fell from Pounds 2.61m to Pounds 1.69m.
Mr Everard Goodman, chairman, said the moves to stimulate the economy had
created a short-term burden for the group, with reductions in profitability
for the period until May 1994. That reflected lower interest rates
receivable upon resources raised in April 1992 and held pending portfolio
acquisitions and refinancing of loans set for repayment at an effective
annual cost of 12.44 per cent.
Since April an additional Pounds 800,000 per annum of rental income flow had
started, arising from increases and completed developments. In the second
half a further Pounds 400,000 will flow in.
Earnings per share came to 4.42p (4.79p). The final dividend is 1.5225p to
make 2.1p (2p).

LAZARD High Income Trust, an investment trust which will buy convertible
securities, has issued its prospectus, writes Philip Coggan.
It is aiming to raise up to Pounds 35m via an offer for subscription of
shares at 100p each.
The trust is expected to offer an 8 per cent dividend yield, payable
quarterly. It will have a fixed life of six years, a device designed to
minimise the discount on which investment trust shares trade.
In addition to the share capital, the trust will also borrow up to Pounds
15m via a banking facility from Midland Bank. The interest payable will be 1
per cent above Midland Bank's swap rate.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Ford operations behind Vardy's rise to
Pounds 4.38m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REG VARDY, the multi-franchise motor dealer, increased its pre-tax profit by
nearly 11 per cent, from Pounds 3.95m to Pounds 4.38m, in the year ended
April 30 1993.
The main factor was a rise from Pounds 260,000 to Pounds 660,000 in the
contribution from Ford operations. The specialist division, where the market
saw a significant downturn, maintained its level of profitability.
There was no significant contribution from disposal of property. A sale was
expected during the year.
Sales totalled Pounds 205m (Pounds 178m) and operating profit came to Pounds
5.02m (Pounds 4.78m), with acquired operations accounting for Pounds 9.21m
(Pounds 9.43m) and Pounds 159,000 (Pounds 9,000) respectively.
Earnings per share were clipped to 7.1p (7.4p) and the final dividend is
2.9p for a total of 4.2p (4p).
Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said five dealerships had been added to the group
since the beginning of May, and further acquisition opportunities were being
explored. There was almost Pounds 3m cash in hand.

<TEXT>
SHARES IN PhoneLink rose 14p to 241p on news that the computing services
company had signed a five-year marketing agreement with IBM's UK subsidiary.
The agreement will enable IBM to market and promote PhoneLink's Tel-Me
software in the UK.
Tel-Me is software which makes it easier to extract specific information
from a computer database compared with current technologies.
PhoneLink joined the USM in May, placing 8.9m shares at 155p. The IBM deal
had been outlined in the prospectus. Under its terms, IBM will promote and
market Tel-Me to its customers, design and build a special personal computer
to be marketed as the Tel-Me terminal, and load the software on all its
production PCs manufactured in the UK.
Mr Trevor Burke, PhoneLink's chief executive, said yesterday that from
October selected customers would be testing the final version of Tel-Me in
preparation for the commercial launch, expected to take place in the first
quarter of 1994.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Raglan Property to consolidate shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RAGLAN PROPERTY Trust, the property investor and developer, is proposing to
consolidate its share capital in line with intentions expressed at the time
of the capital restructuring announced in March.
As then indicated, the aim is to reduce the spread between the bid and offer
price as a proportion of the share price.
The proposed consolidation is on the basis of 1-for-25 existing 1p shares.
A consequence will be that shareholders with fewer than 25 shares in the
company will cease to be shareholders. As these represent only 0.01 per cent
of the company's capital but a significant proportion of the number of
shareholders, Raglan expects to make net savings in ongoing administration
costs.
There will be a a scrip issue of warrants to subscribe for new shares on the
basis of one warrant for every 10 new shares held. They will enable the
holder to subscribe for new shares at 30p per share at any time up to
December 31 1995. It is expected that trading in the new shares and warrants
will begin on August 2.
Following the warrants issue and assuming full exercise, Landswell Holdings,
Century City International, Mr Keith Holman and Mr Alan Fosler, deemed to be
acting in concert, will hold about 11.1m new shares, representing 33.6 per
cent of the enlarged issued capital.
An extraordinary meeting on April 15 agreed to waive any requirement that
any member of the concert party should make a general offer to shareholders.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Morris Ashby advances 25% and calls for
Pounds 4.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORRIS ASHBY, the specialised diecasting and machining group, yesterday
announced a Pounds 4.53m cash call, a 25 per cent surge in pre-tax profits,
and a 15 per cent increase in its dividend.
The funding involves the placing and offer of 3.5m shares at 135p each; in
the market they rose 14p to 156p.
Some 55 per cent of the new shares have been placed firm; shareholders can
apply for the underwritten balance of 1.53m shares on the basis of 3-for-7.
Mr Norman Gardner, chairman, said the move would facilitate the capital
expenditure policy in the current five-year plan of continuing investment to
enhance the group's position in the diecasting industry.
For the year ended March 31 1993 pre-tax profit was Pounds 1.5m (Pounds
1.2m) from turnover ahead 24 per cent at Pounds 19m.
Sales rises were achieved in nine of the 10 industry sectors the group
served.
Mr Gardner said the current year had started well and the order book was
strong.
Earnings per share worked through at 13.5p (10.7p). The recommended final
dividend is 3.7p, to make 5.4p (4.7p).

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare to raise Pounds 33m for nursing
homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRESTACARE is raising Pounds 33.3m through a placing to finance acquisitions
in its core nursing homes business. The group, where Mr Andrew Taee was
appointed chief executive in March, also announced yesterday the sale of
some of its non-core properties and the appointment of a new chairman.
Mr Brian O'Connor is retiring as chairman, having, Mr Taee said, been the
architect of CrestaCare's new strategy. Mr Graeme Hart, deputy chairman, is
stepping up.
The placing and two acquisitions announced yesterday, totalling Pounds
15.1m, are subject to approval at a special meeting of shareholders on July
30. The placing is at 40p and the shares rose 2p to close at 45p yesterday.
Mr Taee said further acquisitions were under negotiation but that
shareholders would not be asked to put up more new equity.
CrestaCare said that since the introduction of the Care in the Community Act
in April it had held occupancy rates above 90 per cent. Downward pressure on
fee rates was offset by an increasing proportion of privately funded
residents.
Yesterday's acquisitions are of two businesses, each operating four nursing
homes. Together they have 515 beds and made an operating profit of Pounds
2.57m in the year to end-March. CrestaCare is paying Pounds 14.1m in cash
and the balance through the issue of 2.375m shares.
The vendors in both cases will continue to develop new homes for CrestaCare
to its specifications. It will only take these homes on to its balance sheet
when they are fully built and reach a certain occupancy level.
As well as the shares issued to the vendors, the placing involves 83.23m
shares, with investors able to clawback shares on a 1-for-1 basis. It will
raise Pounds 31.6m net of expenses.
Directors are taking up their entitlement under the placing. As well as
doubling his stake of 333,000 shares, Mr Hart is acting as a placee for a
further 2m shares.
Of the placing proceeds, Pounds 7m will go to buying four homes which
CrestaCare currently leases. Three are leased from Grosvenor House Group in
which Mr Taee has a 10 per cent stake. Mr Taee said that after the placing
net debt would be about Pounds 8m.
In its last accounts CrestaCare had properties for sale with written down
values of Pounds 9.4m. All but Pounds 2.8m of these have been sold, although
there has been a Pounds 1m loss on the sales.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Warning sends AAF shares down 66p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in AAF Industries plunged 66p to 125p as the modular buildings and
alloy wheels group announced that the results for the six months to June 30
would be 'significantly below those of last year'.
Then, pre-tax profits increased slightly from Pounds 2.22m to Pounds 2.26m.
The warning comes just two months after the group made a Pounds 7.65m rights
issue.
The company said that the business of Alloy Wheels International looked 'in
line with the management plan' at the time of the rights with deliveries for
a 'significant volume of wheels for a major US automotive manufacturer' due
to start on October 1.
However, the problems lay in the system building side. Here, margins have
'remained at very low levels' with competition further intensifying. The
company said that 'substantial redundancies' had been necessary and further
rationalisation was being examined.
Moreover, the company admitted that the review of all operations - and the
internal controls - at the Blackburn site had been 'inadequate' and that
unprofitable contracts had been undertaken as a result.
In the US, Preferred Medical Enterprises, a specialist modular building
operation, had been closed - incurring losses of about Pounds 1.4m - as
recession and reduced medical and military expenditure resulted in lower
demand for new medical facilities.
In an attempt to beef up the management team, Mr Alex Brown, of W&amp;A
Investment Corporation, the South African consumer and industrial group
whose stake in AAF was diluted to 43.1 per cent by the rights, has become
chief operating officer.
AAF is due to report its interim results in early September when further
information on the review currently under way will be made available. The
directors 'remain confident in the prospects of the group'.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dixons counts the cost of Silo closures:
With competition hotting up analysts remain sceptical about formula for
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUTATION of the US as the graveyard for UK retailers' ambitions looks
set to continue after Dixons' announcement yesterday of increasing losses
and higher-than-expected closure provisions at Silo, its US offshoot.
When Dixons acquired Philadelphia-based Silo in 1987 for Dollars 320m (then
about Pounds 200m) it was one of four rapidly-growing 'power retailers',
specialist superstore chains which were making substantial inroads into a
Dollars 40bn electrical goods market long dominated by independent traders
and department stores.
However, the US then went into recession and Silo, which had over-expanded,
found itself unable to compete with powerful rivals such as Circuit City and
Best Buy.
Silo's losses increased this year from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 22.4m, and
Dixons' group pre-tax profits were further depressed by Pounds 36.2m of
exceptional costs for closing 56 Silo stores.
One analyst, otherwise positive about Dixons' prospects, recently parodied
the poet Sir John Betjeman, urging 'Come friendly bombs and fall on Silo.'
Dixons has been struggling hard to inject its own skills in buying, systems,
management and customer service into the chain, but has little to show for
its efforts.
It did, however, claim many markets showed an improvement in sales last
year, with the overall results being dragged down by falls in sales in its
largest markets, especially California.
In the past year it has taken more aggressive steps. In February, it
replaced Mr Robert Sirkis, Silo's American president, with Mr Peter Morris,
previously Dixons' group property director.
That move came only weeks after Dixons announced the closure of 45 stores -
nearly a fifth of the total - in Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, Kansas,
Missouri, Kentucky and Oklahoma. They accounted for 37 per cent of Silo's
markets but only 11 per cent of sales.
It has since closed a further five stores, and 11 more will go in the coming
year.
The recovery plan now has three main elements. One is revamping existing
stores, doubling the space given to the computer/home office departments.
In-store product service departments are being added to many stores, as are
car radio and alarm fitting bays.
The second element is closing many of the smaller, poorly-located stores,
and replacing them with new superstores, of between 20,000 and 30,000 sq ft,
parallelling what Dixons is doing successfully with its Currys chain in the
UK.
That would mean the chain gradually shrinking from its current 185 stores.
Thirdly, Silo is experimenting with new formats to form the basis of that
superstore expansion.
Four stores in Rochester, New York State, have been refurbished and renamed
YES - Your Electronics Store.
As the name suggests, the stores concentrate heavily on electronics, and
white goods have been dropped. New brands have been added to Silo's usual
range to add 'authority'.
Silo is experimenting with a second store revamp formula in Chicago,
although the name has not been changed, and white goods are retained.
Dixons said it wants to give the reforms at least until early next year
before assessing their success. But analysts remain sceptical about Dixons'
chances, especially with competition increasing in its biggest California
and Chicago markets.
Mr John Clare, managing director, said underlying improvements so far have
convinced Dixons that it can turn Silo around 'over time'.
'But we well understand that we cannot continue as a company to see a
situation where Silo makes significant losses year after year.'
Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates the cost of
closing Silo at a prohibitive Pounds 150m. But if there are no signs of
improvement before the half-year results in January, he suggests 'major
surgery' may be necessary.
Dixons, he said, may eventually have no alternative but to make a 'slow,
miserable retreat'.

A REALIGNMENT of share-holdings at Wills Group, which distributes high
specification fluid handling equipment, coincided with the signing of
exclusive distribution agreements with three companies in the former Sigma
Group, recently privatised by the Czech government.
Stockbrokers Greig Middleton have placed 24.7m shares in Wills with its
management and institutions. More than 21m were sold by Galactic Enterprises
and the balance represented the rump of the holdings of the banks which
assisted in the 1991 restructuring of Wills.
In addition, Galactic's holding of 4.1m warrants has been bought by a family
trust of Mr David Massie, Wills' chairman.
Sigma's products will expand significantly Wills' range of fluid handling
and instrumentation devices.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Bespak to Pounds 11.5m
and shares jump 56p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Bespak jumped 56p to 518p as the medical valve and component maker
reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.92m to Pounds 11.5m in the
year to end-April.
The outcome reflected a first full-year contribution from US-based Tenax
Corporation, which moulds plastic medical components and was bought from
private owners for Pounds 33.1m in March 1992.
The US company contributed about Pounds 4.8m to operating profits of Pounds
11.3m (Pounds 6.79m).
Group turnover, including the acquisition, improved to Pounds 61.8m (Pounds
38.8m) and operating margins from 17.5 to 18.3 per cent.
Mr Bob King, chairman and chief executive, said sales of pharmaceutical
valves were slow in the first six months due to significant customer
de-stocking, but overall sales of pharmaceutical products had risen 16 per
cent during the year.
Sales of devices for laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) improved on the previous
year, but increased competition and de-stocking caused a fall in business
towards the end of the year.
He said sales from Tenax and Bespak's rest-of-world operations grew at more
than 10 per cent: 'Despite recent concerns about the healthcare market,
there is a growing need in all developed healthcare markets for medical
devices and systems that will safely dispense powerful drugs.'
Interest receivable rose to Pounds 199,000 (Pounds 134,000).
A proposed final dividend of 6p makes a 10p (9p) total. Earnings per share
rose to 31.9p (24.8p).
COMMENT
Bespak is good at safely delivering drugs to patients. Now it is working on
delivering profits to shareholders after analysts downgraded forecasts in
April and the shares fell sharply. Yesterday's share price jump signalled
returning confidence in the company's fundamental strengths. Its products
have secure market niches and it has taken steps to broaden its once narrow
customer base. Sales to Glaxo are now under 25 per cent of total turnover
compared with more than 70 per cent a few years back. However, demand is
changing as patents expire on the drugs its devices deliver and generic
suppliers invade the market. Even so, Bespak products might be used by the
new drug suppliers. Meanwhile, continued demand for its main products - drug
valves for asthmatics and components for laparoscopy - is virtually assured.
On a prospective p/e of 13.8 the shares look cheap compared to previous
highs of 15 or 16 which the market expects to see again.

compensation

<TEXT>
MR JOHN Hutchinson, whose contract as Nationwide Building Society's
corporate strategy director was terminated last December, was paid Pounds
250,000 compensation for his loss of office, the society disclosed
yesterday.
Mr Hutchinson, who was appointed as Visa International's UK managing
director in April, was given the sum in compensation after the society
decided that it should concentrate on cutting costs and overheads in
traditional operations.
The society also disclosed that the total compensation of Mr Tim
Melville-Ross, its chief executive and highest paid director, fell to Pounds
215,000 in the year to April 4, against the Pounds 220,000 Mr Melville-Ross
received the previous year.
The performance-related bonus paid to Mr Melville-Ross fell to Pounds 13,000
against Pounds 23,750. The bonus was calculated on several measures of
performance including customer service performance in the previous financial
year.
The total annual bonus paid to executive directors of the society, which is
the second largest by asset size after the Halifax, fell to Pounds 39,000
(Pounds 76,000), while the directors' total annual salary fell to Pounds
562,000 (Pounds 608,000).

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 79m buy puts Sidlaw in packaging big
time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIDLAW, the Scottish oil services group, is to become one of Europe's
leading flexible packaging companies with the Pounds 79m purchase of a
business from Courtaulds, the chemical materials group.
The acquisition of Courtaulds Flexible Packaging, with 11 operations in four
countries, marks Sidlaw's first significant move overseas and will more than
double group turnover.
The purchase will be funded partly by a Pounds 53m rights issue, on a
4-for-7 basis at 275p,pushing Sidlaw's market value from Pounds 108m to
about Pounds 180m on yesterday's share price of 328p, down 17p.
The balance will be funded by debt, increasing gearing from 38 per cent at
the end of March to 62 per cent.
A dividend is forecast of not less than 10.5p for the year to the end of
September, against 10p last year.
Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said the purchase was 'about market
positioning and long-term opportunity.'
Once combined with Sidlaw's existing packaging operations, the group would
rank in the top five European flexible packaging companies by sales, he
said. The total market was estimated to be worth about Pounds 2bn annually.
The new business would bring several benefits, including a strong management
team and a pan-European presence in the snacks, biscuits and confectionery
markets. This would complement Sidlaw's packaging operations serving the
frozen and processed food sectors.
The acquisition was expected to have a neutral effect on earnings in its
first full year, but would be enhancing afterwards.
Courtaulds said yesterday that the disposal formed part of a strategy to
focus on worldwide corporate development, which was unsuited to the European
focused flexible packaging businesses.
Mr Michael Pragnell, Courtaulds' finance director, said the disposal would
leave the group with a Pounds 12m exceptional gain in the current year.
Courtaulds Flexible Packaging made Pounds 6.1m profits from continuing
businesses on Pounds 108m sales in the year to March 31.
Sidlaw reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.6m on sales of Pounds 71.5m for
the six months to March 31.
The rights issue is underwritten by Morgan Grenfell.
COMMENT
Sidlaw, until now known for small niche acquisitions, yesterday thrust
itself into the limelight with uncharacteristic vigour. The deal certainly
appears to be tax efficient, with benefits in Spain, the Netherlands and at
home. The rise in gearing is expected to come down shortly, while there also
seem to be respectable cost savings to be made. However, there remains the
simple fact that this is bigger than anything Sidlaw has attempted to date.
Furthermore, it exposes Sidlaw to the vagaries of the continental European
market, where many other UK companies have stumbled. Sidlaw's track record
on acquisitions offers a certain degree of comfort, although this one may
take slightly longer to settle in. Pre-tax profits this year are forecast at
Pounds 11.3m, leaving the shares on a prospective p/e of 14.6. On a medium
to longer-term view the purchase makes sense and the rights appear worth
taking up.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland seeks IPounds
100m to buy US stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF Ireland yesterday announced an IPounds 100m (Pounds 94m) rights
issue to allow it to repurchase Dollars 125m (Pounds 83.3m) of US preference
stock, which was becoming expensive to fund, while strengthening its equity
base.
The 1-for-6 rights issue at 150p per share was the first among London-listed
banks this year, despite speculation before the announcement of the
full-year results in May that others would be forced to bolster their
capital.
The announcement caused some weakness in the share price of Allied Irish
Banks, the other main Irish clearing bank, but analysts said there was a
clear reason for Bank of Ireland's move, and it was unlikely to be followed
by others.
The rights issue was disclosed by Mr Howard Kilroy, chairman, at the bank's
annual meeting.
Mr Kilroy also said that Bank of Ireland First Holdings, the US subsidiary,
which reported a Dollars 2.7m deficit in the first quarter, would incur a
similar loss in the second period.
The bank estimated that the issue of 67m ordinary shares would dilute
earnings per share by about 0.6p, but that it would save about IPounds 7m
per year in the cost of paying interest on the two tranches of US preference
shares.
It intends to retire Dollars 75m adjustable rate preference stock, and
Dollars 50m preferred stock held by the US Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. This would cost IPounds 85m, and the remaining equity would
strengthen its capital base.
Mr Paul D'Alton, chief financial officer, said the rights issue had been
prompted by the high cost of carrying the US preference stock, and the fact
that the bank's share price had been performing well in the past few months.
'There is an opportune set of circumstances, and we believe that we can put
the proceeds to good use,' he said.
Mr D'Alton emphasised that the bank intended to use the new equity in 'a
sensible and responsible' manner to strengthen itself.
The bank estimated that its tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted
assets would rise to 7.3 per cent, from 6.6 per cent at the March 31
year-end.
Its equity to assets ratio would rise from 4.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent.
The bank said it intended to maintain the dividend at 9.83p on the enlarged
capital.
It said this represented a 6.5 per cent increase, taking into account the
scrip element of the rights issue.
COMMENT
Bank of Ireland's share price only slipped 9p to 241p as the market absorbed
the relatively clear logic of a modest rights issue. There seems slim danger
of the bank using its equity to expand assets recklessly when most of it is
already earmarked to retire US preference shares with a high and rising
cost. The vexing aspect for other banks is the light it sheds on weak ratios
of equity to assets elsewhere. After an interlude in which several have
propped up capital ratios by issuing preference shares, Bank of Ireland's
move shows that the thirst for equity may not be postponed indefinitely.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sharelink Investment raising Pounds 5m to
pay preference and debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARELINK Investment Services, the telephone-based stockbroker which is
floating on the Stock Exchange at the end of this month, is raising almost
Pounds 5m of new money to pay off Pounds 3.5m redeemable preference shares
and Pounds 1.2m of borrowings.
The information is contained in the pathfinder prospectus published
yesterday. The group will be valued at more than Pounds 30m.
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said he wanted an ungeared balance sheet to
enable him to invest in new services.
Sharelink, which currently specialises in equities and traded options, is
looking at expanding into insurance and banking.
The annual remuneration for Mr Jones and Mr Kenneth Bull, finance director,
is Pounds 125,000 and Pounds 80,000 respectively. Both directors are
eligible for bonuses which last year came to Pounds 5,350 and Pounds 1,750
respectively.
Sharelink's two biggest shareholders, Foreign Colonial Ventures and the
British Coal pension fund, both of which have a 32 per cent stake, are
expected to sell about half their shareholdings.
Mr Jones, who started the business in 1987, is expected to sell a quarter of
his 20 per cent holding, making him a millionaire just six years after he
invested Pounds 4,000 in the bus-iness.
He increased his holding after a management buy-out from the original
institutional backers, BT and Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based
stockbroker.

DOUBT HAS been cast on the value of Pounds 15.1m in bonds received by Maddox
Group, the computer maintenance company, when it sold two cable businesses
earlier this year.
Ernst &amp; Young, the company's auditors, said there was a 'fundamental
uncertainty' over being able to recover the Pounds 15.1m in full.
However, Mr Hugo Biermann, Maddox chairman, was confident of converting
Pounds 2m of bonds into equity each year after the cable companies are
floated in New York later this year.
The auditors added that a Pounds 680,000 paper profit from the sale be
included in the accounts as deferred income. Mr Biermann hoped the amount
would be written back into the p&amp;l account once it was established that
there were no problems with the business.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Deutsche Bank may cut Daimler stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bank may reduce its 28 per cent holding in Daimler-Benz in the
medium-term, Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler has said .
In Nuremberg this week Mr Reuter said it was possible that Deutsche Bank
would reduce its stake, although there were no immediate plans to do so.
Even after a reduction, Deutsche 'would remain a highly-valued large
shareholder in the house of Daimler-Benz', Mr Reuter said.
The holding by Germany's biggest bank in Germany's biggest industrial
company, worth more than DM8bn (Pounds 3.13bn), dates back to the late 1920s
and is one of the most enduring features on the German corporate landscape.
Mr Reuter's statement follows comments by a Deutsche Bank board member
earlier this year that both sides had agreed that the stake should be
reduced over the medium term. These remarks prompted fierce denials from
both companies.
Both Deutsche and Daimler insisted again yesterday that there were no plans
for a reduction. But Mr Reuter's willingness to address the issue adds
weight to speculation that the two have had behind-the-scenes talks.
This is thought to be in connection with Daimler's decision to seek a
listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year.
Daimler, which derived two-thirds of last year's DM98.6bn turnover from its
Mercedes-Benz car subsidiary, has said that it is planning a DM2bn to DM3bn
rights issue next year following the US listing.
It is possible that Deutsche would not take up its entitlement to new
shares, which would dilute its holding.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Renault and Volvo to merge in weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERGER of Renault, the French state-controlled motor group, and Volvo,
its Swedish partner, should be completed by the end of this month, according
to Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister.
Mr Longuet also confirmed in an interview with Les Echos, the French
financial daily, that he saw Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, as key candidates for the first round
of the privatisation programme.
He was also considering plans to merge Thomson-TCE and Thomson-CSF, the
consumer and defence electronics arms of the Thomson industrial group.
The French government has for some time been anxious to finalise Renault's
merger with Volvo. The two have been in partnership since 1990 and have
since stepped up their co-operation. Mr Longuet said negotiations were being
concluded and he 'hoped' to complete the deal by August as a precursor to
privatising the combined company.
In the meantime, he said that Elf Aquitaine and Rhone-Poulenc were 'neck and
neck' in the race to be the first industrial companies to be sold.
The French government, which earlier this week passed its privatisation bill
through parliament, is expected later this month to announce the names of
between three and six companies scheduled for sale in the first phase of
privatisation. The sales will start in September and continue until early
next year.
The privatisations form part of Mr Longuet's long-term strategy of reducing
the state's role in French industry. He has already affirmed that the new
government will be more rigorous than its predecessors in its treatment of
ailing public sector companies.
He singled out Bull, the loss-making computer concern, as one company which
needed 'taking in hand'. Bull, which earlier this week announced plans to
reduce its worldwide workforce by 6,500 by the end of 1994, is seeking a
capital injection from the government.
Mr Longuet said he planned by the end of this month to present his
recapitalisation proposals to the EC.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Losses in US mar Dixons' UK gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING losses and closure costs at the Silo chain in the US pushed down
annual pre-tax profits at Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, to
Pounds 33.5m from a restated Pounds 50.1m.
The losses, which overshadowed an encouraging performance by Dixons' UK
chains, will increase pressure on the group to find a way of turning Silo
around or make further closures. Dixons' share price fell 15p to 195p.
Operating losses at Silo increased from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 22.4m. Dixons
shut five more stores on top of the 45 closures announced in January, and
will close a further 11 this year, leading to an exceptional provision of
Pounds 36.2m.
Without the provision for Silo, a Pounds 6m write-down on UK properties  - a
business discontinued last year - and a Pounds 1m loss on disposals, the
profit before tax in the year to May 1 would have been Pounds 76.7m, broadly
in line with analysts' forecasts. Group turnover increased to Pounds 1.93bn
from Pounds 1.81bn.
Mr John Clare, managing director, said sales at Silo had risen 2 per cent in
the second half, after a 3 per cent fall in the first half, and sales had
increased year-on-year in many areas of the US. However, those increases
were outweighed by a decline in its biggest markets, especially in
California.
'Success in the UK chains has been hidden and frittered away by the US
losses,' one analyst said yesterday.
In the UK retail business, operating profits rose to Pounds 77.6m from
Pounds 71.9m. Stripping out a Pounds 10m warranty fund surplus from last
year's figure, profits improved 25 per cent.
UK turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.32bn, while the electrical market
grew 4 per cent. Like-for-like sales jumped 15 per cent in Currys
out-of-town superstores, 8 per cent in Currys high street stores, and 6 per
cent in Dixons.
But Dixons warned that while gross margins had been maintained for the third
year running, increasing price competition had led to pressure on margins in
the current year, although like-for-like sales continued to be ahead.
The European property division also increased its operating profit from
Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 11.4m, after selling several properties, mainly in
Belgium, and letting out the Beaulieu office development in Brussels to the
European Commission.
Dixons ended up with a post-tax loss, after an exceptional taxation charge
of Pounds 20.6m, relating to a liability to pay US retirement medical
benefits - a hangover from the acquisition of Cyclops, Silo's parent
company, in 1987. That led to a loss per share of 6.5p, compared with 6.5p
earnings last year.
A slightly increased final dividend of 4.6p, paid out of reserves, makes a
total of 6.2p, up from 6p.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Warburg's war game for BT3: The launch of the global
bookbuilding exercise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a far cry from the world of the bumbling Inspector Morose. The SG
Warburg machinery, clicking into place for the worldwide sale of the UK
government's remaining 22 per cent stake in British Telecommunications, is
highly computerised and, according to its operators, better oiled than
anything which has gone before.
Today, SG Warburg, co-ordinator for the third and last sale of the
government's shares, launches the US-style 'bookbuilding' operation to
collect investors' bids for the shares and help establish the selling price.
Warburg concedes that there are few innovations in the bookbuilding
technique, which has already proved itself in BT2 and in the Wellcome
Trust's sale of its stake in Wellcome Plc.
But it does offer refinements on the syndication procedure and new software,
which Warburg says will simplify the process and save money on
administration.
Unlike BT2 and the Wellcome deal, the sale of BT3 shares does not involve a
series of syndicates selling to designated geographic regions.
Instead, there are 11 global managers who are free to market to any of 473
so-called 'exempt' institutional investors. These are large investors who
have internationally diversified portfolios and were probably purchasers of,
or bidders for, shares in the BT2 offering.
Separately, three regional syndicates cover Japan, North America and the
rest of the world. These may solicit bids from investors not on the exempt
list.
Each syndicate will submit bids directly to computers located in Warburg's
war-room, on the sixth floor of the merchant bank's Broadgate headquarters.
The room contains three sets of desks representing each region, a series of
terminals on each, a television screen of the type used for viewing sporting
events in a local pub and a fully stocked refrigerator. The room will be
staffed around the clock, with staff putting in 12-hour shifts until July 19
when allocations will be announced.
Mr Maurice Thompson, director of equity syndication at SG Warburg
Securities, says the software can instantly produce colour graphics offering
snapshots of the bidding process by region. 'People can take it home for
bedtime reading.'
Another advance is the commission structure. The commission to global
co-ordinators could be worth around Pounds 40m on the basis of is 1 per cent
of the sum raised, with 20 per cent of that distributed on an agreed basis.
However, unlike previous global tender offers, the remaining 80 per cent
will go to whichever of the global co-ordinators the investors select,
rather to the firms that booked the orders.
Mr Thompson says this tactic will make it easier for investors to spread the
commission among the various firms which aided them in the bidding process.
Mr Rory Tapner, director of Warburg Securities, concedes it is possible that
investors unhappy with Warburg's tactics in the offering may choose to
punish the firm by ensuring that it does not get its share of their
commission.
If that is the case, he insists there will be no retaliation in the number
of shares awarded. 'Designation will not affect allocation,' he says.
The ability of clients to split commission is aimed at motivating firms to
encourage bidding, even when it is not clear they will earn direct
remuneration. The aim of the bookbuilding is to achieve the highest price
for the shares, while ensuring that those who bought them do not immediately
dump them.
Indeed, the vigour with which Warburg has pursued this goal has attracted
howls of outrage from UK institutional investors. Warburg had said that in
the allocation period, it would reward those who had bought shares in the
run-up to the bidding process and penalise those who had sold them.
To this end, it asked the London Stock Exchange in June to 'recommend' that
dealings in BT3 shares in the run-up to allocation be for cash settlement
rather than the two-week account period. Such a move would allow Warburg to
know within two days who had bought and sold shares. After vigorous
institutional protest, the exchange backed down on plans to concede to the
request. It instead decided to require all deals involving more than 100,000
shares to be reported to it.
Mr Tapner insists the request was only aimed at helping the firm to reward
buyers. Investors will now be asked to sign a form confirming to the UK
Treasury that they in fact own as many shares as they claim to on the BT3
bidding form.
But he admits the request did reflect the experience of Robert Fleming,
global co-ordinator of last summer's Wellcome sale, which saw the Wellcome
share price plummet by nearly one-third in the run-up to the bidding
process. A stock exchange review found that some investors had sold Wellcome
shares short just days before bidding closed, driving prices down.
Perhaps the true test of Warburg's success will come after trading begins.
In this 'stabilisation' period, those who bought shares for a quick profit
will sell them, forcing Warburg to support the price by buying them back.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Germans advise Budgens on trial discount stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGENS, the small food retailing chain, will open four trial discount
stores next month in a format it devised with Rewe, one of Germany's largest
food retailers.
Rewe is a private company which operates 8,000 stores and has 15 per cent of
the German food market. In April it stepped up the continental European
assault on the discount end of British retailing through buying a 26 per
cent stake in Budgens.
Budgens is converting four of its existing 100 stores in the south-east of
England to the new format, named Penny Market. Rewe currently operates more
than 1,400 discount grocery outlets, as well as supermarkets and
hypermarkets.
Several continental European discounters, attracted by the high profit
margins available in UK food retailing, have opened stores in the past three
years, making discounting the fastest-growing area of the market.
Budgens will decide whether to expand the new format after two months. Mr
John von Spreckelsen, chief executive, said that if more Penny Market stores
were opened, they would be in addition to the Budgens chain. No decision had
been made on how any expansion would be funded.
Mr von Spreckelsen, a German who was installed as chief executive of the
struggling chain in 1991, meanwhile confirmed that the recovery in Budgens'
profitability was continuing, in spite of what he described as 'continuing
attrition' from retail competitors.
Last year 800,000 sq ft of competitive space was opened close to Budgens'
outlets in the south-east, which themselves total only 600,000 sq ft, and
another 700,000 sq ft of competitive space will be opened in the current
year.
Pre-tax profits rose by 33 per cent to Pounds 6.2m in the year to April 25,
although turnover fell marginally from Pounds 291m to Pounds 285m. The board
is recommending a return to the dividend list with a payment of 1p.
Earnings per share dipped from 3.5p to 3.4p, partly because non-trading
items incurred a cost of Pounds 250,000 from the closure of unprofitable
outlets, compared with profits of Pounds 842,000 in the previous year.

FT  08 JUL 93 / EC steel strategy faces chaos warns Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community's steel strategy faces chaos if a deepening row over
subsidies for state-owned steelmakers is not resolved by the autumn, Mr
Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said yesterday.
The European Commission has threatened Italy with a formal injunction to
prevent the government writing off an estimated Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.09bn) of
debt at Ilva, the loss-making state steel producer. The Commission has also
extended an existing state aid inquiry to look into the debt cancellation.
Italy has been given 15 days to comment, before the rarely used injunction
powers will be activated, although Rome will still be able to finance more
than Ecu80m of monthly losses at Ilva.
Brussels hopes the latest action will persuade the Italians to comply with
overall EC plans for capacity cuts in the ailing Community industry by
September 21. That is the new date for a special meeting of EC industry
ministers on subsidies, postponed from this month because of the outstanding
problems.
'We have to be ready for that extraordinary council because if we are not. .
. . I fear we may be heading towards chaos,' said Mr Van Miert. He and Mr
Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, will press steelmakers on capacity
cuts at a 'secret' meeting in Geneva on Monday.
State-owned Spanish and east German steelmakers are also resisting the
Commission's tough line. Unlike Rome, Madrid and Bonn have been talking to
Brussels about changes. The Italians have not admitted the existence of
state aid in their plans and therefore refuse to cut capacity.
The signs are that the Italians will be prepared to negotiate. Earlier this
year, Mr Hayao Nakamura, Ilva's managing director, attacked a similar
approach - already being considered by Spain - as a surrender to
unjustifiable interference in Italy's internal affairs. Events since have
made it much more difficult to brazen out such a stance.
For example, Rome had argued strongly that Iri, the biggest state holding
company which owns Ilva, was now an independent entity ruled by market
forces and poised to sell off assets. But delays in the privatisation
programme have eroded that argument.
Iri last night expressed 'its deep reservations' on the content and motive
of the Commission's decision.
However, it stressed its willingness to meet EC officials and identify
'acceptable solutions', in the context of the reorganisation of the Italian
and European steel industry.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Iraq arms ban loopholes 'allowed by Whitehall': Scott
inquiry hears how Jordan was left off blacklist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT, the judge heading the arms-for-Iraq inquiry, yesterday
questioned why Whitehall officials allowed 'glaring loopholes' in the
government's restrictions on arms sales to Iraq.
UK government documents made available to the inquiry show that at the end
of 1991 Jordan was excluded from a British blacklist of countries which were
subjected to more stringent export controls.
This was in spite of the fact that British intelligence had provided what it
told government departments was 'irrefutable evidence' that Jordan was
diverting arms to Iraq.
During intense questioning at yesterday's public hearing, Lord Justice Scott
asked a witness, Mr Peter Vereker, head of the Foreign Office's arms control
and disarmament department, whether he did not agree that the exclusion from
the list had left open 'apparently glaring loopholes for material to get to
Iraq'.
Mr Vereker insisted that as far as the 'core interest' of his department was
concerned, Jordan's exclusion was not important, as his department had
'other ways of catching equipment'. But, all the time referring to
government documents, Lord Justice Scott implied that he was not convinced.
'What's the point of publishing a list if it hasn't got the right countries
on it?' he snapped at one point.
The inquiry has been looking at the export of munitions and defence-related
goods to Iraq in the period up to the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
However, in justifying his intervention yesterday, Lord Justice Scott told
Mr Vereker he considered the circumstances surrounding the list of relevance
since they could cast light on the strength of what he identified as a
'Jordan lobby' in the Foreign Office determined not to do anything that
might upset bilateral relations.
The Scott inquiry is examining the extent to which ministers, officials, or
agencies may have acquiesced in allowing arms and arms-related material to
reach Iraq .
The inquiry heard yesterday that a list of militarily high-risk countries
had been sent in November 1991 by Mr Peter Lilley, then trade minister, to
Mr John Major, the prime minister, which left blank a line where 'Jordan'
should have appeared.
Mr Vereker said the list had been drawn up after officials from the Foreign
Office's Near East and North African department, responsible for bilateral
relations with Jordan had challenged intelligence assessments provided by
the Ministry of Defence.
Mr Vereker yesterday confirmed that an official of the Near East and North
African department had handwritten over a copy of Mr Lilley's letter to the
prime minister: 'Jordan's disappeared. Well done.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / Government drops disputed Oxleas Wood road scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Transport yesterday scrapped plans to build a new road
through Oxleas Wood in Greenwich, south-east London, giving
environmentalists one of their greatest triumphs in recent years.
The controversial scheme would have severely damaged one of London's last
ancient woodlands and had been the target of vigorous campaigning by
conservationists and local residents.
It had also attracted the attention of the European Commission which earlier
this year started proceedings against the UK government claiming it had
failed to publish a proper environmental assessment of the project.
The aim of the scheme was to provide a link between the A2 London-Dover road
and the A406 North Circular by building six miles of dual carriageway
leading to a new bridge over the Thames, the East London River Crossing.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced in answer to a written
Commons question yesterday that he was dropping the Pounds 283m project
because the section passing through Oxleas Wood failed to meet the
environmental standards now applying to new road schemes.
He said the government still intended to build a link across the Thames
because the plan formed an important part of its strategy to regenerate the
East Thames Corridor. But fresh proposals would now be put forward,
incorporating a design competition for the bridge and possibly a role for
private sector finance.
Mr MacGregor added that his decision was 'quite independent' of the EC
proceedings because the government remained convinced that the environmental
assessment directive did not apply to projects already initiated when the
ruling came into force.
The main reason for the government's turnabout appears to have been an
acknowledgment that it had virtually no public support from any quarter for
its stance. The last straw came in May when the British Road Federation, a
lobbying group which normally argues strenuously for more roadbuilding,
allied itself with the campaign to stop the road through Oxleas Wood.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said: 'We have been
campaigning to save the wood for eight years, so we are delighted that the
government seems to have faced up to common sense.' But it warned against
complacency: 'The fact that the government is still planning to build the
bridge leaves an axe hanging over the wood.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Daimler-Benz to seek a listing in New York implies a radical
change in its attitude to investors. So it is natural for Deutsche Bank's 28
per cent stake in the company to come increasingly under the spotlight.
There is a strong argument that such a blocking stake is incompatible with
the more open approach implied by the New York move. But that does not mean
that Deutsche Bank will rush to sell. However strong the forces of change,
it cannot easily relinquish such an important symbol of its economic power.
There are practical reasons, too, for waiting. Now is the bottom of the
cycle. Deutsche might get a better price by holding on. That would also give
it time to overcome the tax problems associated with divestiture. For its
part Daimler has to cope with the uncertainty of the dissolution - in
connection with its New York listing - of Mercedes Holding, which holds 25
per cent of its shares. The move could leave some Daimler stock overhanging
the market.
Yet these are only arguments for delay. At some stage the fundamental
questions will have to be addressed. To German eyes Deutsche's alliance with
Daimler brings long-term stability of management and purpose. Perhaps it
also reinforces that sense of a corporation as having a broader social
purpose - to benefit the community and its workers as well as just
shareholders. But corporate Germany cannot cling to that and still solicit
foreign equity. International investors want returns, not to subsidise
someone else's social effort.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Small companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to judge whether the smaller companies bandwagon is still
gathering momentum or about to reach terminal velocity. Since the FT-SE
Small Cap index has risen by 20 per cent this year - while the FT-SE 100 has
stood still - small company shares might be due for a period of
consolidation. On most measures, though, the Small Cap is far from
overvalued. A yield and price-earnings ratio not far from the market average
is if anything modest for this stage of the cycle. If economic recovery is
this time led by capital goods industries, the Small Cap stands to benefit
from its weighting towards this sector.
The worry is that expectations of dividend and earnings growth are ahead of
what smaller companies can deliver. That is of concern in the upper reaches
of the market too, but small companies in particular will find cash flow
squeezed during the early stages of recovery. Dividend growth may be held
back as a result. If profits are growing strongly investors will be happy
enough. But the onus is now on companies to live up to their promise of
sharply higher earnings this year.
Lower interest rates will certainly help. Small Cap stocks are generally
more highly geared than larger companies. Their cost of borrowing is also
linked almost exclusively to short-term interest rates rather than long-term
bond yields. If that makes small companies especially sensitive to changes
in base rates, though, the best of the gains have already been seen.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK food retailers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To the puzzlement of investors, two leading grocers have just articulated
seemingly contradictory views of the industry's future. According to Mr
Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, it does not work. Looming saturation
and growing price competition will undermine profitability. Sainsbury,
though, begs to differ. According to Mr David Sainsbury, product of
generations of grocery genes, profits will continue to rise. Discount stores
have not significantly hit sales. Saturation is a distant prospect. There
remain 150 grocery outlets for every one Sainsbury store in the UK.
Perversely, both interpretations may be right. The difference is over
time-scale. The question is not whether the rate of profits growth will be
eroded but how quickly. In the 1980s, efficiency gains from information
technology, centralised distribution and fancy out-of-town superstores
enabled grocers to ratchet up gross margins every year. But this process is
running its course while falling inflation imposes whole new disciplines.
The big grocers will maintain earnings momentum for a while but even
Sainsbury does not expect further gross margin growth.
The food retailing sector will therefore remain a strategic sell - unless
cunning diversification plans materialise. But there is scope for tactical
buying. Even bearish forecasts suggest that a slowing Sainsbury should lift
profits by one third to Pounds 1bn by 1996. With the sector having sunk to
an all-time low, it may soon be due a bounce.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Dixons' short circuit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If last year's disappointments at Dixons were suitably varied, this year's
crop is depressingly predictable. Silo - the out-of-town US electrical
retailer which has proved a dark and dangerous hole in the ground - has
swallowed up yet more of the UK businesses' hard earned profits. When Dixons
bought Silo in 1987 it claimed that it would not repeat mistakes of other UK
retailers venturing into the US. Others had bought companies with weak
competitive positions or poor managements, and to boot had run the
operations from London. As it turned out, Silo had both a weak market
position and poor management, and the lack of control from London until too
late has proved a serious blunder.
Dixons is having one last throw at revamping Silo, but the trial in three
stores has the feel of a token effort. Indeed, the ground is being cleared
for closure since the UK and overseas operations have been hived into
separate subsidiaries. That will protect Dixons' ability to pay dividends
when the Silo write-off strikes.
The cash cost of closure will be lower than the monumental paper losses,
although it will still cut shareholders' funds to an unacceptably low level
 -all the more so since so much of Dixons' capital is in the form of
preference shares. As European property development could still subside, a
rights issue looks unavoidable if Dixons' directors wish to sleep at night.
It is all such a pity since the main UK business is doing well despite
pressure on margins from intensifying competition. Dixons must be left
hoping that Circuit City does not decide to hand out the same treatment to
electrical retailers in Britain.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HANDING responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of England would lead
to lower interest rates and strengthen the accountability of bank officials,
Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, said yesterday.
Lord Lawson told the Treasury and Civil Service committee that the present
system under which which politicians controlled interest rates led to
international investors demanding a 'risk premium' when buying sterling and
threatened the UK's anti-inflation credentials.
However, Lord Lawson's views were opposed by Lord Healey, a former Labour
chancellor, who told the committee he was 'an agnostic veering towards
scepticism' on the need for an independent bank.
Mr Kenneth Clarke is to make his first appearance as chancellor before the
Treasury and Civil Service committee on July 21.

<TEXT>
BOWING to pressure from the fishing industry, the government announced last
night that the introduction of new conservation regulations - due in the
autumn - would be delayed until January 1 1994.
Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, faced complaints from both sides of the
House that proposed regulations limiting the time British trawlers can spend
at sea were not matched by other EC members.
He confirmed that Pounds 25m would be available for reducing the size of the
fishing fleet through a decommissioning scheme to operate over the next
three years. He said the closing date for applications in respect of
eligible vessels had been put back from July 9 until the end of the month.
The decommissioning scheme was approved by a government majority of 115
(137-22).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INFLUENTIAL committee of MPs is to start holding snap one-day inquiries
in a move to step up its speed of response to emerging issues, David Owen
writes.
The Commons trade and industry committee will earmark one additional session
a month for the inquiries after MPs return from the summer recess in
November.
As well as examining issues that emerge at short notice, the sessions are
expected to be used to scrutinise how money is spent by the collection of
agencies and quangos monitored by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The intention is to gather written evidence before witnesses appear.
The committee effectively held one such inquiry earlier this year when it
used an unexpected gap in its schedule to interview senior Post Office
executives about the organisation's possible privatisation.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard rejects inquiries on
Euro-boundaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Howard, the home secretary, last night rejected demands by
opposition MPs that public inquiries should be held into the proposed
boundaries for Britain's six new Euro constituencies to be established
before next year's European parliament elections.
He warned that there were 'unacceptable risks' that the time needed for the
inquiries might result in the UK not being able to increase its numbers of
MEPs from 81 to 87 from next June.
Five of the new constituencies are to be in England and one in Wales.
Opening the resumed committee stage of the European Parliamentary Elections
bill Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, argued that there was still time
for public inquiries to be staged.
While stressing that he was not challenging Mr Howard's good faith, he
outlined proposals providing for public inquiries to take place within the
timescale required for an enlarged European parliament to be elected next
June.
Endorsing Mr Blair's arguments, Mr Robert Maclennan, spokesman for the
Liberal Democrats, emphasised that the public inquiries were the key part of
the process of ensuring the fair distribution of parliamentary
constituencies.
Mr Howard insisted that the timetable outlined by Mr Blair was
'unrealistic,' and stressed that it would be impossible to impose a time
limit once a public inquiry got under way.
He promised that the committees to be appointed to recommend the boundaries
of the new constituencies would take account of objections.
Former Tory minister Mr John Biffen (Shropshire N) said it was 'regrettable'
there would be no public inquiries and demanded assurances of 'maximum
opportunity for those affected to be able to appeal against whatever
decision is being made'.
A Labour amendment designed to facilitate the holding of public inquiries
was defeated by a majority of 41. Liberal Democrats attacked the government
for refusing to agree that proportional representation should be used to
elect the new MEPs. They were joined by some Labour backbenchers in voting
against the third reading of the bill which was carried by a government
majority of 172 votes (203-31).

FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Both sides claim victory in PM's
libel tussle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE unexpected end to the libel action by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
against New Statesman &amp; Society yesterday gave way to a war of words, with
both sides claiming victory.
Mr Major, who has accepted Pounds 1,001 in damages after the magazine
reported rumours linking him with caterer Ms Clare Latimer, declared himself
satisfied with the outcome. But the magazine simultaneously was claiming a
clear moral victory.
Once again distracted from international affairs by domestic issues - this
time the New Statesman's unilateral announcement of a settlement - Mr Major
said in Tokyo that the agreement meant the issue was 'dead and gone'. Ms
Latimer, who has also agreed to the settlement, said she was happy with the
outcome.
But back in London, Mr Steve Platt, the magazine's editor, said the prime
minister had accepted 'almost derisory' damages. For him, it was a moral
victory, albeit a very expensive one given likely total costs of around
Pounds 250,000 which left the magazine with enormous financial difficulties.
Mr Platt insisted that acceptance of the damages by Mr Major without any
attached apology or admission of liability on the magazine's part left his
colleagues holding the moral high ground.
In Tokyo, Mr Major remained equally adamant. The magazine had expressed
regret for the injury and embarrassment caused. The size of the damages, he
emphasised, had never been a relevant figure.
Mr Major and Ms Latimer had already been awarded damages reported to be
around Pounds 60,000 each against the printers and publishers - with an
additional Pounds 100,000 in costs - which the magazine has to meet. It will
now also have to pay Mr Major's and Ms Latimer's costs.
Mr Major, told of claims of a moral victory, retorted: 'It's a curious moral
victory, when they admitted it has cost them Pounds 250,000. They have
admitted that what they said was unfounded, they can't repeat it. If this is
a moral victory, it is not the sort of moral victory they would like every
week.'
Later in London, Mr David Hooper, the prime minister's solicitor, said: 'If
they thought they were going to win the case, they could have sat back and
said 'see you in court'.'
That remained the message yesterday from Mr Simon Regan, editor of
Scallywag, the satirical magazine, which is also being sued over the same
subject. He dissociated himself from the New Statesman settlement and said
he intended to see the case concluded in court.
In the latest twist, today's editorial in the New Statesman further taunts
the prime minister. It says Mr Major has won nothing which had not been
available five months ago.
Downing Street said it was not aware of what the prime minister had done
with the damages award.

OPPORTUNITIES for comp-romise between the Labour party and the unions over
internal party democracy appeared to recede yesterday as Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, reaffirmed his commitment at the annual conference of the
Transport and General Workers Union to the 'simple principle' of
one-member-one-vote.
Mr Smith told the conference that the principle must apply to the selection
of parliamentary candidates, but side-stepped the issue of union involvement
in the election of the party's leadership.
Mr Smith last week indicated that he would consider a deal which allowed the
continued participation of unions in an electoral college for the selection
of leader.
Such a compromise was flatly rejected by Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general
secretary, speaking yesterday after Mr Smith's address. 'I don't think that
we are in the business of trading off one part of our members' democratic
rights for another,' he said.
The GMB, another of the large unions opposed to the Labour leadership's
plans, has already made known its rejection of the deal.
The scene now looks set for a damaging split between the two wings of the
party at Labour's autumn conference. Unless Mr Smith can drive a wedge
between the unions opposed to reform, he faces a defeat: unions control 70
per cent of the votes at Labour's conference.
Mr Smith told the TGWU conference that there was 'no question of breaking
the historic links' between Labour and the unions. He added, however: 'We
should not be afraid of modernising our relationship.'
The word 'modernise' was greeted by a few shouts of 'rubbish' from the
audience, although, overall, the Labour leader's speech was well received by
the 700 delegates. Mr Morris said afterwards that he did not think Mr
Smith's speech had 'changed many minds in the conference'. One delegate said
the Labour leader should remember 'the trade unions started Labour, not the
other way round'. The union is likely to vote overwhelmingly today for a
motion against reducing trade union input into Labour's decision-making
procedures.
Referring to a scheme which would offer cut-price party membership to trade
unionists who paid the political levy, Mr Smith appealed for union members
to join the party as full individual members.
This was not just the democratic way forward, but would be a 'new source of
energy and strength', he said.
Mr Morris said later: 'We must not confuse proposals to increase Labour
party membership with the rights of trade unions within the Labour party
constitution.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Actions stations at Christchurch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE announcement of the by-election date trickled down to Christchurch
yesterday, the local political parties were not the only people to swing
into action, Gillian Tett writes.
At the Chef Peking Chinese restaurant, next to the Christchurch Conservative
Club, a cut-price campaign menu was on offer. But with the outcome of the
election still uncertain, the restaurant has tactfully avoided any
predictions. 'We're throwing in some wine so that way they can either
celebrate or commiserate,' said Mr Mike Allen, of the Chef Peking.
At the civic centre, a group of local businesspeople have already formed a
committee to find ways of cashing in on the media circus expected to hit
Christchurch soon. And as the first television cameras swooped into the town
yesterday locals were already buzzing with anticipation.
'Normally people round here don't talk a lot about politics,' said Mrs
Eileen Stephens, owner of a sweetshop. 'But this time there's a lot of talk,
a lot of moaning and groaning.'
Although Christchurch is dominated by pensioners, many of whom are
traditional loyal Conservatives, many yesterday admitted that they were
increasingly wavering in their vote.
'I have always voted Tory but I won't this time. They've messed everything
up,' said pensioner Mr Gilbert Smith. Mr Bernard Saxton, who had also voted
Tory all his life, echoed the complaints: 'I am hoping the Liberal Democrats
will win.'
At Liberal Democrat headquarters in a former car showroom, the mood was
cautious as scores of party workers stuffed leaflets into envelopes and
attempted to set up a campaign in an area where the party traditionally has
had a low profile.
'We are going to have to fight very hard to win,' said Mrs Diana Maddock,
Liberal Democrat candidate. 'We cannot be complacent.'
At Conservative party headquarters, where a bevy of Central Office workers
have been shipped in to boost the campaign, Mr Rob Hayward refused to
predict the outcome of the election.
Others will not be so reticent. Until polling day Christchurch will be a
natural home for pundits. The voters will end the speculation on July 29.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cautious Tories set date for
by-election test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday set the Christchurch by-election for July 29, a
date calculated to minimise the political shockwaves if it loses the
once-impregnable Tory stronghold to the Liberal Democrats.
The by-election, caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley, provides another
unwelcome test of Mr John Major's battered authority. The campaign in the
sleepy Dorset seaside town is expected to be dominated by the government's
handling of the economy, its tax and spending plans and by the widespread
slump in confidence in Mr Major's premiership.
By scheduling the poll for two days after the expected summer parliamentary
recess the prime minister hopes to avoid an immediate backlash from the Tory
back benches if the seat is lost. He also wants to maximise the pressure on
potential Tory rebels in a crucial Commons vote on the Maastricht treaty on
July 26, just before the start of the summer break.
But a defeat would still reawaken doubts about Mr Major's leadership and
increase the risk of a grassroots backlash at the autumn party conference.
An opinion poll this week shows that the prime minister's popularity rating
has now slumped to a mere 14 per cent, the lowest since modern polling
began.
Mr Robert Hayward, the Conservative candidate, starts the campaign defending
a general election majority of 23,000 over Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal
Democrat. In normal circumstances the 20 per cent swing required to overturn
that majority would be judged well out of reach. But in their crushing
victory in the Newbury by-election, the Liberal Democrats achieved a swing
of over 28 per cent, suggesting that a victory in Chistchurch is possible if
not inevitable.
Mrs Maddock's campaign is expected to focus on fears among the large retired
population in the constituency that it is likely to be among the main losers
from the government's fundamental review of the welfare state. She is likely
to seize on Mr John Major's warning in Tokyo yesterday that demographic
changes meant public spending on pensions had to be limited.
Mrs Maddock is also expected to exploit discontent about the imposition in
the Budget of VAT on domestic fuel and over the government's plans for
railway privatisation.
Tory hopes rest with the possibility that Mr Hayward, who lost his Bristol
seat at the last election, can persuade enough disgruntled Tory supporters
that economic recovery is now firmly entrenched. Mr Hayward, who is also
highlighting law-and-order issues, yesterday accused the Liberal Democrats
of 'smears' about government spending plans.
Mr Nigel Lickley will fight the seat for Labour, but the party has enjoyed
little traditional support in the constituency and its vote is likely to be
squeezed further by the Liberal Democrat challenge.
General election 1992 result: Robert Adley (C) 36,627; the Rev Dennis Bussey
(Lib Dem) 13,612; Alan Lloyd (Lab) 6,997; James Barratt (Natural Law Party)
243; Adrian Wareham (Chauvinist Raving Alliance) 175. Turnout 80.7 per cent.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour seeks to rally Tory rebels
on social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW alliance has been forged between Labour and Tory Euro-sceptics, aimed
at forcing Mr John Major to choose between accepting the social chapter or
being unable to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
Labour's draft proposal for the Commons debate on the social chapter - which
must take place before ratification - has been framed to maximise the
prospect of a coalition of all the opposition parties and Conservative
rebels which could defeat the govern-ment.
Labour has been keeping in informal touch with Conservative Euro-sceptics,
who met on Tuesday night to discuss tactics.
The party is considering adding to the pressure on Mr Major by putting up Mr
John Smith, the Labour leader, to open the set-piece debate, which is
expected on 26 July.
The need for a further vote on the social chapter was inserted into the
legislation to ratify the Maastricht agreement by the same combination of
opposition MPs and Tory rebels.
Labour's amendment for the debate is critical because MPs will vote on it
before the government motion. It would instruct the government not to ratify
the treaty unless it had previously said it would sign up to the social
agreement which applies only to the other 11 European Community member
states.
This is intended to attract both those in favour of the social chapter - on
the basis that the government would sign rather than block the treaty
altogether - and those who believe that the prime minister has tied himself
so strongly to Britain's opt-out that he would stymie the agreement rather
than surrender it.
Some Euro-sceptics believe that faced with that unenviable choice, Mr Major
might opt for a referendum on whether the UK should accept the treaty as he
negotiated it - the course which many Tory rebels prefer.
With the government's overall Commons majority standing at only 18, just a
few rebels would put the result in doubt. One estimate within government is
that there are about six Tories who would vote with the opposition, and at
least the same number who would abstain.
Mr John Major is expected to discuss tactics for the debate with government
business managers on Monday.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lawson urges independent Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HANDING the Bank of England responsibility for monetary policy would lead to
lower interest rates and strengthen the accountability of bank officials,
Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, said yesterday.
Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, Lord
Lawson said the present system under which which politicians controlled
interest rates led to international investors demanding a 'risk premium'
when buying sterling and threatened the UK's anti-inflation credentials.
However Lord Lawson's views were opposed by Lord Healey, a former Labour
chancellor, who told the committee he was 'an agnostic veering towards
scepticism' on the need for an independent bank. He said Bank officials
would not necessarily have a better success than government ministers in
economic stewardship.
Mr Kenneth Clarke is to make his first appearance as chancellor before the
Treasury and Civil Service committee on July 21.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind moves to reassure suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, defence secretary, tried yesterday to soothe defence
manufacturers' concerns about recent equipment cuts by indicating that the
government would give preference where possible to British contractors.
'There is always a bias towards a national supplier,' he said.
Mr Rifkind, answering questions after a speech on the defence programme to
the Royal United Services Institute in London, said it was important for
Britain to have an industry that could 'manufacture as much as possible' to
meet the country's military needs.
His remarks contrasted with the strong emphasis placed on international
competition for defence orders during Sir Peter Levene's period as chief of
defence procurement from 1985 to 1991.
Defence equipment remains outside the scope of the European single market.
Mr Rifkind said the Ministry of Defence, with a Pounds 9bn annual
procurement budget, was by far the largest single client British industry
had or was ever likely to have.
UK arms manufacturers had also, with MoD support, cornered 20 per cent of
the world market last year, more than any other country except the US.
'I can't think of any other part of our industry which has a performance
remotely comparable to that,' he said.
Mr Rifkind also took issue with his former armed forces minister, Mr Archie
Hamilton, who argued at the weekend for a reduction in the number of troops
in Northern Ireland.
Mr Rifkind promised that the government would provide 'whatever is needed'
to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary and that Northern Ireland would
take priority over other missions such as UN deployments. There are more
than 19,100 soldiers in the province, including the locally recruited Royal
Irish Regiment.
Meanwhile, officials disclosed that the British army might move part of its
training to North Africa because of the loss of its main training area in
Germany and pressure from environmentalist lobbies in the UK.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Private cash sought for 30% of CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT hopes that private investors will fund at least 30 per cent
of the cost of the CrossRail project to build two tunnels under central
London.
Ministers anticipate a public contribution of between Pounds 800m and Pounds
1.2bn, leaving a possible 60 per cent of funding for the Pounds 2bn scheme
to be raised from the private sector.
But they believe moves to revamp inflexible design and project-management
procedures could conceivably shave Pounds 300m off the final price-tag. This
could leave just Pounds 500m for the private sector to make up.
CrossRail would enable passengers travelling on suburban trains into British
Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street stations to reach the West End and
the City without having to change to the Underground system.
It is central London's biggest public transport project since the Victoria
line opened in 1968.
Ministers hope to be able to inject competition by asking potential
investors how much financing they would be prepared to provide, given
certain fixed assumptions about future fare levels.
They indicate that the size of the public contribution would be based on
quantifying the project's wider benefits such as reduced traffic congestion
and other environmental benefits.
One possible source of private funding which is under consideration by
ministers is a new London transport trust that would draw its income from a
levy on businesses - perhaps in the form of a business rate increase.
A penny on the business rate in greater London would raise more than Pounds
100m - enough by some estimates to support about Pounds 1bn in bond issues.
Ministers see an opportunity for introducing such a levy relatively
painlessly following the 1995 rating revaluation. This is expected to see
the burden of business rates shift away from the south-east towards the
Midlands. By some estimates, the rates bills of offices in the City could
more than halve.
The timing could fit neatly with CrossRail which is thought to be at least
18 months away from full clearance, following last month's second reading of
the parliamentary bill needed for it to go ahead.
The government's drive to attract private finance to projects such as
CrossRail is motivated by the urgent need to modernise the country's
infrastructure at a time when the spiralling public sector borrowing
requirement is forcing it to crack down on public spending.
London First, the business-led initiative set up last year to promote
strategic thinking about the capital, estimates that more than Pounds 17bn
will be needed over the next 10 years to fund the renewal of London's rail
and underground systems and to finance new projects.
Current government investment plans will provide only half of what is needed
over the next five years.
During last month's second reading debate Mr Steven Norris, transport
minister for London, said the government wanted the private sector
'fundamentally' involved in CrossRail. He said the government was not
contemplating a project to which the private sector 'might merely make a
small contribution'.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Clear water revival in Tyne: Industry and salmon have
returned to the river
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLETION of one of Britain's most ambitious environmental clean-ups,
the Pounds 150m transformation of the Tyne's urban reaches from open sewer
to England's best salmon river, will be celebrated tomorrow.
Kevin Keegan, manager of Newcastle United football club, will unveil an
information panel at Newcastle Quayside about the clean-up.
It will be part of a new heritage trail along the north bank of the Tyne,
charting the riverside's history and changing use.
The 20-year construction project - first discussed early this century - ends
the discharge of untreated sewage and industrial effluent from 200 outfalls
into the river's last 18 miles.
When design work on the scheme began in the late 1960s, pollution was so bad
that the river could be seen bubbling with gases produced by rotting waste.
On warm days, the stench of the sewage then visible was nauseating.
Oxygen depletion caused by the discharge of 700 gallons of raw sewage a
second was so bad that stretches of the river were dead, preventing the
salmon from reaching their spawning grounds upstream. Now they have
returned.
As traditional manufacturing has declined, the cleaner Tyne has made new
uses possible for riverside sites, including private housing and offices
inconceivable 20 years ago.
Without the scheme, the Pounds 500m of public and private investment so far
attracted by the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation would not have been
possible, according to Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive.
The investment includes an upmarket Pounds 21m hotel, the Copthorne in
Newcastle; the Pounds 27m St Peters Basin development, mostly of private
housing by Barratts, and the Pounds 140m Newcastle Business Park - last year
named Britain's most outstanding urban renewal project by the Institute of
Chartered Surveyors.
Mr Paul Cheesmond, a director of consulting engineers Merz and McLellan, one
of the occupants of the business park, remembers as a schoolboy 30 years ago
seeing the Tyne black and dirty.
The change has been dramatic. 'My office window looks out on the river. It's
far more picturesque than I ever imagined it could be,' he says. 'You can
see water-skiers and birds.'
He adds: 'It encapsulates some of the changes which have taken place over
the last 20 years. Everybody is upset about the shipyards but this is one of
the positive aspects.'
The interceptor sewers, which divert sewage from the old outfalls, run
parallel to the Tyne. Most were tunnelled under Tyneside, up to 120 feet
deep; the rest lie in covered trenches.
The network, handling waste from 900,000 people, feeds into a treatment
works at Howdon, Wallsend.
The clean-up began when Tyneside's local councils created the Tyneside Joint
Sewerage Board in the 1960s. Responsibility later passed to Northumbrian
Water.
In spite of the big improvement in the quality of the river water,
Northumbrian Water has more to do. At present sewage sludge treated at
Howdon is dumped six miles out at sea. Liquid effluent from the plant is
discharged into the Tyne's lower reaches where tidal action sweeps it out to
sea. New legislation means these practices must end in the next few years.
But, says Mr Bob McMillan, group design manager of Northumbrian Water,
'we've come a hell of a long way'.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Guidelines on selection of pupils by ability are eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS will be allowed to accept up to 10 per cent of their intake on the
basis of specific abilities under guidelines released yesterday by the
Department for Education.
Mr Robin Squire, the new education minister, announced that schools which
are strong in art, drama, music, sport or technology will be allowed to
select up to 10 per cent based on pupils' ability or aptitude in these
fields.
The education department said: 'A measure of specialisation does not mean
selection, which implies choice by the school; instead it means increased
choice for parents and pupils.'
The inclusion of technology, which is an academic subject within the
national curriculum, brought claims that other subjects could be added to
the list if the government wished to encourage selection.
Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokeswoman, described 'specialisation'
as a code-word for 'selection'.
The department said admissions policies should be 'clear, reasonable and
objective'.
Mr Squire refused to offer encouragement to schools wishing to become
grammar schools despite a ruling last week that appeared to show that
schools which had opted out of local authority control could make this
change without difficulty.
He said no conclusions should be drawn from the court decision that Mr John
Patten, the education secretary, acted correctly in allowing a school in
Penrith, Cumbria, to become selective, even though local consultation had
resulted in 55 formal objections to the proposal and only one letter of
support.
The ruling was justified because the governors supported the proposals, and
they were regarded as representatives of their community, the education
department said.
Under the new guidelines, any school whose character would be changed by
selecting pupils on academic criteria will have to undergo a period of
statutory consultation.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Sheehy defends proposals for police shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIXED-TERM contracts for police officers would not be a question of trying
to squeeze the public sector into a private-sector mould, Sir Patrick
Sheehy, chairman of the government-appointed inquiry into police and pay
responsibilities, said yesterday.
The introduction of fixed terms - with officers appointed on initial 10-year
contracts subsequently renewable every five years - is the committee's most
controversial recommendation. Sir Patrick, chairman of BAT Industries,
mounted a determined argument in favour of it when he addressed the
Association of Chief Police Officers conference in Birmingham yesterday.
In his speech he called on the government to 'move ahead with implementation
of our proposals as rapidly as possible'.
He said the present police tenure arrangements amounted to telling the
taxpayer that, whatever the changing needs and circumstances, the service
could do nothing to alter its staffing and skill profile in less than 30 or
40 years. He said: 'Surely this is unacceptable. The police service needs
the opportunity to renew itself.'
The committee made a series of recommendations which it believes would sweep
away barriers to effective management. They would place a duty on managers
to recruit carefully, plan ahead and introduce adequate career development
and training arrangements.
Sir Patrick defended the other most controversial proposal, to introduce
performance-related pay. No organisation could afford to employ 'passengers
or mere figureheads' and he said he made no apology for proposing that
senior officers' pay should be particularly dependent on their
responsibilities.
Sir Patrick faced critical questioning from senior officers and local
authority representatives at the conference.
Mr Keith Povey, chief constable of Leicestershire, said the service had been
attracting high-quality recruits and needed to continue doing so. He
questioned how the recommendations for lower starting rates, loss of housing
allowance, increasing the service requirement for full pensions from 30
years to 40 years, raising the retirement age to 60 and fixed-term contracts
would improve recruitment.
Mr Richard Wells, chief constable of South Yorkshire, said comments by Sir
Patrick had implied that his proposals would be supported by progressive
people in the police service. He added: 'There are progressive people in the
police service who actually welcome change who might want to question some
of your recommendations.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / Daf receivers form components group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS at Leyland Daf have formed a new company to run the collapsed
Anglo-Dutch truckmaker's parts distribution arm - the last and potentially
most valuable operation still to find a buyer.
The formation of Multipart Distribution by Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch
McKillop, the Arthur Andersen joint receivers, helps clear the way for an
expected sale in about two months.
The operation is based in Chorley, Lancashire and employs about 350 people.
The receivers are holding talks with a number of parties, including a
management buy-out team. Unipart Group is understood to be one of at least
three other possible bidders.
Mr McKillop said: 'Although the eventual ownership of Multipart has still to
be decided, we believe it is important that the parts operation also makes a
fresh start and carries on trading as a company no longer in receivership.'
The business, which used to trade as Leyland Daf Parts, had a turnover of
Pounds 140m in its last year and has been described as making 'significant
profits'. Estimates of its value run as high as Pounds 100m.
Whoever buys the business will have contracts with the three newly formed
truck and van manufacturing companies, including Birmingham-based Leyland
Daf Vans.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Criticism mounts of BT's selling by numbers / A look at the
fresh pressures facing the company as the last tranche of the government's
shares is offered for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF British Telecommunications thought the forthcoming sale of the
government's last tranche of shares in the company would give it a break
from regulatory pressure, the last week will have been a rude shock.
The prospectus for the Pounds 5bn sale, published last week, revealed that
BT may face a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into its directory
advertising services, notably its lucrative Yellow Pages business. This week
came notice from Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, that it is to
investigate directory enquiry services, where BT has a virtual monopoly.
Should the two investigations happen they will be separate - but there will
be considerable overlap. This is because the loudest complaint of
competitors to Yellow Pages is that BT's control of its numbering database
gives it an un-warranted advantage in the market for printed directories.
Thomson Directories, the main rival to Yellow Pages, has been airing its
grievances against BT for nearly a decade. It is no longer alone. Mercury
and the newly established cable TV companies are adding their voices - and
it was all these representations which precipitated the investigations.
Announcing the second investigation, Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of
Oftel, stressed the need for telecommunications subscribers to have access
to a 'complete' directory service, 'especially at the local level' in which
the cable companies are starting to compete fiercely with BT.
With the BT3 share sale imminent, BT refuses to discuss its directories
business. But analysts estimate that revenue from Yellow Pages last year was
in excess of Pounds 350m, with a profit margin approaching 40 per cent.
Rivals complain of BT's charges. Mercury has to pay BT Pounds 3.80 a year
for each of its numbers listed in BT's directories. The cable TV companies,
in addition to paying for entries, buy directories from BT for distribution
to their customers, many of whom have severed their BT connections.
The cable companies resent having to pay BT the full retail price for the
directories - Pounds 6.50 for 'white' pages and Pounds 5 for Yellow Pages -
when BT customers get them 'free' - the price being buried in the line
rental and not separately accounted for in BT's accounts.
Thomson is similarly concerned about BT's prices and its refusal to break
them down. In 1989 it secured a licence giving it access to the
business-numbers side of BT's numbering database, for a price similar to
that 'paid' by Yellow Pages to BT's numbering information services division.
However, Thomson believes that the price is too high in relation to the
costs, and that BT is able to get away with it only because of Yellow Pages'
dominant position.
It points to new BT directory services, such as Electronic Yellow Pages and
Talking Pages, and questions whether they recover their full costs. It also
questions whether other BT divisions pay the Yellow Pages rate for access to
the database.
The implication is that BT should have to account separately not just for
its main 'retail' and 'network' businesses, as suggested recently by Oftel,
but also for smaller 'retail' and 'network' units within them.
After all, for Thomson - with a turnover estimated at barely a sixth that of
Yellow Pages - small differences in prices charged by one part of BT to
another make a critical difference to its capacity to compete. Thomson is
thinking, for instance, about offering a rival directory enquiry service to
BT's, but says it needs to be able to unbundle BT's prices to be able to
assess the potential.
A drastic option would be to take the numbering database away from BT. That
would be the ultimate in unbundling, and prevent BT from gaining benefits
which are hard to quantify in its accounts - such as early access to
numbering changes and the ability to use its residential database to target
Yellow Pages and other services to phone subscribers, an economy which
Thomson claims places it at a competitive disadvantage.
Mr Gordon Mitchell, Thomson finance director, says: 'All we want is to
compete on a level playing field with BT businesses in the area of telephone
information services.'
That is the plaintive cry of all would-be competitors to entrenched
operators.
For Thomson, however, there is a bitter irony. From 1965 until 1980 it had a
contract to provide Yellow Pages for the Post Office, as it then was. When
it lost the contract for part of the country in a competitive tender in 1980
it decided to go it alone - and started to scrap with its former paymaster.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Balanced review in accounts is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES SHOULD provide a written statement in their annual reports
describing their performance and prospects under guidelines issued yesterday
by the Accounting Standards Board.
The proposed operating and financial review is designed to give directors
maximum flexibility in commenting on their company's results and financial
position.
The board's guidelines say the review should be balanced, objective and
analytical. It should also deal with both good and bad aspects of a
company's performance.
The statement will not be formally audited and is not compulsory like other
accounting standards because it will be published within the text of the
annual report rather than in the numerical accounts at the back.
But in an unusual endorsement by the Stock Exchange and the 100 Group of
leading finance directors, companies are being urged to comply with the
statement 'in the interests of good financial reporting'.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director of Reed Elsevier and chairman of the
100 Group's technical committee, said that he believed peer pressure would
encourage compliance by a growing number of companies.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, said: 'We want
a free-flowing document which leaves management free to write what they like
without being constrained by the required formats of the accounts.'
The review should include a commentary on the operating results, the
dynamics of the business, investment and other factors that may have an
impact on the future.
The financial review would cover the capital structure of the business,
internal financial management, cashflow and current liquidity, borrowing
requirements and future needs, and any overseas restrictions on the transfer
of funds abroad.
Companies will be permitted to exclude information that they believe too
sensitive on grounds of commercial confidentiality.
The guidelines suggest that the review may also be the appropriate place to
include a statement that the company is a 'going concern' for the next 12
months, as required by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance.
The review is designed for listed companies, and the board is encouraging
its adoption for other large corporations in which there is 'a legitimate
public interest'.

SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday signalled
his approval of the Law Society's latest application for wider advocacy
rights for solicitors in the higher courts.
Sir Bryan said the application - which was rejected by the Lord Chancellor's
Advisory Committee last week - did not have, nor was likely to have, the
effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition to any
significant extent.
Sir Bryan said that extending higher court advocacy rights to solicitors
would widen consumer choice and might lead to gains in efficiency.

LORD RUNCIMAN admitted yesterday that he had been 'very surprised' by the
degree of critical reaction to proposals from the Royal Commission which he
chaired for restricting the rights of accused people to opt for jury trial
in cases which could be heard by magistrates, Alan Pike writes.
He said after addressing the Association of Chief Police Officers conference
in Birmingham that in Scotland the right of defendants to select which court
should hear their case did not exist. He had not intended the committee's
proposal for parliament to set guidelines in England and Wales to prove
controversial. 'I do not at all see the case for giving the defendant the
choice,' he said.

ENRON, the US gas group, is to start construction of a second gas processing
plant on Teesside next year, costing Pounds 50m, Chris Tighe writes.
The investment was confirmed yesterday at the official opening of the
company's first Teesside gas processing plant at Seal Sands. The

completed Pounds 1bn project.
The Pounds 70m plant can process 300m cu ft of gas a day and receives
supplies from the Everest field. Amoco expects gas from the Lomond field to
come on stream next week.
The second plant, due to begin operation in 1996, will process up to 300m cu
ft of gas a day from the new Judy/Joanne North Sea complex.
Enron is a 50 per cent partner in Teesside Power, the joint venture which
owns the new combined heat and power Teesside power station. It is supplied

FT  08 JUL 93 / Crown Estate payment rises by 8.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CROWN ESTATE, the property owned by the sovereign, who surrenders its
profits to parliament in exchange for the civil list, yesterday announced
that its payment to the exchequer had risen by 8.4 per cent to Pounds 75.9m
for the year to end of March.
The estate, the UK's largest landowner, generated a revenue surplus of
Pounds 74.3m, up 3.6 per cent. Its value had fallen by 6.8 per cent to
Pounds 1.66bn by the year-end.
Lord Mansfield, the estate's first commissioner, said the estate had
'weathered the recession very well'.
The estate said its strength reflected 'the wide-ranging nature and quality'
of its portfolio, and 'the effect of good financial management and a prudent
investment strategy'.
Lord Mansfield said the Leasehold Enfranchisement Bill going through
parliament would have 'a considerable effect' on the estate.
Although the estate is immune from the bill's provisions, it has agreed to
enfranchise leaseholders except in places such as Windsor, Regent's Park and
Kensington, where there are historic associations, special security
considerations or close connections with royal palaces and parks. In these
cases, tenants will be allowed to extend their leases to 150 years.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Maxwell assets return 'unlikely'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAXWELL pension funds are unlikely to receive full restitution of the assets
stolen by Robert Maxwell, MPs were told yesterday by Mr Andrew Large,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.
He told the Commons social security committee that full restitution for
Maxwell pensioners was a worthy goal, but one that would be very difficult
to achieve.
'We don't know whether total restitution is needed for pensioners to enjoy
the benefits to which they are entitled,' said Mr Large. He added that SIB -
the organisation which oversees regulatory bodies for the financial services
industry - was doing everything it could to maximise restitution.
Asked whether he thought - with only Pounds 100m of the Pounds 440m stolen
from the fund still untraced or in disputed ownership - the time had come
for financial institutions to get together to reach a settlement, Mr Large
said he thought that would be 'extremely difficult'.
Reporting to MPs on the structure of self-regulatory organisations, Mr Large
said there was a strong case for having three bodies - with the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), watchdog for the fund management
industry, retaining its independence.
He said SIB would publish the criteria it intended to use in exercising its
power to ban individuals from the financial services industry under Section
59 of the Financial Services Act 'within the next month or so'. It was a
draconian power that needed to be used fairly but firmly.
A review of Imro's admission procedures had been undertaken, with monitoring
arrangements scrutinised.
Resources allocated to monitoring had been increased, with the number of
staff raised from about 35 to 50.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Mr Carr goes to Whitehall: An industrialist's secondment to
the DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOE CARR is convinced that some of his colleagues at the Department of
Trade and Industry regard him as 'a complete pain'.
Civil servants, he says, are usually pretty inhibited when it comes to
'crossing borders, questioning fundamental wisdoms or challenging their
boss'. Given that such traits come more easily to him, it is perhaps as well
that his career prospects will not be decided by powers within the DTI.
Mr Carr's air of independent detachment is understandable, bearing in mind
his imminent departure from the department after an 18-month secondment from
TI, the specialist engineering group. His temporary relocation in London
from TI headquarters in Oxfordshire - having changed places with the DTI's
Mr Chris Jackson - forms part of the department's strategy for developing a
new partnership between industry and Whitehall.
Mr Carr, who was TI's commercial director before arriving at the DTI, has
been one of a five-strong team of private-sector high-fliers attached to the
department's innovation unit. His relatively easy access to ministers will
not have endeared him to some of those who rarely see, never mind win the
ear, of the DTI top brass.
His unit's aim is to promote the need for innovation in business as a key
element in improving UK competitiveness. Mr Carr has been a busy emissary,
spending three days a week out spreading the message around the business and
academic communities.
After nearly 20 years and a 'very narrow career experience' in the same
company, he was anxious to widen his horizons and jumped at the chance to
enlist at the DTI.
He insists that, in spite of the frustrations he has encountered in the
department and the closed minds of some of those with whom he has had to
deal, the experience has been valuable and a lot of fun.
He stresses his admiration for the professional skills of the civil servants
with whom he has worked: 'They have excellent brains and are extremely
literate. Businessmen are consumed by data, relying on numbers and diagrams.
Civil servants are the masters of language and, contrary to what some cynics
might say, dedicated to the public interest.'
Mr Carr has criticisms, too. 'The trouble is that most of them have very
little alternative experience. The result is that they try and resolve
issues by polling everyone's ideas, averaging them out and making a
decision. Your view is not necessarily recognised, even if you have specific
expertise. That cannot be the best way to proceed.'
He believes that, in spite of the DTI's new mission to help UK industry
successfully compete in a tough world, many officials still believe they can
bring about change only 'by legislation and regula-tion or by spending
money'.
The DTI, he stresses, offers an 'enormous menu' of responsibilities and
broad scope to influence events. In his time there his projects have
included preparing a report on the role of venture capitalists in financing
innovation, a joint venture with the Confederation of British Industry to
devise a code of best practice for innovation, and an initiative to improve
dialogue between the City and the engineering industries.
Mr Carr has considerable sympathy for his temporary colleagues. The DTI's
big problem, he says, has been a lack of credibility which has prevented it
from doing its job properly. 'It is inevitable for a department which had so
many bosses in so short a time,' he says. 'Under Mrs Thatcher it had no
intellectual raison d'etre.
'It was given a hard time by the companies it tried to talk to, so it became
inward looking, afraid of the outside world.'
The result has been an unrealised potential and a worrying level of
performance.
Yet he accepts that the DTI is beginning to fulfil its potential to help
stimulate successful industry. He says: 'People are beginning to realise
that the dialogue with industry should not just be about crisis but about
what is good in business and how it can be encouraged.'
He says he has been helped from 'going native' and accepting the traditional
DTI approach to life by the presence of his four fellow secondees. 'We have
been able to regularly ask ourselves whether it is 'us or them' who are
right or wrong,' he says. 'That way you can collectively press for change,
rather than accept conventional attitudes.'
Therein, according to Mr Carr, lies another problem for civil servants.
'Your work goes into the system and it is very hard for most DTI people to
establish whether their efforts have any real impact,' he says.
'How do you ever know if you are, in some small way, helping the
wealth-creation process? You are left in no doubt about that at TI.'
So what benefits has the exercise brought for the DTI and for Mr Carr's
employer? He believes that he has brought some added value to the
department's operations.
He has been able to achieve a quality and range of dialogue with parts of
industry which would have been hard for department officials. He has also
been able to ask in-depth questions born of his detailed industrial
knowledge. 'I think most people have been persuaded that we have made a
difference,' he says.
As for TI, he says: 'If I ask whether my company's shareholders will benefit
from my experience, the answer must be yes. A better understanding of the
broader issues must, inevitably, help TI. And I've made some wonderful
contacts.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / Low redundancy pay 'widespread'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of all employers have no redundancy arrangements, a survey of
more than 1,000 employers in the government's Employment Gazette indicates.
It says 60 per cent of employees provide redundant workers with only the
statutory minimum redundancy payment - one week's pay for every year of
employment up to 20 weeks.
Twenty per cent of the sampled employers have made redundancies in the past
year, with financial services and engineering being the hardest-hit sectors.
Of those made redundant, 22 per cent were in managerial grades, 27 per cent
were white-collar staff, 26 per cent skilled manual workers and 16 per cent
other manual workers while 85 per cent were full-time workers.
Unions seem to make a big difference in whether employees are paid above the
statutory minimum. In workplaces where unions are recognised, only 35 per
cent of employees received the statutory minimum compared with 71 per cent
in non-union workplaces.
However, the survey says this may be related to size of establishment.
Unions are involved in formulation of redundancy arrangements at only 22 per
cent of workplaces where unions are recognised.
When making voluntary redundancies, employers are more likely to make extra
payments. In 60 per cent of cases of voluntary redundancies employers said
they paid extra to at least some employees. Employees who receive more tend
to be either long-service employees (49 per cent) or managers (32 per cent).
About half of employers in small companies employing fewer than 50 people,
said they would make no payments at all if the statutory scheme did not
exist.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Judges call for rethink on Bentley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE High Court judges ruled yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke 'erred in
law' when the then home secretary refused last October to grant a pardon to
Derek Bentley, who was hanged 40 years ago after being convicted of taking
part in the murder of a policeman.
The judges said it should be possible 'to devise some formula which would
amount to a clear acknowledgement that an injustice was done'.
They added: 'We would invite the home secretary to look at the matter again
and to examine whether it would be just to exercise the prerogative of mercy
in such a way as to give full recognition to the now generally accepted view
that this young man should have been reprieved.'
Bentley had allegedly encouraged a youth to shoot the policeman after the
two were caught attempting a burglary in south London.
Mr Clarke, who as chancellor is in Tokyo at the G7 summit, said: 'As far as
I am aware my judgments in the case have not been challenged. My judgment
was that the verdict of the jury was safe, and that Mr Bentley was in fact
guilty of murder.
'My opinion was he should not have been hanged in the circumstances because
of his mental handicap and because, though more culpable, the other man was
not hanged. I followed the precedent that a royal pardon was only given
where innocence was established.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / GKN calls for economic stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR David Lees, chairman and chief executive of industrial group GKN,
yesterday urged the government to provide a more stable economic climate for
business, and to make permanent the 40 per cent first-year capital allowance
introduced for one year only in the Autumn Statement, John Griffiths writes.
He told the Commons trade and industry committee that the UK had suffered
two significant recessions in little more than a decade, unlike most
competitor countries. This had made it considerably more difficult for
productivity improvements to be made.
Sir David said that in productivity terms, GKN's UK facilities were still
bottom of the league table of its European plants, but were 'catching up
quickly'. He acknowledged, however, that it would take a further three to
five years before they were likely to match GKN's best continental European
plants.
He described as overstated a widespread view that the City and financial
institutions were preoccupied with the short term.
Sir David's plea for greater stability and extra support for business by
extending the capital allowances on plant and machinery was supported by
executives of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
It also called on the government not to allow sterling to strengthen
significantly.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Tec chiefs vote today on central body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of directors of Training and Enterprise Councils will today decide
whether they want a strong central representative body, on the lines of the
Confederation of British Industry.
The vote, which is at the heart of how the 82 Tecs in England and Wales see
themselves, will be held at their third annual conference, at the National
Exhibition Centre in Birmingham.
Tecs, which are employer-led, administer more than Pounds 2bn of public
funds on government-funded training programmes. They also seek to improve
the training of people in work and stimulate economic development.
Agreement in principle is likely to be given at the conference to a new
national body, called the National Tec Council, which will replace the much
criticised G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen that represents common concerns
to the government.
Directors will then debate how powerful the new council should be. Some Tec
directors, most of whom are senior business leaders, believe that Tecs have
insufficient say with the government and want an authoritative lobbying
body.
Others believe that if such a body was created they would lose their local
autonomy - the key ingredient to which some Tecs attribute their growing
success.
A small but vociferous group of directors is against any diminution of their
direct contact with the government. They are likely to support the
appointment of a part-time chairman and annual budget of around Pounds
500,000. Others want a full-time director-general backed by a strong
secretariat.
After the vote there will be keynote speeches by three secretaries of state
 -whose attendance, along with several junior ministers, indicates the
important the government gives to Tecs.
An important and controversial theme at the conference will be the priority
that most Tecs place on economic development - rather than running the
publicly-funded training schemes for the unemployed and Youth Training, the
scheme for young people.
Tecs argue that unless they are able to help create enterprises there will
be fewer jobs.
They are likely to be pleased by the new employment secretary, Mr David
Hunt, who is expected to tell them that he sees them as prime movers in
economic development.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Policy for training jobless is attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANISATIONS training unemployed people are forced to pick the trainees who
can be trained most quickly, rather than people who are more disadvantaged,
the National Council for Voluntary Organisations claimed yesterday.
The council represents organisations traditionally working with women; the
disabled; the long-term unemployed, and those from ethnic minorities. It
said Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) were buying fewer places from
voluntary training organisations, and providers were being forced to be more
selective.
Its conclusions are based on a survey of training providers contracting with
52 of the 82 Tecs, which receive more than Pounds 2bn a year to administer
government training programmes.
Tecs have been given tougher targets by the government, which is
increasingly paying for 'outputs', such as National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs). Tecs in turn put more pressure on providers to
achieve qualifications.
The survey also shows:
A 16 per cent cut in funding voluntary adult training providers - which
provide about 15 per cent of all training places for adults.
An 11.5 per cent reduction in money spent on each young person in training.
A 12 per cent rise in funding to providers of Youth Training to tackle
waiting lists. The government guarantees a YT place to any 16 to 19-year-old
who wants one.
Mr Martin Ayton, NCVO policy and campaigns officer, said: 'The pressure is
on to select those who can be trained quickly and cheaply, whilst having to
turn away those who need the most.'
Employers are moving away from recruiting 16 to 19-year-olds and taking on
fewer, more qualified and older school-leavers, a report for the employment
department says today.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Gummer delays Sellafield extension plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN GUMMER, the environ-ment secretary, yesterday delayed planning
approval for an extension to the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant
in Cumbria.
In his first big environmental initiative since taking office in May, Mr
Gummer directed Copeland Borough Council to withhold permission for the
project until the impact of the plant had been more fully considered.
The Pounds 300m plant would manufacture mixed oxide fuel (Mox) for nuclear
power stations using a number of ingredients including plutonium and
uranium. The plant would obtain plutonium from Sellafield's Thorp
reprocessing plant, the start-up of which has also been delayed because of
environmental concerns.
The government does not now expect to make a decision about the go-ahead for
Thorp until the autumn, and it is clearly not logical to embark on
construction of the Mox facility until Thorp's future is clear.
Copeland council, which wants the Mox plant, had received legal advice that
it would not have to prepare an environmental impact statement as long as it
consulted widely. But Mr Gummer told the council that he was considering
whether a statement should be made under local planning regulations.
Mr Robin Smith, the council's general manager, said last night that Copeland
supported the plant because it would bring more than 200 jobs to an area of
high unemployment. Some 1,700 jobs had already been lost because of delays
in approval for the start-up of Thorp. 'Council members are very concerned
at this outside interference in the area,' he said.
Mr Gummer's action is further evidence of the dilemma facing the government
over the whole Sellafield site. Environmental pressure groups have been
fighting any expansion of the operations there - yet it is the main industry
in a very depressed area, and a potential export earner.
British Nuclear Fuels, owner of Sellafield, said last night that it would be
'inappropriate' to comment on yesterday's developments. However, the
state-owned company has already said that delays over Thorp are costing it
large amounts of money. BNF has argued that Mox represents one way of using
up some of the plutonium that will be extracted by Thorp.
The Mox plant would manufacture 120 tonnes of fuel a year. The original
schedule was for a start-up in 1997. A demonstration plant has already been
built at Sellafield and is ready to start work on orders from Switzerland.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Tax breaks could boost rented homes market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX allowances for invest-ment in new homes for rent could generate 50,000
extra rented homes a year, according to a report to be published later this
month by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation.
The report, prepared by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, says that
annual capital allowances should be introduced for the cost of building
homes for rent and on property which has not been rented out recently.
It recommends that the initial first-year allowance should be 40 per cent,
with the remainder of the cost set against tax at 4 per cent a year. Relief
would be clawed back if the property were sold within 10 years.
Rental income should be treated as trading income, the report says, adding
that rented property should be exempt from capital gains tax - provided that
it is held for at least 10 years.
The cost of the measures would be around Pounds 5,000 for each extra new
home, according to the report. This is a quarter of the cost to the
exchequer of each new home provided for rent under the Business Expansion
Scheme - which is wound up at the end of the year.
The report says that the tax measures are needed to make private renting
attractive to investors. Figures by Coopers &amp; Lybrand show that rented
housing could produce a real return of 6 per cent from net rents  - 2
percentage points less than is needed to achieve significant growth in the
sector.
The report also recommends the creation of residential property unit trusts
to attract funds from investors who do not wish to become directly involved
in rented housing. These would be attractive to investors who do not pay
tax.
Mr Richard Best, director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: 'The
fiscal incentives set out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand could draw in the huge
resources of City institutions which have been denied to the rented sector
for so long. The next Budget provides the moment to revive the rented sector
on a much bigger scale.' Sir George Young, the housing minister, will today
urge financial institutions to become involved in the government's programme
for transferring local authority homes to housing associations. More than
Pounds 500m will be required to fund this year's transfer of 43,000 homes in
13 local authority areas.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Graphic terrorists advertisements launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRUTAL set of television advertisements graphically depicting terrorist
murder was launched yesterday, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The three advertisements - a scene from one of which is pictured - cost
Pounds 373,000. They are to be shown in Ulster to encourage the use of a
confidential police telephone line.
'Government must tackle the evil of terrorism by every practical means,'
said Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. 'These films are part
of that effort.'
Two of the films are so violent they will only be shown after the 9pm
watershed.
One depicts two weddings. Later one groom murders the other and the killer
is jailed. The two wives pass in the street without knowing each other. The
second portrays how violence is handed down through the generations. A
father is involved in random killings in a bar. Later his son is murdered as
his young son looks on. The third shows a tragedy avoided because of the use
of the telephone line.
Sir Patrick said: 'It is not the government's wish to re-open grievous and
painful wounds. But terrorist crime continues to extinguish lives and blight
many more.' He added that the campaign was aimed at those involved in or on
the verge of committing terrorist acts.

The case of Mr John Matthews, who was flown to Belfast yesterday, is set to

relations between the two governments.
Mr Matthews was freed by magistrates on Tuesday when the prosecution offered
no evidence on a charge that he ordered a taxi driver to take a bomb to

rights for solicitors in the higher courts.
Sir Bryan said the application - which was rejected by the Lord Chancellor's
Advisory Committee last week - did not have, nor was likely to have, the
effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition to any
significant extent.
The liberalising nature of the proposals would serve to lower entry barriers
to the market for the supply of higher court advocacy services, he said.
But in his advice on whether to approve the society's application, Sir Bryan
said that Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, should consider a mandatory
requirement that a solicitor's advice to a client on choice of advocate, the
likely costs and the criteria for any recommendation, should be clearly set
out in writing.
Sir Bryan said that extending higher court advocacy rights to solicitors
would widen consumer choice and might lead to gains in efficiency.
His advice will now be considered by Lord Mackay together with the advice of
his Advisory Committee before he decides whether the society's application
should be approved.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Politicians on all sides court enduring Perot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON politicians wish that they could close their eyes and make him
disappear, but Mr Ross Perot shows no signs of obliging.
Instead, both parties have set their best minds to work on devising
strategies of enlisting support from the mercurial Texas billionaire and his
rebellious supporters.
Several Republican members of Congress have joined United We Stand, the
supposedly non-political Perot organisation, and others are jostling for
space on the same public platform with him.
Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison, the newly elected Republican senator for Texas,
won Mr Perot's endorsement during her campaign - carefully disguised so as
not to imperil the tax-free status of United We Stand - and some senior
Republican leaders believe that Mr Perot could run for and win their party's
presidential primaries in 1996.
In a study of Perot voters published yesterday, the Democratic Leadership
Council, which stands to the right of the Democratic political spectrum,
argues that President Bill Clinton must find ways to win support beyond the
43 per cent of the electorate that voted for him last year.
'To expand his base, the president must go hunting where the ducks are. That
means targeting the nearly 20m voters who backed Ross Perot in last year's
election,' said Mr Al From, DLC president.
The DLC study, conducted by the Greenberg Research polling organisation,
warned that politicians and pundits have misunderstood Perot voters, who are
often assumed to be principally concerned about the federal budget deficit,
which was the subject of many of Mr Perot's advertising seminars last year
and which lay at the heart of his campaign message.
Mr Stanley Greenberg, the pollster, notes that three quarters of last year's
Perot voters do not mention the deficit first or second among their greatest
worries, instead listing the economy, healthcare and jobs as their primary
concerns.
'What the deficit represents to Perot voters is a massive act of
irresponsibility on the part of the leadership of this country,' Mr
Greenberg says.
Another recent poll conducted for Time/CNN showed that, given a choice
between cutting the budget deficit and stimulating the economy, 58 per cent
of Perot voters favoured the latter.
The DLC argues that the message of these polls is that Mr Clinton needs to
concentrate on centrist, 'New Democrat' policies to revive the economy,
reinvent government, spend government money with discipline and avoid
capture by the Washington establishment.
Mr Greenberg's soundings show, however, that the Perot factor is here to
stay. Perot voters have not aligned with either of the two traditional
parties since the election.
In a three-way race against Mr Clinton and a Republican candidate such as
Senator Bob Dole or Mr Jack Kemp, three-quarters of last year's Perot voters
would once again vote for Mr Perot, once again allowing Mr Clinton to win
with fewer than 50 per cent of the votes. Should the Texas populist join the
Republicans, the 1996 election would tighten to a heat, with 47 per cent for
Mr Perot and 46 per cent for Mr Clinton.
While Mr Greenberg cautions that this result is artificial, he says it shows
the durability of Mr Perot's appeal: 72 per cent of Perot voters who
describe themselves as Democratic-leaning would, nevertheless, join the
Texan on a voyage to the Republicans.

FT  08 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Murdoch threat to close NY Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch, who has been managing the troubled New York Post since
March 29 with the aim of eventually buying it, is threatening to close the
tabloid tomorrow if he cannot reach agreement by then with its unions on
cost-cutting measures.
Mr Murdoch's News Corporation is running New York's smallest and raciest
tabloid under a deal with the bankruptcy court which controls the Post's
fate.
The agreement, which runs until the end of August, gives him permission to
walk away from the management contract, after a three-day notice period, if
he and the paper's 11 unions cannot agree on terms which would make the Post
economically viable.
On Tuesday, Mr Murdoch gave the court the required three-day notice of
intention to end the contract at 4pm on Friday.
A spokesman for News Corporation said the Post was losing about Dollars
330,000 (Pounds 220,000) a week and Mr Murdoch had spent some Dollars 8m
since he emerged in late March as a potential saviour for the paper.
Union officials have said that while they are prepared to make some
concessions, Mr Murdoch has been asking for too much. News Corporation's
pressure on the unions follows a June 29 ruling by the Federal
Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the media
industry, allowing him to own both the Post and a television station in New
York.
Federal regulations normally forbid ownership of both a paper and TV station
in the same market, but Mr Murdoch received a waiver after receiving
widespread political support in New York and making clear that he would shut
the paper quickly if he did not receive the green light.
If he backs out of the management contract, the paper's fate would once more
be in the hands of the bankruptcy court, which might be unable to find an
alternative buyer. If Mr Murdoch's talks with the unions succeed, he will
then have to negotiate precise purchase terms with the court.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Russia yesterday signed an agreement to finance Russia's purchase
of at least Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) of US equipment and services to
revive its flagging oil, gas and petrochemi-cal sectors.
The deal, which comes after more than a year of difficult negotiations, is
also ex - pected to create thousands of jobs in the US oil and gas equipment
and services sector.
Under the terms of the agreement, negotiated by the US Export-Import Bank,
revenue earned by the Russians from the sale of oil and gas will be
deposited in escrow accounts in Moscow Narodny Bank in London or Eurobank in
Paris. Money from such accounts will be used to repay the Eximbank loans.
In order for the deal to go ahead, the World Bank must release Russia from
the requirement that it be the first institution repaid when a country has
the currency to do so. The Bank board is expected to vote on this 'negative
pledge waiver' in the next few weeks, but the Eximbank officials say they
will not wait for the vote to move forward with paperwork on specific
transactions.
On March 30, the World Bank voted for a general approval of negative pledge
waivers but the action still requires the Bank's board to grant a waiver to
a specific nation on a country-by-country basis.
The first transaction in the Dollars 2bn facility could be approved by
Eximbank as early as September.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Clinton nominee defends judiciary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's nominee for the vacant seat on the US Supreme Court
has defended the judiciary against charges of being too activist and
usurping the role of elected politicians in setting public policy.
In written answers to a questionnaire before her Senate confirmation
hearings begin on July 20, judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, described judicial
activism as 'a label too often pressed into service by critics of court
results rather than the legitimacy of court decisions.'
The courts would not have to take such an active role, she suggested, if
legislators had made 'the hard, somewhat controversial decisions necessary
to equip judges with clearer policy directions ..'
Mrs Ginsburg, whose ideological stance is not readily definable, appears
already to have won enough backing from key senators to ensure Senate
confirmation.
Judicial activism has been an important issue in conservative criticism of
the Supreme Court, since it began to take a more aggressive approach to
social issues in the 1930s, and particularly under Chief Justice Earl Warren
in the 1950s and 1960s. With the arrival of new justices appointed by former
Presidents Reagan and Bush the balance has swung to the right.
In earlier writings Judge Ginsburg suggested the Supreme Court could
endanger its credibility by moving too far ahead of the political process,
or lagging too far behind.
'Without taking giant strides and thereby risking a backlash too forceful to
contain, the Court through constitutional adjudication, can reinforce or
signal a green light for social change,' she said in New York.
The 1954 Brown vs Board of Education decision that barred school segregation
followed a carefully prepared path in the campaign against racial injustice,
she argued. On the other hand, Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision outlawing
most anti-abortion statutes, may have reversed a tide that was already
underway in the political arena and triggered 20 years of bitter
controversy.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Fear and loathing in Vegas and Jersey: The threat of
competition to US's traditional gambling centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO sooner had the Mississippi burst its banks this week, than there was a
spate of announcements: riverboat gaming would not be interrupted.
Little, it seems, will stop the explosive growth of the US gambling
industry. And that means problems for the nation's two traditional gaming
strongholds, glitzy Las Vegas in Nevada and New Jersey's more down market
Atlantic City.
For years, these were the only centres for legalised casino gaming in the
US. Now competitors across the nation are threatening to woo their punters
away.
Atlantic City, a depressed town which lacks essential infrastructure, is the
more severely affected. This is particularly bad news for Mr Donald Trump,
whose three casinos make him the biggest operator in town. The New
York-based property and gaming mogul has even filed a legal action against
the US federal government seeking to block the growth of casinos on Indian
land.
Mr Trump's complaint stems from a 1988 federal law which permitted Indian
tribes to engage in any form of gambling which was already legal in a
particular state. In itself, this did not look hugely permissive. However,
many states which outlawed traditional gambling did permit charitable 'Las
Vegas nights' with 'casino-style' gaming. Using this loophole, tribes
successfully established their right to run casinos.
Today, legal gaming operations, from bingo to blackjack, are reckoned to
exist on more than half the nation's Indian reservations. In the case of
more serious 'class three' gaming operations - casino games, slot machines,
Jai Alai and horse and dog-racing - 78 agreements have been struck between
tribes and officials in 18 states. Gaming on Indian land is now a Dollars
6bn-a-year business, according to the National Indian Gaming Association.
Meanwhile 'riverboat' gambling has started to flourish on the Mississippi.
The movement began in Iowa, largely in response to local economic
difficulties. The state approved riverboat gaming in 1989 after four years
of lobbying.
Illinois, Missouri, Mississippi and Louisiana quickly followed. Now Texas is
considering legislation which could bring riverboat gaming to seven
locations on the state's Gulf Coast.
Given these two catalysts, the spread of legalised, onshore gaming to
centres other than Vegas or Atlantic City has become almost inevitable. Most
states could use the additional tax dollars and the jobs.
The expansion remains controversial: opponents cite social problems and
Indians themselves have been divided. Worries of mob influence in the newer
gaming centres also continue to surface - an issue mentioned in the Trump
suit.
His legal action, however, centres on the issue of state powers versus
federal ones, and mirrors rearguard actions being mounted by 'anti-gaming'
lobbies in states such as Florida and Alabama. It argues that the federal
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment,
which reserves for states all the rights which have not been expressly given
to the federal government.
Legal arguments notwithstanding, much of the industry's expansion may now be
irreversible. Big gaming companies - such as Hilton Hotels, Promus and Steve
Wynn's Mirage Resorts - have seized the new opportunities, striking deals
with tribes and competing to run both new land-based casinos and riverboats.
For Atlantic City, where the seafront casinos lead on to blocks of run-down
houses and dilapidated streets, this is bad news.
To boost business, New Jersey decided to allow 24-hour gaming, lifting
revenues to Dollars 3.2bn last year. But infrastructure investments - such
as a modern airport and a new convention centre - are only belatedly getting
under way, presenting an opening for eager competitors.
Nevada has been in the gaming business since 1931, compared with only the
mid-1970s for Atlantic City, and the transport and convention facilities are
better. About 40 per cent of visitors fly into Vegas, giving the city more
chance of competing for punters on a national scale.
Even so, Vegas has not been immune to the west coast recession and
competitive pressures. Although California has declined in importance as a
source for visitors, the state still accounts for about one-third of Las
Vegas's customers. A surge in alternative gaming options there could present
the Vegas impresarios with even tougher business odds.

Harrods, they say, is timeless. So it was apt that the star role at the
opening of its summer sale should be played by the ageing Burt Reynolds.
True, a few screams split the air from middle-aged fans among the
bargain-hunters, some of whom had camped out all night on the pavement. But
they may have been less enthused by the manner of the man, with his grey
hairs and leathery suntan, than by the manner of his arrival.
In the best of Hollywood traditions, he rolled up in an olive green
horse-drawn carriage preceded by pipers.
By then, Observer was too far away to hear what they were playing. If the
theme of the event was Harrods' history, however, it was perhaps The Bonny
Earl o' Murray, whose first words go something like:
'Ye Highlands and ye Rowlands, O where hae ye been?'

Don't despair. When Norman Willis retires as general secretary of the Trades
Union Congress, his line in homely parables and never-ending metaphors will
continue. His successor is already warming up in the wings.
Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, rejecting a possible compromise by the
Labour leadership over unions' involvement in internal party democracy, said
yesterday: 'It's like if somebody wants to knock your greenhouse down and
they threaten to knock your house down and then, in discussion, you get back
to the point where they say 'oh well, I won't knock the house down, I'll
just knock the greenhouse down'.
'That's not much of a compromise, is it?'

<TEXT>
While the more fuddy-duddy clearing bankers might frown on Beynon's
brass-necked ambition, it is a fact of life that, were it not for outsiders
like him, there would be even fewer success stories in British banking.
Take Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line, the UK's fastest growing
general insurance company. He is a computer boffin who spent 11 years in
Alexander Howden's back office before joining the Royal Bank of Scotland in
1984. It's no wonder that RBS rewards him so handsomely. He has created a
hugely successful business out of nothing.
David Jones, chief executive of Sharelink, the soon-to-be floated telephone
share-dealing service, is trying to do the same. It wasn't until he broke
free from BT in the mid-1980s that his entrepreneurial flair was noticed. In
a stockbroking industry where losses are more normal than profits, Jones has
created a fast-growing business with operating margins of 40 per cent. Its
long-term viability still needs testing in a bear market, but his success to
date is impressive.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Observer: Paragon unmasked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The mystery is solved. The high-level clearing bank executive who works from
dawn on Monday until 8pm on Friday, and gives 110 per cent of his time to
the business, has been formally identified.
Observer's interest had been aroused when the fax brought an anonymous
excerpt from a bank's in-house magazine. It talked of a high-octane
executive not only on the way to the office before other commuters got up,
but then working so hard that he rarely saw his ballet-dancer wife - let
alone his Georgian rectory, swimming pool, gymnasium, and dance studio.
Could there really be a clearing banker like that?
The answer is yes . . . and no. The paragon turns out to be David Beynon,
new boss of Midland Bank Personal Financial Services. But he's not a pukka
clearing banker.
His main background is life-insurance selling, including 17 years with BAT's
pushy Allied Dunbar until he undertook to turn Midland's infant bank
assurance business into the market leader. But if it doesn't work out, his
previous experience would seem to have given him a rare range of options.
He has also been, among other things, a drama teacher, Flamenco guitarist
and dustman.

With Premier Major's re-election chances still far from assured, Britain's
voters should perhaps be glad they don't live in Swaziland. Every poll there
is apparently preceded by an upsurge in ritual killings.
'There is a strong belief among Swazis that human blood is good medicine and
can bring power to people,' says police inspector Azaria Ndzimandze who has
just warned local politicians against being too cut-throat in competing for
parliamentary seats.

After the empire, manufacturing and moral values, is the British officer
class now also on the decline? That at any rate is the perception of Major
General Rob McAfee, in charge of army training.
He went before the Commons defence committee yesterday to bemoan the
'deficiencies in instinctive leadership qualities' observed in the recent
crop of cadets at Sandhurst military academy. Would-be officers up in front
of the army's Regular Commissions Board, which vets all applicants, tended
to be 'less well-prepared' to take on leadership roles than in the past.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the committee's Tory chairman, blames the schools for
placing too much emphasis on academic qualifications and not enough on
sport. But his colleague, Winston Churchill, will perhaps remember his
grandfather's remark: 'Based on many years' observation, officers with high
athletic qualifications are not usually successful in the higher ranks.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Time to get tough on steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission's decision yesterday to crack down on state aid to
the Italian steel industry is a welcome sign that Mr Karel Van Miert, the
competition commissioner, can take as robust an approach to market
distortions as his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan. The Italian government
yesterday appeared to be softening its position, but it has still not come
into line.
The confrontation has been caused by Italy's unwillingness to accept that a
plan by IRI, the state-owned holding company, to write off Ecu4bn in aid to
Ilva, its wholly owned subsidiary, amounts to state aid. Italy's position is
based upon the argument that IRI ceased to be a government agency last year
and that the plan is being driven by commercial considerations.
This argument is specious. Merely converting IRI from a government agency to
a state-owned company does not put it beyond the reach of political
considerations. It is inconceivable that a rational private owner would
write off Ilva's debts without also demanding cuts to stem losses of Ecu84m
a month.
One consequence of Italy's resistance is that a Europe-wide scheme to turn
the steel industry from a bloated sector of the economy into a globally
competitive one could unravel. A meeting of the Council of Ministers
scheduled for the end of this month which was to hammer out such a plan has
had to be postponed.
If Italy refuses to play by the rules, it may well be impossible for the
Commission to insist that Spain and the Treuhand, east Germany's
privatisation agency, cut hand-outs to their stricken companies. The
fall-out could be a subsidies war in which more efficient private-sector
steel-makers are driven out of the market.
Potential damage
But the potential damage does not stop with the steel industry. If the
Commission fails to rein in steel subsidies, there will be nothing to stop
governments handing out aid to companies in other sectors. That would
endanger the single market, as Mr Van Miert said in a speech earlier this
week. The idea of the single market programme was to encourage dynamism and
efficiency by bringing down barriers to trade. But if governments are
allowed to skew this process by giving unfair advantages to inefficient
domestic competitors at the expense of efficient foreign rivals, the
legitimacy of the programme will suffer.
Closing steel plants will, of course, never be popular. Plants are typically
located in communities where unemployment is already high, while steel's
prominence in a dwindling manufacturing sector gives it a hold on public
affections, with the result that the industry has tremendous lobbying clout.
Enfeebled industry
But delaying the restructuring of the European industry will in the end do
nobody any favours. The industry has already been enfeebled through
dependence on subsidies, estimated to have totalled DM121bn between 1975 and
1990.
Such aid not only wastes taxpayers' money, but keeps steel-workers in jobs
which are not sustainable in the long run. Instead help should focus on
creating durable jobs for redundant steel-makers, an approach which has met
with some success in the UK.
By this standard, the Commission's plan is far from ideal. In response to
political pressure, it has made clear it will allow aid to the Italian,
Spanish and German state-owned companies in return for capacity cuts. It has
also imposed anti-dumping duties on cheap imports from eastern Europe. As a
result, competition within the Community will be distorted and eastern
European countries will face an unwelcome barrier to their attempts to
develop their economies.
But the Commission plan is clearly preferable to untrammelled subsidies and
full-blooded protectionism. Yesterday it backed up its plan with the threat
of sanctions if the Italians do not come into line. These could include
cutting off Community aid to Italy to finance steel redundancies or, in the
extreme, erecting barriers against the export of Italian steel to other
Community countries. It is to be hoped that none of this will be necessary.
But if Italy refuses to toe the line, sanctions will be in order.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Oil on Algeria's troubled waters: There is little hope for
peaceful change as the governmentsets a timetable for elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What Algeria's press ruefully calls the country's 'multi-dimensional crisis'
has claimed another 11 lives this week.
The three soldiers among the dead bring to 78 the number of Algerian
security personnel slain by Islamic extremists in the past seven months.
Diplomats put the death toll of the violence which has ravaged Algeria since
the annulment of its first multi-party elections in late 1991 at 1,000.
Algiers, the capital, has been under a night-time curfew for months.
But political violence is only the starkest symptom of Algeria's ills. Since
the military-backed government deprived the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of
victory in the second round of the 1991 poll, Algeria has been pitched into
a combination of political convulsion and economic straits unequalled in its
30 years of independence from France.
'Everything is in the air at once,' says Mr Omar Belouchet, editor of
El-Watan newspaper and survivor a few weeks ago of an assassination attempt.
'The future of Algeria is being decided, debated, now, passionately and
violently at every level. We are deciding on a project for our society.'
This 'project' took its violent turn straight after cancellation of the
elections, an act pressed on the government by the army, which then set up a
five-man presidency known as the High State Council to govern the country.
The FIS was outlawed, although its anti-government rhetoric, populist appeal
to the poor, and promise to install an Islamic state won it 3m votes and an
unassailable majority in the 430-seat assembly in the 1991 poll. Its leaders
were detained, or they fled, and a battle started between armed extremists
and the police, punctuated by assassinations of eminent scholars and
writers.
Last month, however, the state council took what it claims is the first step
towards restoring Algeria's political balance and, eventually, to bringing
in democracy. It has laid out a draft transition plan - to be discussed by
the main political parties, including two permitted Islamic groups, and the
main, republican leftist parties - allowing for presidential elections no
sooner than 1996, but no later than 1997.
By ruling out elections until 1996, diplomats, politicians and academics
believe, the state council is giving itself time to achieve its two greatest
priorities: to restore security, and to revive Algeria's economy. The
government's political project will depend essentially on achieving these
goals.
One senior diplomat puts it more strongly: 'The government is certainly
trying to bolster its own legitimacy by seeking consensus, but finally the
regime's top priority, raison d'etre even, is to smash Islamic
fundamentalism.'
Few in Algeria underestimate how bloody a fight this will be. Although
residents of some 'hot' FIS areas in Algiers say attacks on security forces
have dropped since 15,000 troops were brought in to the capital recently,
there is plenty of evidence that extremists are able to carry out
well-planned ambushes with groups of 10-20 heavily armed men.
But the logic of the government's strategy is that it can seriously damage
support for the Islamic extremists if it tackles the social and economic
deprivation from which the FIS appears to draw its nourishment. Its hopes
for the economy rest on optimism over the country's unexploited resources in
hydrocarbons - oil and gas - and success in mastering its foreign debt.
Algeria leans heavily on its oil, gas and other hydrocarbon exports, which
bring in more than 95 per cent of the country's hard currency earnings -
about Dollars 11bn last year. But a crippling 71 per cent of export earnings
are devoured servicing Algeria's Dollars 27bn external debt, leaving the
country's industries starved of money to buy spares and raw materials. The
government blames this hard currency shortage, above all, for unemployment
of more than 20 per cent and the fact that state enterprises - which make up
about 80 per cent of Algeria's industry - are running at an average 60 per
cent of capacity.
But the government calculates it will be over the crest of its present debt
servicing mountain within three years, and western economists agree that by
1996 Algeria's payments of interest and principal should fall to 50 per cent
of hard currency earnings.
As important as the fall in its debt servicing is the potential rise in its
export earnings. Since Algeria abandoned its determination to develop its
hydrocarbon wealth without foreign involvement in the late 1980s, it has
signed more than 30 exploration and production sharing deals with foreign
oil companies. The arrival of companies such as BP, Repsol, Arco and more
than 20 others is expected to lead to fresh discoveries, and to improve the
exploitation of oil and gas already found. The government estimates that
total investment in the industry will reach Dollars 19.3bn by 1997.
Natural gas sales were already expected to double to 60bn cu m by 2000
through announced plans to double its present pipeline capacity to Italy and
for the construction of a fresh link to Spain.
'Algeria's gas is very strategically placed for the south European market,
which is growing fast,' says Mr David Drury, BP's general manager in
Algiers. Figures from Sonatrach, the state oil group, suggest the value of
hydrocarbon sales should rise to about Dollars 13bn by 1997, assuming oil at
Dollars 20 a barrel.
Some western economists believe that earnings of this order, combined with a
reduced debt burden, could leave Algeria with an extra Dollars 5bn a year to
spend on the domestic economy. It is this bonus on which the government is
counting. 'The government thinks that as revenues grow it can afford more
openness politically, but while 70 per cent of their resources are paying
off debt they have no room for political manoeuvre,' says one western
ambassador.
But it may be dangerous to bet on an essentially economic solution to the
country's political problems. First, the government is assuming that the
boost to export earnings will easily translate into job creation. Many
economists seriously doubt this will happen, given the government's
continued commitment to a largely state-run economy. 'So far the
government's policy is essentially to pour money into inefficient public
sector enterprises,' says a western economist. 'And there's no chance in
hell that will work. These enterprises are not economic concerns, they're
employment agencies.'
The government also appears to be hoping to weather the period up to 1996-97
without any further political fissures blowing open. Many question this,
too. Among politicians, there are already clear signs that the government's
hoped-for 'national consensus' may be illusory.
'It will be impossible to reach consensus while there are two completely
opposing political beliefs in the country - Islam and republicanism,' says
Mr Mustapha Bacha, national secretary of the RCD Republican party. 'Even the
so-called democratic parties are absolutely divided,' says newspaper editor
Mr Belouchet. 'They have absolutely nothing in common.'
Furthermore, at street level, where the FIS appeared to draw much of its
support in 1991 from among Algeria's tens of thousands of young unemployed,
the next three years before the arrival of the country's expected oil and
gas bounty promise only more austerity. Some diplomats are concerned that
this, the tough police clampdown and the curfew could produce a dangerously
volatile mix.
Islamic activists argue, meanwhile, that nothing the government does in the
next two years can diminish the appeal of the fundamentalists in any
circumstances. 'FIS may no longer be a political party, but it's become a
popular phenomenon,' says an Islamist lawyer close to the now banned party.
'You can't dissolve a popular phenomenon by judicial decree or by offering
it money.'
The country's natural wealth means there is some hope for the economy. But
by leaving its political role to an ill-defined attempt to rally 'consensus'
 -one that prohibits the group that nearly won the last elections - many
believe the government is taking the same risk it took in 1991, when it
miscalculated the people's political aspirations so badly. The cost of such
a miscalculation would be further and continuing bloodshed.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Personal View: Give shareholders more power over pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER INGRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While wage increases are decided by companies individually in the UK, a
collective, inflationary, consequence can arise. In the past managers and
employees have been expected to provide the solutions to the problem.
However, the externality of wage inflation would best be internalised by
turning to institutional shareholders and investors to provide a remedy.
This might be achieved by their providing a more direct influence on the
aggregate level of wage increases.
Unusually, at the moment the aggregate effect of wage decision-making
generates little concern. The rate of average earnings increases is at its
lowest level since the early 1960s, while wage settlements across the
private sector are at record low levels. Despite this encouraging situation,
the need for a solution to Britain's pay problem is perhaps more timely than
at any stage since the return to free collective bargaining in 1979.
Before the recovery gathers pace and improving company profitability causes
employees to pursue their wage demands with increased vigour, the perennial
British problem of wage growth outstripping productivity needs to be
addressed. To imagine, on the strength of recent statistics, that the issue
that has bedevilled economic management in postwar years has disappeared
could prove over complacent. While the change in the labour market in recent
years, through legislation, decentralisation and union decline, has been
considerable, the unco-ordinated pattern of pay determination needs to be
reinforced with a mechanism to ameliorate Britain's structural pay problem.
Many advocate a system designed to establish a consensus on affordable pay
increases nationally. Professor Metcalf (Personal View, June 2) suggests
involving the views of the Seven Wise Men who advise the Treasury,
buttressed by a forum of the largest 50 private sector companies to
establish a co-ordinated view on earnings growth.
Though the importance of the issue is not in question, a system which is not
governed by the interests of individual companies may prove ineffective.
Since managements cannot easily be induced to behave in a manner that
appears contrary to their immediate interests, the adverse externality of
wage inflation can arise. Therefore, an economy-wide dispersion in wage
settlements, around a lower nominal average increase, would be best achieved
via a mechanism applied through corporate shareholders rather than
managements.
To see the problem in a shareholder/management context offers a potential
solution. Collective co-ordination of wage growth through corporate
shareholders could exert an effective discipline on the corporate sector as
a whole. By providing appropriate pressure at this level, any benefits of a
collective approach might be better appreciated, while the institutional
investors would also be best placed to regulate such a mechanism through the
application of pressure on their shareholdings. Although such a proposal may
seem beyond the current ambit of shareholders in Britain, it should be seen
as a logical extension of their existing mandate.
This control mechanism could be put into effect by extending the remit of
the Institutional Shareholders' Committee, in its direction on strategy and
performance. It could include a responsibility to advise on an economically
feasible average wage increase across the corporate sector as a whole.
Subject to this 'external' constraint, individual management teams could
continue to use pay as a managerial tool within their organisations. Company
managements would therefore remain free to act as they see fit under
prevailing circumstances while the institutional shareholders ensure the
well-being of the corporate sector as a whole. In such a mechanism neither
shareholders nor managers are required to act in any way other than the
pursuit of their individual interests.
Ownership in the corporate sector has become progressively more concentrated
over recent years: more than 50 per cent of shares in British quoted
companies are effectively controlled by a small cluster of institutional
investors. So, where individual companies pursue outcomes that are
collectively disadvantageous, it should be at this higher level of corporate
control that a remedy should be sought.
If a need should arise for exhortation on pay or co-ordination of wage
awards, it should emerge from Britain's institutional investors. This would
provide the attraction of economically consistent pay settlements combined
with the scope for flexibility while enabling the private sector to control
itself.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Full speed ahead on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOKYO summit is already different from its three immediate predecessors.
In 1990, 1991 and again in 1992, leaders of the Group of Seven main
industrial countries promised to make every effort to complete the Uruguay
round of multilateral trade negotiations, but then made themselves
ridiculous by failing to deliver what they had promised. This time, their
principal trade negotiators were told to reach agreement beforehand. While
the summit now has rather little useful left to do, it has already proved
its worth merely as a catalyst.
Final agreement on the Uruguay round has not yet been reached. But it is
increasingly difficult to believe that negotiators will not reach that goal.
Not only have they achieved much already, but they have also grown
accustomed to reaching agreement even on sensitive issues, while none of
them wishes to bear the blame for failure. They are, in short, condemned to
succeed.
But what sort of success might it be? From the draft final act of the
multilateral trade negotiations (the so-called Dunkel draft) of December
1991, the November 1992 'Blair House agreement' on agriculture between the
EC and the US and the outlines of the market access agreement in
manufactures revealed yesterday, the answer is rather a good one.
At the heart of the agreement between Canada, the European Community, Japan
and the US are: elimination of tariffs (known as 'zero-for-zero') in eight
sectors, including pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, steel and
spirits; cuts of up to 50 per cent in tariffs covering products whose
current tariffs are above 15 per cent; and reductions averaging at least a
third in tariffs on other products, including scientific equipment, paper
and electronics.
Vexed question
Even this agreement needs to be cemented by further negotiation. One vexed
question is what offers will be forthcoming from participants in the Uruguay
round, other than the big four. The latter, particularly the US, might even
insist that every participant in the round adopt zero tariffs wherever they
intend to do so. Such a demand could be a round-breaker. Yet another
contentious demand would be for general liberalisation of textiles and
clothing. Equally important would be reaching a 'multilateral steel
agreement', a necessary condition for elimination of tariffs on steel.
Negotiations for liberalisation of trade in services are far from complete.
Similarly, final agreement has not yet been reached in agriculture, with
French anxieties unassuaged and both Japan and South Korea continuing to
insist they will not liberalise their imports of rice.
Tighter control
Some, notably the French government, also argue that US unilateral actions
against allegedly subsidised imports should be brought under tighter
control. US imports of steel are the immediate casus belli. Although US
unilateralism is indeed a concern, this is not a relevant example of the
problem. The US has an unquestionable right to take such action under the
Gatt. It is absurd for the French, who support similar EC actions against
alleged cases of dumping, to pretend otherwise.
What remains to be achieved is indeed contentious. But what has been
completed already is just as contentious and more important. Economists
might question the wisdom of proposals that are likely to widen the
dispersion of tariff rates. What matters rather more is that negotiators
have accepted the principle of tariff elimination, which can readily be
extended in future. The fact that a deal has been reached matters even more.
Some argued that no agreement would be better than a 'bad agreement', by
which was meant less complete a package than some participants desired. This
was a weak argument, but the agreement now within reach is a good one by any
standard.
For the sake both of the world economy and of peaceful international
relations, participants must now put every effort into climbing the last few
hundred metres. Reaching the end of the Uruguay round negotiations would not
solve the world's economic problems. But it would help. It would also
demonstrate the ability of world leaders to address those problems
co-operatively. Failure must now be regarded as not merely unforgiveable,
but unthinkable.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Letter: Propaganda for the IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RONALD WILLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Ring of Anxiety' (July 6) concerning the City of
London's anti-terrorist traffic restrictions was pathetically addled. Was it
written by committee?
Disruption was negligible, you said, yet you conclude that this is a
propaganda coup for the IRA.
Vital though it is to defeat terrorism, you said, you are critical because
the rest of the capital is not thus protected. The ultimate absurdity of
your thinking is that 'once made permanent, it would be difficult to
dismantle'. Yes, quite.
The propaganda coup for the IRA is the bombing and the killing and the
disruption and the NatWest tower hanging in shreds. Measures against these
acts, providing they do not impinge on traditional civil liberties, are not
a propaganda coup for the IRA. Driving to work in the City is not a civil
liberty.
The sooner the City of London plants trees and flowers in the barriers to
make them permanent and pedestrianises the area, the better. Now that would
be a propaganda coup.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Letter: Economic ideas need scientific testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof DAVID CURRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As Tim Congdon (Letters, July 2) knows, my colleagues, Andrew Burrell
and Stephen Hall, have just undertaken the first systematic analysis of all
the UK forecasts published regularly in Economic Forecasts, the monthly
survey from North Holland. They presented this yesterday at the
Macromodelling Conference at Warwick University. They compare the
forecasting records of a wide range of forecasters, academic and commercial,
allowing for differences in information available at the time of the
forecast.
They find that differences between individual predictions are typically
small in comparison with forecasting mistakes. Moreover, forecasting late in
the year on the basis of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates
helps in producing a good forecast of next year's growth. Some forecasting
groups, such as London Business School, have not produced a regular year-end
forecast (a reason why we cannot rise to Tim Congdon's challenge on end-year
forecasting records). They therefore do less well in comparisons, such as
Chris Huhne's Golden Guru award, which make no adjustment for differing
information sets at the time of forecast. To win at the Guru game, the motto
must be 'forecast often and late'.
Allowing for this, one is led to the conclusion of our recent Economic
Outlook, reported by Peter Marsh (June 28), that claims made for Tim
Congdon's forecasting record have been exaggerated; it may or may not be
marginally better than that of others, but the differences are dominated by
the forecast errors.
Tim Congdon also claims that his forecasting record rests on certain basic
ideas in economic theory. He mentions a specific one - the need for
equilibration between money demand and money supply - that is not in
dispute, incorporated as it is in all well-specified macroeconomic models,
including London Business School's. This is one of the reasons why his March
Open Letter so entirely missed the point.
His specific policy advice, that underfunding can materially affect the
growth of broad money and the economy without a change in interest rates, is
one that is inconsistent with modern monetary economics, particularly in a
world of high international capital mobility. More generally, his analysis
takes little account of recent developments in the theory of money and
banking. Tim Congdon makes little reference to the very considerable body of
empirical research devoted to testing the propositions that he advances and
which are generally found wanting; hence our comments on the unreliability
of broad money.
It is important that economic ideas are subjected to careful empirical
testing: this is the basis of the scientific method that allows the slow
advance of knowledge. Tim Congdon has played a useful role in restating some
simple propositions in macroeconomics; unfortunately they seem not to
withstand scientific testing, perhaps because they are over-simple. Any edge
that he may have in forecasting is based on intuition and prowess, not on
theoretical insight or scientific method.

EUROPE. THE STRANGE SUPERPOWER By David Buchan
Dartmouth, Pounds 32.50 hb, Pounds 17.50 pb, 182 pages Brussels is a very
religious town - less for the church-going zeal of its multinational
populace than for the deep faith of those building European political
integration. How other than by faith could the latter face the tedious hours
dedicated to such arcana as veterinary regulations or the specifications of
pressure vessels in industry? The alternative would be serious doubt about
the purpose of life.
Cecil Parkinson, now a lord but then a British trade minister, once
explained the stress of the non-believer after a discussion in Brussels on
an obscure trade issue. 'I came into politics enthused by high ideals of
freedom, public service and the greater good,' he said. 'I cannot believe I
have just spent three hours arguing about tiny import tonnages of Yugoslav
baby beef.'
The frustrations of a Eurocrat are not dissimilar. But they are lessened by
the certainty that building Europe is a crab-like political process. In good
times, usually periods of solid economic growth, great leaps can be made
towards integration. But the intervening periods comprise daily wars of
attrition against states' exercise of their flagging sovereignty.
As these imperatives weaken, the ritual battles in Brussels are usually
settled through a perpetual and often untidy compromise. Supranational
bindings are continuously tightening and, before the century is out,
efficiency and democracy will demand a new institutional framework.
David Buchan's four years in Brussels as the FT's European Community
correspondent, to 1992, were characterised more by leaps forward than
crab-like movements. He saw the impressive assembly of the single market and
the negotiations on monetary and political union which were crowned by the
Maastricht treaty. In this book he has largely dedicated his sceptical eye
and skilful pen to the EC's expanding international role, for which
Maastricht promises much but may deliver far less.
As Buchan reveals, the 12 could not find the political will to invent the
institutional mechanisms for a common foreign and security policy.
Maastricht commits them to 'joint actions' in some areas of foreign policy.
This means, says Buchan, that they will 'deliberately fashion a straitjacket
and then put themselves in it'. But a member state is free to refuse the
straitjacket if it does not accept a line of action agreed by all. Moreover,
it can block joint action altogether because, in principle, the joint action
must be approved unanimously.
While some majority voting is allowed on matters of implementation, a common
foreign and security policy is to be decided essentially by
intergovernmental, rather than community, procedures.
Buchan captures Jacques Delors' tone of contempt for these formulae. 'First
we would have to decide, unanimously, whether the meeting was to be in
Warsaw, Budapest or Prague. Then we would have to agree whether we were
going by plane. Lunch? We would need an opt-out for vegetarians. No doubt we
could use majority voting to decide where the smoking and non-smoking
sections should be.'
Alongside this uncommon approach to making foreign policy, courtesy of
Maastricht, is a promise of the development of a European 'defence
identity'. It is to come via a reinvigorated Western European Union, whose
tasks, Buchan points out, remain to be invented. He suggests one possible
area for its operations might be eastern Europe 'to intervene to quell some
ethnic dispute between, say, Czechs and Slovaks or Hungarians and Romanians,
that threatened to send refugees flooding into the EC'.
In view of its handling of the Yugoslav crisis - well reviewed by Buchan,
who deems it 'a tragic failure' - the EC will need to discover more common
purpose. Moreover, the Germans need to resolve their constitutional
impediments to military action - before the WEU can be a credible
instrument. External pressures are pushing Europe in that direction.
A sense that moves towards greater integration are, in part, a dynamic
response to external political and economic pressures is strangely missing
from Buchan's analysis. His is much more a book on what Europe is doing than
why Europe is doing it. Here Buchan shares a weakness of the Brussels
perspective, which tends to assume wider public understanding of EC purposes
and procedures than actually exists. Such presumption has been exposed by
the less than ecstatic reaction to Maastricht.
Buchan accepts the conventional wisdom that this response is the result of
politicians pushing integration too fast for their electorates. But perhaps
the political failure is of a different order.
Maastricht's proposed economic and monetary union is a supranational leap
which has had to be mediated through national political systems. Few leaders
have found the courage to justify it as an appropriate response to the
nation state's diminishing power to deal alone with global economic
challenges.
The value of this book is that it pulls together a great deal of information
about the EC's relations with the world and presents it in a readable form.
It is hard to disagree with Buchan's conclusion that Europe will become both
wider through enlargement and deeper through a form of political federation.
The latter may be unwelcome to many Britons. Yet the F-word could well
promise the full expression of all that is best of national values in Europe
 -humanism, tolerance, democracy - while steadily undermining the worst -
such as ethnic rivalry, territorial aggrandisement and the struggle for
power.
As of now Europe is, indeed, a strange superpower. But it will become a more
normal one. The pressure of world events will make it so.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Letter: ITV burdened with public service anachronism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DANIEL SANDELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The National Heritage Committee's ill-informed knee-jerking over the
News at Ten issue and the unnecessarily strong language in which the
committee's report was couched only serve to underline the fundamental
contradictions at the heart of the Broadcasting Act 1990 ('MPs condemn ITV
over News At Ten proposals', July 3).
What the committee failed to recognise is that ITV is going through an
inevitable but painful transition - from a system with a considerable public
service element to one of more or less unfettered commercialism (which are
not, by the way, dirty words). The pain of this transition has been foisted
on ITV by the Act, which cobbled together a system of competitive tendering
which was supposed to value bids by the mechanism of the free market. In
stark contrast, however, it burdened the ITV companies with very
un-marketlike public service obligations in programming and scheduling.
Forcing ITV to set its schedules in stone forever in the name of 'public
service' will weigh ITV down with obligations which can only hinder it in
competing in the domestic and international broadcasting market. In 20
years' time this will be seen as an anachronism in a world that has changed
faster than the legislators realise. The true home of public service is the
BBC.
The legislators should not forget that, by no coincidence, the country with
the world-beating media industry has the First Amendment.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Economic Viewpoint: An agenda for a real summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By proposing a special summit to discuss unemployment, President Bill
Clinton at the time more or less wrote off the prospects of the Tokyo
summit.
Politicians in the Clinton interventionist tradition see job creation in
terms of spending projects which create work, oblivious that almost any kind
of spending will do just this if it is not absorbed by higher pay and
prices. What they really have in mind is an enhancement of the role of the
state - an outlook incorrectly called 'liberal' in the US.
What, however, could a genuine economic directorate of the Group of Seven
achieve? First, the work would be at the level of finance ministers and
central bankers. Maintaining the directorate at that level would enable
Germany to play a fuller part than it can at summit gatherings where the
Bundesbank is absent. Above all, heads of government lack both the time and
knowledge for the work. The Gatt breakthrough was a separate affair, owing
little to summitry.
Moreover, because a problem is worldwide, it does not mean that it is best
tackled in international meetings. As the Nobel Prize-winning UK economist,
James Meade, has never ceased to emphasise, the restoration of high
employment requires a steady rise of total cash spending (conveniently
measured by Nominal Gross Domestic Product), and severe pay restraint
(combined, I would stress, with flexibility) so that increased money
expenditure leads to increased output and jobs, rather than just higher
prices.
Meade has always said that the second objective is the harder; a new booklet
gives his latest ideas for achieving it in an equitable way (Fifteen
Propositions, Employment Policy Institute, Southbank House, Black Prince
Road, London, SE1 7SJ, price Pounds 6.50).
But because the first objective is less difficult, there is no reason to
neglect it. Indeed, while labour market reforms are best carried out at the
national, EC or local level, the regulation of total spending (or demand
management as it used to be called) is easier if the world's main industrial
leaders move in harmony. Moreover, almost for the first time since the
second world war, inadequate growth of total cash spending is an important
contribution to unemployment.
A rate of measured price increase of 2 per cent to 3 per cent per annum is
now probably the best working definition of minimum inflation. The
underlying trend of real growth in G7 countries is, say, 2-3 per cent.
Adding together the volume and price components, a satisfactory rate of
growth for Nominal GDP would then be about 5-6 per cent a year - perhaps
slightly more to catch up for shortfall.
Now look what has happened. On OECD estimates, G7 Nominal GDP growth has
dropped to 3 1/2 per cent in the past 12 months. It is clear that the
leading industrial countries have been suffering, not quite from deflation,
but from demand deficiency in the Keynesian sense.
The OECD forecasts a return to 5 1/2 per cent nominal GDP growth by 1994.
But few would like to rely on forecasts alone - and even they depend on
assumptions about appropriate policies. The dangers, just for once, are of
inadequate demand growth rather than of inflationary excess.
Where should the largest stimulus be applied? Surely, to those countries
whose demand growth has been exceptionally slow or where an exchange rate
depreciation would be in order. The countries where demand has been growing
most slowly are Japan and Germany and those EC countries whose currencies
are tied in to the D-Mark.
In Japan, a guarantee of further stimulus to domestic demand would be the
best way to defuse the conflict with the US over the Japanese trade surplus.
If Japanese domestic activity could be raised to normal levels, expenditure
on imports would automatically rise. A big surplus would probably remain,
reflecting an underlying rate of savings above domestic investment.
But once Japanese activity returns to normal the rest of the world will have
little reason to complain. Nor could the US continue to moan if Japanese
expansion is accompanied by a fall in the yen against the dollar, so long as
there is a net rise in Japanese purchases from the rest of the world.
With respect to Germany, the logjam suddenly seems to have eased. The recent
budget measures agreed by German political leaders are larger than realised.
Spending cuts for next year, together with new tax revenue and higher
pension contributions, are equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP, according to
Kleinwort Benson - much more than the ill-fated Solidarity Pact. These
measures are due to be followed by further fiscal tightening equivalent to 1
1/4 per cent of GDP in 1995.
There will have to be many further interest rate cuts in Germany, simply to
make up for the contractionary arithmetical effects of the package. In
psychological terms, however, these cuts are a boost; and there has been a
different tone to Bundesbank statements in the past few days.
Better money supply numbers and belated union talk of pay flexibility have
also brought joy to the Bundesbank. The effect of the whole package of
fiscal economies and prospective interest rate cuts is likely to be positive
for German 'animal spirits', but not necessarily for the D-Mark, which
remains subject to downward influence.
The Americans will just have to put up with some further downward drift of
the D-Mark against the dollar if it occurs. Indeed, one advantage of a world
economic directorate is that it might hope gradually to wean the Americans
away from the belief that the dollar can never be low enough. The
Bundesbank, too, will just have to grin and bear the possibility of some
D-Mark depreciation, while industrialists in neighbouring DM-bloc countries
will be delighted.
POSTSCRIPT ON UK
The downside risk on the D-Mark, and sterling's new position as Europe's
strongest currency, will create complications for British policy. Sterling
has already regained nearly half of its fall against the D-Mark since
departing from the ERM and one-third of the ground lost on the index.
Nevertheless, sterling could easily go higher. The dilemma of the winter of
1987-88 on whether to cut interest rates to restrain the pound looks, like
all dilemmas, likely to recur, although against a much less inflationary
background. It would indeed be absurd to endanger the still-fragile rebirth
of confidence in the UK economy by heavy upward over-shooting of sterling.
Like the majority of the chancellor's forecasting panel, I would
unhesitatingly reduce interest rates if required to put a brake on
sterling's rise. It is only in this context that there is a case for further
fiscal tightening.
But unlike at least two members of the forecasting panel, I believe it would
be equally foolish to plan another devaluation from recent levels of
sterling. The devaluationists' case is illustrated in the final chart, which
shows a worsening payments deficit constraining real economic growth to a
crawl. The result would be resumed upward movement of unemployment for years
to come.
Both the balance of payments projections and their implications for policy
are highly disputable. Even if the UK does have to continue to turn the
terms of trade against itself (which is all a successful devaluation can
achieve) then it would be best done by maintaining a British rate of
inflation below that of the main trading partners. That is no longer a
pipe-dream.
The case for either a large upward or downward movement of sterling is
extremely weak; but it will no longer be possible to keep the issue under
the carpet much longer.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Letter: Expenses charged to managed funds unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL MOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The daily Managed Funds Service in the Financial Times contains four
full pages of fund data. Ninety-three of the offshore-based fund management
groups which are listed are recognised by the Securities and Investments
Board. Most of these funds are marketed actively to UK retail and
institutional investors.
Investors might assume that the Securities and Investments Board applies the
same strict control over the annual charges suffered by these funds as they
do for their onshore counterparts. In reality, only the investment advisory
fee must be disclosed by the management company in promotional literature.
Administration, custodian and other expenses are detailed only in the
published financial statements.
It appears, in fact, that neither the SIB nor the local regulators enforce a
limit on the total level of expenses which can be charged to the fund. My
own research reveals that, while the highest disclosed annual fee is 2 per
cent, the total annual charge is frequently above 5 per cent and can even
reach double figures in the worst cases. Investors in these funds cannot be
aware of the extent of these charges or of the resulting effects on their
fund returns.
Of course, the total annual charge for many funds is more reasonable, but
comparative figures are only now being made available.
There is a clear case for full disclosure by management groups marketing
retail offshore funds in the UK and for more effective monitoring by the
regulators.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Arts: Truly grandiose theme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris Opera Ballet marked the tenth anniversary of Balanchine's death in
May. Now the company has continued its tribute - for Balanchine was
ballet-master at the Palais Garnier in 1947 - with the acquisition of Theme
and Variations. This grandiose display piece suits the Opera dancers
wonderfully well. The troupe's elegance of manner, its gleaming prowess,
reflect both the stage light and the inner radiance of Balanchine's
inventions, making the ballet glitter. Most important, the Opera can field
principal dancers to rejoice in the demands Balanchine sets them.
I count myself fortunate to have seen Alicia Alonso and Igor Youskevich, for
whom Theme was made. There have been other notable interpreters. None,
though, have seemed so impeccably, nobly right in the roles as Elisabeth
Platel and Manuel Legris, who led Tuesday night's performance. Both are in
the high summer of their gifts. Platel is unmatched in the West in those
qualities of serene authority, technical purity, that are the emblems of the
true classic ballerina. She has the polished virtuosity and the integrity to
serve the choreography rather than her own temperament. Balanchine intended
this ballet to evoke the golden age of Imperial Petersburg's ballerinas, and
in Platel's dancing we see how she accepts every demand like a jewel which
she wears with loveliest assurance. The role was a homage by Balanchine to
the ballerina as divinity. Platel reveals its splendours with unfailing
grace.
From Manuel Legris dancing no less satisfying. His technique is beautifully
rounded - the bravura passages without strain, the dance full and rich in
tone - but it is the aristocracy of his manner that reminds us that here,
too, is a tribute to those princely figures who strode through Balanchine's
youthful years. Legris is rightly their heir. From the rest of the cast,
lustrous dancing, and fine playing of the Tchaikovsky suite from the Opera's
orchestra under Jonathan Darlington.
The programme is completed by two Jerome Robbins ballets. Moves is that
experiment in dance without music which Robbins made for his own Ballets:
USA in 1959. I am not sure how well it wears its years, for it looks somehow
portentous, and dated in its physical attitudes. It was given dedicated,
rather solemn performance; the real reward came with the presence of
Emmanuel Thibault, the Opera's wunderkind. In Moves he offers a passage of
beaten steps with the speed of a humming-bird's wings. Robbins' The Concert
ends the evening on a note of happiest comedy. The cast is good and the
jokes still fresh, still funny.
On Monday the Opera Ballet presented new choreographies by members of the
troupe. No one expects genius, but ideas can be explored, and talent will be
seen. So will miss-hits, and theorisings that were better in the creator's
head than on the dancers' feet. Of the five pieces, two struck me as worth
the time and energy given to their staging. Florence Lambert's Demoiselles
d'Avignon owes little to Picasso, but a lot to the way women see men
watching women. It was an ingenious deconstruction of masculine attitudes to
women and women's response to them - satiric, angry, dismissive. It was set
to part of the Goldberg variations, improbably played on piano and accordion
and improbably worth listening to, and it gained vastly from performances by
Aurelie Dupont, Agnes Letestu, Nathalie Ziegler and Beatrice Martel.
Pierre Darde's Carnival of the Animals offers four dancers - Clairemarie
Osta, Beatrice Martel, Nicolas le Riche and Darde himself - who impersonate
the menagerie in dances that are off-beat, and often pertinent about beasts.
They are also funny - but Darde's ideas have something more than jokiness to
them, and he uses the great stage well. The piece was admirably danced, with
Nicolas le Riche showing again that he is one of the brightest hopes in the
tremendous ranks of the Opera's young dancers.

HOUSE OF ANGELS (15) Colin Nutley
EQUINOX (15) Alan Rudolph
BENNY AND JOON (12) Jeremiah Chechik
SUPERMARIO BROS (PG) Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel
Would you believe a Swedish film-maker called Colin Nutley? Before you reach
for your Guinness Book of Cultural Incongruities, let me explain. Mr Nutley
was born in England but lives and works in Sweden. House Of Angels is his
third feature there: he has also made documentaries and, back in his brief
British career, a controversial TV series called Annika. That tale of
Swedish au-pairs, lapped up by the Swedes, became Nutley's calling card in
Scandinavia.
House Of Angels is a comedy of social disaster - and a delightful one -
somewhere between Ibsen and Emmerdale Farm. Nutley is blithely offhand in
setting up the plot. A village elder drops dead in an eccentric road
accident - involving a rifle, a singing priest and two youngsters coupling
in a parked van - and then a mysterious blonde girl appears at the funeral.
'I'm sorry I never knew you, grandpa,' she murmurs to the open grave:
whereupon an older lady mourner, the old man's daughter, faints in shock.
The newly-revealed illegitimate granddaughter (Helena Bergstrom) inherits
the deceased's farm and the village trembles when her leather-clad boyfriend
and fellow cabaret artiste (Rikard Wolff) moves in. He is followed by an
army of louche friends who parade nude on the riverbank by day, wassail by
night and are then indulged by the conscientiously peacemaking vicar when
they bid to hold a concert in the church hall. Chainsaws, transvestism, sexy
songs . . .
Urban Bohemia meets the pastoral petit bourgeoisie; and the film could have
been trampled underfoot by its own programmatic two-party comic politics.
Instead - call it the great tradition of bruised British understatement (see
Mike Leigh, Les Blair and company) - House Of Angels gives us laughter as
subtle and oblique as reflected light. The reaction shot rules, and Nutley
has found the faces to make it tell. Not just born comic victim-figures like
the priest, his road to Hell-on-earth paved with good intentions; but the
gnarled phizzes of the two old farming brothers whose jaws drop at tales of
Berlin decadence, or the girl who runs the village shop and sees her
boyfriend drawn to the blonde like metal to a magnet.
The film's satiric bonhomie conjures breezes of comic euphoria from nowhere.
In one scene the two codgers clump down a tree-lined avenue in their humble
Sunday best - tight-buttoned shirts, ill-matching ties, freshly shined
sandals - to meet the new neighbours while a full-throated hymn fills the
soundtrack. The absurd presentational pride; the sense of interchangeable
best-behaviour protocols (going to tea is a solemn, uplifting social event
just like going to church); the pictorial play-off between nature's
luxuriance and nurture's regimentation: all are here in a scene as casual as
an aside.
Finally, the film yields too much to its own feel-good instincts. Happy
endings are distributed too glibly; irreconcilable opposites are forcibly
reconciled. But not even this late surge of sentimentality, though it may
account for the film's runaway popularity in Sweden, where it has broken
box-office records, can smother the sly wit and astringency of what went
before.
                          *        *       *
Equinox could only come from the pen and lens of writer-director Alan
Rudolph. The film-maker defines his film as 'a regular movie with all the
regular bits taken out.' (Compare similar Rudolphs such as Remember My Name,
Choose Me and Trouble In Mind). But Equinox is a doppelganger thriller with
all the thrills not so much taken out as teasingly internalised.
Matthew Modine dons alternate hairstyles - hedgehog and flop-mop - as two
identical twins who have never met since the womb. Now grown up in Empire
City (New York), one Modine is a gangster's assistant, the other a garage
hand. Paths are set to cross when their unknown Ma dies, leaving a letter, a
mysterious fortune and a vacated movie screen ready to be filled with the
largest supporting cast since Noah's Ark.
Check them as they come: the garage Modine's fat, soft-boiled foster-father
(M. Emmet Walsh), the gangster Modine's slim, hardboiled boss (Fred Ward),
the aspiring lady writer who pilfers Ma's letter and pieces the story
together (Tyra Farrell), Modine 1's best friend (Kevin J O'Connor), Modine
2's best friend (Tate Donovan) and the sea of
girlfriends/sisters/wives/hookers. Here the style ranges from Lara Flynn
Boyle's noirish temptress in the upstairs apartment, part spinster part
spiderwoman, to Marisa Tomei's good-hearted, drunk-on-giggles,
funny-accented whore.
If Antonioni and Fellini had ever teamed up to adapt Poe's William Wilson it
might have come out like this. But no, not even then. Rudolph's style has an
inimitable absurdist melancholy. This plot's convolutions begin by
irritating and end by becoming a monstrous, marvellous lingua franca for the
confusions of life itself. Which of us has not felt himself living parallel
identities in a world divided between violent purpose (gangsters) and homely
purposelessness (garage hand)? And which of us has not sometimes echoed
Modine's cry of 'My whole life seems to be taking place without me in it'?
                          *        *       *
Benny And Joon is one of those films that have crashed through the
looking-glass into that mythical land called Middle America. You recognise a
Hollywood film about medium-poor people in the provinces by the fact that
they live in a palace, mildly distressed, somewhere in Small Town, USA.
Benny (Aidan Quinn) runs a garage; his sister (Mary Stuart Masterson) paints
and is mentally disturbed; and the new boarder (Johnny Depp) in their
rambling clapboard mansion idolises and imitates Buster Keaton.
Upshot: holy-eyed innocent falls in love with brush-wielding mad girl and
greasy-handed brother is saved the trouble of putting her in a home. The
film, of course, never expresses itself so brusquely. Sugary songs caress
the soundtrack; Mr Depp bats his large emotive eyes in a no-make-up reprise
of Edward Scissorhands; and Miss Masterson's mental illness is one of those
conditions you only find in a medical dictionary under 'H for Hollywood.'
Scripted by ex-circus clown Barry Berman and produced by MGM, this project
may have seemed to promise a second benediction at the box-office for the
studio that brought us Rain Man. But it is more like death by slow drizzle:
notable only for the few surreal learning experiences we witness through the
curtain of schmaltz, like how to make toasted cheese with a steam-iron and
how to mash potatoes with a tennis racket.
                          *        *       *
In Super Mario Bros the age of Nintendo reaches the large screen in a film
that should carry a health warning. If you do not get epilepsy from the
parent video game, you may acquire it here. Seeking to save the universe
from destruction, swashbuckling Brooklyn plumbers Bob Hoskins and John
Leguizamo break through into a parallel dimension peopled by ageing
Hollywood delinquents (Dennis Hopper as Koopa the Lizard King), ex-RSC
actresses slumming it (Fiona Shaw as Mrs Koopa) and frenetic special
effects. Pushed from plot-point to plot-point like human cursors, they and
we are presented with alligator-headed stormtroopers, sub-Spielberg baby
dinosaurs, chases through hi-tech futureworlds and large quantities of
are-we-hearing-correctly dialogue. ('Trust the fungus'; 'De-evolve him right
now'). For anyone but Nintendo addicts the film will be complete Greek: with
just a few lifelines to the adventure cinema we once knew and loved in Mr
Hopper's snarl, Mr Leguizamo's swashbuckle and a nubile heroine-in-distress

Because Ireland produces such wonderful writers, the English view of the
Irish aristocracy tends to come entirely from fiction. Perhaps Ireland
really is full of the scions of ancient families, mad, fey and mounted on a
big chestnut hunters. . . perhaps not. In Borderlines Hector MacDonnell,
descended from the Earls of Antrim, meets other survivors of Ireland's
once-great families, including Baron Kingsale, who lives in Somerset and is
on the dole (7.30 BBC2).
I know from letters (and the mailbag at Radio 4's 'Feedback') that there is
an unfulfilled demand for television programmes of popular music; not pop or
rock music, but ballads and arias and music from the shows. Perhaps Michael
Ball will help fill the void. Made famous by Aspects Of Love', Ball begins a
six part series on ITV at 8.30.
By all accounts Roger And Me (9.00 C4) is an unusual movie. Director Michael
Moore set out to meet Roger Smith, head of General Motors, when the company
laid off 30,000 workers in Moore's home town. It has been variously
described as dark, ironic, hilarious, and scathing. Moore calls it a
'docucomedy'.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Arts: A sinuous, sadistic Giovanni
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Covent Garden, in Johannes Schaaf's production, Don Giovanni is a Marquis
de Sade figure - grey at the temples, sinuous in movement, permanently bent
on exploring the extremes of pleasure, pain (for others) and freedom from
the confinements of 'nice' behaviour. When not stalking the streets in
search of new victims, or hovering in corners relishing the misfortunes of
old ones, he goes home to eat dinner off a naked woman's body or refine the
appurtenances of his bondage-sex studio. The sky glows red when he sinks to
Hell - and, after that, bourgeois proprieties can be restored to Seville.
There are many things to be said against the whole conception: they came to
mind in growing number during Tuesday's revival of the one-year-old
production. But since the show still elicits a riveting performance of the
title role from Thomas Allen, there are points in its favour as well. Mr
Allen is not 21 - the age of Luigi Bassi, the first Giovanni, at the time of
the premiere - but a mature artist of astonishing stage potency, with a
knack of closing an eyelid, pointing a finger or swivelling a hip-joint to
convey menace that is the distillation of expressive economy. His singing,
though perhaps a degree less fresh or strong throughout the range than in
the past, achieves similar mastery: a flicker of colour or verbal accent
speaks volumes.
What he lacks is any kind of charm, wit, or sensual attractiveness. This,
surely, is not Mr Allen's fault, but a consequence of production slant,
which he supports with absolute steadfastness, suppressing in the process
almost all his natural audience-wooing facilities in the presentation of an
unredeemed reptilian brute. As in so much of Schaaf's work (at least as
Royal Opera audiences have experienced it in his four Mozart stagings), this
produces an immediate frisson of dramatic intelligence but a sacrifice of
long-term logic and sustaining dramatic architecture.
On a second viewing, indeed, I find much in this Don Giovanni production
that simply will not bear a moment's scrutiny. (Anna so excited by bloodlust
after 'Or sai chi l'onore' that she kisses Ottavio's sword-hilt? Elvira an
Ophelia figure wistfully garlanding daisies while singing 'Mi tradi'? Come
on now]) The fussy over-detailing and the finding of plausible (but usually
banal) formulas in which to 'fix' characters' motivation may be one method
of containing this untameable and all-but-unplayable masterpiece, but the
steady promotion of theatrical momentum is not one of its benefits.
This was underlined by the conducting of Bernard Haitink: the performance
started solidly and rather ponderously, and for a good deal of Act 2 seemed
to go dangerously limp. Much affectionate detail, much exquisitely shaped
phrasing, not much electricity - the high-voltage excitements of Haitink's
Glyndebourne Giovanni a decade ago were here no more than a distant memory.
The stop-start pacing of recitative was one of the evening's minor
irritations.
At least, however, the cast is almost entirely first-rate: the revival,
whatever problems it may place in the way of people seeking an intelligible
'overall' account of this opera, is a feast of good Mozart singing. Ann
Murray's first London Elvira, vigorous, passionate and expertly controlled,
and Angela Gheorghiu's first London Zerlina, delicate and fragrant of
timbre, give particular pleasure; Hans Peter Blochwitz, the production's
first Ottavio, sings 'Dalla sua pace' with wonderful gentleness and poise.
Karita Mattila, who on Tuesday blurred some of her rising scales, is
nevertheless very near achieving an Anna of heroic vocal stature. Bruno
Caproni's Masetto is an asset in every scene. Of the original cast-members
Claudio Desderi's Leporello shows greatest gain in authority: the voice may
still sound a shade small for the house, but the pungent Italian utterance
and thrusting characterisation are alone worth the ticket-price.
Royal Opera House: in repertory until July 23.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, who is also the founder
and chairman of USM electronics company ACAL, will join Dixons as a
non-executive director with effect from September 7. John Curry succeeds
Oxford University's Peter Oppenheimer, who is retiring after six years on
the board.
'It sounded an interesting company and one where I thought I could make a
contribution,' remarks Curry (right), who was headhunted for the position.
'Dixons needs to develop in Europe and I know about Europe,' he says, adding
that he believes his entrepreneurial style will fit the Dixons culture.
Curry, who says that 'unfortunately' he has no connection with the family
which founded the Currys retail chain, built up, with his brother Peter,
Unitech, a manufacturer of power supplies, industrial controls and
connectors. In 1987 he himself branched out to set up ACAL, a distributor in
the same line of business as Unitech, which was floated the following year.
Gaining both a rugby and tennis blue when he was at Oxford, Curry, 55, has
been chairman of the All England Club, a part-time position, since 1989.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Technology: The television answers back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Imagine that you could talk to your television set. If you felt like seeing
an old Humphrey Bogart movie, it might suggest the Maltese Falcon or
Casablanca; tell it you were in the mood for romance and Love Story would
come on the air.
This is the ultimate goal of a new set of interactive cable systems being
introduced around the US. 'Eventually, we'll have a voice-activated device
on the television that will truly make it a Captain Kirk computer,' says
David Herrah, a spokesman for IBM.
'Your television will allow you to play a game with someone you've never
seen before, shop for almost anything, and play movies on demand.'
The arrival of multimedia may soon turn such dreams into reality.
In an attempt to provide more viewer options, Tele-Communications, a
Denver-based cable group, is investing Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in
fibre-optic cable over the next four years. Fibre optic wires can handle 100
times the amount of information dealt with by traditional coaxial cables
today.
Digital compression will allow information to be compressed into tiny
signals, so that the number of channels available to a Tele-Communications
cable customer is set to jump from 54 to 500 over the next few years.
Time Warner is also moving into a new cable television realm, aided by the
regional telephone group US West's recent Dollars 2.5bn purchase of a 25 per
cent stake in the company's movie studio and cable television assets.
Time Warner will take advantage of digital compression to maximise the
number of options offered. Unlike Tele-Communications, Time Warner will rely
on traditional coaxial wires to deliver its cable products.
Instead of investing in fibre-optics, the company is betting its money on a
digital movie 'library' large enough to store 500, two-hour motion pictures.
This service will move cable television closer to its goal of 'video on
demand', a service allowing each customer to access through a cable menu any
number of entertainment sources and have the ability to pause, rewind and
fast-forward the tape.
Time Warner's new service should also allow customers to play video games
with other subscribers, engage in home shopping from a menu of catalogues,
use video-conferencing services, connect to a long-distance telephone
service and receive educational instruction at home. 'Our system will be the
first truly multimedia service,' says Michael Luftman, head of corporate
communications for Time Warner Cable.
Once an interactive cable system is up and running, the services should
quickly become more sophisticated. Video games, for instance, may soon be
played in full-motion video and with three-dimensional graphics.
Home shopping services could widen their scope to include aeroplane tickets
and investment plans.
'In the not too distant future, you'll be able to view a hologram of
yourself on screen, wearing the clothing item you're interested in
purchasing,' claims IBM's Herrah.
'And you may not be surprised to hear the television telling you that you'd
look better in another colour.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / People: Emmott's surprise departure from Morrisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based superstore chain, announced yesterday that
Bob Emmott, joint deputy managing director, had resigned from the company to
'pursue an alternative career'.
Martin Ackroyd, finance director, explains that Emmott's resignation had
been accepted after he sent in a letter late on Tuesday. But mystery
surrounds his future plans.
Ackroyd says Morrisons has 'no idea' what Emmott intended to do next, and
Emmott himself could not be reached at his home yesterday. There was
speculation inside the company that he had left to join another retailer.
Ken Morrison, company chairman, says he regretted the departure of a man he
had worked closely with since he joined the company in the late 1960s and
who had played an 'increasingly important role', culminating in his
appointment to the board in 1987, and eventually as joint deputy managing
director.
Morrisons, which operates 59 superstores mainly in the north of England and
was named the UK's top-performing company last year by the Institute of
Directors, insisted there had been no disagreement with Emmott, and
relations had remained amicable.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big companies will continue to maintain a central computer or information
systems department although the need for in-house programmers and other
specialised information technologists will decline. Facilities management or
'outsourcing' is not expected to take over permanently the central IS
function.
These are the chief conclusions of a study* published this week which seeks
to explain the recent phenomenon that many information technology
specialists in large companies, whose jobs only a few years ago looked
secure, have found their careers derailed if not on the buffers.
The study concludes there are a number of tasks which only a central IS
function can fulfil. These include ensuring that the IT infrastructure of
the company is in place and flexible enough to respond to a rapidly changing
business environment.
It must ensure company-wide standards are applied and advise senior
management on the significance and applicability of new technologies. Most
critically, it has to provide the quality assurance for large business
systems projects.
Companies are likely to lose in-house expertise, however, as they avoid, for
example, bespoke software developments in favour of cheaper, packaged
solutions. Furthermore, IS staff who lose their jobs as the recession bites
are unlikely to be re-employed when the economy recovers. The study projects
that from 520,000 personnel in 1991, numbers will fall to about 400,000 by
2000.
Facilities management or outsourcing has been seen as an answer to expensive
and hard-to-manage IS departments, but the study argues it is principally a
short-term reaction to a need to cut costs. Some companies use outsourcing
as a way of disposing of old technology, intending to refurbish the internal
department with modern systems.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Technology: Barriers to a brave new world - Multimedia's
biggest test will be at the hands of the humble consumer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If computer and telecommunications executives have their way, the world will
be a very different place 30 years from now. Government postal services and
overnight couriers will have been forced out of business, as people rely on
electronic mail to send letters and documents.
A traveller sitting on an aeroplane will be able to sign a letter using a
pen-device and send it over a wireless phone. Newspapers will no longer be
delivered to the doorstep; rather, a selection of articles, complete with
illustrations, will be pulled up on a computer screen.
This vision of a futuristic world may not be far removed from reality. What
will make some of these scenarios possible is the convergence of the
telecommunications and computer sectors, forming the 'multimedia' industry.
The innovations of this new mega-industry may have an impact on our lives as
profound as those wrought by the computer and the telephone.
'As a society, we have not begun to understand the changes this new
technology is going to cause,' says Lee Hoevel, vice-president in charge of
technology and development for NCR Corporation, an American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph (AT&amp;T) subsidiary. 'Just as the computer and the telephone touched
everything, so will this.'
The convergence of telecommunications and computers has already produced
many innovations which are widely used in the business community. Among them
are electronic mail, video-conferencing and data access services. But this
is only the beginning of the revolution.
AT&amp;T has just announced a new telephone which will allow the user to send
full-colour, television-quality pictures down a telephone line, while
simultaneously talking on the same line. Silicon Graphics and Time Warner
Cable will work together on the world's first interactive digital cable TV
network, allowing viewers to select videos and do their shopping on screen.
Intel and Microsoft have established new interface standards to facilitate
modem communication and bring it on to the mass market.
In the longer run, the changes will be even more profound. Within 30 years,
the average household may be equipped with a single device the size of a
television remote control which will handle all computer, fax, voice mail,
electronic mail, data connections and home entertainment needs.
What is making this revolution possible is the convergence of a number of
new technologies. Fibre-optic cables can handle 100 times the amount of
information as the old-fashioned coaxial telephone lines. And digital
compression technology allows information to be squeezed into tiny signals,
easy for the telephone wires to handle.
Add to this the miniaturisation of consumer products, the move to wireless
communication, improving software and increasingly sophisticated
microprocessors and the possibilities seem endless. 'The technology is
moving so fast that microprocessors, for instance, are doubling capacity
every 12 to 18 months,' says David Herrah, a spokesman for IBM. 'We're
definitely on the steep side of the learning curve. In a few years, the
computer chip on your television remote control may be more powerful than
the chip in most personal computers today.'
Sophisticated technologies such as video-conferencing and wireless
communication, although becoming familiar to business executives, are a
mystery to most people. To make the leap on to the mass market, these
technologies will have to become more affordable.
'Right now, these products are far too expensive for the average consumer,'
says Wayne Dyer, vice-president of products management for EO Incorporated,
a California-based multimedia group. 'But this is the natural path for new
technologies to follow. First, they make their way on to executives' desks;
then, as the technology becomes cheaper, they move on to the mass consumer
market.'
The industry may be facing bigger challenges than just affordability. Some
executives fear the multimedia technology is outpacing the products'
user-friendliness.
'The technology side has definitely been running ahead of the usability
side,' says Mark Porat, president of General Magic, a newly-formed
multimedia group. 'Unless this is addressed, the problem will come back to
bite companies in the industry.'
The 'user-friendly' issue is quickly gaining prominence. Microsoft and
Intel's decision to standardise modem communications addresses the
difficulty many people have in sending electronic mail. And new start-ups
such as General Magic and EO are focusing heavily on the problem.
'To be widely accepted, we have to start looking at the human interface,'
says NCR's Hoevel. 'It's far more complicated to run an interactive computer
meeting than it is to run a meeting with a room full of employees. Someone
has to decide who has control of the mouse, for instance. Unless these
things are resolved, it will limit growth for the industry.'
Another hurdle multimedia groups will have to overcome is the myriad of
telecommunications regulations in many parts of the world. Some warn,
however, that too much deregulation will not be good for the industry,
either. 'If they had made the right decisions on standardising modem
communications from the beginning, the market would have moved a lot
faster,' contends Porat.
Another uncertainty is the way in which companies will organise themselves
within the industry. 'One thing that's clear is that no single company has
the wherewithal to develop all the necessary technologies itself,' says
Gordon Bridge, president of EasyLink, an AT&amp;T business unit concerned with
inter-computer communications.
As a result, multimedia is probably in for a long period of re-organisation.
Recent corporate activity has involved acquisitions (such as AT&amp;T's purchase
of the computer group NCR), joint ventures and partnerships (such as General
Magic, an alliance between Apple Computer, AT&amp;T, Matsushita Electric,
Motorola, Philips and Sony), and start-ups (such as EO).
Still, figuring out how the corporate chips will fall may slow down the
technological drive of the fledgling industry. 'If there's one thing
inhibiting the advance of multimedia, it's the problem of deciding how
different industries will interact, and who will get which slice of the
pie,' believes Hoevel.
Although the revolution may not proceed at the pace many in the new
multimedia industry would like, in the long-run its success seems inevitable
and its impact profound. 'This thing is so big, no one can miss it,' says
Dyer.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A rocky marriage -
Marks and Spencer's attempts to popularise its Brooks Brothers chain in the
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over half the men's suits sold at Brooks Brothers, the prestigious US
clothing chain, are now peddled 'wardrobe' style. This means the purchaser
picks out a jacket from one rail and trousers from another, rather than
buying a paired combination or having the outfit tailored from scratch. If
the notion sounds familiar to British ears, that is because it was imported
from Marks and Spencer, Brooks' UK parent.
For Paul Smith, the M&amp;S director who supervises US operations from New York,
'wardrobe suits' are a sensible transfer of retailing technique - although
Bill Roberti, Brooks' chief executive, admits that it took three stabs at
the concept before the US retailer 'got it right'.
But, from a broader perspective, this novel selling practice seems to
epitomise the dilemma facing the British retailer as it struggles to make a
five-year-old US marriage work. M&amp;S is a skilled mass-marketeer. How, and to
what extent, can it popularise Brooks - founded in 1818 and one of the
nation's oldest retailers - without tainting the latter's classic image?
M&amp;S needs to get the answer right. It acquired the US retailer for Dollars
750m (Pounds 500m) in 1988, and has since admitted that it overpaid. Brooks
was then making profits of Dollars 24.5m after tax on sales of Dollars 290m.
Earnings promptly tumbled and, five years later, the US unit is still
struggling to match the 1988 results. In the 12 months to end-March this
year, Brooks' operating surplus was Pounds 12.6m on sales of Dollars 338.3m.
Bill Roberti acknowledges that the post-acquisition period was tough. But,
in 1991, the two companies agreed a strategic plan for Brooks which aimed to
help the US group grow without undermining its preppie customer base. This
includes:
A new 'prototype' store. Encompassing around 6,000 sq ft of selling space,
the model is about half the size of the traditional Brooks outlet, and is
designed to fit more neatly into heavily-shopped malls. 'There's a wide
frontage and less depth in the interior . . . it gives us more flexibility,'
says Smith.
To date, about 10 of these 'new' outlets have been rolled out, sometimes
replacing existing stores and sometimes taking Brooks into new markets. The
first was in St Louis, where Brooks had originally operated a 'traditional'
store on an uninspiring downtown block. It switched the business to a
new-style outlet, sited in a glitzier mall nearby. Roberti claims that while
the retail footage shrank by 60 per cent, sales doubled.
A 'factory outlet' business, selling surplus stocks at discounted prices. In
part, this replaced a previous system whereby Brooks sold its remaindered
merchandise to Filenes, a New England-based chain of 'off-price' clothing
stores.
But the factory outlets are also supposed to market the Brooks name. By
placing them in vacation resorts, M&amp;S hopes to inveigle casual shoppers
through the doors and thus convince them that Brooks Brothers is not always
synonymous with top-of-line prices. More people, runs the thinking, might
then be encouraged to shop at mainline Brooks stores.
Licence income and new markets. On the one hand, M&amp;S wants to utilise the
Brooks name via licensing deals; it has, for example, signed an agreement
with Luxottica, the world's largest eyewear frame manufacturer. On the
other, it plans to take the Brooks Brothers retail business to new
countries. Brooks Brothers products are already sold in Italy and Japan, and
more plans are being laid.
'By the end of this year, we'll have a couple of business plans in place for
another far eastern country and another European country,' says Smith. 'A
joint venture? It depends where we go for. If it is Hong Kong, where there
is an M&amp;S office, or Paris, we might be able to do it on our own. In other
countries, I think we'd need a partner.'
Operational changes. These have ranged from altering staff remuneration, to
the sale of the credit card business. They have not always been easy to
implement. M&amp;S ran into a strike threat in the New York stores, for example,
when it tried to move employees away from the old departmental
commission-based pay structure and towards higher basic salaries - although
the revision finally went through. On the distribution front, it is still
preparing to move to a controlled central warehouse system and away from the
historic arrangement whereby suppliers drop shipments directly to individual
stores.
The problem is that many of these move are costly and M&amp;S, having forked out
generously for Brooks in the first place, does not seem anxious to provide
further largesse. For the past few years, emphasis has been placed on
upgrading Brooks' computer systems and improving stock control. The new
store programme has been correspondingly constrained. Only three new Brooks
stores opened last year, plus nine factory outlets. This pace should pick up
in the years ahead, but Roberti is clear that his capital expenditure plan
'should never exceed Brooks' cashflow and often fall below'.
Problem number two is the US retail market. This is extremely competitive,
and most retailers - from specialist fashion chains to department stores -
have been emphasising 'value-pricing' in recent years. Brooks, whatever the
justification, is widely viewed as an expensive option. Smith knows this and
says the M&amp;S board has agreed the unthinkable: Brooks will run a national
advertising campaign.
Still, everything has yet to be proved. While Brooks boasted an 8 per cent
sales increase last year, the underlying sales growth from its existing
stores was a less-than-impressive 3.5-4 per cent range. Perhaps the big plus
to date is that few old-established Brooks customers seem to notice much
difference under the M&amp;S regime. One Manhattan shopper, who has brought
suits from Brooks' Madison Avenue store for decades, says he heads for the
same department where his measurements remain safely stored. Wardrobe
selling, he admits, has passed him by.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Easing lines of
communication - Phone bills are becoming easier to read
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If UK telephone customers find their bills easier to read these days, they
have Clear Communications to thank. Part of Siegel and Gale, the Saatchi and
Saatchi-owned communications group, the new company was launched in June.
Its arrival signals the priority now being given to clarity and directness
in company literature and other public dealings.
The telephone bill, which was called the 'telephone account', until Clear
Communications got hold of it, is in some respects just as complex as the
old bill. There are more subtotals rather than fewer leading up to the one
number you really need to know - the one you will write on your cheque.
This is because the aims of clarity are often at odds with marketing demands
from companies, such as BT, offering special options and customer
incentives. Improvements only go so far and groups, such as the Plain
English Campaign, remain critical of official gobbledegook. Some arcane
details remain unaltered.
Why, for example, do BT's customer account numbers bear no relation to the
unique numbers by which all customers are already known - their telephone
numbers? US telephone companies have abolished this anomaly. Nor do the
bills reveal another piece of information customers want - the date they
really have to pay by.
Much of the demand for simpler, clearer company communications originated in
the US, where Siegel and Gale has long held a commitment to what it calls
'language simplification'. In Britain, recent months have seen complaints
about form-filling and paper-pushing from bodies as diverse at the
Metropolitan Police and the Arts Council.
A study by Siegel and Gale with KPMG Peat Marwick shows that documentation
can consume up to 10 per cent of operating costs, but that only one senior
manager in 15 knows this.
Matters are often so desperate that any change is an improvement. But better
may not be good enough. Simplification should not be used solely as a
marketing tool but seen as a good thing for its own sake. There is no
substitute for sincerity, according to Chrissie Miles of the Plain English
Campaign.
Technology is one reason for current improvements. The new telephone bill's
secret is that it is laser-printed. This allows bills to be designed to
present more of the company's information and yet still appear simpler to
the customer.
Computers edit data so that bills may be prepared for particular customer
types and yet still be printed economically.
'One of the keys is being able to customise information,' says Susie Gear,
director of Clear Communications. This much was possible before. The
advantage of laser-printing is that it presents this information elegantly,
in typefaces that blend with the BT corporate style rather than hard-to-read
computer capitals.
Barclays Bank reports a 75 per cent increase in applications from students
in the year, following the introduction of Clear Communications' Barclaycard
application form. Students need only fill in the one form, ticking boxes to
indicate which of several cards they wish to apply for, rather than filling
in many forms and duplicating basic information, such as addresses, known to
the bank from the first form.
Clear Communications is currently tackling the design of waybills for DHL,
the express carrier, due to be used in August. Clear Communications found
that DHL's use of 24 slightly different variants of the waybill slowed
processing.
Customers filled in the confusing forms wrongly, leading to delays in
customs and insurance losses, and did not read the company's Terms and
Conditions.
The problem seems obvious in this case as in many others. But will the
solution be that much better?
Probably not, according to the Plain English Campaign which awards 'clarity
diamonds' for clear writing. It surveyed some of Siegel and Gale's work in
the US.
'The stuff they've called plain English I wouldn't give a pound of tripe
for,' says Miles. Now, that's clear communication.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Regent, London's newest luxury hotel, officially opens its doors today.
A magnificent reconstruction of the Great Central, one of Victorian
England's grand railway hotels, the Regent, on Marylebone Road, retains much
of its original stained glass and boasts an eight-storey, glass-roofed
atrium. The problem is that few people know where it is.
To counter this, the Regent, part of the Canadian Four Seasons group, began
a campaign late last year to ensure that guests who asked to be taken to the
hotel were not greeted with blank incomprehension by London's taxi drivers.
The hotel placed an advertisement in Taxi Newspaper, journal of the Licensed
Taxi Drivers' Association, last December offering readers a free packed
continental breakfast if they came to the hotel between 5.30 am and 7.30 am.
The offer was repeated in February. Seven hundred breakfasts were served.
Each driver who brought a coupon from the ad was also given three books of
receipts to give their customers. The receipts had the Regent's name on the
back.
On Park Lane, a better-known hotel district, the Inn on the Park, also part
of the Four Seasons group, has turned to taxi drivers, too.
The Inn on the Park is one of London's best-known and most highly-regarded
hotels. Five years ago, it changed its name to The Four Seasons Inn on the
Park, but most people sensibly ignored this mouthful and continued to use
the old name.
Last week the hotel shortened its name to the Four Seasons, raising the
prospect of further confusion. A few weeks ago, the Inn on the Park placed
an advertisement telling Taxi Newspaper readers it was changing the name.
The hotel followed up with a competition, asking questions about six other
cities which have Four Seasons hotels. The winner gets a week for two at a
Four Seasons hotel in the US, along with Dollars 300 (Pounds 200) to spend
on taxi fares.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (9): Tight timetable for sale of OTE - Anne
Counsell monitors progress of the privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fate of Greece's privatisation programme will be sealed in the coming
weeks. Success or failure largely rests on the strategic sale and subsequent
partial flotation of OTE, the state-owned telecommunications corporation.
'It is crucial,' says Mr Stefanos Manos, the minister of national economy
and driving force behind the government's sell-off of public enterprises. He
remains confident that the equity sale will be a success and, perhaps as
important, that it will be on schedule.
The timetable is very tight. An election is due before April next year,
possibly earlier. The Socialist opposition, widely tipped to win, has
vehemently opposed New Democracy's privatisation programme and has pledged
to halt and even reverse the sell-offs.
The government has taken steps to maintain the support of pro-privatisation
MPs during the summer session of parliament to push through enabling
legislation for the privatisation programme as well as the charter and
licence for OTE. The sale of a 35 per cent strategic stake in the company is
expected by early September with an initial public offering (IPO) in
November.
France Telecom, GTE of the US, NTT, Stet, Korea Telecom and Telefonica have
been shortlisted to bid for the strategic stake prior to the equity offering
of 14 per cent, valued at around Dr90bn, the largest so far in Greece. The
flotation structure is 5 per cent to domestic investors, 5 per cent as an
international tranche and the remaining 4 per cent will be offered at a
discount to OTE's 27,000 employees and 13,000 pensioners.
International advisers and analysts swell the ranks of the already
well-staffed government offices. Credit Suisse First Boston and J. Henry
Schroder Wagg have been appointed joint international lead managers while
the international accountancy firm Arthur Andersen is winding up a complete
audit of OTE. At the Athens Stock Exchange, Coopers and Lybrand are checking
the trading system as concern has been voiced over whether the market can
absorb such a large issue.
There is considerable bustle, tinged with urgency, as the preparations
continue apace. The prospectus is expected to be in draft form by August,
radio advertising is underway and a television campaign will start this
month.
Analysts view the OTE strategic sale and IPO as not only vital to Greece's
international credibility but also a potential turning point for the entire
privatisation programme. The government is fighting for the hearts and minds
of a population long accustomed to the state provision of jobs in public
sector corporations.
Patronage appointments and the use of the public sector as a cushion against
unemployment are viewed as a duty of the state and the monopolistic utility
corporations as state assets. This attitude extends to suppliers and
contractors who enjoy cosy relationships with public sector managers, to
trade unions worried about job losses and to senior politicians concerned
about the political cost of privatisation.
The unwieldy nature of the public sector and opposition from within the
ranks of the government have not helped the privatisation process. Its
presentation and image have also been tarnished by allegations that some
smaller companies were sold on favourable terms to businessmen and by the
somewhat patchy success of some larger sell-offs such as shipyards.
The process of unbundling state involvement in all aspects of the economy
began in 1990 when more than 60 per cent of Greece's GNP was generated by
the public sector. The government created the Industrial Reorganisation
Organisation (IRO) to liquidate or sell some 60 enterprises, many of these
moribund, on its books. Many were liquidated through accelerated procedures
and of the 27 companies in operation, the IRO now has three remaining - the
Kerafina ceramics company, Athens Paper Mill and Larco, the nickel mining
company. The Dollars 200m subsidy to maintain IRO companies has been
eliminated and proceeds from the liquidations are keeping the IRO running.
Privatisation sales in 1991 and 1992 amounted to almost Dr200bn, of which
Dr124bn came from the sale of the Aget Heracles cement company to
Calcestruzzi, a subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group. The sale has been
clouded by allegations that Calcestruzzi officials were involved in the
payment of kickbacks to Italian politicians.
Contractual difficulties have also contributed to slippages in the
privatisation timetable. The sale of a minority interest and management
rights in Greece's two largest oil refineries, Hellenic Aspropyrgos Refinery
(ELDA) and Hellenic Fuel and Mineral Oil (EKO), were delayed over the
appointment of international advisers. The offering memorandum is now
expected in October and lists of potential investors are being drawn up for
one or both partial buy-outs, expected to raise up to Dollars 1bn.
A continuing stand-off between the government and managers at the
state-owned Public Power Corporation (Deh) illustrates the depth of
opposition over private sector involvement in utilities and the managements'
ability to obstruct tender procedures. Deh maintains it can produce power
more cheaply than private operators and wants to maintain control of its own
development programmes whereas the government insists that Deh's debts are
too high to finance new power stations. Asking the Deh management to
co-operate with a private partner under build-operate transfer (BOT)
financing is 'akin to asking a man to chop off his own hand,' commented one
analyst. 'Of course, they declined.'
The retendering process for the 600MW Lavrion gas-fired power station is due
to start in mid-summer as part of the recent spurt in the privatisation
programme. The partial sale of 20 per cent of the Hellenic Sugar Industry,
also slowed by management and union sabotage, is expected to be completed by
early summer.
A important sale of assests belonging to the state tourism association (EOT)
is also on the busy agenda for the summer parliament. Mr Athanassios
Zambaras, special adviser to the privatisation team, expects considerable
foreign interest, especially in packages combining the sale of a hotel with
a marina or casino.
About 50 hotels, most of them small, will be sold while marinas are to be
offered on long-term leases or as sites to private operators. In addition, a
new regulatory framework is being established for nine casinos in prime
tourist sites. More than 150 indications of interest have been received for
the first round of selection this month and the casino licences are due to
be awarded by early November. Licence revenues are estimated at Dr22bn.
Privatisation plans for Olympic Airways remain on the distant horizon
because of huge cumulative debts and non-performing loans estimated at more
than Dr200bn. A new chairman has been brought in from the US and auditors
are working on the balance sheet as part of the fix first, sell later
approach to the airline. Olympic, which posted an operational loss of
Dr13.2bn in 1992, requires either a debt write-off or substantial financial
restructuring, possibly both, before it can contemplate seeking a strategic
partner.
A somewhat overdue drive towards greater transparency in the privatisation
process may have come too late to overcome deep-seated prejudices and
opposition. More important, the potential benefits will not be immediately
obvious to the majority of voters before the election.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (10): Rush for new acquisitions accelerates
 -A special correspondent discusses the reasons why Greek shipowners are
enlarging their fleets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK shipping is still an offshore industry, although it makes a generous
contribution to inflows of foreign exchange, injecting more than Dollars 2bn
into the domestic economy in 1992.
Greek-owned merchant ships accounted for 14.1 per cent of world tonnage in
March this year, totalling 2,479 vessels and almost 104m deadweight tonnes.
They are just as likely to be operated from offices in London and New York,
Monaco and Montevideo, as from Piraeus. The ships are registered under
numerous flags and employ a patchwork of nationalities in their crews.
By June, the Greek-controlled fleet had jumped to 2,835 ships totalling
107.5m dwt, representing almost 52 per cent of the European Community fleet.
Since January, Greek owners, wherever based, have spent at least Dollars 1bn
on sales and purchases. One London-based broker estimated that out of a
total of around 450 second-hand ship purchases in the first half of this
year, as many as 350 vessels had gone to Greek owners.
At the same time, Greek owners have been putting in orders for new buildings
for the first time in many years. Asian yards, notably in South Korea, have
received orders worth Dollars 700m in recent months. Greek owners have also
jumped at opportunities to take over contracts placed with east European and
former Soviet shipyards, at very attractive prices.
So far, however, the reasons behind the Greek rush for acquisitions remain
unclear. Are Greek owners taking advantage of comparatively low ship prices
to position themselves for an international economic recovery? Or are they
looking for a quick return on their investment as prices are pushed upwards?
'The US and Europe keep seeing green shoots but from here we don't see any
sustained growth yet,' says a Piraeus banker.
However, the shipping industry is more likely to be driven by fundamental
changes in demand rather than by fleet growth and tonnage supply. As Mr
Dennis Stonebridge, of Drewry Shipping Consultants, pointed out recently:
'There is fairly close correlation between peaks and troughs in the shipping
market and business cycles in the world economy. Any global economic
slowdown has always, after a time-lag, undermined the financial performance
of the shipping industry.'
The revival of Greek orders for new vessels can be attributed to tougher
regulations to cut marine pollution. Three of the four double-hulled,
double-skin very large crude carriers (VLCCs) delivered this year went to
Greek owners.
In the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster and the ensuing American Oil
Pollution Act (OPA 90), companies trading with the US have started to make
the huge investments called for by the new regulations.
The London-based operator Lykiardopoulos took delivery in January of the
280,000 dwt Arosa from Hitachi Zosen, the Japanese shipbuilder. In March,
the Onassis group took delivery of the 280,000 dwt Olympic Loyalty from
Sumitomo Heavy Industries. In May, the G S Livanos group took delivery of
the 301,824 dwt Chios from Hyundai of South Korea.
As one analyst puts it: 'All three vessels can be considered the latest in
ecologically-conscious tonnage that will give a boost to their operators'
image.'
Eletson Corporation, the Piraeus-based operator of products carriers,
recently placed an order for two 45,000 dwt double-hull, double-bottom ships
with Hyundai. The company says it has invested Dollars 500m in new ships
over the past eight years.
Even owners who had been content to operate with older tonnage have been
buying newer vessels, reflecting a growing tendency among charterers to be
more demanding about the state of vessels.
There is no shortage of opportunity, as the state-owned shipping companies
in the former eastern bloc struggle to find ways of surviving.
Last month, Forum Maritime, the Piraeus-based operator, reached agreement on
a Dollars 650m deal to acquire a 51 per cent stake in Petromin, a Romanian
state shipping company. Forum agreed to pay Dollars 335m in cash
instalments, with the remainder to be covered through repair and upgrading
of vessels. Forum will manage more than 100 vessels belonging to Petromin,
totalling some 4.5m dwt.
The deal followed a number of smaller agreements between Greek owners who
took over Romanian ships on a bareboat charter basis. The Greek operator
also agreed to finance repairs and improvements as needed.
The Forum deal, criticised for its lack of transparency, stirred
considerable political controversy in Romania. But with much of the
country's commercial fleet laid up and some vessels left unfinished in state
shipyards, the deals with Greek owners offered the Romanian government a
solution to the problems of fleet expansion and replacement.
For their part, some Greek operators have found that the Romanian vessels,
though solidly built, needed more work than expected. Greek operators who
have taken over Russian vessels have similar complaints.
'Structurally, the east European ships will last and last. But they aren't
designed for cost-effective operating, their engines are often in bad shape,
and crew living conditions are unsatisfactory by western standards,' says
one analyst.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (11): Prizeworthy taste of success - Anne
Counsell discusses the quiet revolution in the wine industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GEORGE Skouras predicts a good year for his Megas Oenos wines. He has
already had a head start; the 1990 Megas Oenos carried off first prize in
the category of full-bodied, expensive reds at the Wine America exposition
in New York and his entire production for 1993 has been pre-sold.
Not bad for a small producer of little known Greek wines, but his success
story is part of a bigger, but quiet revolution - the emergence of good
quality Greek wines produced by discerning winemakers experimenting with
indigenous and international grape varieties.
Nothing taints the palate or the reputation of Greek wines more than the
lingering aftertaste of a bad retsina. Unfortunately, the bitter taste of
the pine resin, originally added to preserve a mediocre wine or camouflage a
poor one, has become synonomous with Greek wines in general.
Mr Skouras and a small band of winemakers are improving this image by an
emphasis on quality and consistency and by reviving interest in traditional
vineyard areas.
The Nemea region in the Peloponnese illustrates the range of production
techniques and the diverse qualities of Greek wines. Vineyards hug the
hillsides and occupy almost all the available land in the fertile Nemea
valley, a basin area encircled by craggy outcrops of rock.
There is an air of order and purpose in the valley. Seemingly endless rows
of vines grow on neatly aligned supports to achieve optimum growth. The
Agioritiko red grape is grown in Nemea under a controlled 'appellation of
origin' and produces a dry wine with a rich bouquet and velvety taste, not
dissimilar to Cabernet Sauvignon.
Most of the leading producers offer a Nemea variety, many aged in oak
barrels to improve body and aroma, in their portfolio of regional labels.
The Nemea area embraces a range of production and marketing methods; from
small grape growers with a couple of hectares to Ktemata (estates) with
their own wineries and bottling plants.
The region produces about 20,000 tonnes of wines a year from an area of just
over 1,000 hectares. There are 40 wine producers and about twice as many
small grape growers who sell their harvest to the wineries at a producer
price of Dr80 a kilogramme.
A gleaming new co-operative winery built with the aid of EC funds occupies a
prime site in the centre of the valley. It is here that many small growers
bring their harvest, which is then processed and blended for bulk export and
bottling in Italy. Even at this lower end of the market, efforts are being
made to achieve consistency and to improve standards.
Other growers sell their grapes to the large producers or to independent
wineries such as that owned by Mr Skouras. In return for paying a higher
price to the growers, they maintain a watchful eye on vineyard practices.
George Papaiannou and his father Athanasious cultivate an area of 30
hectares in the valley and their family winery produces between 10 and
15,000 cases a year with a range of eight labels.
The Hellenic Export Promotion Organisation has awarded the elder Mr
Papaiannou prizes for vine growing and cultivation of experimental
varieties.
However, the Papaiannous are purists. They do not blend grape varieties, and
are insistent that meritocracy for indigenous grapes is the way forward.
Local connections are reflected in the labels, one of which depicts the lion
slain by Hercules at Nemea.
Their winery exemplifies the efforts being made by small and medium-sized
producers towards a consistent, better quality wine.
It is also an illustration of the marketing and distribution difficulties
which beset many Greek industries and which have hampered the effective
promotion of wines. Mr Papaiannou complains about the lack of good export
agents, as many are particular about price and less so about quality. 'This
is bad for the image of Greek wines abroad,' he says.
Mr Skouras, however, has had more success, largely because he has not relied
on the vagaries of the local agent system. Bottles in hand, Mr Skouras
sought out the reputable restaurants and cavas, selling the wines one by one
on merit.
Slowly he established a list of clients and won customer loyalty through
consistent supplies and personal services. He also gave his Cambello table
wines a high profile. The Cambello red, white and rose' wines feature in
information leaflets for visitors to the Nauplia area. Maps, useful
telephone numbers and descriptions of local sites are outlined in five
European languages.
Mr Skoures has also managed to penetrate the American market through
personal contacts with a wine importing and distribution enterprise in
Chicago.
However, many of the independent producers have neither the contacts nor the
energy of Mr Skouras and have to rely on the more haphazard agent system.
For this reason, it is mainly the large producers who have been successful
in securing export outlets.
Boutari, the market leader, has outlets in Belgium, Germany, Denmark,
Holland, the US, UK and Japan. It produces more than 25m bottles a year, of
which 20 per cent are destined for export markets.
With its purchase of the Andrew P Cambas company in 1991, Boutari now
commands 29 per cent of the local market and has been a leader in the
rennaisance of Greek wine making by drawing on its presence in many of
Greece's long-established wine-producing regions. The Boutari empire
stretches from Macedonia in the north to the island of Santorini, and its
Classic labels use the indigenous grapes of each region.
Much of the recent focus on improved quality has been initiated by larger
companies seeking to expand their export outlets in an increasingly
competitive market. Wines from France and Italy jostle for shelf space in
supermarkets and off licences as an ever-increasing range from the New World
and emerging producers enter the international market.
This realisation has woken up Greek producers. Constrained by the terrain
which precludes a huge increase in output, producers have begun to focus on
the virtues and potential of indigenous grape varieties.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (6): Neighbours evoke old suspicions - The
Balkan obsession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S progressive integration in the western world's leading
organisations, such as the European Community and Nato, has done nothing to
lessen its historical obsession with Balkan problems and its volatile
relations with its neighbours. On the contrary, the ending of the cold war
and the growing economic problems within the EC, which has switched some of
the spotlight from Greece's own economic failings, has allowed Athens to
devote even greater energy to Balkan affairs.
That interest and concern is not, of course, entirely in the Greeks' own
minds. It is natural that the break-up of Yugoslavia and the resulting
conflicts so close to its borders, particularly in Bosnia-Hercegovina,
should preoccupy the Greek government and public opinion. What can be
questioned, however, is whether the undoubtedly worrying situation in the
former Yugoslavia and some of the surrounding regions, should evoke
reactions and policies from Greece, some of which appear to be more
appropriate to the early part of this century than to an era in which
Greece's allies and partners are guarantors of its territorial integrity.
The war in Bosnia, recalling at least in Greek minds the ancient struggles
between the Islamic and the Christian worlds, has conjured up all the old
fears about Turkish and Islamic domination of the region. There is talk in
Athens about a 'Turkish arc' stretching from Turkey via Macedonia to
Albania, if the Moslem populations of Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia
are allowed to get out of hand.
To be worried about the stability of the region, particularly if there is an
uprising in Kosovo which, though part of Serbia, has a predominantly
Albanian population, is one thing. Turkey, however, has not shown any signs
recently of wanting to exploit the situation in the Balkans. Though urging
the international community to act more vigorously in support of the Bosnian
Moslems, it has been careful not to take any unilateral action.
With the election of Mr Suleyman Demirel, first as prime minister and
recently as successor to the late President Turgut Ozal, the heat has been
taken out of some of the traditional Greco-Turk bilateral problems, such as
quarrels over the Aegean continental shelf and airspace. The Cyprus talks at
the United Nations remain deadlocked without, however, generating too much
tension between Ankara and Athens and Turkey has now accepted that it has no
chance of joining the European Community until the next century, even if
Greece were to adopt a more accommodating attitude towards its application.
Yet in spite of the relatively quiescent state of Greco-Turk relations and
the fact that the Turks are increasingly turning their attention to central
Asia, the Greeks remain suspicious that their traditional enemy will be up
to something in the Balkans as soon as it has a chance. The improvement in
Turkish-Bulgarian relations, following the demise of the communist regime in
Bulgaria and the adoption of more liberal attitudes towards inhabitants of
Turkish origin in that country, is seen in Athens as more of a potential
threat to Greek interests than a welcome contribution to regional stability.
The long-running row over the name under which the former Yugoslav republic
of Macedonia should be recognised as an independent and sovereign state is
symptomatic of these historical and deeply-ingrained Greek attitudes and a
reflection of what one foreign diplomat has described as 'a tremendous lack
of national self-confidence'.
Both the Greek government and a large majority of the Greek population
insist that Macedonia, which is also the name of Greece's northernmost
region, is part of the nation's cultural identity dating back to King
Alexander the Great. To allow the former Yugoslav republic of Skopje, the
name of its capital by which it is always called by the Greeks, to adopt
Macedonia as its sole name and the 16-pointed star of Vergina, an ancient
Macedonian symbol, as its flag, would be an insult to the Greek nation and
people, it is argued.
Even worse, it would endorse the territorial claims on northern Greece of
those in the multi-ethnic former Yugoslav republic who harbour ambitions of
uniting all Macedonians within one nation. It is true that such fears might
once have been justified. If the communists, supported by Marshal Tito, and
including many people of Slav origin, had won the Greek civil war in 1949, a
carve-up of northern Greece might well have taken place. As it was, the
defeated guerrillas fled over the border, giving rise to present-day Greek
fears that some of their descendants have inherited their territorial
ambitions.
The latest state of play is that Greece and Macedonia, which in March was
allowed to take its seat at the United Nations under the temporary
description of Former Yugoslav Repulic of Macedonia, or FYROM, have been
given until September by the UN to resolve their dispute over a permanent
name. They recently rejected the compromise name of 'Nova Makedonija',
proposed by Mr Cyrus Vance, the former UN mediator, because of their
respective leaders' domestic problems. But they could well return to this
suggestion during their direct talks over the next three months, which are
also expected to deal with confidence-building measures, such as
guaranteeing Macedonia access to the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki
(Salonika).
The net result for Greek foreign policy, is that Athens' relations with its
European Community partners and, indeed, a much wider group of UN members,
have been soured quite unnecessarily, given that it was always clear that a
compromise had to be reached at the end of the road.
Nor has Greece's international standing been enhanced by its close
relationship with Serbia at a time when that country has been condemned
throughout the world for its support of the Bosnian Serbs and has been
punished by international sanctions. The moment of glory enjoyed by Mr
Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, when he was perceived to
have contributed to the conclusion of an international peace on Bosnia at an
Athens meeting in May, was all too short-lived, since the plan was rejected
by the Bosnian Serb assembly a few days later.
The close alliance with Serbia, based once again on a common Christian
Orthodox faith and the belief that Greece and Serbia can build a bulwark
against the perceived expansionist designs of Turkey and other Islamic
nations, appears to the rest of the world as ill-founded and short-sighted.
It is yet one more example of a policy which, by focusing entirely on the
country's short-term regional interests, risks losing Greece more friends in
the western world than such a small country can afford.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (5): Opportunities with high risks - Direct
investment in the Balkans is increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK businessmen who trade in the Balkans are used to setting up unusual
deals. Still, the entrepreneur who was offered a Russian nuclear submarine
'whole or in parts' while in Romania admitted to being surprised.
It is widely acknowledged in Athens that doing business in Romania, Bulgaria
and Albania offers opportunities not to be found elsewhere, in spite of the
high risks. Greek companies have set up more than 1,200 joint ventures in
these countries, though only a few hundred are active on a regular basis.
Direct investment by Greek companies is gradually increasing, especially in
Bulgaria where the framework for foreign investment is less uncertain.
A recent study by Ekome, a private Greek research organisation, notes that
bureaucracy is a difficulty to be overcome before setting up in Bulgaria but
there are few administrative problems once businesses are in operation. It
says that contracts are generally respected and distribution networks are
adequate.
Although Bulgaria's privatisation programme is far behind schedule, foreign
companies can take over state-owned enterprises there, with government
approval being granted on a case-by-case basis.
The experience of Hellenic Bottling Company, the Coca-cola franchise-holder
for Greece and Northern Ireland, illustrates how the existing infrastructure
can be adapted.
HBC holds majority stakes in four joint ventures set up with state-owned
bottling plants around Bulgaria to produce Coca-Cola and a minority stake in
a similar venture in Sofia. Its total investment is budgeted at Dollars 25m.
'We were going into completely unknown territory, with no idea how long it
would take to start up. Our partners are local co-operatives, together with
the central co-operative organisation,' says Mr Gerry Reidy, managing
director.
HBC found there was a 'critical mass on which to build a business' with soft
drink consumption at the same per capita level as in Greece in 1981, he
adds.
The company's investment covers upgrading and extension of buildings,
machinery and distribution vehicles. With four in operation from the start
of this year, the joint venture has started to show a return, with pre-tax
profits totalling Dollars 600,000 by last month.
The main difficulty, according to Mr Reidy, lay in changing the attitudes of
a workforce indifferent to how the business was being run. Language was also
a problem, with comparatively few English-speakers available.
HBC intends to avoid these problems in Romania, where it plans a
similar-sized investment, by starting production of Coca-Cola on two
greenfield sites. The company has a franchise covering more than one third
of the country.
The other high-profile Greek investor in Romania and Bulgaria is Intralot, a
subsidiary of Intracom, the telecommunications and software equipment
producer in which Ericsson of Sweden has a 12 per cent stake.
Intralot will launch an electronic lottery game, based on one developed for
the Russian market, in Romania next month. The company is providing systems
and equipment for Ralps, the state lottery organisation to operate the
'lotto' game. It has made a similar deal with Bulgaria's state lottery, the
Bulgarian Sports Totalizator, due to start up by the end of this year.
The lottery games are the first stage in Intracom's efforts to position
itself in what it sees as a promising market for telecommunications and
informatics.
Mr Costas Tsoukalidis, technical director of Intracom, says: 'We feel the
big international telecoms operators have the edge in winning public sector
contracts funded through aid programmes to eastern Europe. But there will be
plenty of other opportunities developing.'
In the wake of the businessmen, Greek banks are also entering the Balkan
market. Credit Bank, the largest Greek private bank, is setting up a bank in
Bucharest in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
taken a 25 per cent equity stake.
Xiosbank, a private bank controlled by the Vardinoyannis shipping and oil
group, has been given a licence to set up the first foreign bank branch in
Sofia. Its main task will be to back up the group's rapidly expanding
operations in Bulgaria. These range from a network of petrol stations and
car dealerships to hotels and even a fashionable hairdressing establishment
in Sofia.
The bank also expects to attract business from Greek-Bulgarian joint
ventures and Bulgarian exporters.
'The Bulgarian central bank is trying hard to comply with European Community
banking requirements. There are few problems with repatriation of funds. The
main problem we have is finding staff because there are so few real
bankers,' says Mr Christos Katsanis of Xiosbank.
There is less activity in Albania because of the small market and the
absence of even basic infrastructure. However, that has not deterred Greek
businessmen from setting up small-scale projects, mainly in textile
production and food processing, with the help of an extension of Greece's
investment incentives law to cover much of Albania.
In addition, trade with Albania can now be handled in drachmas rather than
hard currency under a special dispensation from the Bank of Greece. With
more than 200,000 Albanian migrant workers in Greece sending cash home
regularly, drachmas are widely available in Albania.
Mr Spyros Patseas, managing director of a trading company, says: 'Being able
to work with drachmas in Albania makes it possible to build more solid
relationships there.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (2): Urgent surgery needed - Anne Counsell
examines the economy of the poorest country in the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE has been a grudging acceptance by the financial community that the
Greek economy was in need of serious remedial attention. The realisation
that periodic cash injections from the EC could not sustain indefinite life
in a chronically sick economy has also slowly begun to penetrate the
political ranks.
Political expediency in an election year dictates that the prescribed
surgery of public spending cuts and structural reforms should be
administered painlessly. But many in government are reluctant to be left
holding the scalpel.
The Greek home remedy of spending its way out of tight corners is, not
surprisingly, the preferred course of treatment for many politicians.
Against this backdrop, Mr Stefanos Manos, the minister of national economy
and finance, has been dogged in his approach to economic and fiscal reform.
He has been instrumental in pushing through much needed but nonetheless
unpopular measures such as lifting price controls, public sector wage
freezes and privatisation programmes.
There have been howls of protest, not only from the public but also from
within parliament, resulting in a see-sawing passage towards reform. Part of
the problem is that external pressures have forced changes at a faster rate
than Greece's deeply entrenched political traditions.
Greece, which is the largest net recipient of EC funds, has committed itself
to the Maastricht treaty and an economic convergence programme. Both demand
a fiscal discipline which, until quite recently, was markedly absent from
Greek economic policy.
When Greece joined the EC in 1981, it was the second poorest country. It is
now the poorest, having been overtaken by Portugal in 1991, and has the
lowest productivity in the community, the highest inflation and the biggest
external debt.
In 1990, the New Democracy government took over an economy with a public
sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of 18.5 per cent of GDP, a current
account deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP and an inflation rate of more than 20
per cent.
Three years into its economic programme, the government can point to
significant progress - the PSBR and the current account deficit have shrunk
by 50 per cent or more to 10.5 per cent and 2 per cent of GDP respectively,
inflation is down to an average 15.5 per cent for early 1993 and a host of
measures have been taken to liberalise capital movements, implement
privatisation and to curb spending.
Recent reports by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), acknowledged the
improvement in economic indicators and praised the momentum towards
structural adjustment, urging the government to press ahead with its
reforms.
However, both the annual reports tempered their praise with concern,
primarily over the persistently high rate of inflation and the government's
ability to raise revenues.
The most significant brake on the economy is inflation. The consumer price
index, which ended the year at 14.4 per cent, has risen to more than 16 per
cent during March, April and May, largely because of steep rises in
telephone, transport and water tariffs as well as some basic foodstuffs.
A package of indirect taxes introduced last August has also added about 3
per cent to the annual rate of inflation. But even when stripped out of the
index this August, the resulting fall will still be below target.
The goal of single digit inflation by the end of 1993, as outlined in
Greece's convergence programme, cannot be met and 12 per cent is now seen as
a more realistic figure.
Another obdurate problem is the large public deficit, which in turn has
contributed to the inflation difficulties. Although there have been
significant reductions in the PSBR over the past three years, the rate has
fallen short of targets. In 1991, the PSBR was 14.1 per cent of GDP, 3.7
percentage points higher than the objective, in 1992 it was 10.5 per cent of
GDP and 1.4 percentage points adrift, while for the first half of this year
it is estimated to be 12 per cent of GDP, against a convergence programme
target of 8.6.
This is not for a lack of budgetary consolidation efforts. Public sector
wages and pensions have been cut in real terms, keeping the wage bill within
limits and contributing to a primary surplus in 1992 - the public sector
financial position before debt costs.
The government has attempted to rein in its consumption by reducing gross
overstaffing in a public sector packed with political appointees.
A recent study revealed that Greece has a ratio of one civil servant per 17
members of the population, compared to one per 100 in the United Kingdom. A
policy of replacing one out of every two retiring civil servants is not
being widely implemented because of the perceived political cost.
On the revenue side, the government introduced a new tax law last May to
deal with the pastime of tax evasion, a contributory factor to the high
budget deficit and shortfall in revenues.
However, the Greeks have had more practice at evading tax than the
government has had collecting it.
Lower tax rates did not bring more people into the net, neither did an
amnesty on previous tax years. A projected 30 per cent increase in tax
returns materialised as a rise of only 13 per cent for the first five
months.
The policy is to intensify the collection of taxes already assessed by
offering bonuses to the tax offices and by cross-checking. IBM is installing
hardware in 120 tax offices which account for 80 per cent of the tax system.
The government has ruled out tax increases before the election, and is
focusing on spending cuts involving a reduction in public investment and a
cut in public sector subsidies.
The government has also targeted two new sources of revenue. Road taxes
collected through the banking system are projected to raise up to Dr1.5bn a
day and the sale of casino licences is estimated to bring in Dr22bn. In
addition, receipts from privatisations should arrive in a flurry towards the
end of the year.
Further falls in inflation and the PSBR are pivotal to reducing the wide
interest rate differential with the EC. Real interest rates, now at around
14 per cent, have discouraged investment and strangled business activity.
There is little prospect for reduced rates as high real interest rates are
required to cushion the drachma against international exchange rate
uncertainty and to finance the PSBR.
Given the slippage in a number of crucial targets, the drachma will not join
the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) this year.
There has been some success in stabilising the devaluation of the drachma
against the Ecu to between 4 and 5 per cent over the first five months of
this year compared to a rate of 9.9 per cent in 1992.
On the external front, progress has also followed a zigzagging path. The
1992 current account deficit climbed to Dollars 2.03bn, partially reversing
a 60 per cent fall in 1991 to Dollars 1.46bn. Much of the deficit can be
attributed to payment lags and a surge in imports during the autumn currency
crisis in the EMS when there were expectations of a drachma devaluation.
A large net inflow of invisible earnings, including from the EC, continued
to hold up the balance of payments performance.
Although many expectations have not been realised, the failings are not
acute when over-ambitious targets, the war in Yugoslavia and the negative
impact of a slowdown in Europe are factored into the government's record. Mr
Manos and his experienced team, do not see Greece bumping along at the
bottom of the European Community in the longer term. The difficulty is the
short term.
The patchy but generally better prospects for the Greek economy are not the
most appealing message to voters, especially since most will not have reaped
any direct benefits from the overdue, but necessary, reforms.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (4): Institutions focus on bad debts / A
look at the effects of deregulation in banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION is intensifying in Greek banking as private banks continue to
chip away at the market share of the state-controlled institutions.
While the private banks were taking advantage of deregulation to offer a
sizeable range of new products, the attention of state-controlled banks has
been focused on sorting out bad debts.
Not before time, the Greek government stepped in to address a serious
anomaly in the banking system whereby state banks gave a gloss of
respectability to their balance sheets by accruing interest on
non-performing loans.
In addition to setting capital adequacy requirements for Greek banks
according to Bank for International Settlements (BIS) rules, a new banking
law laid down that interest could no longer be charged on loans left
unserviced for more than 12 months.
The result has been a dramatic fall in profits for National Bank, the
largest state-controlled bank, from Dr43bn (Dollars 215m) in 1991 to
Dr22.5bn last year. National Bank wrote off Dr30bn in bad debts in 1992,
while interest losses on doubtful loans amounted to Dr27bn.
Of the state-controlled banks, National Bank is burdened with much the
largest portfolio of bad debts, the result of decades of being forced to
make loans on political criteria to businessmen favoured by successive
governments.
Ionian Bank, also state-controlled, posted profits of Dr8.1bn for 1992, a 48
per cent decline from the previous year, after increasing provisions for
doubtful debts to Dr11.5bn.
Ionian's loan book now contains about Dr55bn in non-performing debt,
equivalent to 20 per cent of total lending, according to bank officials. The
bank hopes eventually to recover about Dr30bn of this amount.
According to analysts, the market share of the state-controlled banks has
dropped from more than 80 to around 70 per cent in the past four years.
Deregulation has permitted the private banks to exploit their comparative
advantage of greater flexibility and better technology.
However, the half dozen new private banks that have joined the market since
1990 cannot yet be called fully established. Their combined market share is
less than 5 per cent, according to most estimates.
This is forecast to grow slowly but steadily as their activities expand,
again at the expense of the large state banks. Mr George Gonticas, chairman
of Euromerchant Bank, which belongs to a group of private banks controlled
by the Latsis shipping family, says: 'To be successful you must develop a
range of activities. There's not really enough scope in Greece to
specialise.'
Euromerchant, with a capital base more than double the Greek licencing
requirement of Dr4bn, has focused on corporate lending and private banking.
However, it has not neglected the business of growing a deposit base. Its
branches are more imaginatively located than many: there is one in a leading
Athens supermarket and another in a private medical clinic.
Private banks, together with the 20-odd foreign banks with branches in
Greece, are also expected to gain most from the central bank's latest moves
to liberalise regulations.
Full liberalisation of interest rates came with the central bank's abolition
earlier this year of the basic 18 per cent savings rate, the last
administered rate. It brought a marked increase in the variety of
interest-bearing accounts available to depositors.
Still, so long as the government is obliged to raise more than Dr150bn each
month, mostly in high-yielding treasury bills, to finance the public sector
deficit, real interest rates can be expected to remain high.
The effects of the biggest changes have yet to be felt. In May, the central
bank lifted controls on all foreign exchange transactions except for
short-term borrowing in drachmas from abroad and transfers of paper, such as
cheques. The remaining curbs are to be lifted in July 1994 under an
extension agreed with the European Community.
However, it will be several months before the banks are ready to take
advantage of the new freedom in forward transactions.
The government has decided to go ahead with the privatisation of four small
state-controlled banks, including several subsidiaries of larger credit
institutions. All are profitable, with nationwide branch networks, but have
suffered from being used as receptacles for patronage appointments.
Following some confusion last year over the sale of Bank of Piraeus, a
subsidiary of the state-controlled Commercial Bank, which was criticised for
a lack of transparency in the deal, the preferred method of privatisation
will be through tender offers on the Athens Stock Exchange.
Earlier this year, Hanwha First Investment, a subsidiary of South Korea's
Hanwha group, acquired control of Bank of Athens, a subsidiary of National
Bank, through such an offer. Bidding in association with Rabobank of the
Netherlands, Hanwha paid Dr6.83bn for a two-thirds stake in Bank of Athens.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (1): Power struggle mars recovery - Greece
may be heading for a period of political instability that could wreck the
government's attempts to reform the economy. Kerin Hope discusses the
problems facing the EC's poorest nation, as two elderly politicians battle
to win the approval of voters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TO THE frustration of most Greeks, the country's elderly political leaders
seem to think they are no less immortal than the gods on Mount Olympus.
With his popularity at an all-time low, Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis is preparing constitutional amendments which would restore some
executive power to the president. He hopes to take over in 1995, when the
incumbent, Constantine Karamanlis, is due to step down.
However, Andreas Papandreou, the opposition leader, whose health is already
too fragile to permit putting in a full day's work, is just as keen to
become head of state, according to senior members of his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement.
Both men are 75, but according to the unwritten rules of Greek party
politics, neither can be unseated without first losing a parliamentary
election.
That is due to take place next spring, though it may come earlier if the
quarrels in Mr Mitsotakis's conservative party get out of hand.
Whatever happens, Greece appears to be headed for a period of political
instability that could wreck the present government's efforts to put the
economy on a sounder footing. Few analysts would bet on parliament being
able to elect a new president with the required three-fifths majority. The
alternative is a fresh election, followed by a presidential vote decided by
a simple majority in the 300-member house.
Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, is already under pressure to relax
wage restraints and curbs on public sector hiring. Yet even if he gives way,
it is probably too late for the conservatives to claw back enough votes to
stay in power.
Conservative supporters are just as enraged as the socialists over the
govern-ment's privatisation pro-gramme, which, among other things, calls for
selling 49 per cent of OTE, the state telecoms company, by the end of 1993,
and launching private sector power generation, without the participation of
DeH, the state-owned electricity producer.
Opposition to privatisation stems from the realisation that the practice of
making patronage appointments to public sector corporations, whose bloated
workforce exceeds 100,000, would immediately end.
Nor can the conservatives hope to scrape home on the back of an economic
recovery, originally forecast for the end of the year.
The target of single-digit inflation by December is slipping, with 12 per
cent now the best that Mr Manos can hope for. Moreover, the official
prediction of 2 per cent growth in 1993 has been reduced by half.
The government's position is further weakened by the recent decision of Mr
Antonis Samaras, the former foreign minister, to found his own political
splinter group.
Mr Samaras, sacked last year for his hardline stance in Greece's dispute
with Macedonia over the former Yugoslav republic's choice of name, retains a
strong personal following among voters.
In spite of having age on his side - he is 42 - Mr Samaras's bid to capture
the middle ground between reform-minded conservatives and moderate
socialists is undermined by his reputation for outspoken nationalism. Indeed
his main parliamentary support comes from a group of extreme rightwing
backbenchers.
Because the conservatives have only a one-seat majority in parliament, Mr
Mitsotakis faces the uncomfortable prospect of being held hostage by Mr
Samaras's supporters until the election.
Yet, the potential for internal division would be just as strong in Pasok,
if Mr Papandreou were obliged to step aside because of failing health. If
the socialists return to power, Mr Papandreou would be likely to conserve
his energies by appointing a pair of deputy prime ministers to handle
day-to-day running of the government.
Nobody expects Mr Papandreou to make the succession process easier by naming
a political heir. The result could be a long, drawn-out power struggle,
again with potentially disastrous consequences for management of the
economy.
Greece's policy on ex-Yugoslavia is in any case contradictory, with the
government being repeatedly criticised abroad for failing to crack down on
Greek companies defying sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - although
the Greek navy participates in the Nato blockade of the Adriatic coastline.
Indeed, the traditional Greek friendship with Serbia has grown stronger
since the start of the Bosnian war underlining how the government is being
pulled simultaneously in different directions: by its perceived interests in
the Balkans and by the responsibilities of belonging to western
institutions.
On the other hand, there seems little chance that Greece will ignite a
crisis in the southern Balkans.
With 200,000 Albanian migrant workers already in the country, the government
is well aware of the problems that a massive influx of refugees from Kosovo
and Macedonia would create.
Any Greek involvement in the Balkan imbroglio would also raise an immediate
territorial threat, by encouraging Turkey to intervene on behalf of the
ethnic Turkish minority in Thrace.
Political problems and regional anxieties have tended to overshadow the
progress which has been made on economic reform. Mr Manos has tried to clean
up the public sector balance sheet, reforming the pension system in the face
of stiff union opposition and rescheduling a heavy burden of domestic debt
left over from the 1980s.
He has brought in international auditors to straighten out the accounts at
public sector corporations. By contrast with his predecessors, he shows a
willingness to act on the advice provided by outside experts.
One result is that in spite of technical hitches and resistance from within
the revenue service, computerisation of main tax offices is finally under
way.
If nothing else, this year's revenue shortfall has spurred the government
into making greater efforts to close holes in the tax net.
Greeks must now record their personal tax number on an unlikely variety of
documents, from car insurance to telephone bills.
Abolition of price controls has given competition a boost, while the labour
market is more flexible with the introduction of part-time work and
liberalisation of shopping hours.
The official unemployment figure has stabilised at around 9 per cent, giving
credence to the government's claim that more than 150,000 new jobs have been
created in the past three years.
Despite present economic constraints, the structural reforms should improve
the outlook for medium-term growth, based on much-increased aid inflows from
the EC. Greece should receive Ecu18bn over the next five years from the
community's structural funds.
It will also be entitled to another Ecu2.5bn from the new cohesion fund for
improving transport and environmental protection in the four poorer
community states.
Most of the new EC funding is destined for important infrastructure
projects, notable by their absence during the past decade.
Greece is desperately short of motorways, many regional airports lack radar
equipment and ports are badly in need of expansion.
With the overland route to EC markets closed by the war in Bosnia, improving
communications in western Greece to link up with Italy is crucially
important.
If the politicians could switch their attention to practical matters, there
is much that could be done.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: Broad-brush approach for a truer picture
 -The final version of the ASB's operating and financial review formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY IS not often compared with painting, but David Tweedie is in an
expansive mood as he unveils the latest document from the Accounting
Standards Board.
'We've said that this is a broad canvass,' says Tweedie, chairman of the
ASB, referring to conversations held in recent months with companies. 'Now
you paint away. We're keen that managements say what they like.'
The final version of the operating and financial review (OFR), released
yesterday, extends the paint brushes and palette expectantly towards British
companies in the hope that they will use them constructively and creatively.
The OFR is loosely based on the management discussion and analysis (MD &amp; A)
with which US companies' accounts must comply. More specifically, the ASB
sees its own version as an attempt to emulate what it believes is existing
best practice among British companies but also believes it to be far less
legalistic than its trans-Atlantic counterpart.
The aim is to describe corporate performance, with analysis and a balance of
good and bad while providing some element of a projection of the business
into the future.
Like most good artistic work, the OFR has been months in fruition. The
previous discussion draft was produced in April last year. Since then, the
ASB has been busily attempting to build consensus around its contents.
The delay was partly the result of careful discussions with bodies such as
the 100 Group of leading finance directors, the Association of British
Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Institute of
Investment Management and Research.
The 15-page statement is unusual in many respects differing from the normal
accounting standards document. First, it is far more comprehensible to the
lay reader than most of its predecessors. Technical words crop up far less
frequently.
That is to be expected, since the aim is to provide guidance which will lead
to equally non-technical reports from companies. The OFR is intended to
appeal to less knowledgeable readers, at a time when the accounts themselves
are becoming more and more complex.
'We're looking for words, not for detailed numbers,' says Simon Peerless,
the ASB's project director for the OFR. Adds Tweedie: 'I suspect this is the
thing that private shareholders will read. It will also be useful for
analysts.'
He points out that while many company directors are complaining that FRS 3,
the new standard on the profit and loss account, does not provide a fair
portrayal of their performance, the OFR will give them the chance to
describe their company's position in the way they want.
The statement will provide much of the information that interests analysts
too, which may be a necessary outlet at a time when informal City briefings
are coming under attack by the Stock Exchange because of the risk of passing
on inside information. It may, as a result, threaten analysts' position.
It will also provide a convenient ground in which companies can describe the
state of their internal controls and whether they believe they are 'going
concerns' as required by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance.
A second difference from normal accounting standards is that the OFR is not
prescriptive. Unlike most ASB documents, it does not attempt to pounce on
ambiguity in existing rules; nor, unlike other recent publications, does it
even include examples to indicate the intention or the spirit rather than
the letter of the standards-setters.
'We wanted to let many flowers bloom,' says Tweedie, extending the metaphor.
'We felt that if we provided too much explanation it would kill
experimentation. This is not mandatory. We would rather have a much more
free-flowing document.'
Equally, unlike other standards there is no deadline for compliance. Tweedie
hopes the OFR is out in time for some financial year-ends in the autumn, and
certainly for many more for the start of next year.
That is partly explained by a third difference: the OFR is outside the ASB's
formal remit, which is to guide those areas within the statutory accounts at
the back of annual reports. 'If it is a standard rather than a statement
then we have got to have a locus to do it,' says Tweedie.
That raises several difficulties. Most important is how far companies will
comply, without the pressure of standards and the threat of the Financial
Reporting Review Panel. There is not even the requirement for scrutiny of
the statement by the auditors - unless there are any grave contradictions
with the financial information in the accounts.
All that exists is an unusual endorsement at the start of the OFR: a
'commendation' from the 100 Group, the Financial Reporting Council and the
Stock Exchange 'in the interests of good financial reporting'.
Tweedie argues that peer pressure will gradually persuade companies to
comply, dragging the more recalcitrant executives into line with their more
open, loquacious rivals.
He points out that about two-thirds of FTSE-100 companies already provide
some form of operating review in their annual reports, and cites examples of
existing good practice such as from Shell.
Some companies are likely to grumble that even if a picture is worth a
thousand words, when it comes to the OFR it is only a complement for a few
of the many numbers in the accounts. They will be concerned about the time
and cost in producing lengthy statements to describe their performance.
But Tweedie argues that most companies should already know most of the
information they will be asked to provide and that the length of the typical
OFR might only been 10-12 pages even for the most complex businesses.
More significant, there will be concern over confidentiality. Smaller
companies and those with a single product are likely to feel particularly
vulnerable to providing information that might provide too much sensitive
detail to their competitors.
The ASB provides a let-out: that they should say when they exclude this
information for this reason. It also suggests that they highlight any
changes in expenditure on particular items, rather than providing any
specific, absolute numbers.
Nigel Stapleton, finance director of Reed Elsevier, and chairman of the
technical committee of the 100 Group, says: 'I think the power of best
practice will be a very potent force and people will want to be seen
complying'.
But how likely is it that companies - especially those which have something
to hide - will provide ammunition to their critics by highlighting negative
information on their performance and their weaknesses? Says Tweedie: 'It's
going to be an interesting test of management freedom.'
He can only hope that the pictures they paint will be more at home in the
National Gallery than the Tate; more representational and classical than
they are impressionistic and abstract.

THE TURMOIL which replaced the iron hand of Communist rule in parts of
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union brought with it severe human
rights violations last year, Amnesty International said in a report released
today, Reuter reports from London.
The pressure group said in its annual world report that 1992 'was an
appalling year for human rights in Europe'.
Right around the globe, killings, torture and ill-treatment persisted with
few signs of improvement, it found, with 'governments continuing to put
politics before people's lives'.
The London-based organisation said: 'There are thousands of stories in this
350-page report of people whose lives have been destroyed by state
persecution and injustice.'
Amnesty said it feared the first United Nations human rights conference for
25 years, held in Vienna last month, would do little to help victims.
'When we compare the fine speeches and final document with the damning
evidence of political repression in this report, it is clear governments
have yet to prove the world conference will make a difference to the lives
of people around the world.'
During 1992 prisoners of conscience were held in at least 62 countries,
police in more than 110 states used torture and 45 governments killed
opponents and 'troublemakers' for political reasons.
Listing gross violations, it said conflict brought carnage and appalling
abuses in ex-Yugoslavia and Somalia and killings and mass arrests in Egypt,
Algeria and Israel.
'In a largely unreported civil war in Tajikistan, officials estimated that
20,000 people had died by the end of 1992 and unarmed civilians were
deliberately killed,' it said.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Gazans grapple with economic despair / A look at the
downward spiral of Palestinian living standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAMI Haddad is a skilled carpenter who sweeps the rubbish-strewn streets of
Gaza for Dollars 9 a day. Like thousands of other Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, Mr Haddad and his family of eight became
impoverished overnight when in late March Israel sealed-off the occupied
territories and restricted labourers travelling into Israel.
Now Mr Haddad is part of a temporary public works programme initiated by the
Israeli military-run civil administration. To many Palestinians, the
programme is a further slight on their dignity and a vain attempt by Israel
to defuse rising anger among the 780,000 refugees and residents who inhabit
the economically decimated strip.
'It's nonsense work,' said Mr Haddad. 'Each day we sweep the dirt into piles
and next day it blows back into the street. But what can I do? I must work
just to feed my family.' Per capita income in 1991 was Dollars 1,300 (Pounds
867) - a fraction of Israel's Dollars 11,000.
The long-suffering economy has suffered a lack of job-creating investment,
restrictive trade with Israel, annual population growth of 4.7 per cent and
a fewer migrant labourers working in Israel.
The closure has exacerbated the crisis. 'At one blow we lost jobs and our
markets in Israel and the West Bank. The closure is an economic war against
the Palestinians,' said Mr Mohamed Qudwa, chairman of the Gaza Chamber of
Commerce.
In the fruit and vegetable stores of Gaza prices have plumeted. The price of
a 17kg box of tomatoes has fallen from Shk20 (Pounds 4.80) to Shk2.5 since
the closure and a 11-12kg box of aubergines is down from Shk15 to Shk1. Some
Gazan farmers are leaving their produce to rot in the fields rather than pay
to harvest the crop.
Shops have either closed down or been forced to extend credit for basic food
items. Factories and businesses have scaled down production and laid off
workers as the export market was frozen and the domestic market shrunk.
Mr Nasser Sarraj, of the Gaza Union of Industrialists, says his members have
lost up to Dollars 80m since the closure.
Ordinary Palestinians in the towns and sprawling refugee camps have been
forced to rely on extended families and meagre savings. But these resources
are running out.
A draft report by Oxfam, the British charity, has warned of the prospect of
hunger unless urgent action is taken. 'Deterioration will continue and the
situation cannot be stabilised unless there is a massive and continuing
injection of funds to lift overall purchasing power,' Oxfam says.
The closure of Gaza, eased slightly in recent weeks, has also focused
attention on the long-term economic situation in the strip. Although the per
capita income of Gaza grew substantially after the 1967 occupation by Israel
as a result of access to the Israeli market, it fell sharply after the
intifada (uprising) in 1987 and declined steadily thereafter.
The economy was battered during the Gulf war. Israel sealed-off the
territories after the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) backed Iraq,
and Gulf states expelled 400,000 Palestinian guest workers, tens of
thousands of whom had been remitting substantial earnings to relatives in
Gaza.
Most of the workers returned to Gaza with no prospects of finding work. For
decades, Gaza has been starved of investment. Wealthy Palestinians shied
away because of the security situation and fears of being accused of
collaboration.
Israel also restricted Gazan exports to Israel, especially agricultural
produce, and has banned certain industries such as food processing to
protect Israeli producers. Gaza's producers, who import 96 per cent of their
raw materials from Israel, also suffer from excessive import tariffs and
taxes levied by Israel without reaping the benefit of import substitution.
In most years there has been a net capital flow from Gaza to Israel. Income
tax and VAT collected in Gaza accrues to the civil administration but import
taxes and VAT paid on imports from Israel accrues to the Israeli treasury.
Professor Ephraim Kleiman of the Hebrew University estimated in 1987 the net
flow of tribute capital from all the occupied territories into Israel was
about Dollars 180m.
In the past two years, Israel has begun changing its policy. It has
encouraged more investments, reformed taxation, raised its investment budget
in the territories and subsidised direct exports, like tomatoes and
strawberries, to foreign markets. But even the civil administration concedes
the present level of investment is inadequate compared to the massive need.
Gaza will continue to depend on Israel for migrant employment, imports and
exports, at least in the medium term.
Billions of dollars of foreign investment, a relaxation of Israel's
discriminatory trade and tax regime, and regional integration will be vital
to Gaza's economy and its fast growing and malcontent population.

NIGERIA'S Social Democratic party has agreed in principle to form an interim
national government to replace the military regime on August 27, provided it
can choose key members of the government and that elected local, state and
legislative institutions remain intact.
The National Republican Convention, the SDP's rival party, is joining it in
talks with President Ibrahim Babangida in an attempt to reach terms
agreeable to both parties and the military government. The NRC would prefer
new elections before August 27.
Both parties were established by the government, the NRC representing the
traditionally powerful north and the SDP the economically important
south-west.
The government on Tuesday issued an ultimatum to the parties to either join
a national government and accept the dissolution of all democratic
institutions or face fresh elections before August 27.
Statements from both parties and the government leave the transition as
uncertain as ever.
The SDP has rejected the option of fresh elections before the military is
meant to hand over because it insists its presidential candidate, Mr Moshood
Abiola, was a fair winner in last month's elections.
The government has annulled those polls and banned Mr Abiola from standing
in fresh elections. SDP officials say that the inclusion of Mr Abiola as
head of the interim government is a condition of their acceptance.
Protests in Lagos lasting three days have demonstrated popular rejection in
the south-west of Nigeria, the main base of Mr Abiola's support, of fresh
elections before August.
The two parties met in Abuja yesterday and agreed on the need to maintain
elected civilian institutions and to end military rule in August, but the
NRC accuses the SDP of intransigence in ruling out elections.
Troops have restored order in Lagos as protesters in the commercial capital
await details of the military government's plan for an interim national
government.
Mr Uche Chukwumerije, the information minister, denied reports that troops
had shot protesters there. The main casualties on Tuesday were the result of
a road accident in which a taxi driver ran over some youths blockading the
road and was lynched.

UN AND Iraqi officials began negotiations yesterday on the possible
resumption of oil exports from Iraq that, if successful, could add more than
half a million barrels a day to the current glut, further depressing prices.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said he hoped that an
eventual agreement to ship up to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) of Iraqi oil
over six months would be 'a first step in building confidence between the UN
and Iraq'.
He was instrumental in reviving the talks during a meeting with Mr Tariq
Aziz, Iraqi deputy prime minister, in Geneva last month.
The earlier rounds in the first half of 1992 ended in failure, in part
because of Baghdad's objections to a requirement that oil be shipped through
a Turkish pipeline in order to facilitate UN moni-toring of the quantities
sold.
Mr Carl-August Fleisch-hauer, German head of the UN legal office, is leading
the negotiating team from the UN secretariat. Mr Riyadh al-Qaysi is the
principal Iraqi negotiator.

<TEXT>
KUWAIT last night dismissed as a fabrication a report that it had paid for
political support from western and Arab countries during the 1990-91 Gulf
crisis, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
Finance Minister Nasser Abdulla al-Rodhan said in a statement that an
allegation in a report in yesterday's Financial Times was devoid of all
truth. 'Kuwait has never resorted to these means at any time, either in the
past or at present,' he said.
The statement carried by the official Kuwait News Agency said the charge was
aimed at tarnishing the country's image and its right to restore its
sovereignty following the 1990 Iraqi invasion.
'He (Mr Rodhan) accused parties deeply implicated in financial
irregularities of spreading such malicious reports in a futile attempt to
clear themselves from the crimes they have committed,' the agency reported.
The Financial Times report said former officials of the Kuwait Investment
Office (KIO) had said Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) missing from the KIO's
Spanish operation was used to buy western and Arab support to free Kuwait
after Iraq invaded.
The report said large sums were alleged to have been used at the United
Nations to buy votes which later provided the legal basis for Kuwait's
liberation by a multinational force.
A coalition of western, Arab and Asian armies drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait
in February 1991.
Mr Rodhan said the allegations aimed 'at insulting the international will
which was unanimous in denouncing the Iraqi invasion and occupation based on
respect for international legitimacy and the United Nations charter'.

NIGERIA'S Social Democratic party (SDP) has agreed in principle to form an
interim national government to replace the military regime on August 27,
provided that it can choose key members of the government and that elected
local, state and legislative institutions remain intact.
The National Republican Convention (NRC) is joining the SDP in talks with
President Ibrahim Babangida on terms agreeable to both parties and the
military government. The NRC would be a more grudging participant,
preferring the option of new elections before August 27.
According to a presidential spokesman on Tuesday, the military government
would dissolve all democratic institutions and possibly the two army-created
parties unless they were ready for fresh elections by the end of July.
The SDP has rejected the option of fresh elections before the military hand
over because they insist that their presidential candidate, Mr Moshood
Abiola, was a fair winner in the June elections. The government has annulled
those polls and banned Mr Abiola from standing in fresh elections. SDP
officials say that the inclusion of Mr Abiola as head of the interim
government is a condition of their acceptance.
'Things have reached a collision course and that would not help the parties,
the military or the people,' said Mr Amos Idakula, spokesman for the SDP.
'We are opting for this because it is the only way to get the military out
of power. This interim government would be a buffer between the outgoing
regime and elected civilian government. Elections held under the military
would have no credibility.'
The civilian protest in Lagos which has paralysed the country's commercial
capital for three days has made clear popular rejection in south-west
Nigeria, the main base of Mr Abiola's support, of fresh elections before
August.
'We would not be fooled by that,' said a Lagos civil servant. 'The June
polls results should be upheld. There is no option being offered by the
government, it is an ultimatum. We could not accept new elections under
them.'
The two parties met in Abuja yesterday and agreed on the need to maintain
elected civilian institutions and to end military rule in August, but the
NRC accuses SDP of intransigence in ruling out elections under the existing
regime.
'We are paying for the sins of the SDP,' said an NRC spokesman in Abuja.
'Our position is that there should be new elections immediately. But if the
SDP show restraint and table proposals which are in the national interest,
we are prepared to negotiate if it will preserve the corporate unity of
Nigeria.'
Soldiers have restored order in Lagos as protesters await details of the
plan for an interim national government.
Mr Uche Chukwumerije, the information minister, denied reports that anyone
had been shot in Lagos. Contrary to local reports, the main casualties on
Tuesday were the result of a road accident in which a taxi driver ran over
some youths in road blockade and was lynched by a crowd.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Pay strike hits civil service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 50,000 Israeli civil servants began an open-ended strike
yesterday, demanding pay rises of 35 per cent spread over the next three to
four years.
The strike hit government offices, ports, state television, the rabbinical
courts and hospitals, although essential services were maintained.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said that, while he had some sympathy for the
lowest paid workers, the wage demands were too high to contemplate. His
finance minister Mr Abraham Shochat termed the strike 'unnecessary',
claiming that a solution could have been negotiated without such action.
But representatives of the four unions involved - which have agreed among
themselves not to return to work until their demands are met in full - said
that they had been trying to negotiate for the past six months, to no avail.
They noted teachers had won 30 per cent pay rises earlier this year after
resorting to strikes.
Mr Shochat said that to bow to the strikers' demands would inevitably push
up unemployment, which runs at 11 per cent.

FT  08 JUL 93 / 60,000 join strikes against Hyundai
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GENERAL strike yesterday at Hyundai group factories raised concerns that
the labour dispute at South Korea's largest conglomerate could affect the
nation's economic recovery.
About 60,000 workers at eight Hyundai subsidiaries, including its large car
and shipbuilding companies, escalated their industrial action by staging an
one-day strike after conducting partial walkouts since mid-June.
The trade unions were debating last night whether to continue their general
strike or revert to walkouts, which have already cost Dollars 300m (Pounds
198m) in lost sales for Hyundai.
The workers are seeking pay increases above the 4.7 per cent rise offered by
Hyundai. Wage growth at Hyundai last year averaged 16 per cent.
The government wants to limit pay rises in the big industrial groups to
about 5 per cent this year in a bid to restore the country's
competitiveness, which has been harmed by high wage increases since
democracy was introduced in 1987.
The Hyundai workers are also demanding the company accept Hyundchongryong,
an alliance of the Hyundai trade unions, as legal representative in all
labour talks. This is likely to strengthen the workers bargaining position.
Hyundai now holds separate negotiations with individual company unions
within the group.
The government fears that a lengthy strike at Hyundai could affect exports
since the industrial group is the country's biggest producer of autos and
ships.
The government yesterday ordered the arrest of four Hyundchongryong
officials for their role in the strike.
But concerns that the Hyundai labour dispute could spread to other
industrial groups appeared to be receding A threatened strike at Daewoo
Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries was averted after workers accepted a 4.7
per cent pay offer.
Workers at nine of Hyundai's 33 companies have also accepted similarly
modest wage rises.
The government reported that about half of the wage negotiations in the
country's 5,500 leading companies have been settled for this year. Officials
also report that the number of industrial disputes have fallen by 53 per
cent.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Angola ready to award two oil contracts in spite of civil
war: Minister expects Dollars 1bn investment in exploration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANGOLAN government is ready to award two new contracts for oil
exploration shortly in spite of the country's civil war and disrupted
production.
Ms Albina Africano, the country's energy minister, said western oil
companies were preparing to invest more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in
oil exploration.
The country was plunged back into civil war after election results which
returned President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his MPLA government to power
were rejected by the rebel movement Unita.
In May Unita captured the oil town of Soyo where they destroyed oil storage
facilities and halted onshore oil production.
'They've completely destroyed Soyo, everything has been blown up,' Ms
Africano said. Onshore oil output of 30,000 barrels a day (b/d) has been
stopped since January and some offshore production has been suspended
because of the destruction of Soyo's storage terminal.
Ms Africano in London for meetings with the British government in an effort
to persuade ministers to put pressure on Unita to return to the negotiating
table, said 60,000 b/d of offshore output had been halted, but she was
confident that this could be resumed within months, if storage facilities
offshore could be expanded. Angola is producing 453,000 b/d compared with
capacity production of 550,000 b/d.
The rebels have shot at the oil platforms 70km offshore, but Ms Africano
said the western oil companies have been given military guarantees they will
be protected as effectively as possible.
'The situation is more stable than it appears, the future investment plans
of the oil companies show they still have confidence in the country,' she
said.
Chevron, Angola's largest operator is investing Dollars 500m in development
of oilfields in Cabinda, and Elf, the French energy company, plans to put
Dollars 1bn into expanding its own production.
Ms Africano said the government hoped to sign a contract by September,
giving Exxon, the US oil major, and British Petroleum deep-water exploration
acreage. Exxon will be the operator on the 4,500-square km block with BP
holding 40 per cent of the interest and Agip, Italy's resources company,
having a minority interest.
Royal Dutch/Shell has recently been awarded another deep water block and Ms
Africano said a group of companies led by Chevron and including Total and
Agip would be awarded another deep-water block in August.
The Angolan government is looking for the country's oil production to
increase to 690,000 b/d by 1997, excluding the new deep-water blocks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, yesterday warned that the
Japanese economy has yet to hit bottom, as there is no evidence of a
recovery in personal consumption and corporate capital spending.
His comments stimulated speculation in the country's financial markets that
the official discount rate, now at 2.5 per cent, will be cut soon after the
July 18 general election.
Meanwhile, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said the Japanese
government should further stimulate internal demand to quicken the domestic
recovery and assist the world economy.
Referring to a Y13,200bn (Pounds 82bn) stimulatory package announced in
April, Mr Bentsen said Japan had 'made a start', but must do more to
encourage economic growth and reduce its still expanding current account
surplus.
However, Mr Mieno said Japan had 'done everything possible' to stimulate
growth and the positive effects would be seen in the longer-term. He
suggested that a rush to cut the external surplus could create inflation and
damage the Japanese economy.
Mr Mieno was speaking after a two-day meeting of the bank's regional branch
managers, who complained that the benefits of the yen's recent appreciation
had yet to be passed on to consumers, while export-oriented companies are
under increasing pressure.
The gloominess of the branch managers has tempered the bank's expectations
of a recovery this year, and Mr Mieno admitted yesterday that business
sentiment could be damaged by continuing political instability.
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party is expected to lose its majority at
the election, leading to a coalition government, which may have a limited
life. There is a growing expectation that another election will be called
within a year.
The bank has toned down its forecasts for the strength of the expected
recovery from 'modest' to 'very modest', suggesting the continuing falls in
personal consumption and capital spending have come as a surprise.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Hurd to press for Hong Kong talks progress

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, arrives in Beijing today for
discussions with Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in an effort to
give talks about Hong Kong's political development a fresh impetus.
The meeting of the two foreign ministers, scheduled for tomorrow morning,
follows high-level talks in London last week about Hong Kong policy and the
appointment of Mr Qian to head a group charged with studying issues related
to the colony's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Mr Hurd, who said last week that he would make no new proposals is expected
to underline Britain's desire to reach an agreement with Beijing on the
terms of Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 elections.
He will make plain to Mr Qian that the principles enunciated by Mr Chris
Patten, Hong Kong governor, for fair and open elections are British
government policy, and that the time for discussion between the two
governments is not unlimited and that laws for the 1994-95 polls need to be
enacted in the near future.
In a speech in Singapore this week, Mr Hurd stressed the need for
continuity, which he defined as 'objective criteria evident to everybody by
which candidates who stand for election to the Legislative Council in 1995
know they can continue through 1997 the 'through train' to the next
elections in 1999'.
British and Chinese officials have had seven rounds of talks in Beijing on
Hong Kong's constitutional development since April. Mr Hurd said: 'Progress
has been slow - I must say slower than we would wish.' But he said most of
the groundwork had been done and that Mr Patten had suggested a meeting
between the two foreign ministers.
Britain's objective in the talks, which Mr Patten characterises as his
'bottom line', is to secure a broadening of the electoral franchise for the
representatives that will sit in the 1995 Legislative Council, Hong Kong's
law making body. The UK also wants China to define the criteria of a
'loyalty test' it will apply in 1996, to those elected a year earlier, to
assess their fitness for office after 1997.
Mr Hurd last met Mr Qian in September when the two foreign ministers were in
New York for opening of the UN general assembly.
Since then Mr Qian has been promoted to full membership of the Politburo -
the Chinese Communist party's top policy making organ - and assumed
responsibility for Hong Kong affairs.
British officials hope that Mr Qian's enhanced political clout, allied to
his broader perspective on China's place in the world, might prove
influential in persuading Beijing to accept accepting the need for a deal
with which both can live.

FT  08 JUL 93 / French output forecast worsens: Insee statistics institute
expects 0.7% decline this year

FRANCE'S national output will fall by 0.7 per cent this year and its
unemployment rate will rise a further percentage point to hit a level of
12.5 per cent by December, according to a forecast released today by Insee,
the official statistics agency.
This estimate is gloomier than that of the government, which earlier this
month predicted a 0.4 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Insee also
forecast that traded goods and services (excluding state-provided services)
would contract by 1.2 per cent this year, whereas the government expected
only 0.8 per cent.
According to Insee, the traded portion of GDP fell by 0.5 per cent in the
last three months of 1992, by 0.6 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 and
by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter. It predicts a return to stability in
the third quarter and growth of 0.2 per cent in the final three months.
The sombre prediction about unemployment has been amply borne out this week
by announcements of large scale redundancies at state-controlled companies
which are trying to cut losses before eventual privatisation.
Trade unions at Aerospatiale, the aicraft and defence company, have called a
two-hour strike today in protest at a plan to cut up to 1,500 jobs next year
following 1,145 redundancies this year.
Mr Bernard Attali, president of Air France, said yesterday the airline might
have to increase the scope of the 4,500 redundancies it had already planned
for 1991-93. Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics group, said it too was
looking at various forms of part-time work, paid leave and early retirement
schemes in order to avoid redundancies.
At the same time, Credit Lyonnais yesterday cast doubt on official estimates
of the degree to which the economy will bounce back next year.
The bank forecast growth of 1 per cent in 1994, compared to the 1.4-1.5 per
cent estimate from the government and the Organisation for Econonmic
Co-operation and Development.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Caterpillar accused of EC law breaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR, the world's largest construction equipment group, faces
European Community fines for alleged 'serious infringements' of EC
competition laws by restricting parallel trading in machinery and parts.
The European Commission's DG IV competition directorate claims Caterpillar
has used discriminatory pricing and other means to discourage parallel
trading, in which independent resellers buy machinery or parts in a
low-price zone and sell in a high-price area.
Caterpillar is contesting the allegations.
The EC document says Brussels 'intends to require Caterpillar to put an end
to these infringements'. However, no final decision has been taken, and a DG
IV official said the case was still under review.
The case arose from a series of complaints made to the Commission over the
past few years by independent resellers, including Seymour Equipment
Services of the UK, and Johannes Rosendahl of Germany.
According to the EC document, the complaints were 'addressed against alleged
export bans, and against refusals to supply machines and parts and measures
taken to ensure that Caterpillar's dealers in their turn refuse such
supply'.
It says the agreements notified by Caterpillar to the EC and the general
policy of the Illinois-based company and its distributors 'lead to a
complete orchestration of international trade in Caterpillar's construction
machinery and parts'.
Parallel traders cannot obtain these goods for third states, it claims. 'If
they succeed in obtaining and exporting the goods, they are blacklisted and
are excluded from all trade, including trade between member states.'
Caterpillar cannot be fined for any agreements it has notified to the EC,
but the DG IV document says the company's 1990 guidebook, Export Parts
Policy, was never notified.
The prohibition on sales to end-users exporting for use outside the EC and
other procedures contained in the guidebook 'go beyond the scope of the
earlier notified agreements and associated letters,' says the EC.
Caterpillar said yesterday it was preparing its response to the Commission's
objections. 'But, based on the opinion of our legal counsel, Caterpillar
believes it has strong defences to each allegation set forth in the
statement of objections. In our opinion, Caterpillar's distribution
practices comply with Community law.'
Mr Timothy Trott, general manager of Seymour Group, said he was very pleased
by the EC's stance. If confirmed, the Commission's decision would make it
much easier to exploit price differences in different markets, within and
outside the EC.
For example, he said, there was a huge differential in Greece. 'We could buy
machinery and parts in the UK, ship them to Greece and still undercut the
local dealer. At the moment, we're completely barred.'

Bosnia's Moslems looked set yesterday to reject a plan for a three-way
partition of the republic despite warnings from UN envoy Thorvald
Stoltenberg that this could threaten peacekeeping efforts there, Reuter
reports from Sarajevo.
The bulk of Bosnia's collective 10-member presidency met to consider a
report recommending formation of a federal state or protectorate under
international control. Both ideas would appear to be at odds with a joint
Serb-Croat proposal for a division into Serb, Croat and Moslem states.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Budget approved in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S conservative coalition government yesterday survived crucial
budget votes in parliament, boosting its hopes of reaching a new funding
agreement with the International Monetary Fund
The government's unpopular plan to increase value-added tax on foodstuffs
and other staples from 6 to 10 per cent was approved by a majority of 13.
The comfortable margin of victory for the government was ensured by the
absence of some opposition MPs from the Free Democrats and Young Democrats,
two liberal parties which have no desire to fight an early general election.
The governing Hungarian Democratic Forum of Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime
minister, has a majority of just one following the recent defection of
right-wingers to the newly-formed Hungarian Justice party.
Approval of the supplementary budget - which followed yesterday in a later
vote by parliament - staves off the prospect of an early election as Mr
Antall, leader of the longest-running government in post-Communist central
Europe, had warned he would be unwilling to lead a minority administration.
An election is due to be held next May.
Officials believe, however, that the Democratic Forum's coalition allies are
likely to grow more rebellious, and a further challenge may come this autumn
when the restrictive 1994 budget comes before parliament.
The change to VAT is part of a mini-budget aimed at holding Hungary's budget
deficit to Ft215bn (Pounds 1.5bn) this year. That would keep the public
sector deficit down to 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product and put it on
track for a further reduction to 5.6 per cent in 1994.
Yesterday's approval by parliament comes at the same time as a reported
compromise in talks between the International Monetary Fund and the trade
unions over social security funding. Resolution of the two issues sets the
scene for Hungary to conclude a new 18-month accord with the IMF which would
provide access to Dollars 700m in loans.
The Fund suspended credits when Hungary's budget deficit careered through
agreed parameters in mid-1992. An IMF seal of approval now would in turn
clear the way for a World Bank package of credits to restructure Hungary's
most indebted companies and support the recapitalisation of the country's
largest commercial banks whose balance sheets are littered with
non-performing loans granted to loss-making state-owned enterprises.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Triumphant Milosevic heaps scorn on west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French president's wife, Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, this week became the
latest international figure to founder on the rock of Serbian intransigence.
She returned to Paris yesterday after failing to persuade President Slobodan
Milosevic to free Mr Vuk Draskovic, the opposition leader beaten by police
during demonstrations in Belgrade last month.
'It would not be the truth to say I am not disappointed. . . . Perhaps we
overestimated our powers of conviction. But I don't believe it was a
failure,' Mrs Mitterrand told reporters.
But snubbing the west and its envoys is a skill which Mr Milosevic exercises
with increasing relish. In a cynical move this week, his cabinet even went
so far as to wish Mrs Mitterrand a 'pleasant stay in Belgrade', at the same
time as ignoring her pleas for Mr Draskovic's release.
With Greater Serbia within his reach, a triumphant Mr Milosevic appears
convinced that the time has come to erase any remnants of opposition to his
rule.
The west's refusal to take action against Serbian forces in Bosnia was a
signal to Mr Milosevic that there would be no international resistance if he
snuffed out the remaining Serbian opposition and independent media. His
earlier promises that Serbia would never bow to western pressure have been
fulfilled.
Flexing his muscles, Mr Milosevic has refused to release Mr Draskovic,
jailed since June 1. He has ignored international appeals on behalf of Mr
Draskovic, including personal letters from Mr John Major, UK prime minister,
and President Francois Mitterrand.
The imprisonment and subsequent beating of the opposition leader and his
wife Danica are an act of personal vengeance by the Serbian president, who
is unwilling to tolerate any challenge to his hold over Serbia.
Last month, he cemented his grip on the remains of Yugoslavia, now
comprising Serbia and its tiny ally Montenegro, when he replaced the federal
president, Mr Dobrica Cosic, with a faithful party apparatchik. Mr Milosevic
now has unlimited power in Serbia. His cronies have been installed at the
head of state institutions and enterprises.
The open and brutal treatment while in police custody of the opposition
leader has sent a clear message to any would-be opponents of the government,
as well as ordinary Serbs, of what might will happen to them if they dare
resist the government.
Belgrade journalists fear Mr Milosevic will soon carry out a purge of the
media which opposed his grip on power. The editor-in-chief of Borba, the
independent Belgrade daily, is likely to be ousted this week.
Mr Milosevic reportedly has a police force of 80,000 available to crush any
protest and to sow the seeds of fear prior to possible social unrest as the
Serbian economy collapses under the weight of war and 14 months of UN
sanctions.
There is no doubt sanctions are taking their toll, but they have had no
effect on moderating Serbia's hardline stance towards the UN and other
international organisations.
Serbia over the past month has ordered the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe to close its Belgrade offices which monitored human
and minority rights. The government also declared as 'unwelcome' the UN
special envoy on human rights and war crimes.
In addition, Serbia has refused to participate in the Geneva conference on
succession in the former Yugoslavia. The unrecognised Yugoslav federation is
also delaying or refusing to issue new visas for incoming western diplomats
and journalists.
Mr Milosevic last week said sanctions would 'not be lifted by pleading or
concessions' to the international community. So far his arrogant resistance
has paid off. By refusing to bend, he appears to have gained the respect of
the west as the main power broker in the Balkans.
But for all his present power the Serbian president knows he is in a race
against time. This winter could find most inhabitants of Belgrade facing
severe heating and food shortages if sanctions continue to be enforced
strictly. Then, even 80,000 police could have trouble containing their
anger.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Finland cuts base rate to protect fragile shoots of
recovery: Hugh Carnegy examines prospects for an export-led end to prolonged
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND yesterday cut its base rate from 7 to 6.5 per cent in an effort to
lift the economy out of deep recession and to sustain emerging optimism for
recovery.
The rate cut applies to many domestic mortgages and loans dating back
several years when these rates were set officially. Most market rates in
Helsinki are now around 7 per cent compared with 17 per cent last autumn.
Finnish interest rates in general are among the lowest in Europe.
Falling interest rates have lifted optimism over the Finnish economy which
has contracted by 10 per cent since 1990. A two per cent rise in GDP is
forecast in 1994, largely on the basis of rising exports.
Exports are expected to rise by more than 12 per cent this year and almost
as much in 1994, fuelled by a sharp devaluation in the Finnish markka late
last year and falling real wages at home. These two factors have combined to
give Finnish companies greatly improved competitivity.
Finland, along with Sweden, has carefully avoided re-pegging its currency to
the Ecu, because devaluation has boosted competitiveness of the wood and
paper industries, both dominant factors in the economy.
'We think we are close to the bottom,' said a finance ministry official, but
there is a grim realisation in Helsinki that the recovery is likely to be
fragile and painfully slow.
Any upturn in the economy has to offset a catalogue of difficulties stemming
from the loss of trade with the Soviet Union, a slump in world markets for
its forestry products and the of collapse of a borrowing-led domestic bubble
at the start of the decade.
The finance ministry has already revised downwards its original forecast of
3.5 per cent growth next year. Above all, persistently rising unemployment,
presently standing at around 18 per cent of the workforce, is not expected
to peak until 1994.
Forecasts which officials admit are optimistic see the jobless rate still
above 12 per cent in 1997.
Export growth may wipe out the current account deficit next year, halting
the rise in foreign debt which is now approaching 50 per cent of GDP. But a
rise in exports has so far produced little impact on employment as Finnish
manufacturers are heavily capital intensive.
The paralysed domestic economy has also yet to respond to falling interest
rates. The trend has been for companies and individuals to repay borrowings.
Latest official forecasts see overall consumption falling by four per cent
this year and a further 3.5 per cent in 1994, while investment is set to
decline by more than 11 per cent this year, the fourth successive year of
decline.
Nor is the government able to provide fiscal stimulus. The cost of
unemployment benefit, debt servicing and bailing out the banking system,
coupled with falling revenues, has taken the budget deficit to near 10 per
cent of GDP.

Opposition supporters mount a protest in central Belgrade over the continued
detention of Mr Vuk Draskovic, the Serbian opposition leader, who is on a
hunger strike. Russia yesterday joined several western governments in a call
for his release. Serbian opposition deputies announced they would go ahead
with street demonstrations across the country if the Belgrade regime failed
to release Mr Draskovic who, with his wife Danica, was jailed and severely
beaten on June 1 during an anti-government protest. A team of
government-appointed doctors yesterday said Mr Draskovic's condition had
'worsened' and could face 'critical complications' over the next 24 hours.

FT  08 JUL 93 / EC employment creation is no easy job, says Brussels report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREATING jobs in Europe is not just a matter of growth, according to a
European Commission report published yesterday.
While few countries have succeeded in increasing employment without a
healthy increase in output, the relationship is not at all uniform, says the
Commission's fifth report on Employment in Europe. High-growth Spain and
Ireland have both performed poorly in job creation, it says. France and
Italy, too, have been above average on growth but below average on
employment creation.
The report - written by officials in Directorate General 5 - is an ambitious
attempt at a comparative labour market analysis which underlines that there
are no easy answers to the EC's manifest failure to create jobs. But
describing the great diversity of practice and outcome within the EC's
labour markets 'can be used to develop more effective measures and
programmes of action', claim the authors.
The report's publication could scarcely be better timed, given the recent
launch by Brussels of a debate about unemployment and job creation across
the community.
The report's authors start by setting the scene with the familiar but
depressing facts of EC employment: the proportion of the working age
population in employment has fallen in the past 20 years while it has been
rising sharply in most of the rest of the industrial world; during the EC
jobs boom of the second half of the 1980s only about a quarter of the new
jobs went to the unemployed; and in 1991, 45 per cent of the EC unemployed
had been out of work for more than a year.
But the regional variations in unemployment are extreme, ranging from less
than 5 per cent in parts of southern Germany, northern Italy and northern
Portugal to rates of more than 20 per cent in parts of Spain, Ireland and
southern Italy.
The two most original chapters of the report concern labour costs and
employment protection. Taking average hourly labour costs in manufacturing,
Germany is 15 per cent higher than the next country, the Netherlands, which
is bunched together with Belgium, France, Denmark and Luxembourg.
Italy is 5 per cent below them and roughly at the EC average while the UK is
placed 25 per cent below that average and only just above Spain and Ireland.
Average hourly labour costs in manufacturing are six times greater in
Germany than Portugal.
These large differences are closely linked to differences in productivity,
say the authors.
Indirect labour costs vary considerably from 30 per cent or more in France,
Italy and Belgium, to 13 per cent in the UK and 3 per cent in Denmark.
The authors say that cutting such indirect costs to employers would not
necessarily make countries more competitive as either the state or the
individual employee would have to take on more of the burden of, say, health
care, which would place upward pressure on wage costs.
But the report does say that excessive non-wage costs push more employees
into the black market.
Wages adjust to changes in employment levels only very slowly, says the
report, pointing to Germany where Hamburg has the second-highest
unemployment level in the country but by far the highest labour costs.
Restrictions on firing workers divides the EC into three groups: Denmark,
Ireland and the UK have the least restrictions; Greece, the Netherlands,
Italy, Portugal and Spain, have the most restrictions and Belgium, France
and Germany are somewhere in between.
Despite the fact that direct severance costs are third highest in Spain,
behind Italy and Greece (the average cost of firing someone in the EC is 22
weeks pay), Spanish workers have the highest risk of involuntary redundancy.
That is because there is has been a sharp increase in the use of temporary
contract work in some high regulation countries such as Spain and Portugal.
In Spain the proportion of employees on temporary contracts increased from
16 per cent in 1987 to 32 per cent in 1991. And in France most new recruits
now start on part-time contracts.
EC surveys of employers' perceptions of labour protection placed Italy at
the top followed by the Netherlands, Spain, France and Belgium.
There has been some pattern of liberalisation in recent years and the report
concludes that the link between employment protection and job creation is
complex.
The highest protection is found in the southern member states (Italy has the
most highly-regulated market in the Community) which also, however, have the
lowest labour costs. And in the high-protection northern states some of the
costs are cancelled out by generous state aid to employers for
restructuring.

FT  08 JUL 93 / No figure put on aid to Ireland, says Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, underlined yesterday that
Brussels had not committed itself to any figure in the EC dispute with
Ireland over its share of Ecu157bn (Pounds 121.36bn) in regional aid.
Ireland at the weekend blocked agreement on rules for the regional programme
for 1994-99, holding out for the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) Irish Prime
Minister Albert Reynolds said he was promised at last December's Edinburgh
summit.
Irish foreign minister Dick Spring is understood to have rejected an offer
of IPounds 7.5bn made by Mr Delors at last weekend's meeting of EC foreign
ministers, although some senior Commission officials believe even this
figure cannot be justified.
But at yesterday's weekly meeting of the Commission, Mr Delors said no
concrete commitment had been made to Ireland, according to a Commission
spokesman.
The official said the Commission had discussed the criteria for allocating
the regional aid, which would be in the hands of the four commissioners
directly concerned, most prominently Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for
regional policy.
Mr Millan has been pushing for strict application of the allocation criteria
decided at Edinburgh, which weigh factors such as regional income,
unemployment and size of population, and which by some Commission
calculations would give Ireland not more than IL7bn.
Commission officials insisted there had 'been no confrontation, big or
small' between Mr Delors and Mr Millan, but said the Commission president
was irritated by publication of the figures.
Negotiations with Ireland were expected to continue yesterday, with
telephone contacts between Mr Reynolds and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime
minister of Belgium, which currently chairs the EC. Mr Delors is expected to
contact Mr Reynolds today or tomorrow.
The hope is that the European parliament will accept the framework
regulation for the aid package when it meets next week, even though Ireland
has affixed a reserve to it. If the parliament does not, it will only come
back to it in the autumn, under a lengthy procedure which moreover grants
MEPs veto powers.
But if parliament does give its approval, efforts will continue to get an
agreement with Dublin before foreign ministers meet in Brussels on July 19.
This will only be possible if Mr Reynolds can get near his IPounds 8bn
without subtracting from funds earmarked for the other poor member states to
which the bulk of the aid goes - Spain, Portugal and Greece.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Works councils go-ahead likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stalled EC draft directive to set up mandatory works councils in large
trans-European companies is likely to be the first measure approved
separately by Britain's 11 partners under the Maastricht social chapter,
assuming the treaty is fully ratified in early autumn.
Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, said yesterday that talks in
London this week with Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, had failed to
produce any change in the UK's attitude.
The 11 who signed the Maastricht social protocol are broadly agreed on the
works councils directive, which Britain has blocked for more than two years.
Mr Flynn said the Belgian presidency intended to put the directive on the
agenda of its first social affairs council (probably on October 13).
'Failing agreement, it is a candidate for the first measure to go through
under the protocol.'
He is understood to have been seeking some signs of flexibility from Britain
on works councils in exchange for concessions in other areas of EC social
policy.
Under the directive, companies employing more than 1,000 workers in more
than one member state, and with more than 100 employees in at least two of
them, would have to set up elected works councils, and consult them on jobs
changes, new technology, investment and relocation plans. Though there is
provision for workers and employers to make their own arrangements, the UK
opposes making consultation obligatory.
But because British companies in continental Europe would be among those
most affected, even if only 11 states adopted the directive, the UK had
appeared until now to be keeping its options open, negotiating clause by
sub-clause on the measure.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Suharto criticised over rights

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday warned President Suharto of Indonesia that
Washington was concerned about alleged human rights abuses in East Timor,
which was annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
The criticisms came despite the fact that Mr Suharto, in Tokyo as chairman
of the Non-Aligned Movement, had requested that leaders at the Group of
Seven summit should not link economic assistance to the human rights issue.
Mr Suharto said his government would welcome an international fact-finding
mission to East Timor, where there have been clashes between Indonesian
troops and a pro-independence movement.
The Indonesian leader has had a mixed time in Tokyo. On the one hand,
attention has been drawn to the East Timor issue. However, Mr Suharto has
also been congratulated for his 'moderate' leadership of the 108-member
Non-Aligned Movement.
Mr Suharto had hoped to address the G7 summit but had to be content with
meeting individual leaders, including Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime
minister, who has agreed formally to convey the movement's concerns to the
summit.
Mr Suharto told US and Japanese officials that developing nations did not
want to be left out of trade agreements fashioned by the leading
industrialised nations.
He also requested increased assistance from developed countries,
particularly for environmental protection in countries experiencing rapid
economic growth and accompanying severe pollution.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Tokyo seeks tocut the pompand paperwork
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR, Bill Clinton and even Francois Mitterrand agree on one thing:
that the annual Group of Seven summits have become too elaborate for their
own good.
The leaders will discuss today the future of the meetings, with some, such
as Mr Major, advocating a return to the 'good old days' of 1975 when heads
of government first gathered out of the public eye for a 'fireside chat' on
global economic problems without hoards of officials and journalists turning
the event into a circus and stoking up expectations.
Already the Japanese hosts of this year's summit have gone a good way to
cutting down the element of spectacle. Whereas previously the G7 summiteers
happily succumbed to lengthy opening ceremonies, this year's talks began
yesterday in a determinedly businesslike manner.
Punctually, at four-minute intervals, the leaders of the US, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Community arrived at Tokyo's
Akasaka palace and began their talks after no more than a brief handshake
with the host, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa.
Further streamlining is promised with a savage attack on the mountains of
paper that summits have produced. The political declaration to be issued
today will be no more than two pages of text, compared with five last year.
The final economic declaration will also be brief compared with the 10-page
monster from last year's Munich summit.
Indeed, for the second time this century Munich has become associated with
an infamous international meeting. Last year's G7 summit in the city is now
considered to have been no more than an expensive photo-call.
Yesterday's progress in the Quad trade talks has probably reprieved the G7
summit as an institution. But after last year's meeting Mr Major suggested
to his fellow leaders that future summits be limited to heads of government.
A lively discussion is expected.

HEADS of government are allowed to take the high road while mere cabinet
secretaries play it rougher. Rarely has this been more evident than in the
contrasting performances here of President Bill Clinton and other members of
his delegation in their negotiations with the Japanese government.
Yesterday's address at Waseda University saw Mr Clinton at his most
uplifting. He came to praise Japan far more than to berate it for not
playing by global trading rules. He also put the case that the interests of
the average Japanese and American citizen were, in effect, identical.
The president's theme was 'the new global economy' - the sort of catchy
phrase in English likely instantly to enter, if it has not already, the
Japanese vocabulary.
He defines this as an economy no longer 'based on standardised mass
production but dominated by an explosion of customised production and
services and by a volume of information increasing at an astonishing rate.'
This, he noted deferentially, 'requires little explanation here in Japan,'
as the pioneer of Asian modernisation.
But it is not merely this brave new world that Mr Clinton sees as threatened
by restrictive Japanese government practices. It is the Japanese consumer
who mostly takes it on the chin, Mr Clinton said, prompting a clarion call
to the students at Waseda.
'I would send this message to all of you and to the people beyond the walls
of this hall. You have a common cause with the people of America - a common
cause against outdated practices that undermine our relationship and
diminish the quality of your own lives.
'The ideas I propose are beneficial to both of us because they will increase
the number and lower the costs of the products you will be able to buy, the
services you are able to access and they will, thereby, reward the work, the
education and the skills that you bring to daily life here in Japan. You are
entitled to no less.'
Mr Clinton emphasised the indispensable nature of the bilateral relationship
(subject to some changes) and the extent to which the US and Japan could
help forge a 'new Pacific community.'
The president has been publicly kind to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the lame but not
entirely dead duck Japanese prime minister, and to the Japanese politicians
who have upset the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's applecart.
Mr Clinton and Mr Tsutomu Hata, who has broken away from the LDP to form the
Renewal Party, were observed comparing notes at a US embassy reception.
Back in the bilateral ministerial trenches, however, less apparent sweetness
has prevailed, with one conspicuous, but multilateral, exception.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, mentioned Japan's willingness to
cut to zero its tariffs on distilled products as instrumental in bringing
about the new market access package agreed by the four trade ministers
yesterday.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, and his small army of officials
continue to insist that quantifiable targets must be agreed with Japan if
its trade surplus with the US is to be reduced.
'It won't be easy,' he intones for the umpteenth time, yet again marvelling,
as any Texan would, how the Japanese can tolerate paying six times as much
for a pound of prime beef as Americans do.
One of his senior advisers talks about it being 'better to get a good
agreement than a quick agreement' and lists the areas in which the US
believes the Japanese government 'manages' trade - financial services,
automobile parts, computers and government procurement.
Leaning on Japan pays off, he argues. Pressure this year has produced a
bigger, earlier fiscal stimulus package than anticipated and goes on to make
the case for a second pump priming operation this autumn because of new
signs that the Japanese economy is back in first gear again.

</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN press made a meal yesterday of the Clinton administration's
spectacular ignorance of Italy's representatives at the Group of Seven
summit in Tokyo.
This followed the discovery by reporters covering the summit that the US
guidance kits indicated Italy would be represented by President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro - 'to be pronounced Skalfaroh.' The Italian president, who
constitutionally has no executive authority, never attends such meetings.
Meanwhile, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister and its
representative at the summit, was absent from the US guidance. So was Mr
Piero Barucci, the treasury minister and Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the foreign
minister.
The guidance kit also included a curriculum vitae of Mr Franco Gallo, the
finance minister, one of two junior ministers in the three-man government
economic team. Mr Gallo was in Rome yesterday and had never been expected to
go to Tokyo.
A final curious error. The US hand-out stated that President Scalfaro was
the godfather of Mr Bruno Trentin, the leader of the main trade union
confederation, CGIL. About the only thing the two men have in common is the
Italian language.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Dumping penalties are still core problem -
Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the more hollow commitments in the Quad's market access report to G7
leaders was to cut steel tariffs to zero.
This is not because zero tariffs are not achievable, but because conflict in
the steel sector lies elsewhere - in over-production and alleged dumping.
Indeed, formal tariff barriers on steel products are already low, averaging
about 5 per cent.
By contrast, the US is levying tariffs of up to 109 per cent on flat-rolled
steel on charges of foreign dumping or subsidies in the US market.
It is these duties - the upshot of cases still to be ruled on by the
International Trade Commission on July 27 - which have so infuriated Mr
Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister.
In spite of international protests over US legal procedures that have led to
such draconian dumping duties, neither President Bill Clinton nor Mr Mickey
Kantor, his trade representative, have impeded the process, which is
expected to eliminate most foreign flat-rolled steel from the US market.
It was not until he began his round of pre-summit interviews that Mr Clinton
addressed the steel issue directly.
He told reporters: 'We can discuss the facts. But there's nothing wrong with
our law, and it's not different from the laws of a lot of other countries.'
In spite of such strong words, the route to settlement of both the dumping
duty row, and to successful introduction of zero tariffs, is a Multilateral
Steel Agree-ment.
This MSA has been the subject of angry and fruitless negotiation for several
years. Talks collapsed in March last year, and resumed in Geneva yesterday.
By including steel on the list of sectors destined for zero tariffs, the US
has put a firm marker down that no Uruguay Round deal will be done without
the MSA issue being resolved.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Companies welcome export prospects - UK
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proposed abolition or lowering of tariffs was welcomed in most sectors
of British industry yesterday. Makers of drugs, textiles and construction
equipment said it could lead to higher exports and profits. The beer
industry, however, warned it could mean unfair competition.
A producer of construction equipment said: 'This gives us room to increase
our profit margins or sell 10 per cent more in the US.'
Textile industry officials pointed out that the UK has no tariffs on
textiles above 15 per cent, whereas US tariffs on UK goods range above 40
per cent. An official said: 'Halving such tariffs would provide significant
export opportunities.'
The pharmaceuticals industry welcomed the move. Some medicines are subject
to tariffs of about 5 per cent into both the EC and the US. The UK exported
Pounds 324m worth of drugs to the US last year, compared with American
imports worth Pounds 121m.
Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest chemical producer, said the
progress was encouraging but begged a lot of questions.
The company pointed out that many British companies already had operations
in North America and Japan, and would therefore not benefit directly from
the reduction in tariffs.
The steel industry was equally cautious, noting that any elimination of
tariffs in steel would be subject to a Multilateral Steel Agreement, which
is still under negotiation.
However, British Steel, which wants the MSA to eliminate subsidies to steel
producers and encourage free trade, said yesterday's announcement meant the
MSA was now linked to the Gatt talks more closely than before.
The Scotch whisky industry said the abolition of tariffs on spirits was good
news, especially for the Japanese market. However, it pointed out that the
main impediment in Japan was not tariffs but excise duties.
The UK Brewers' Society said abolition of tariffs on beer could expose EC
brewers to unfair competition as barley costs more in the EC than on the
world market.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Tariff-cutting deal lifts hopes for Uruguay
Round - Long and difficult talks lie ahead before pact is sealed / Free
trade for many manufacturers, Gloom on G7 economies, Gatt talks given 80%
chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE was no shortage of superlatives in Tokyo yesterday as the ministers of
the Quad group of countries unveiled their tariff-cutting deal to the
world's press.
But even the most jaundiced veteran of successive 'breakthroughs' in the
seven-year history of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations
found it difficult not to be impressed by the package unveiled by
negotiators from the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada.
Nobody was hiding the fact that long and difficult negotiations lay ahead
before the Quad 'market access' pact could be talked into a full trade
liberalisation agreement under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. But there was a strong sense that the protracted haggling
in the early hours of Tuesday morning and the additional negotiations
yesterday had brought a qualitative change for the better.
One senior EC negotiator, admitting past doubts as to whether the Uruguay
Round could be completed successfully, said: 'I am now confident that we can
reach a Gatt agreement by the end of the year.'
The Quad package envisages substantial tariff cuts for manufactured
products, including:
Complete elimination of tariffs and non-tariff measures in pharmaceuticals,
construction equipment, medical equipment, steel, beer and, subject to
certain exceptions, furniture, farm equipment and spirits.
The inclusion of spirits among the so-called zero-for-zero products came
after a surprise concession by the Japanese negotiators and should benefit
exporters of Scotch whisky to Japan, where tariffs will fall by about Y170
(Pounds 1.05) a bottle.
Harmonisation of tariffs at low rates for chemical products. The negotiators
hope further negotiations will lead to more harmonisation in other areas.
Tariff cuts of up to 50 per cent for 'high tariff' products, which carry
tariffs of 15 per cent and above. Although there will be some agreed
exceptions to this rule, this should be particularly beneficial to European
producers of high-quality textiles such as British woollen suits, which
should now find the US market more accessible. Tariff cuts averaging at
least one third for other products. These include wood, paper and pulp and
scientific equipment, which some members of the Quad group had
unsuccessfully earmarked for zero-for-zero tariff treatment. Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC's chief negotiator, said the tariff-eliminating part of the
deal would be especially good for Europe because the EC was a net exporter
in all categories of zero-for-zero products except medical equipment.
In the area of services, progress has been more opaque. The report prepared
by the Quad ministers for the G7 summit said there were many existing offers
to improve market access for services. These covered sectors such as
insurance, banking, securities, construction, distribution, tourism,
software and computer services, professional and business services,
including consulting, engineering, accounting and legal services.
But the specific commitments to emerge yesterday were vague.
In financial services, the Quad countries promised to 'continue their
efforts' towards more open financial services markets.
In basic telecommunications the way ahead appeared somewhat clearer. The
Quad ministers said they would 'pursue a multilateral liberalisation' of the
sector within the framework of a draft trade in services agreement and on
the basis of a common detailed agenda that they had developed.
Whether the package lives up to the description of Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US's chief trade negotiator, as the 'biggest tariff-cutting agreement in
history' will depend on its successful 'multilateralisation' in Geneva.
This is especially true of trade liberalisation in textiles. Mr Hugo Paemen,
the chief EC negotiator, pointed out that 70 per cent of US textile trade
was with countries other than the Quad group and so further negotiations in
Geneva with other Gatt partners would be vitally important for this sector.
It was clear yesterday that the participating countries had shown
considerable goodwill to bring about the pact.
The agreement to include spirits in the products exempted from tariffs was
decisive for the success of yesterday's talks and possible only because
Japan abandoned a long-held stance.
The concession followed the intervention of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese
prime minister. The issue had been a major obstacle in Tuesday's late night
negotiations and was resolved only after he ordered that spirits be included
in the zero-for-zero group. The US also made significant concessions on
textiles.
Sir Leon pointed out that eliminating tariffs on steel would need not just
completion of a Multilateral Steel Agreement but also settlement of the
current anti-dumping dispute by which the US has imposed penal tariffs on
certain steel imports.
A key attraction of making market access the focus of the trade negotiations
ahead of this week's summit was the idea that a tariff-cutting initiative
would be easily understood by voters as leading to more growth and jobs.
Yesterday, G7 spokesmen were quick to claim that the Quad agreement would
boost employment. The US said it could eventually add perhaps 2m jobs
worldwide while British officials predicted 400,000 new jobs in the UK over
13 years.
But, even if the Uruguay Round is successfully completed by the end of this
year, it will still be some time before the full effects of yesterday's
advance on trade liberalisation is felt by business and consumers.
Mr Paemen explained that it would take five years before the tariff cuts
could be fully implemented for most products and longer for chemicals.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Accord fixes agenda for global forum - Geneva
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a matter of conjecture whether yesterday's breakthrough in trade talks
between the world's leading industrial powers had the force of an historic
'preliminary agreement' - as Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative,
would have it - or was no more than a 'report that sets out the terms for
future negotiations and objectives' - as coy French ministers insisted.
What is less debatable is that it has enabled trade negotiations to resume
next Monday in Geneva for the first time since December. There, issues can
be addressed by all 111 signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, rather than the 15 industrial countries represented by the European
Community, Japan, Canada and the US.
Equally clear is that an array of difficult disagreements on trade
liberalisation remain to be resolved before any champagne corks can be
popped to celebrate a Uruguay Round accord.
In short, deep-seated differences remain over liberalisation of farm trade,
trade in textiles, and the opening of markets in Japan and South Korea to
rice imports. The long-simmering row over trade in steel products will also
be hard to resolve.
The text of yesterday's Uruguay Round report to the G7 from negotiators in
Tokyo stepped discreetly around a failure to reach agreement on trade in
services. Officials noted merely that they would 'continue to work toward
satisfactory solutions' to outstanding differences on reform of trade in
financial, maritime and audio-visual services - areas that have eluded
agreement for the past two years.
Disputes over proposals to strengthen Gatt rules - most prominently over
settlement of trade disputes, the use of subsidies, protection against
dumping, and government procurement - have also been left unattended until
negotiations resume in Geneva. Most contentious of all is a dispute over
whether Gatt's powers should be increased by transforming it into a
multilateral trading organisation.
In Tokyo yesterday Mr Hugo Paeman, the EC's senior trade negotiator, was
clear that difficult issues remain. 'The most difficult will be to sell
(today's agreement) to the other countries,' he said, adding that some newly
industrialised countries might object to parts of the accord.
The Quad deal would be meaningless without a multilateral Gatt accord
embracing all 111 signatories, he said. 'Everything is part of one single
undertaking.'
He was, nevertheless, optimistic about prospects. 'Now that this has been
done, it's 80 per cent certain that we can end the Uruguay Round by the end
of the year.'
The task facing Mr Peter Sutherland, now in his eighth day as
director-general of Gatt, is daunting as negotiators prepare to try for the
fourth time in four years to steer the Round to a successful conclusion.
For Mr Sutherland, a key sentence in yesterday's Quad report sets his agenda
for the months ahead. 'Subject to appropriate contributions by other major
producers and exporters and satisfactory resolution of specific non-tariff
measure issues, we want to build upon existing market access offers
contained in our draft schedules of concessions through a comprehensive and
integrated approach, recognising the desire of some participants to move
further in various areas such as wood, paper and pulp, and scientific
equipment,' the report says.
A priority will be to gather together representatives from all contracting
parties to the Gatt next Monday.
The next step will be to prepare an agenda that takes negotiators to a full
agreement by a December 15 deadline - when President Bill Clinton's 'fast
track' authority expires.
It is possible Mr Sutherland will demand the unthinkable: that negotiators
abandon long-planned summer breaks during August to ensure progress in the
negotiations.
If he balks on this, he has just two weeks now, and then 15 weeks from early
September, to resolve outstanding differences.
Mr Sutherland was yesterday relieved by the breakthrough. Late last week he
had warned that failure in Tokyo would effectively destroy hopes of
completing the Round by the end of the year. 'This was the signal that was
needed to relaunch the multilateral process in Geneva,' he said. He called
on negotiators in Tokyo to return on Monday to Geneva 'to inform trading
partners. . . on the details of the agreement they have reached, with a view
to building a multilaterally agreed package acceptable to all.'

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Structural reforms key to economic revival -
Impediments to growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE ministers from the Group of Seven countries will today deliver a
blunt warning to their heads of state that the world's leading economies
face a gloomy future.
A confidential finance ministers' report on structural impediments to growth
says average G7 growth rates have fallen from 4.8 per cent in the 1960s to
3.3 per cent in the 1970s and 2.6 per cent in the 1980s. Since 1990 growth
in the G7 economies has averaged just 1.3 per cent.
Meanwhile, unemployment has more than doubled from 3 per cent in the 1960s
to about 7.2 per cent.
The report, agreed yesterday in Tokyo, warns that unless deeply rooted
obstacles are dealt with by structural reforms, economic growth will remain
depressed, unemployment will become a chronic problem and the threat of
trade protectionism will grow.
The report says a stable macroeconomic environment is needed to promote
growth.
'It is essential for our countries to strengthen their efforts for fiscal
consolidation at all levels of government to create room for private
investment and keep the stock of public debt manageable.'
Monetary policies, supported in some countries by wages and incomes
policies, should help keep long-term interest rates low enough to promote
investment.
Efforts to make exchange rates more stable will be most successful with
close co-ordination of economic policies. 'Structural unemployment has grown
while economic growth has decelerated. Macroeconomic policies alone will not
be effective in reducing the structural elements in unemployment.'
However, in contrast to G7 statements in the 1980s this report does not call
for sweeping deregulation to free up markets. Instead it acknowledges an
important role for public policy in improving economic performance. It says
'well-targeted structural policies' are needed to raise growth. The report's
recommendations include:
The G7 economies need greater wage flexibility. They should move away from
income support programmes for the unemployed towards more active policies to
strengthen incentives for education, training and job search by the
unemployed, particularly the young.
Elements of social insurance schemes and regulations which unduly discourage
employment creation should be re-examined.
Fiscal deficits must be reduced over the medium term to generate higher
savings and investment, particularly in the light of the costs of pensions
and welfare for ageing populations.
Free trade should be encouraged with the completion of the Gatt trade
liberalisation talks. The ageing of populations in the G7 countries will
require measures to control medical costs, public pensions and other welfare
programmes. Labour market reforms to promote work by older workers will also
be needed to improve the incomes of the elderly.
Better control over healthcare costs is needed through direct government
control over fees paid to hospitals or budget systems which limit overall
outlays. The report is cautious about the benefits of financial
deregulation. It says this should continue because it has benefited
consumers, but policies should also address the risk that deregulation will
increase consumer indebtedness and cause wild swings in share and land
prices.
Efforts are urged to reduce subsidies, particularly for producers of traded
goods and in export credit systems must be intensified.
On the environment it calls for the implementation of decisions taken at the
Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit last summer.

THE Quad statement on market-opening measures for services makes clear that
in this key area of the Uruguay Round negotiations the most contentious
issues remain unresolved.
In particular, the US has not given ground on maritime services - which it
wants to exempt from commitments granting equal access to allcomers. Nor
have the US and the European Community yet found a way of resolving their
differences over audio-visual services, where the EC is seeking exemptions
on 'cultural' grounds.
In both areas the Quad statement says merely that 'we will continue to work
toward satisfactory solutions'. This is bound to disappoint many countries
taking part in the world trade talks in Geneva, notably the Nordic nations
and others with important shipping interests.
Elsewhere, the Quad participants report 'progress' in liberalising financial
services, where Japan's banking, insurance and securities markets have been
a target for both the US and EC.
However, the statement adds, in an implied reference to east Asian countries
such as South Korea and Singapore, that the four are seeking 'a greater
level of commitment from other participants'.
In basic telecommunications, the Quad nations have drawn up a 'common
detailed agenda' for multilateral liberalisation talks involving big
suppliers and customers.
The talks will begin as soon as possible.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Biggest impact will be in Japanese market
</HEADLINE>

THE Scotch whisky industry reacted with cautious satisfaction to the news
that the four Quad members - Japan, the US, the EC and Canada - are to
abolish tariff barriers to imports of spirits. For whisky producers the
market most affected will be Japan, where high import duties are levied.
There was caution because the removal of import duties appears to depend on
the entire Uruguay Round being concluded. Furthermore, the whisky industry
is still trying to persuade Japan to end its discriminatory regime on taxing
whisky, which is seen as a much bigger impediment to whisky exports than
import duties.
The effect of the abolition of import duties will also be felt in the US and
Canadian export markets, but duties in these countries are moderate compared
with those in Japan. French brandy is another EC product that will benefit.
'This is potentially very good news,' the Scotch Whisky Association said
yesterday. 'It is something we have always sought.'
Exports of Scotch whisky to Japan totalled Pounds 178m in 1992, amounting to
18.56m litres. Each litre pays about Pounds 1 in import duty.
On liquor tax, Japan has been urged to comply fully with a Gatt ruling of
1987 which said the liquor taxation system discriminated against imports.
Tax on whisky and brandy is nearly Pounds 6 a litre but only 50p on high
quality Japanese shochu, a potato-based liquor.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Kantor puts on the kid gloves to appease US
industrial lobby - Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE sectors like pharmaceuticals, steel and spirits were raised
specifically in the Quad report to G7 leaders, textiles concessions were
handled with kid gloves by Mr Mickey Kantor - in deference to powerful
industrial lobbying in the US.
The word 'textiles' does not appear in the text of the report. It simply
refers to sectors in which tariffs are higher than 15 per cent, and says 'we
will negotiate the maximum achievable package of tariff reductions,
recognising the objective of reaching 50 per cent reductions' - as long as
other countries 'provide effective market access through tariff reductions
and appropriate non-tariff disciplines'.
Behind the coded language this is a clear signal to developing countries -
in particular China and Taiwan which at present fall outside Gatt
disciplines - that a deal on textiles will only be delivered finally when
multilateral negotiations in Geneva during autumn coax market opening
gestures from them.
Lobbyists for the US textile industry have clung increasingly firmly to
their tariff protection as they have begun to come to terms with planned
reform of the Multifibre Arrangement, under which quotas will be phased out
over a 10-year period.
In a letter to Senator Ernest Hollings, the leading protector of textile
interests, Mr Kantor promised not to negotiate a deal that failed to provide
US access to developing country markets for fibres, textiles and apparel.
'We understand the importance of insisting that those who benefit from the
phase-out of the Multifibre Arrangement must also be willing to open their
domestic markets,' he said.
Thus the US was constrained in making detailed textiles concessions in the
Tokyo talks (and so, incidentally was unable to press hard for gains the US
electronics industrywanted). In electronics, the negotiators agreed only
tariff cuts of at least a third and possibly a half.
Mr Michael Maibach, government affairs director for Intel, the computer
company, said he was 'disappointed' but not ready to abandon the zero-zero
tariff concept. He was heartened by the possibility of tariff elimination
for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which the EC industry does not
oppose.

FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Companies welcome export opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proposed abolition or lowering of tariffs was welcomed in most sectors
of British industry yesterday.
Makers of drugs, textiles and construction equipment said it could lead to
higher exports and profits. The beer industry, however, warned it could mean
unfair competition.
A producer of construction equipment said: 'This gives us room to increase
our profit margins or sell 10 per cent more in the US.'
Textile industry officials pointed out that the UK has no tariffs on
textiles above 15 per cent, whereas US tariffs on UK goods range above 40
per cent. An official said 'halving such tariffs would provide significant
export opportunities'.
The pharmaceuticals industry welcomed the move. Some medicines are subject
to tariffs of about 5 per cent into both the EC and the US. The UK exported
Pounds 324m of drugs to the US last year, compared with American imports
worth Pounds 121m.
Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest chemical producer, said the
progress was encouraging but begged a lot of questions.
The company pointed out that many British companies already had operations
in North America and Japan, and would therefore not benefit directly from
the reduction in tariffs.
The steel industry was equally cautious, noting that any elimination of
tariffs in steel would be subject to a Multilateral Steel Agreement, which
is still under negotiation.
However, British Steel, which wants the MSA to eliminate subsidies to steel
producers and encourage free trade, said yesterday's announcement meant the
MSA was now linked to the Gatt talks more closely than before.
The UK Brewers' Society said the abolition of tariffs on beer could expose
EC brewers to unfair competition. This was because EC producers had to pay
the price for barley set under the EC's common agricultural policy.
Non-EC brewers were free to buy barley cheaply on the world market.

In basic telecommunications, the Quad nations have drawn up a 'common

The talks, to begin 'as soon as possible', would be conducted within the
framework of the draft General Agreement on Trade in Services, part of the
Uruguay Round package, but would extend beyond December when the Round
proper is due to conclude.
Negotiations on a sectoral market-opening accord for telecommunications were
tentatively agreed by the dozen or so countries involved last year but
procedural difficulties remain. These include how to handle
telecommunications in countries' services liberalisation schedules which,
like their complete tariff schedules, will be an integral component of the
final Uruguay Round agreement.
Some 60 countries (the EC counting as one), have made services offers.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Mackay to advertise for judges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANTED: judge to sit on northern circuit. Must be prepared to travel and
accept substantial drop in earnings. Knowledge of the law an advantage.
Preferred age 45-55. The Lord Chancellor is an equal opportunities employer.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, finally bowed to pressure last night in
agreeing to end the secrecy in England's judicial appointments system by
advertising judges' jobs and holding open competitions for specific judicial
posts.
Speaking to a packed house of his judicial brethren at the lord mayor's
annual judges' dinner, Lord Mackay said he still believed he was the best
person to make judicial appointments but, having consulted senior
colleagues, he had decided changes were needed.
His announcement follows complaints from Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief
Justice, of a serious shortage of High Court judges which resulted in the
appointment of an extra 10 in March.
Lord Mackay said he would be putting machinery in place to help in
forecasting the numbers of judges and the expertise required at different
levels.
Specific job descriptions would be drawn up detailing the work involved and
the qualities required. Initially, only jobs up to circuit judge level would
be advertised, but if this experiment worked, the Lord Chancellor would
consider extending it to senior judicial posts.
Lord Mackay said he was anxious to see if there were further measures he
could take to encourage applications by female, black and Asian lawyers.
He would also explore the scope for involving non-lawyers in the selection
process. Lay people with experience in the justice system might be asked to
sit on interview panels.
Lord Williams of Mostyn QC, Labour's legal affairs spokesman in the Lords,
who last year called the current judicial appointments system 'bizarre and
farcical', said he was delighted Lord Mackay had finally seen the force of
the argument for a more open system.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Tariff deal hailed as breakthrough: Trade agreement puts
pressure on Gatt negotiators to restart stalled Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S leading industrial nations yesterday agreed a potentially
far-reaching tariff-cutting deal which could revive the long stalled Uruguay
Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Before leaders of the Group of Seven countries began the 19th economic
summit in Tokyo, top level trade negotiators delivered the long sought after
draft agreement to expand market access for manufactured products.
US president Bill Clinton hailed the agreement, reached by ministers from
the 'Quad' group of countries - the US, the European Community, Japan and
Canada - as 'good news for America and good news for the world'. It meant
'more jobs and higher incomes for our people'.
Mr John Major, prime minister, said the agreement was 'infinitely bigger
than anything we have seen before', while US officials predicted as many as
2m jobs could be created worldwide as a result of the trade deal. British
officials estimated it could produce as many as 400,000 jobs in the UK over
a 13-year period.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, said yesterday was 'an exciting
day for world trade and good news for the world economy' and hailed the
agreement as a 'breakthrough'.
However, he pointed out that the market access agreement would have to be
approved by the membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
that many other issues, such as agriculture, had to be resolved if the
Uruguay Round negotiations were to be completed as hoped by the end of the
year.
Yesterday's agreement proposes:
The elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers for eight categories of
manufactured products.
The harmonisation of tariffs on chemical products at low rates.
Tariff cuts of up to 50 per cent where existing tariffs exceed 15 per cent.
Negotiation of tariff cuts averaging at least one third on other products,
with the possibility of cuts of more than 50 per cent on some items.
There was also an agreement to progress to greater trade liberalisation in
the services sector, particularly financial services and basic
telecommunications.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, claimed the Quad pact was the
'biggest tariff-cutting agreement in history'. Mr Major said 80 to 90 per
cent of the proposed Uruguay Round agreement was now in place.
The summit of G7 countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy
and Canada - is expected to support yesterday's agreement, which will be
presented to Gatt negotiators next Monday. Mr Major said the effect of this
week's summit would be to put huge pressure on Gatt negotiators to reach a
successful conclusion to the trade talks.
The pact was given a generally favourable reception by the French
government, which is holding up agreement on the liberalisation of farm
trade. French officials said the government reacted 'prudently, but
positively, to the news'.
The US and Britain were quick to claim that Mr Clinton and Mr Major deserved
the credit for the successful conclusion of the deal - claims that came as a
surprise to at least one of the participants in the long-drawn-out talks.
The US and EC agreed the breakthrough would not have been possible without a
special effort by Japan, which surprised other Quad members by agreeing to
eliminate tariffs on spirits.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, was enjoying the plaudits
of his G7 trading partners, but he received a reminder that tariff cuts are
not popular at home as the Japan Spirits and Liquor Makers' Association said
it 'deeply regretted' Japan's contribution.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Finance ministers warn of crisis in jobs and growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S leading economies face a long-term crisis of slow growth and
rising unemployment which will not be solved by macro-economic policies or
by deregulation to free up markets, according to a report which was agreed
yesterday by the finance ministers from the G7 countries.
The report says that the G7 economies need greater wage flexibility and more
active labour market policies for training as well as changes to national
social insurance schemes which discourage job creation. The high cost of
healthcare and the ageing of most populations means stronger control over
health spending will be required along with greater competition in the
provision of medical services to reduce costs.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said each G7 country had to take
unpopular but necessary steps to keep in check growing social security
budgets.
He said Britain's social security spending was rising at 3 per cent per year
in real terms after a sevenfold increase since 1945. He warned that this
growth was structural, the product of Britain's ageing population and
widening entitlements to benefits.
By the year 2030, for every 10 pensioners there would be only 24 people of
working age, compared with 34 today. The confidential report, which will be
discussed by the G7 heads of state later today, suggests the G7 economies
are facing structural obstacles which have undermined their long-term
potential for growth.
It calls on the G7 to build on macro-economic policies by co-operating to
tackle common issues such as high healthcare costs and policies to promote
training.
Unlike previous G7 statements on structural issues, the manifesto for
structural reform does not simply call for deregulation to free up markets.
In a marked change of tone, which reflects the involvement of the Clinton
administration, the manifesto casts doubt on the benefits of financial
deregulation and argues for more active public policies, particularly in the
field of education and training.
The need to reduce unemployment was the main issue discussed yesterday by
the heads of state and finance ministers in their afternoon meetings. Japan,
as the G7 summit host, has argued that to head off mounting protectionism
pressures bred by high unemployment, structural reforms are vital to revive
growth.
The approach is also likely to win backing from US president Bill Clinton
who has called for an international ministerial meeting on employment
creation.
The report will form the core of the economic declaration to be adopted at
the summit today.

Eleven people, including an American and an Englishman, were injured during
the first bull running of the San Fermin fiesta in Pamplona, northern Spain.
Six fighting bulls stormed through the streets of the city in what long-time
Pamplona watchers called a particularly dangerous run in the nine-day
festival, which has been held almost continuously since 1591 and was made
famous by Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel, The Sun Also Rises. The bulls that
make the morning run fight and die in the evening bullfight. Tens of
thousands of Spaniards and foreign visitors are expected at the eight bull
runs.

FT  08 JUL 93 / British Gas admits pipeline price rises may be too high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS admitted yesterday that it could have got its pipeline charges
wrong and withdrew increases of up to 30 per cent proposed only a month ago.
The admission marks a spectacular U-turn for the company just three weeks
before the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is due to report on the future
of the UK gas industry.
British Gas recently defended the price rises, which ranged from 2 per cent
to 30 per cent and were to be levied on rival suppliers which send gas
through the group's pipelines to industrial customers.
The change of tone has been seen as evidence by some industry observers that
the company is worried about the commission's likely verdict on the gas
industry. The commission could suggest British Gas lose its monopoly over
household gas supply and propose that the group hive off its pipeline
operations. The commission is also due to recommend a rate of return on the
pipeline operations which will affect charges.
The government, which must decide whether to implement any of the
commission's recommendations, is believed to favour the introduction of
competition unless there are very strong arguments against.
It also wants British Gas to make the links between its pipelines division
and its marketing operations clearer. This could be achieved by dividing
them into distinct subsidiaries within the group or by setting them up as
separate concerns.
British Gas said yesterday that it would delay the implementation of the
proposed price rises until October next year while it examines the potential
for cutting them.
Mr Harry Moulson, who takes over next Tuesday as managing director of
British Gas's transportation business, said the group was responding to
pressure from rivals. 'I looked at these price increases and said I don't
believe I can live and fight in this marketplace on this basis,' he said.
He said British Gas would talk with rival suppliers, after which it could
revise the proposed rises. However, it will go ahead with an increase in
October of 3.5 per cent, which is based on inflation and other
considerations.
Mr Norman Ellis, managing director at Kinetica, one of British Gas's main
rivals, said: 'The increases are completely unacceptable whether they are
implemented now or later.' Mr Ellis has made a formal complaint about the
charges to Ofgas, the industry regulator which has challenged the basis of
the price increases and asked the group to justify them.
British Gas said it would publish additional information on its cost base to
justify the price rises.

FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Field at premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Field Group, the packaging company, made a very impressive market debut. The
shares were offered for sale at 250p a share and more than seven times
oversubscribed.
The stock began trading at 276p, with buyers moving in and pushing the
volume up to 13m. It was the market's third most heavily traded stock
yesterday. The shares ended the day at 279p.
Field's warm reception had been expected. According to one trader, a premium
of 10 per cent on the offer price had been anticipated, while it closed just
short of a 12 per cent premium. 'There is a healthy demand for well-managed
companies such as this,' said the trader.
The company is the leader in the paper/packaging market and was part of a
Reedpack management buy-out in 1988 and underwent a second MBO two years ago
from SCA. The company intends to complete a Pounds 6m acquisition soon.
Policy Portfolio, a marketmaker in second-hand endowment policies, joined
the market with a placing of 3.6m shares at 130p. It began trading at 143p
and ended the day 3 down at 140p.
Sun Alliance was the best performer in the composite insurance sector, with
the market increasingly suspicious that Transatlantic, the insurance group
owned jointly by Liberty Life, of South Africa, and UAP, of France, may have
been quietly adding to its 3.01 per cent stake in the UK group. The shares
moved up 7 to 360p.
Transatlantic revealed what is described as a 'strategic' stake in Sun early
last month, triggering a rush of specula-tive buying in Sun shares, although
some analysts dismissed talk of imminent bid moves as premature.
Dealers said there had been persistent support for the stock yesterday, with
turnover reaching 1.9m shares, the highest single day's activity since the
middle of June.
Any increase of a percentage point or more above the 3 per cent level has to
be notified to the Stock Exchange.
Big exceptional provisions, largely against a US subsidiary, took the shine
off Dixons' results and the shares fell 15 to 195p in exceptionally heavy
turnover of 10m, the second largest in three years.
The restructuring charges set against Silo confirmed the worst fears of many
in the market. 'Dixons should cut and run on Silo,' said one disgruntled
analyst. While the UK business was holding up well, stores specialists said
Dixons' determination to put the business to rights will probably continue
to overhang the shares for several months.
Strong two-way business in Forte was prompted by a downgrade and reinforced
negative stance from NatWest Securities. The broker cited discounts being
offered by the hotel group in its business class hotels as evidence that
discounting was more widespread than was previously thought.
The shares, which have enjoyed a good run in recent weeks, initially dropped
on the news, but recovered as investors continued to believe the recovery
story. The stock closed unchanged at 226p after a hefty turnover of 11m
shares.
A 'take profits' recommendation issued by Kleinwort Benson Securities on the
insurance broking leaders upset companies such as Sedgwick and Willis
Corroon.
Ms Julianne Jessup, Kleinwort's analyst, highlighted the strong
outperformance of the stocks over the past three months and recommended a
switch into the smaller broking issues. Willis lost 7 at 217p and Sedgwick 4
at 196p.
International trading group Lonrho, which earlier this week appointed James
Capel as its joint broker with Strauss Turnbull, added 3 1/2 at 129 1/2 p on
talk of an imminent disposal.
Inchcape shed 12 1/2 to 545p, with Robert Fleming said to have turned
cautious on the stock. Further reflection on the recent restructuring plans
benefited Rothmans International, sending the stock forward 15 to 669p.
Sellers of Chubb Security, notably of a line of 6m at 300p, brought volume
to 11m as the shares dipped 3 to 310p.
Shares in British Aerospace recovered from an early retreat after the
release of a government study supporting its proposed regional jets joint
venture in Taiwan.
The stock declined last week on fears that the deal signed early this year
may have to be aborted due to a lack of funding. One analyst said: 'This
will be good news if it means the joint venture can now go ahead, otherwise
the regional jets division faces closure.'
Sentiment yesterday was also boosted by talk that Airbus Industrie, in which
BAe has a 20 per cent stake, was about to win a lucrative order for 44
Airbus aircraft. BAe shares closed 7 up at 399p after trade of 2m.
The big sell note from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken on Rolls-Royce continued to
exact a heavy toll on the stock and the shares relinquished 3 to 138p as
volume rose to 3.8m.
British Steel was the subject of a tax-related 'bed and breakfast' deal
which brought total turnover in the stock to 29m shares, including a block
of around 9m. The shares hardened 2 1/2 to 91p, with a leading US securities
house said to have recommended the stock.
Fears that the Vickers subsidiary Rolls-Royce Motor Cars will not break even
this year as expected, due to poor car sales, brought an early slide in the
shares. At the day's worst, Vickers was down 9 at 140p, before bargain
hunters helped to trim the decline. The shares were finally 4 off at 145p.
A squeeze in VSEL following an agency cross of around 100,000 shares at 845p
left the stock 20 stronger at 830p.
Bank of Ireland weakened 9 to 241p after announcing a one-for-six rights
issue that is intended to raise IPounds 100m. The bank said it would use the
funds to strengthen its capital base.

DAEWOO Electronics, South Korea's third-largest consumer electronics
manufacturer, yesterday reported a 25 per cent rise in net profits, to
Won14bn (Dollars 17.5m) during the first half of 1993, on the back of brisk
domestic sales, writes John Burton in Seoul.
Sales grew 15 per cent to Won997bn, including a 17 per cent rise in domestic
sales to Won425bn. In the Korean market, sales of microwave ovens were up 58
per cent; washing machines 28 per cent; and televisions 17 per cent.
Exports, which rose 13 per cent to Won572bn, were bolstered by the Korean
won's depreciation against the Japanese yen. Microwave ovens, washing
machines and refrigerators all posted growth above 30 per cent in foreign
markets.
Daewoo also announced it had acquired for Dollars 1.4m an audio production
facility in the Chinese province of Shandong which it had leased since last
August. The facility has capacity to produce 50,000 sets of cassette
stereos, CD players and headphones annually.
The company plans to transfer the production of cheap audio products from
South Korea to the Shandong plant to take advantage of low labour costs.

<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, has placed the
long-term debt ratings of two leading Japanese heavy electronics makers
under review for possible downgrading.
Moody's said it was reviewing the Aa3 ratings of Toshiba and its
subsidiaries, Toshiba America and Toshiba International Finance. Also under
review are Mitsubishi Electric, and offshoots Mitsubishi Electric Finance UK
and Mitsubishi Electric Finance America.
Japanese electronics makers have been hurt by the prolonged weakness of
consumer demand and sluggish capital spending by companies. Depreciation
costs from heavy capital expenditure during the late 1980s are also
squeezing the industry's profits.
Responding to the announcement, Toshiba said it expected improved earnings
for the year to next March. It based its hopes on a recovery in the US
computer industry, and the Japanese government's emergency economic package.
The agency said it would focus on both Mitsubishi and Toshiba's ability to
improve profit margins and cash flow of weak sectors, as well as debt
reduction and efforts to cope with the strengthening yen.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Canadian combination creates new
CDollars 20bn unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S financial services deregulation, coupled with the long recession
and rising competition, have forced the big Desjardins credit union movement
to consolidate with the publicly-held Laurentian Group.
Together, the newly-formed group will have corporate assets of around
CDollars 20bn (USDollars 15.6bn) and a further CDollars 50bn under
administration through its subsidiaries. It will rank as Canada's fifth or
sixth biggest financial services conglomerate, including units in banking,
trust services, life insurance and mortgages.
Desjardins will have majority control of the new Desjardins Laurentian
Financial Corp, taking in the financial services units of both groups.
However, Laurentian General, a property and casualty insurer, is excepted
from the deal. Laurentian Group's 50 per cent holding in this unit is being
sold to its partner, La Victoire of France, for an undisclosed sum. The
French company paid about CDollars 50m for its 50 per cent share in 1990.
Both Mr Claude Beland, head of Desjardins, and Mr Jacques Droin, chairman of
Laurentian, said the consolidation had been dictated by the heightened
competition resulting from globalisation of financial markets.
Laurentian had been seeking a strategic partner for more than a year, partly
to inject new capital in its life and general insurance unit. It negotiated
with several Canadian institutions. Desjardins operates 1,500 banking units,
mainly in Quebec, while Laurentian Bank operates in both Quebec and Ontario.
The two main life insurance subsidiaries of Desjardins and Laurentian will
be merged, although this arrangement excludes Imperial Life in Toronto.
Laurentian Group minority shareholders will receive a combination of cash
and common shares of Desjardins Laurentian Financial.

FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Molson chief optimistic on
first-quarter result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOLSON, the diversified Canadian brewing group, said beer profits this year
would be hit by the slow economic recovery in North America and price wars.
The group's special chemicals, retailing and entertainment operations,
however, should do better.
'Our first quarter ended June 30 will equal or better the year earlier
level, when profits were CDollars 38.4m (USDollars 29.9m), or 66 cents a
share, on sales of CDollars 799m,' Mr Marshall Cohen, president, told the
annual meeting.
For the full fiscal year, Molson should improve on its fiscal 1993
performance, he added, when final net profit was CDollars 164.7m, or Dollars
2.76 a share, on revenues of CDollars 3.08bn.
Molson, Canada's biggest brewer, last year abandoned efforts to develop a US
market on its own and concluded a CDollars 350m deal with Miller, the
brewing arm of Philip Morris of the US.
Miller bought the US marketing and distribution rights for the Molson brand,
aiming for a US market share of 2.5 per cent in five years, up from the
current 1 per cent.
Molson Breweries is 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's of
Australia, and 20 per cent by Miller. Mr Cohen said it would take between
five and seven years for the full benefit of the Miller deal to offset
Molson's smaller share in its international brewing business.
He said that Diversey, Molson's international cleaning chemicals subsidiary,
had overcome problems with integrating Du Bois Chemicals in the US.
However, European, Asian and Latin American operations were doing well and
Diversey overall now contributed more revenue than the brewing business.
'Diversey can be Molson's most profitable business and yet develop strong
competitive positions in all its markets,' Mr Cohen said. 'We see an
improvement in the US operations in the second half this year.'
Molson is speeding up its five-year programme to build 28 large hardware
stores in Canadian cities after two pilot units had exceeded expectations.
Older hardware stores are being rationalised and overall retail results are
improving.
Molson also owns the Montreal Canadians ice hockey team which won the 1993
National League Stanley Cup, and the sports and entertainment outlook is
favourable.
Mr Cohen said the group's new strategy and improving performance should be
reflected in Molson's share price.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Raglan Property to consolidate shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RAGLAN PROPERTY Trust, the property investor and developer, is proposing to
consolidate its share capital in line with intentions expressed at the time
of the capital restructuring announced in March.
As then indicated, the aim is to reduce the spread between the bid and offer
price as a proportion of the share price.
The proposed consolidation is on the basis of 1-for-25 existing 1p shares.
A consequence will be that shareholders with fewer than 25 shares in the
company will cease to be shareholders. As these represent only 0.01 per cent
of the company's capital but a significant proportion of the number of
shareholders, Raglan expects to make net savings in ongoing administration
costs.
There will be a a scrip issue of warrants to subscribe for new shares on the
basis of one warrant for every 10 new shares held. They will enable the
holder to subscribe for new shares at 30p per share at any time up to
December 31 1995. It is expected that trading in the new shares and warrants
will begin on August 2.
Following the warrants issue and assuming full exercise, Landswell Holdings,
Century City International, Mr Keith Holman and Mr Alan Fosler, deemed to be
acting in concert, will hold about 11.1m new shares, representing 33.6 per
cent of the enlarged issued capital.
An extraordinary meeting on April 15 agreed to waive any requirement that
any member of the concert party should make a general offer to shareholders.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare to raise Pounds 33m for nursing
homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRESTACARE is raising Pounds 33.3m through a placing to finance acquisitions
in its core nursing homes business. The group, where Mr Andrew Taee was
appointed chief executive in March, also announced yesterday the sale of
some of its non-core properties and the appointment of a new chairman.
Mr Brian O'Connor is retiring as chairman, having, Mr Taee said, been the
architect of CrestaCare's new strategy. Mr Graeme Hart, deputy chairman, is
stepping up.
The placing and two acquisitions announced yesterday, totalling Pounds
15.1m, are subject to approval at a special meeting of shareholders on July
30. The placing is at 40p and the shares rose 2p to close at 45p yesterday.
Mr Taee said further acquisitions were under negotiation but that
shareholders would not be asked to put up more new equity.
CrestaCare said that since the introduction of the Care in the Community Act
in April it had held occupancy rates above 90 per cent. Downward pressure on
fee rates was offset by an increasing proportion of privately funded
residents.
Yesterday's acquisitions are of two businesses, each operating four nursing
homes. Together they have 515 beds and made an operating profit of Pounds
2.57m in the year to end-March. CrestaCare is paying Pounds 14.1m in cash
and the balance through the issue of 2.375m shares.
The vendors in both cases will continue to develop new homes for CrestaCare
to its specifications. It will only take these homes on to its balance sheet
when they are fully built and reach a certain occupancy level.
As well as the shares issued to the vendors, the placing involves 83.23m
shares, with investors able to clawback shares on a 1-for-1 basis. It will
raise Pounds 31.6m net of expenses.
Directors are taking up their entitlement under the placing. As well as
doubling his stake of 333,000 shares, Mr Hart is acting as a placee for a
further 2m shares.
Of the placing proceeds, Pounds 7m will go to buying four homes which
CrestaCare currently leases. Three are leased from Grosvenor House Group in
which Mr Taee has a 10 per cent stake. Mr Taee said that after the placing
net debt would be about Pounds 8m.
In its last accounts CrestaCare had properties for sale with written down
values of Pounds 9.4m. All but Pounds 2.8m of these have been sold, although
there has been a Pounds 1m loss on the sales.

FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dixons counts the cost of Silo closures:
With competition hotting up analysts remain sceptical about formula for
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUTATION of the US as the graveyard for UK retailers' ambitions looks
set to continue after Dixons' announcement yesterday of increasing losses
and higher-than-expected closure provisions at Silo, its US offshoot.
When Dixons acquired Philadelphia-based Silo in 1987 for Dollars 320m (then
about Pounds 200m) it was one of four rapidly-growing 'power retailers',
specialist superstore chains which were making substantial inroads into a
Dollars 40bn electrical goods market long dominated by independent traders
and department stores.
However, the US then went into recession and Silo, which had over-expanded,
found itself unable to compete with powerful rivals such as Circuit City and
Best Buy.
Silo's losses increased this year from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 22.4m, and
Dixons' group pre-tax profits were further depressed by Pounds 36.2m of
exceptional costs for closing 56 Silo stores.
One analyst, otherwise positive about Dixons' prospects, recently parodied
the poet Sir John Betjeman, urging 'Come friendly bombs and fall on Silo.'
Dixons has been struggling hard to inject its own skills in buying, systems,
management and customer service into the chain, but has little to show for
its efforts.
It did, however, claim many markets showed an improvement in sales last
year, with the overall results being dragged down by falls in sales in its
largest markets, especially California.
In the past year it has taken more aggressive steps. In February, it
replaced Mr Robert Sirkis, Silo's American president, with Mr Peter Morris,
previously Dixons' group property director.
That move came only weeks after Dixons announced the closure of 45 stores -
nearly a fifth of the total - in Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, Kansas,
Missouri, Kentucky and Oklahoma. They accounted for 37 per cent of Silo's
markets but only 11 per cent of sales.
It has since closed a further five stores, and 11 more will go in the coming
year.
The recovery plan now has three main elements. One is revamping existing
stores, doubling the space given to the computer/home office departments.
In-store product service departments are being added to many stores, as are
car radio and alarm fitting bays.
The second element is closing many of the smaller, poorly-located stores,
and replacing them with new superstores, of between 20,000 and 30,000 sq ft,
parallelling what Dixons is doing successfully with its Currys chain in the
UK.
That would mean the chain gradually shrinking from its current 185 stores.
Thirdly, Silo is experimenting with new formats to form the basis of that
superstore expansion.
Four stores in Rochester, New York State, have been refurbished and renamed
YES - Your Electronics Store.
As the name suggests, the stores concentrate heavily on electronics, and
white goods have been dropped. New brands have been added to Silo's usual
range to add 'authority'.
Silo is experimenting with a second store revamp formula in Chicago,
although the name has not been changed, and white goods are retained.
Dixons said it wants to give the reforms at least until early next year
before assessing their success. But analysts remain sceptical about Dixons'
chances, especially with competition increasing in its biggest California
and Chicago markets.
Mr John Clare, managing director, said underlying improvements so far have
convinced Dixons that it can turn Silo around 'over time'.
'But we well understand that we cannot continue as a company to see a
situation where Silo makes significant losses year after year.'
Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates the cost of
closing Silo at a prohibitive Pounds 150m. But if there are no signs of
improvement before the half-year results in January, he suggests 'major
surgery' may be necessary.
Dixons, he said, may eventually have no alternative but to make a 'slow,
miserable retreat'.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Maxwell assets return 'unlikely'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAXWELL pension funds are unlikely to receive full restitution of the assets
stolen by Robert Maxwell, MPs were told yesterday by Mr Andrew Large,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.
He told the Commons social security committee that full restitution for
Maxwell pensioners was a worthy goal, but one that would be very difficult
to achieve.
'We don't know whether total restitution is needed for pensioners to enjoy
the benefits to which they are entitled,' said Mr Large. He added that SIB -
the organisation which oversees regulatory bodies for the financial services
industry - was doing everything it could to maximise restitution.
Asked whether he thought - with only Pounds 100m of the Pounds 440m stolen
from the fund still untraced or in disputed ownership - the time had come
for financial institutions to get together to reach a settlement, Mr Large
said he thought that would be 'extremely difficult'.
Reporting to MPs on the structure of self-regulatory organisations, Mr Large
said there was a strong case for having three bodies - with the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), watchdog for the fund management
industry, retaining its independence.
He said SIB would publish the criteria it intended to use in exercising its
power to ban individuals from the financial services industry under Section
59 of the Financial Services Act 'within the next month or so'. It was a
draconian power that needed to be used fairly but firmly.
A review of Imro's admission procedures had been undertaken, with monitoring
arrangements scrutinised.
Resources allocated to monitoring had been increased, with the number of
staff raised from about 35 to 50.

FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (9): Tight timetable for sale of OTE - Anne
Counsell monitors progress of the privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fate of Greece's privatisation programme will be sealed in the coming
weeks. Success or failure largely rests on the strategic sale and subsequent
partial flotation of OTE, the state-owned telecommunications corporation.
'It is crucial,' says Mr Stefanos Manos, the minister of national economy
and driving force behind the government's sell-off of public enterprises. He
remains confident that the equity sale will be a success and, perhaps as
important, that it will be on schedule.
The timetable is very tight. An election is due before April next year,
possibly earlier. The Socialist opposition, widely tipped to win, has
vehemently opposed New Democracy's privatisation programme and has pledged
to halt and even reverse the sell-offs.
The government has taken steps to maintain the support of pro-privatisation
MPs during the summer session of parliament to push through enabling
legislation for the privatisation programme as well as the charter and
licence for OTE. The sale of a 35 per cent strategic stake in the company is
expected by early September with an initial public offering (IPO) in
November.
France Telecom, GTE of the US, NTT, Stet, Korea Telecom and Telefonica have
been shortlisted to bid for the strategic stake prior to the equity offering
of 14 per cent, valued at around Dr90bn, the largest so far in Greece. The
flotation structure is 5 per cent to domestic investors, 5 per cent as an
international tranche and the remaining 4 per cent will be offered at a
discount to OTE's 27,000 employees and 13,000 pensioners.
International advisers and analysts swell the ranks of the already
well-staffed government offices. Credit Suisse First Boston and J. Henry
Schroder Wagg have been appointed joint international lead managers while
the international accountancy firm Arthur Andersen is winding up a complete
audit of OTE. At the Athens Stock Exchange, Coopers and Lybrand are checking
the trading system as concern has been voiced over whether the market can
absorb such a large issue.
There is considerable bustle, tinged with urgency, as the preparations
continue apace. The prospectus is expected to be in draft form by August,
radio advertising is underway and a television campaign will start this
month.
Analysts view the OTE strategic sale and IPO as not only vital to Greece's
international credibility but also a potential turning point for the entire
privatisation programme. The government is fighting for the hearts and minds
of a population long accustomed to the state provision of jobs in public
sector corporations.
Patronage appointments and the use of the public sector as a cushion against
unemployment are viewed as a duty of the state and the monopolistic utility
corporations as state assets. This attitude extends to suppliers and
contractors who enjoy cosy relationships with public sector managers, to
trade unions worried about job losses and to senior politicians concerned
about the political cost of privatisation.
The unwieldy nature of the public sector and opposition from within the
ranks of the government have not helped the privatisation process. Its
presentation and image have also been tarnished by allegations that some
smaller companies were sold on favourable terms to businessmen and by the
somewhat patchy success of some larger sell-offs such as shipyards.
The process of unbundling state involvement in all aspects of the economy
began in 1990 when more than 60 per cent of Greece's GNP was generated by
the public sector. The government created the Industrial Reorganisation
Organisation (IRO) to liquidate or sell some 60 enterprises, many of these
moribund, on its books. Many were liquidated through accelerated procedures
and of the 27 companies in operation, the IRO now has three remaining - the
Kerafina ceramics company, Athens Paper Mill and Larco, the nickel mining
company. The Dollars 200m subsidy to maintain IRO companies has been
eliminated and proceeds from the liquidations are keeping the IRO running.
Privatisation sales in 1991 and 1992 amounted to almost Dr200bn, of which
Dr124bn came from the sale of the Aget Heracles cement company to
Calcestruzzi, a subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group. The sale has been
clouded by allegations that Calcestruzzi officials were involved in the
payment of kickbacks to Italian politicians.
Contractual difficulties have also contributed to slippages in the
privatisation timetable. The sale of a minority interest and management
rights in Greece's two largest oil refineries, Hellenic Aspropyrgos Refinery
(ELDA) and Hellenic Fuel and Mineral Oil (EKO), were delayed over the
appointment of international advisers. The offering memorandum is now
expected in October and lists of potential investors are being drawn up for
one or both partial buy-outs, expected to raise up to Dollars 1bn.
A continuing stand-off between the government and managers at the
state-owned Public Power Corporation (Deh) illustrates the depth of
opposition over private sector involvement in utilities and the managements'
ability to obstruct tender procedures. Deh maintains it can produce power
more cheaply than private operators and wants to maintain control of its own
development programmes whereas the government insists that Deh's debts are
too high to finance new power stations. Asking the Deh management to
co-operate with a private partner under build-operate transfer (BOT)
financing is 'akin to asking a man to chop off his own hand,' commented one
analyst. 'Of course, they declined.'
The retendering process for the 600MW Lavrion gas-fired power station is due
to start in mid-summer as part of the recent spurt in the privatisation
programme. The partial sale of 20 per cent of the Hellenic Sugar Industry,
also slowed by management and union sabotage, is expected to be completed by
early summer.
A important sale of assests belonging to the state tourism association (EOT)
is also on the busy agenda for the summer parliament. Mr Athanassios
Zambaras, special adviser to the privatisation team, expects considerable
foreign interest, especially in packages combining the sale of a hotel with
a marina or casino.
About 50 hotels, most of them small, will be sold while marinas are to be
offered on long-term leases or as sites to private operators. In addition, a
new regulatory framework is being established for nine casinos in prime
tourist sites. More than 150 indications of interest have been received for
the first round of selection this month and the casino licences are due to
be awarded by early November. Licence revenues are estimated at Dr22bn.
Privatisation plans for Olympic Airways remain on the distant horizon
because of huge cumulative debts and non-performing loans estimated at more
than Dr200bn. A new chairman has been brought in from the US and auditors
are working on the balance sheet as part of the fix first, sell later
approach to the airline. Olympic, which posted an operational loss of
Dr13.2bn in 1992, requires either a debt write-off or substantial financial
restructuring, possibly both, before it can contemplate seeking a strategic
partner.
A somewhat overdue drive towards greater transparency in the privatisation
process may have come too late to overcome deep-seated prejudices and
opposition. More important, the potential benefits will not be immediately
obvious to the majority of voters before the election.

<TEXT>
TOYOTA MOTOR will find it even harder to achieve its parent company profit
target this year, according to Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president, Reuter reports
from Tokyo.
'We worked hard to meet our forecast of parent company current profit of
Y300bn (Dollars 2.76bn) for the year ended June 1993. It will be an even
tougher in 1993 - 94,' he said.
Toyota has lowered its forecast of domestic vehicle sales to 2.20 in
calendar 1993 from a December forecast of 2.32m, Mr Toyoda said. The company
sold 2.24m vehicles in Japan in 1992.
Domestic vehicle sales by Toyota in the first half of 1993 fell short of the
1.1m the company had forecast.
'We hope to achieve domestic sales of 2.20m vehicles in calendar 1993,
thanks to a big sales push in the second half,' Mr Toyoda said.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hamper side behind 14% rise at Farepak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farepak, the USM-traded mail order distributor and food processor, achieved
a 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.51m in the year to April
30.
Turnover rose 12 per cent to Pounds 70.5m. The Christmas hamper mail order
business lifted sales 15.5 per cent and the total number of agents rose 13
per cent to 55,000. This division provides the bulk of pre-tax profits.
The company was confident that its Pounds 8.5m investment in acquiring 20
year access to the mail order database of the Littlewoods Home Shopping
Group and the acquisition of the Littlewoods Hamper Business in April this
year meant that further strong growth was anticipated this year.
A final dividend of 4.1p brings the total to 5.75p (5p).

FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Granada active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada underlined its predatory intentions in the television sector with
another move into the market to pick up stock in London Weekend Television.
The catering to leisure group bought a further 4.5m preferred shares in LWT
at 500p each, taking its stake up to 19.99 per cent. The shares crept up a
penny to 483p. Granada slipped 4 to 417p.
Leisure and media analysts were sceptical over press reports that the two
groups were discussing a merger, particularly prior to the government's
expected pronouncements on the very subject, due by the end of the year.
Drugs issues Glaxo and Wellcome shrugged off recent weakness to register
sharp advances. Dealers said the corrections were underpinned by some keen
US buying, as well as a short position undertaken by one of the leading
London marketmakers. Glaxo advanced 14 1/2 to 561 1/2 p. Wellcome gained 13
at 658p.
Confirmation that international conglomerate Lonrho had appointed James
Capel as its joint broker with Strauss Turnbull was seen as another move
helping to elevate the stock to 'blue chip' status in the market. The shares
hardened 2 to 126p. Bargain hunters were seen for English China Clays,
boosting the stock 6 to 411p.
Barclays and National Westminster were the pick of a rather sluggish banking
sector, with both stocks responding to some aggressive buying in the traded
options market and lingering hopes of another cut in domestic interest
rates. Both share prices moved to within 10p of their all-time highs.
NatWest advanced 6 to 487p on turnover of 3m, while a similar figure was
traded in the options market. Barclays rose 4 to 481p on 1.6m dealt. Abbey
National was up 2 at 417p and TSB 3 at 193p.
The sale and subsequent purchase of a block of 2.2m Sedgwick shares failed
to unsettle the stock price, which closed only marginally easier at 200p.
A further rally in crude oil prices helped the oil sector stabilise after
the hefty losses of recent sessions.
The oil team at NatWest Securities said a move by the UN to allow the Iraqis
to sell around Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil, for humanitarian reasons and for
reparations to Kuwait, would entail the sale of 600,000 barrels of oil a
day. 'This is not enough to swamp the market by itself, but probably enough
to prevent prices rising in their normal seasonal pattern in the third
quarter,' said NatWest.
The broker told its clients to pick up oil issues with good recovery
prospects, notably British Petroleum, but warned of the exploration and
production sub-sector's vulnerability to weak crude prices.
BP touched 296p but eased back to close only a fraction ahead at 294p amid
talk of a number of profits downgrades in the pipeline, notably from BZW.
Shell Transport rallied 5 to 616p.
Burmah Castrol rose 6 to 708p, reflecting its wide exposure to the German
economy and hopes of further interest rate cuts in that country.
Among the oil minnows, New London shares closed 2 3/4 off at 5 3/4 p after
the proposed sale of its International Drilling Fluids business to
Schlumberger and the latter's proposed acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in
New London fell through.
Celsis, the medical equipment manufacturer, made an impressive debut in the
market, with its flotation via a placing and offer nearly four times
oversubscribed. The shares, issued at 100p, peaked at 117p before
profit-taking saw them close just a penny ahead at 101p; turnover was a
hefty 9.9m shares.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 9.5m and the shares shed a penny to 88 1/2
p as NatWest Securities reiterated its sell recommendation following a
meeting with the company.
Fears that the current UK defence cutbacks may eventually lead to the UK
government scaling down its order for the new Challenger tank hurt Vickers,
off 2 at 149p.
Westland Group, on the other hand, was cheered by reports that an order for
transport helicopters would not be subject to the proposed defence cuts. The
shares appreciated 7 to 221p.
GKN, which has a near 30 per cent stake in Westland, moved 7 ahead to 460p
on the same sentiment and news of an improvement in UK car sales. Lex also
benefited from the car news and rose 7 to 386p.
Suggestions that Saudi Arabia was about to place a substantial order for
Airbus aircraft, for which British Aerospace builds the wings and holds a 20
per cent stake in the company, boosted BAe. The shares closed 6 up at 392p.
BT performed strongly, finishing 8 higher at 426p with 5.6m shares traded,
after news that the company had received 5.2m registrations for the BT 3
share offer. Dealers said the shares were helped by strong support in the
traded options market, where the equivalent of a further 6.3m shares changed
hands.
Positive talk from Kleinwort Benson was said to have helped Boots shares
climb 6 to 433p. MFI improved 1 1/2 to 131 1/2 p in spite of being
downgraded by Goldman Sachs.

FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food stocks hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broker and institutional presentations by a number of food manufacturing
groups led to a welter of downgrades in the sector yesterday.
United Biscuits appeared to be the hardest hit as three profits downgrades
were reported by dealers following meetings in the City. BZW, Cazenove and
Hoare Govett were all said to have reduced their forecasts, with the blame
being attached to difficulties being encountered by UB in passing on rising
costs to the powerful food retailers. UB shares retreated 7 to 377p.
Unilever recovered from talk of a downgrade by SG Warburg to gain 5 at
1005p. Hillsdown's forecasts were also reported to be under review by a
number of houses. The shares lost a penny to 143p.

FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Greycoat deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property shares showed good gains in the wake of the deal agreed by Greycoat
with its main shareholder, Postel, to secure its future. 'It is another sign
that the financiers see a healthy future for the sector,' said one property
analyst.
However, speculative investors in Greycoat, who had piled in to the 9 1/2
per cent preference shares on Monday ahead of the well-publicised
negotiations with Postel and pushed the price up 17 1/4 to 51 3/4 p, saw
most of their gains evaporate. The stock ended 12 3/4 down at 39p, after
34p. The ordinary shares lost 2 at 17p.
Meanwhile, BZW took the opportunity to raise its forecast for average
capital value movements for 1993/94. However, in spite of pent-up investment
demand for 'quality' properties estimated at Pounds 7bn, the broker believes
that property shares will soon enter a period of consolidation. Among the
majors yesterday, MEPC moved ahead 8 to 402p, Hammerson 'A' 9 to 290p, Land
Securities 9 to 585p and British Land 7 to 328p.

FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sears sells Asprey holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Sears to sell its 25 per cent stake in Asprey saw more than
20m shares being sold into the market, with Smith New Court, newly appointed
yesterday as Asprey's broker, placing the stake in a bought deal. Smith
refused to divulge details of the exercise, but marketmakers said they
believed the broker got most of the stock away at 267p. The price Smith paid
for the stake was unknown.
Details of the share placing had not appeared on the Seaq information
service yesterday - prompting some speculation that perhaps not all the
shares had been placed. Sears also converted its 18.5m non-voting
participating preferred shares into 41m 8.25 per cent preference shares,
which were subsequently placed with around 65 institutions by Collins
Stewart, the stockbroker. The preference share placing was 'heavily
oversubscribed', according to Collins Stewart.
Sears also said it was closing down a loss-making Dutch mail order business.
The costs of this virtually wiped out the profits - some Pounds 7m - made
from the Asprey sale. The shares closed a halfpenny off at 98 1/2 p, while
Asprey put on 5 at 293p.

FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures traded in a very tight range of about 10 points, with
the withdrawal of the big institutions to the sidelines leading to poor
volume, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,848, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 briefly
declined to 2,846 but soon recovered on renewed hopes of a reduction in UK
interest rates, a firm gilts market and the strength of sterling.
For most of the session, September was traded in a narrow range of 5 or 6
points, with the day's high of 2,858 recorded at around 11am. However,
volume was poor, reaching only 3,862 contracts by the close, well below
recent levels. Only yesterday, Liffe announced a 47 per cent increase in
total volume since June 1992.
September finished at 2,851, up 14 from its previous close but around 3
points below its fair value premium to cash of 7 points.
In traded options, turnover remained buoyant and came to 30,625. Some 6,404
lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,302 in the Euro FT-SE option.
In the stock options, BT led the way with a total of 6,302 lots transacted,
with most of the trade done in the November 460 calls, which saw volume of
2,000 lots.
It was followed by Barclays at 2,030 contracts, with the December 460 puts
the busiest series, and by National Westminster at 2,010 contracts. British
Steel and Glaxo were also active.

FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Firm pound and gilts boost shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER strong performance from sterling and gilts, coupled with a better
than expected opening by Wall Street and good gains across most European
bourses, helped the recently bruised UK equity market stage a good recovery
yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 Index, having plummeted more than 60 points during the
previous three trading sessions, stabilised and closed 9.6 better at
2,848.1, with dealers encouraged by a sharp increase in the volume of
business going through the market after Monday's dismal turnover levels.
Sterling's continuing strength and that of the gilts sector prompted talk
around the City of London that a reduction in UK interest rates is not
entirely out of the question, while there was also speculation in foreign
exchange markets that a further cut by the Bundesbank is not beyond the
realms of possibility.
Dealers said worries that the recovery in the UK economy, so long in coming,
could be fading had triggered the latest rate cut stories, although they
stressed that there was no great conviction behind the latest speculation.
Recent data on money supply and consumer credit has pointed to a slowing in
the economy, while the latest survey from the Institute of Directors showed
the first fall in business confidence since Britain's withdrawal from the
exchange rate mechanism last year. Another dampener for the market came with
a Gallup opinion poll suggesting that manufacturers are adopting an
increasingly gloomy outlook for exports as the rest of Europe moves into
recession.
There was also an element of uncertainty in markets ahead of the G7 meeting
in Tokyo which commences today.
London's stock market made a bright start to the day, led higher by a strong
opening by the Footsie future. The latter was in positive territory all day,
although traders spoke of miserably low levels of business in the
derivatives areas of the market.
Opening almost five points higher at 2,843, the FT-SE 100 moved
progressively ahead, touching the day's best, 12.9 up at 2,851.4 in
mid-morning, before easing off to finish at 2,848.1.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index delivered an equally good performance, ending the
session 13.1 stronger at 3,232.1.
Turnover in equities showed a welcome improvement from Monday's thoroughly
depressed levels, when volume of 384m shares, among the lowest daily levels
this year, was worth only Pounds 761.5m in customer business.
The value of retail business has fallen below the Pounds 1bn on only a
handful of occasions this year. Yesterday saw 554.3m shares traded, with
non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for 380.4m shares, or 69 per cent of total
turnover.
Drug issues, which provided the FT-SE 100's three worst performing stocks
last month in Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo, down 15 per cent, 9.9
per cent and 9.4 per cent respectively, according to Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken,
the stockbroker, were in the vanguard of the market's advance. Analysts said
the stocks had been oversold and had been due for a rally.
Enlivening a generally uninspiring trading session was a substantial bought
deal engineered by Smith New Court, which bought and sold Sears' 25 per cent
stake in Aspreys, the royal jewellers.

FT  07 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities depressed by US
economic fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
INVESTOR skittishness depressed US equity markets yesterday afternoon, with
worries about inflation conspiring with the recent release of disappointing
economic data to leave Wall Street unsettled, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 34.04 to 3,449.93 and the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 lost 4.41 at 441.43, while the Nasdaq composite shed 2.27 to
702.22. New York SE volume was 220.7m shares.
Before the afternoon sell-off, prices were trapped in a narrow trading range
throughout the morning, never breaking more than a few points above or below
opening values. Many investors and dealers were reluctant to trade equities
because of doubts about the outlook for the economy and the approaching
second quarter reporting season.
Even strong overseas stock markets, and a morning jump in bond prices, which
sent the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to a record low of 6.664 per
cent, failed to stimulate buying interest.
Foreign equities were boosted by last week's cut in German interest rates,
while bond prices rose on reports that the poor June jobs figures would
persuade the Federal Reserve to postpone any plans for an inflation-curbing
rise in US rates.
By the afternoon, equity and bond prices moved solidly lower as surging
commodities prices left investors increasingly nervous about inflation. In
late trading the long bond's yield had risen to 6.676 per cent.
General Motors, however, added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 44 1/8 on reports
that Wall Street analysts were turning increasingly bullish on the stock in

FT  07 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Privatisation programme reaches Athens
exchange - The market debut of Hellenic Sugar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's privatisation programme reached the Athens stock exchange last week
with the listing of Hellenic Sugar Industry, the state-owned sugar beet
processor. In spite of its small size the flotation has attracted
considerable interest, as the first new issue in well over a year.
The Dr7.1bn (Dollars 32m) offering, which covers a 37 per cent capital
increase and includes a small international tranche, came as the Athens
general index was making steady gains after months of wavering. 'It has
turned out to be quite a good moment to launch,' said Mr Nikos Tsiros of
Alpha Finance, adviser on the issue, last week, and he was right; the issue
was 4.3 times oversubscribed.
The market returned to wavering for a few days but it got back on the
upgrade yesterday, the index rising by 9.65 to 761.59 on selective buying,
up 13 per cent since the beginning of this year but still well short of its
February peak of 882. Yesterday's June figure for Greek inflation, a
fraction better than expected at 15.8 per cent, against 16.4 per cent in
May, came too late to affect the equity market, says Mr Stuart Harley of
Schroders.
The government has privatised more than 70 concerns in the past two years,
including a handful of companies already listed on the bourse. But plans to
broaden share ownership in Greece by making disposals through the exchange
collapsed as the weak financial position of most nationalised companies
became clear.
Hellenic Sugar, a monopoly producer controlled by the state-owned
Agricultural Bank, was an exception. The company's earnings soared in the
past two years with the lifting of price controls on sugar.
It remains to be seen whether other new issues will follow over the summer.
Although the list of Greek companies waiting to go public is lengthening,
the market's weak performance over the past two years has acted as a
deterrent.
While brokers seem confident that the current recovery will continue, there
are fears that the flotation of 14 per cent of OTE, the state telecoms
company, planned for November, will soak up all available liquidity.
Even with 5 per cent set aside for an international tranche, together with
another 4 per cent for company employees, the remaining 5 per cent, valued
at around Dr32bn, would still amount to much the largest public offering
ever made in Greece.
In the meantime, Commercial Bank, the second-largest state bank, has
postponed the first stage of a Dr50bn rights issue, set for May, without
deciding on a fresh date.
Mr Nikos Pantelakis of Midland Pantelakis Securities says: 'The OTE offering
dwarfs everything that has ever happened on the Athens stock exchange so,
naturally, there is some apprehension. But it will give a lot more depth to
the market.'
In the meantime, the government's announcement of sharper cuts in interest
rates on treasury bills, already declining by a quarter-point with each new
issue, is likely to send funds back into the stock market. With the savings
deposit rate down to 17 per cent, less than one percentage point above the
current inflation rate, small investors are starting to return to equities.
While company results for 1992 were mixed, construction groups, expected to
benefit from increased inflows of EC funds for infrastructure projects, have
greatly outperformed the market. Mechaniki, a leading contractor, is up 56
per cent. Alcatel Greece, which recently started producing fibre optic
cables for submarine use, is up by 63 per cent.
Banks have also outperformed the market, by an average of 18 per cent this
year. They are led by Ergobank and Credit Bank, the two largest private
banks, which had a good first quarter.
However, the average price/earnings ratio is still only 11, and on that
basis Greece looks cheaper than other emerging markets. Foreign investors
have been returning to Athens as a result.
Mr Alexander Moraitakis of Nuntius Securities says: 'What we are seeing is
international fund managers buying into Greece again. Funds are coming out
of Istanbul, for example, which is now a very expensive market, and moving
here.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich heats up on UBS
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION in Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, Germany gave bourses a
lift, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH raised the temperature again as investors heard more details of a
SFr180m rights issue from BK Vision, the investment trust which currently
has total funds of more than SFr1bn, and which crossed swords recently with
UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank.
BK Vision, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank, disclosed
yesterday that 56 per cent of its holdings were in UBS. UBS led banks higher
in very heavy trading, on speculation that the BK Vision rights issue would
mean more big buying of UBS shares. The bearers rose SFr53, or 4.7 per cent
to SFr1,187 and topped the active list. In the same sector, CS Holding
firmed SFr70 to SFr2,800 and SBC SFr12 to SFr425.
The SMI index hit a new all-time high of 2,390.5, up 26.5 as turnover
recovered after Monday's lull. The traffic was not all one-way. Nestle came
under pressure, falling SFr12 to SFr1,118 as the investment bank, Goldman
Sachs, said in New York that it had removed the share from its recommended
list.
FRANKFURT looked for more rate cut speculation after the Bundesbank
president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, said in a speech late on Monday that
western German inflation had risen at an average of 2.7 per cent over the
previous three months on an annualised, and seasonally adjusted basis.
However, the Bundesbank then denied a report that a majority of central bank
council members had wanted a sharper cut in interest rates than was decided
on last week. The DAX index rose by 8.70 to 1,700.87, nudged upward by some
late buying of banks, as turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM5.2bn.
Dresdner starred with a DM5.60 rise to DM388.50 at the close, and a further
gain to DM390 in the London post bourse. Bayernhypo moved up DM2.50 to
DM401.50 on the session, and then another DM3.50 to DM405 after hours.
Chemical companies were broadly higher, benefiting from the extended
strength of the dollar; constructions, similarly, moved up in echelon,
recovering from recent weakness.
PARIS resumed its uptrend following Monday's losses, and the CAC-40 index
put on 9.68 to 1,935.12. Turnover remained weak at under FFr2bn.
Total lost an early gain on news of progress in talks between the oil group
and Saudi Arabia as the price of crude weakened throughout the day. The
shares slipped FFr2.10 to FFr268.90, while those of Elf Aquitaine lost
FFr2.30 to FFr384.50.
Automotive issues were steady as James Capel reiterated its sell
recommendations for Michelin, Peugeot and Valeo yesterday. The broker
downgraded its 1994 profit forecasts for the three companies, although it
noted that, in contrast with Michelin and Peugeot, Valeo's profits 'should
hold up relatively well'. Valeo closed FFr5 higher at FFr819.
AMSTERDAM also recovered Monday's falls, with a rise in the CBS Tendency
index of 0.9 to 113.2. Ahold went against the trend, slipping Fl 2.30 to Fl
95.00 after the sale of a 6.7 per cent stake.
ABN Amro improved Fl 1.80 at FL 57.70 as it announced the purchase of a US
bank.
MILAN failed to respond to the Bank of Italy's larger than expected cut in
the discount rate, announced after Monday's close. The discount rate now
stands at its lowest level for 17 years.
The Comit index closed down 7.26 at 533.57. Ms Marie-Christine Keith, an
Italian analyst at NatWest Securities in London, remarked that she had
expected a stronger performance, given that the cut of one percentage point
had exceeded expectations.
She expected the market to drift over the next few weeks, ahead of a number
of announcements due by the end of the month. These include publication of
the draft budget for 1994 and details of progress on privatisation issues.
There was some interest in Fiat, partly on rumours of a strategic link up;
but the shares closed marginally lower on the kerb, down L6 at L6,225 ahead
of car sales data which showed a fall of more than 28 per cent in June
against the same 1992 period.
HELSINKI continued to outperform many of Europe's markets on strong demand
by foreign investors and positive company reports. The Hex index gained 3.12
per cent to 1,241.6, although it remained slightly below the year's high,
recorded on May 21, of 1,248.
Nokia advanced FM8 to FM199 after announcing the sale of its electrical
wholesale operations and a broker's upgrade.
ISTANBUL declined by another 3.2 per cent in reaction to the attack by
Kurdish rebels on an eastern village which left 32 people dead. The
composite index plunged 368.7 to 11,328.3 in turnover up to TL905bn from
TL805bn.
TEL AVIV dropped for the second consecutive day on weakness in the bond
market, the Mishtanim blue chip index falling 2.87 to 194.30 in turnover of
Shk177m.
WARSAW reduced its rate of climb ahead of the release of half-year company
results, but the WIG index still put on 133.7, or 3.3 per cent to 4,138.8 in
active turnover of 541bn zloty (Dollars 30m).

FT  07 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 1.1% on
hopes of a rate cut

<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE-related trading pushed cash share prices higher in tandem with the
futures market, which rose on renewed hopes of a cut in the official
discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 206.72, or 1.1 per cent, at 19,829.78 on buying by
arbitrageurs and investment trusts. The index fell to the day's low of
19,589.66 just after the opening, and hit the day's high of 19,833.38 in the
afternoon.
Volume remained subdued at 180m shares against 140m. The Topix index of all
first section stocks rose 7.48 to 1,592.90. Advances led declines by 555 to
397, with 188 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
0.52 to 1,207.57.
The cash market fluctuated on technical trading due to the low volume.
Speculation that Japan will emphasise economic recovery in the G7 communique
added to hopes of further monetary easing.
However, traders expect investors to remain inactive ahead of the July 18
lower house elections. In a recent report, Salomon Brothers in Tokyo
maintains an optimistic view on equities, commenting that the market will
begin to recover as a result of better economic news and opposition
proposals to reduce taxes and stimulate the economy.
Hopes of an imminent cut in the discount rate helped interest rate-sensitive
large capital issues. Nippon Steel rose Y5 to Y366 while Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries gained Y6 at Y642.
Reports of a sharp fall in crude oil prices during recent weeks helped oil
refiners on expectations of wider profit margins: Nippon Oil appreciated Y16
to Y806 and Cosmo Oil advanced Y12 to Y852.
Reports that Unicharm had decided to close Academic Unicharm, a computer
dating subsidiary, encouraged investors, pushing the nappy manufacturer up
Y60 to Y2,780.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 85.73 to 21,791.81 in volume of 15.5m shares.
Rohm, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y50 to Y3,170.
Roundup
THERE WERE mixed performances from the region's markets yesterday.
TAIWAN surged 3.6 per cent in a technical rebound triggered by news that the
Formosa Plastics group would soon begin building its long-delayed Dollars
7.5bn petrochemical complex.
The weighted index finished 140.09 higher at 4,047.42 as turnover expanded
to TDollars 19.35bn from Monday's TDollars 11.92bn. The plastics sector led
the gains, forging ahead 5.1 per cent. Formosa Plastics strengthened
TDollars 2.20 to TDollars 43.50 in heavy trading.
HONG KONG retreated in subdued trading as investors awaited developments in
Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index shed 37.07 to 7,168.34 in turnover
down to HKDollars 2.9bn from Monday's HKDollars 4.2bn.
Some brokers said most fund managers were waiting for the visit of Mr
Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, to Beijing later this week to
discuss Hong Kong's political reform plans. A separate round of Sino-UK
talks ended in Beijing yesterday, with further discussions scheduled for
later in the month.
NEW ZEALAND continued to rise, setting a fresh three-year high with Telecom
again the focus, adding 3 cents at NZDollars 3.28. The NZSE-40 index closed
2.33 up at 1,717.85 in turnover of NZDollars 23.2m.
SINGAPORE eased in thin volume, but with activity particularly noted in
Malaysian plantation stocks traded over the counter. The Straits Times
Industrial index lost 6.95 at 1,818.97.
KARACHI rose on institutional buying, with investors largely ignoring the
continuing political uncertainty arising from what is being seen as a power
struggle between President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif. The KSE index moved ahead 10.92 to 1,243.97.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Bullish on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING money market dealers continued to be bullish yesterday about the
prospects for a cut in UK base rates before the end of the year, writes
James Blitz.
For much of the last few months, there had been an assumption that the UK
authorities might keep interest rate policy on hold for the rest of 1993.
Unemployment has fallen for four consecutive months and inflation is at
historic lows.
However, retail sales and manufacturing output have both remained sluggish,
raising speculation that the government may need to stimulate the economy
further.
Sterling's strong perform-ance on the foreign exchanges is the immediate
reason for the change in the market's view. With the currency touching
DM2.5685 to the D-Mark yesterday, the way is open for the UK government to
ease monetary policy without affecting the pound too much.
However, the consensus appears to be that the cut will come towards the end
of the year rather than in September. An easing in monetary policy would
accompany the tough fiscal consolidation expected in Mr Kenneth Clarke's
first budget.
The December short sterling contract closed 2 basis points firmer at 94.48
yesterday, pricing three-month money at the end of the year at 5 1/2 per
cent. The September contract finished 2 basis points up on the day at 94.30.
A dealer suggested yesterday that the cut, when it comes, may be in the
order of 1 per cent rather than  1/2 per cent. 'I cannot see the rationale
for going to 5 1/2 per cent base rates,' he said. 'If the cut is to have an
impact, it must be bigger than that.'
The prospect of more rate reductions was enough to encourage some dealers
not to offer bills to the Bank of England. There were diffic-ulties removing
a Pounds 1bn short-age, pushing the overnight lending rate up to 9 per cent.
Three-month sterling cash ended unaltered at 5 7/8 per cent.
There was slightly more optimism yesterday about the prospect for more
German interest rate cuts after the Bundesbank president said that German
inflation could fall further before the year-end.
The September Euromark contract closed 4 basis points up at 93.20,
suggesting that three-month money will be some 56 basis points below
yesterday's cash level of 7.36 per cent.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark loses a little ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK was a touch weaker against the dollar and European currencies
yesterday following remarks from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the outgoing
Bundesbank president, that German inflation was slowly coming down, writes
James Blitz.
But in spite of this, the market remained unsure about the prospects for
further cuts in German interest rates. There was continuing concern that the
French franc could come under pressure inside the European exchange rate
mechanism if the Bundesbank does not reduce its official rates by  1/2
percentage point either before or immediately after its summer recess.
The D-Mark weakened slightly against the dollar after Mr Schlesinger said on
Monday night that west German inflation had come a 'step closer' to meeting
the Bundesbank's goal of 2 per cent.
Weak employment data continues to put a cap on the dollar, but the US
currency closed about  1/2 pfennig higher against the D-Mark in London
yesterday at DM1.7000. It subsequently finished New York trading at
DM1.7046.
Sterling also continues to profit from the perception that European interest
rates are coming down, while UK base rates have remained unchanged for
nearly six months. The pound ended  1/2 pfennig firmer at DM2.5675.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, said sterling
still has a strong upside, but this may be capped by the UK policy mix of
low interest rates and tight fiscal consolidation which is not positive for
currencies.
The French franc was also fractionally stronger against the D-Mark. After
closing at FFr3.3860 on Monday night, the franc yesterday finished trading
at FFr3.3810.
However, the franc is becoming a focus of attention in the markets. The key
issue facing the currency is whether the Bundesbank delays implementation of
another cut.
The French authorities have had some chance to 'go it alone' in monetary
policy in recent months. However, although French three-month interest rates
have been some 50 basis points below Germany's in recent weeks, that
differential narrowed to 18 basis points yesterday amid concern over the
deteriorating economic situation and France's restricted ability to lower
rates.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has mitigated the pressure
to cut rates by concentrating on a fiscal reflation package. Following a
major government bond issue, there is now talk of tax cuts to reflate the
economy.
But Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets, believes
that the French franc could come under pressure if Germany does not ease
policy between now and its council meeting on July 29, the last before the

FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers' diamond sales up by
42% in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIAMOND SALES by De Beers, the South African group which dominates the
market, reached an unprecedented Dollars 2.543bn in the first half of this
year, 42 per cent above the depressed total for the first six months of
1992.
But the company cited several special factors which helped to boost sales
and were 'likely to prove transitory' and warned that 'it would be unwise to
look upon the increased level of sales for the first half as a reliable
guide to 1993 as a whole'.
Nevertheless, analysts suggested that even an average second-half
performance would send De Beers' rough (uncut) diamond sales above the
record Dollars 4.17bn seen in 1988 and 1990.
'De Beers' market share must be as close to 100 per cent as it is ever
likely to get,' said Mr Steve Oke, analyst at the Smith New Court financial
services group.
De Beers responded to the improvement by increasing its purchases from
producers who belong to the cartel organised by its London-based Central
Selling Organisation. In September the CSO told producers to cut deliveries
by 25 per cent as it struggled to bring rough diamond supply and demand back
into balance following a huge surge in unofficial exports from Angola.
These 'producer delivery entitlements' were raised to 80 per cent in May and
yesterday went to 85 per cent. In February the CSO made its first price
increase for three years, averaging a modest 1.5 per cent and concentrating
mainly on stones above three quarters of a carat in size. De Beers said the
transitory elements in its first-half figures included:
A relative lack of uncut stones from Angola and Zaire, both affected by
severe political disruption;
A shortage of Russian polished diamonds in the first quarter (which analysts
suggested was caused by bureaucratic bungling);
Buoyant demand from India caused both by various budgetary incentives -
including the increased convertibility of the Indian currency - and a rise
in exports to the US.
Restocking in the cutting centres and some consumer markets, particularly
the US, the most important market for gem diamonds, where Christmas sales
were up substantially both in volume and value terms.
De Beers said there had been some recent increase in diamonds from Angola,
Zaire and Russia. The US government had sold Dollars 77m worth of rough
stones from its strategic stockpile and planned more sales later this year.
The present market for polished diamonds was not as strong as that for rough
stones and no dramatic improvement in retail sales could be expected until
there was a resurgence of world economic activity, it added.
Mr Oke at Smith New Court suggested a great deal of De Beers' extra
first-half sales came from re-stocking rather than any substantial
improvement in retail diamond sales. 'The stones are in the pipeline. But if
there is no retail action to suck them through, wholesalers will sit tight
and buy no more. But even an average second-half sale of Dollars 1.7bn would
take 1993 sales to Dollars 4.2bn or Dollars 4.3bn - a significant
improvement on recent years.'
Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the SG Warburg financial services group, said
the figures pointed to a 'welcome reduction in De Beers' diamond stockpile'.
The group might be able to restore the recent dividend cut as well as soon
restore the offtake from producers' to 100 per cent, he added.
The figures were only slightly ahead of many analysts' expectations and De
Beers share price, which had risen by Dollars 1.50 this week in anticipation
of the announcement, was unchanged yesterday at Dollars 18.10.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York coffee prices surge
higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW YORK arabica coffee market, closed on Monday for Independence Day,
surged ahead yesterday in reaction to the Latin American plan to retain 20
per cent of coffee exports from October 1.
The nearby July contract was up 5.50 cents a lb at 69.05 cents a lb in late
trading. Robusta coffee on the London Commodity Exchange followed New York
upwards. The September contract added a further Dollars 24 to Monday's
Dollars 24 advance, closing at Dollars 977 a tonne after touching a high of
Dollars 1,000 earlier in the day.
Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said the move was
purely psychological, pointing out that 'the Latin American scheme does not
address the problems of overproduction'. Ms Ganes also believes that
estimates of 20m bags (60 kg each) in consumer hands are grossly
understated, and will rise further as producers take advantage of higher
prices.
'Remember that this scheme will not kick in for another three months,' she
said.
Much of the drive behind the price rise was short-covering, which then
triggered stop-loss buying orders and attracted further speculative and fund
buying. But one London trader pointed out that coffee buyers had plenty of
time to take the long view, and they will be waiting to see how the details
of the Latin American scheme are worked out.

deal

<TEXT>
WESTERN OIL companies hoping for contracts from the exploitation of the
massive reserves of the Caspian Sea are increasingly confident that the new
government of Azerbaijan will be persuaded to retain the same general course
as the previous one, and that contracts worth ultimately up to Dollars 12bn
should be signed in the autumn.
Some oil men in Baku believe that Mr Sabit Bagirov, the head of the state
oil company Socar, who had apparently resigned more than a week ago, will
remain in his post after all.
'Bagirov has learned a lot about how to deal with the oil companies and he's
an honest man,' said Mr Oguz Capan, president of the Attila Dogan
corporation of Turkey, the first company to sign a contract for the
exploitation of on-shore reserves 100 km south of Baku. 'I think he'll
stay.'
About 4.5bn barrels of reserves have been proved or estimated in the Azeri
part of the Caspian and more is expected. Investment of between Dollars 9bn
and Dollars 12bn will go into the field.
The oil companies, which include Amoco, BP, Pennzoil and Statoil, had agreed
in principle with the populist government of Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, before it
was replaced recently by hardliners, to unify their approach to the field
However, the new leadership this week reassured senior company officials
that it wished to continue co-operation with them.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bleak picture painted of
Canadian fishery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS HAVE painted a bleak picture of Canada's east coast fishery,
warning that a substantial and permanent cut in the catch is required to
rebuild stocks of cod and other fish species.
The scientists, employed by Canada's department of fisheries, presented a
detailed report in Halifax, Nova Scotia, yesterday at the first public
meeting of the Fisheries Resource Conservation Council, a joint government,
industry and scientific group with a mandate to advise the government on
annual fishing quotas and fishery practices.
The FRCC's work is expected to play a crucial part in drawing up Canada's
case to the North Atlantic Fishing Organisation, which sets an annual quota
each autumn for the area outside Canada's territorial waters.
The east coast fishery has been devastated in recent years by the virtual
disappearance of northern cod stocks. The Canadian government imposed a
two-year moratorium off the coast of Newfoundland last July, putting about
20,000 fishermen and plant employees out of work. Government officials have
indicated recently that the moratorium may be extended beyond 1994 and to
other parts of the Atlantic coast.
Mr Herbert Clarke, the FRCC's chairman, said yesterday that 'the state of
the stocks has worsened dramatically in the last few years. Many are in
decline and a number of stocks are at historical low levels'.
The scientific report noted that past assessments had generally
over-estimated potential catches. It warned that 'immediate and medium-term
prospects (for rebuilding stocks) are poor', adding that 'the necessary
drastic reductions in fishing mortalities can only be achieved by
substantially decreasing fishing effort and these reductions need to be
permanent.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World offshore output forecast
to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD OFFSHORE oil production is forecast to rise by 18 per cent to 943m
tonnes by 1995 with most of the increase coming from the UK and Norwegian
sectors of the North Sea, according to a report released today by Mackay
Consultants, the management consulting group.
Mackay expects North Sea offshore output to increase by 41 per cent with
Norway remaining the world's largest offshore producer for the rest of the
decade.
But the report suggests world-wide exploration activity will be fairly
static. Although the number of exploration wells is expected to rise from
1,017 last year to 1,134 in 1995, that would still be below the level of
drilling in 1991.
The report shows a 20 per cent drop in exploration and appraisal drilling in
the UK with around 105 wells being sunk by 1995. Mackay says it has reduced
its forecasts as a result of changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes announced in
the UK March Budget, which abolished tax relief for exploration work.
Expenditure on the offshore sector worldwide is estimated to grow by 3 per
cent in the next two years to Dollars 84bn. But spending in the UK sector is
expected to fall from Dollars 8.3bn last year to Dollars 5.6bn in 1995 as
the emphasis shifts towards developing smaller fields.
World offshore gas production is forecast to grow by 18 per cent by 1995 to
442bn cubic metres.

Precious metals were sharply higher on the London bullion market as
aggressive US fund activity followed Middle East speculative buying in the
morning to push GOLD, SILVER and PLATINUM to fresh highs. Gold was fixed in
the afternoon at Dollars 391.65 a troy ounce, a fresh high since the
outbreak of the Gulf War, against a morning setting of Dollars 388. Silver
built on overnight and early gains to reach Dollars 5.07 a troy ounce at its
fix, a 35-month high. Platinum jumped over Dollars 10 from morning levels to
fix in the afternoon at a 27-month high of Dollars 404.25 a troy ounce after
Dollars 393.50 earlier. The speculative buying began with silver during the
overnight Far East session and then spilled over into gold and platinum.
'There were some extremely large orders being put around,' one dealer said.
Despite bouts of profit-taking in New York, aggressive fund buying of gold,
silver and platinum maintained early highs. London dealers said the gold
market would now be looking for a strong close in New York as a sign that
Dollars 400 is on the cards. 'We'll see it some time this week, but we'll
probably get a minor pull-back first,' said a New York dealer.

deficiencies in EC regime

<TEXT>
NORWAY YESTERDAY spelt out a long list of demands on fisheries to the
European Community and pointed out deficiencies in the EC's regime that
would have to be corrected if it was to become a member.
'The outcome of the membership negotiations in this area will play a
decisive role in determining the public attitude on Norwegian accession to
the community,' it warned Brussels officials.
Mr Jan Henry T. Olsen, the anti-EC fisheries minister, reiterated that
Norway had no more fish to give away to the community.
Norway failed to get the backing for EC membership in a 1972 referendum
partly because the community adopted a fisheries policy shortly before it
was going to make the decision to join.
Key issues in the discussions this time include mutual access to waters,
management and conservation, control of quotas and technical regulations,
structural matters, market access and market organisation.
Norway attached the greatest importance to the continuation of its regime
ensuring control and sustainable management of marine resources and
aquaculture activities.
It said recognition by the EC of the fundamental relationship between
Norway's coastal population settlements and fish resources was essential.
Norway demanded arrangements to ensure that fishing quotas remained at the
disposal of member states to which they had been allocated. It attached
particular importance to stringent enforcement of quotas and technical
regulations while insisting that it must be allowed to uphold its own
first-hand sales system.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market edges up from lows
despite fears of Iraqi return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES edged upwards yesterday after hitting 18-month lows over the
weekend, although the market remained nervous about talks between Iraq and
the United Nations which are due to begin today . The talks will cover the
sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of Iraqi oil to the export market to pay for
humanitarian aid.
'We're all biting our nails,' said one oil company trader. Oil prices rose
by about 20 cents to Dollars 17.35 a barrel as some market traders suggested
that there had been an overreaction to last week's fears of an Iraqi return
when prices plunged to Dollars 16.80 a barrel.
'I think the chances of Iraqi oil coming back have improved from zero to
say, 12 per cent, it's still not a done deal,' said Mr Vahan Zanoyan,
director at Petroleum Finance Company, the management consultants in
Washington.
Baghdad has signalled that it is softening its hostility to certain
conditions attached to the oil sale, such as the monitoring of sales by the
UN. The UN has also insisted that it keep the proceeds of the sale for
buying food and medicines which it will then distribute.
The New York talks are expected to last at least two weeks as they will
focus on wide-ranging issues such as Iraq's compliance with UN weapons
inspections and Baghdad's treatment of the Kurds.
The talks are likely to examine many technical aspects of the UN's
conditions. If agreement is reached it could then take more than a month for
Iraqi oil to appear on the market. That would give the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries time to hold an emergency meeting to decide
how to accommodate 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day in the
market.
Mr Jean Ping, of Gabon, the present Opec president, has signalled that he
sees no immediate need for an emergency meeting and has kept in touch with
other ministers by telephone.
If the Iraqi oil does not reach the market before the final quarter it will
be accommodated more easily as demand for Opec oil is forecast to rise by
about 1m b/d by then.
The immediate problem for the market is the high level of stocks held in the
US and Europe. The International Energy Agency - the west's energy
monitoring body - said in its latest oil report that stocks had increased at
a rate of 1.4m barrels a day during May. Refineries had been buying forward
because of cheap crude prices, it added.

prices

<TEXT>
THE GLOOMY economic outlook for most of the world's big industrial countries
was reflected by metals markets yesterday as nickel prices dropped to the
lowest level for 5 1/2 -years, lead fell to a seven-year low and tin slipped
back towards its recent 20-year low.
With most of continental Europe gripped by recession, recovery in Japan
still months away and a far from robust recovery in the US , 'the chances of
a demand-lead boost for metals in the remainder of this year are slim,' said
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, a
Royal/Dutch Shell subsidiary.
Nickel was also badly affected by a rise in London Metal Exchange stocks
reported yesterday following a steady fall totalling 10,000 tonnes in June.
Traders said a ship carrying between 6,000 and 12,000 tonnes of Russian
nickel had arrived in Europe.
'There is more than enough nickel around to justify a further fall in
price,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Company, part of the
Deutche Bank Group.
Meanwhile, traders suggested tin for delivery in three months might be on
its way to the Dollars 4,990 a tonne, the 20-year low touched recently.
Lead, suffering from a huge contraction of demand from European and Japanese
car makers, touched Dollars 388 a tonne yesterday before recovering slightly
by the close.

Enthusiasm had dampened in early trading on news that the coupon on the new
10-year Treuhand bond was set at 6 5/8 per cent, disappointing market
expectations of a 6 3/4 per cent coupon.
However, September bund futures shot forward on rate cut hopes in late
trading to close 0.21 higher at 93.38. The hopes were fuelled by a statement
from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, that inflation
in the past quarter was only 2.7 per cent.
That figure approaches the Bundesbank target of 2 per cent and leaves room
for a further easing.
Traders and economists are speculating that the Bundesbank will not ease at
the next council meeting on July 15 but will cut at the last one on July 29.
UK GILTS rose again in response to a strong pound, the German rate cut
optimism and the fundamental attractions of the UK government bond market.
Any German easing will leave more room for manoeuvre in the UK and investors
still like the UK's appeal of low inflationary prospects coupled with slow
growth.
However, the currency was the main reason behind yesterday's rise as
overseas investors acted on the further strength of the pound against the
D-Mark. Long gilt futures for September lifted a further  1/8 to 107 13/16 .
The rapid rise in gilt prices (and fall in yields) has taken some economists
by surprise. Mr Julian Callow, economist with Kleinwort Benson, said that at
7.55 per cent the yield on 10-year issues had almost reached his forecast
for the end of the year.
FRENCH government bonds were also pulled higher by the prospect of a German
easing and received an added impetus from a stronger franc.
Technical buying gave the September 10-year future added support and it
closed half a point higher at 119.60.
The Balladur privatisation bond issue appears to be subscribed beyond the
FFr40bn target initially announced, AP-DJ reports from Paris.
Bankers handling the issue could not confirm a figure of FFr80bn but some
observers indicated that the number was not far-fetched. The subscription
period runs until July 10.
The bonds carry a 6 per cent coupon and can be converted to shares in
privatised companies. They also carry assorted tax benefits.
ITALIAN debt drifted back as investors took profits after a recent strong
rally. The BTP 10-year futures contract for September slipped a quarter
point to 103.89.
However, fundamental sentiment was good and operators who took profits found
eager buyers at lower levels. Dealers said few investors were seriously
worried ahead of yesterday evening's vote of confidence in the government of
Mr Carlo Ciampi.
Several economists believe the BNTP contract which has risen from 93.90 at
the start of April could gain a further two points if the Bank of Italy
continues to make substantial cuts in its discount rate.
PORTUGUESE bonds fell from early highs on profit-taking, and dealers said
recent price rises had been overdone. Some banks with excess funds were
still attracted to the good rate on fixed rate bonds compared to the 10.25
per cent central bank rate for mopping up liquidity, they added.
THE US Treasury market reopened after the long holiday weekend in a broadly
positive mood, with longer-dated prices posting solid gains in the morning,
before an afternoon bout of inflation-related worries dampened spirits and
sent prices broadly lower.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was off  7/32 at 105
23/32 , yielding 6.6676 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  5/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.992 per cent.
Treasuries opened firmer, buoyed by overnight buying in foreign markets and
by reports that the Federal Reserve, in the wake of last week's unexpected
poor employment figures, was ready to return the bias on its monetary policy
to a neutral stance, away from the tightening bias adopted two months ago.
In late morning trading, however, shorter-dated securities fell back from
their early gains, as a slight surge in commodities prices prompted selling
at the short end. In the afternoon, longer-dated securities were hit by
concerns about inflation linked to a 5.12 rise in the Commodity Research
Bureau Index to 217.22.
Technical difficulties have prevented publication today of the Benchmark
Government Bonds table.

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Portugal ready to woo
investors from abroad - The country's plans to catch up with its EC partners
in the competition for loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL'S move to issue longer-dated government bonds marks its desire to
encourage more overseas investors. It comes as recession is beginning to
bite and economists expect the budget deficit to rise. The country can now
plan debt and compete for loans on an equal footing with its EC partners.
With the issue last week of its first 10-year bond, Portugal now has a
fully-fledged debt market with maturities ranging from two years to 10 and
is expected to have a bond futures market by next year.
It is a rapid development for an economy that, just over six months ago,
barely had a workable government bond market. What little it had was at the
short-dated end and was so illiquid that it tempted very few overseas
investors. The republic mostly refinanced its debt via three-month Treasury
bills, leaving itself at the mercy of volatile interest rates.
Historically, it has not been a problem as the country has managed to
maintain a low budget deficit. The present debt of Es1,120bn is 65 per cent
of GDP, which is above the Maastricht ceiling but compares favourably with
Italy's 107 per cent and Belgium's 130 per cent. However, Portugal is now
slipping into recession and beginning to drift further into the red.
Last week, the Treasury issued Es10bn of 11.5 per cent stock dated July
2003. The issue was very aggressively bid with Es82.7bn of offers and an
accepted yield of 10.67 per cent against expectations of 11 per cent. It was
the first auction in an Es40bn borrowing programme.
The issue follows that in April of new seven-year paper with a coupon of
11.875 per cent and marks the end of a yield curve which, because of the
lack of buying at the long end, has stood out among its European
counterparts as completely inverted.
The appreciation of the extent of the divergence prompted a rush of buying
last week with one London securities house taking up large blocks of two and
three-year paper and investors taking profits from Spain to plunge them into
Portugal.
Securities houses first began to dip their toes into the market last year
after interest rates began falling in response to lower inflation (since the
last devaluation on May 13, short-term interest rates have fallen by 6.75
points to 10.25 per cent), the escudo's entry in April last year to the
European exchange rate mechanism and the complete liberalisation of capital
movements.
However, there are still very few securities houses which are heavily
involved in the Portuguese bond market partly because of the illiquid nature
of the market and also because of the tax problems.
On the tax front, domestic fixed rate bonds - the Obrigacioes Do Tesouro or
Ots - are not traded through the leading European settlement houses and have
to be held by a Portuguese depository. Withholding tax of 20 per cent is
payable and although dual taxation treaties bring the rate down to 10 per
cent for a number of countries it can take months to get the rebate.
Nevertheless, Mr Andrew Roberts, bond analyst at UBS, says there is a
possibility that the withholding tax might be scrapped. That possibility and
the trend of increasingly lower interest rates is generating interest.
And Mr Steve Major, a Portuguese bond specialist with Credit Lyonnais, which
is a primary dealer with a big operation in Lisbon, says: 'Portugal has
lagged Spain because of lingering currency concerns but the big picture
story of a weakening D-Mark reduces the cross currency risk of holding high
yield bonds.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Ssangyong Oil issue leads invasion from
Far East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of Far Eastern equity-linked deals amounting to Dollars 650m in new
issuance hit the international bond markets yesterday. The deals consisted
of a large Korean convertible bond issue and two more bonds with warrants
from Japanese corporates.
Ssangyong Oil Refining, Korea's third-largest oil refiner, made its debut in
the international capital markets with the launch of a Dollars 150m
convertible bond with a 15-year maturity. Paribas Capital Markets,
book-runner for the deal, said this was the largest Korean convertible bond
issue to date.
Equity-linked specialists said the deal had a 'fairly rapturous' response,
given that foreign investors are finding it hard to buy some Korean shares.
Although the Korean stock market has been opened up to overseas investors,
there are strict limits on foreign ownership.
Ssangyong Oil Refining, in which Saudi Arabia's Aramco has an equity stake,
has already reached its foreign ownership limit, so the convertible bond
offers overseas investors the only means of buying into the company, dealers
said.
Paribas Capital Markets said the bonds were convertible into non-voting
shares, which currently trade at a discount of about 4.5 per cent to the
voting shares. The indicated conversion premium, which will be set on July
8, is likely to be between 5 per cent and 10 per cent to the price of the
voting shares. The coupon will be set at between 3.75 per cent and 4.25 per
cent.
'The deal did very well, reflecting the scarcity of Korean convertible
paper,' said one rival house. Demand from Switzerland and the UK was strong.
Two more Japanese names came to the market yesterday, as expected, issuing
bonds with warrants. NGK Insulators issued a Dollars 300m, four-year deal,
while Sumitomo Cement launched a Dollars 200m, four-year deal - coming only
one day after a chunky Dollars 480m issue from Seino Transportation.
Dealers had voiced concern about the market's ability to absorb the large
volume of deals expected from Japanese borrowers, especially since investor
interest is muted ahead of the Japanese election. Several borrowers arranged
to launch bonds with warrants, mandating the deals before the announcement
of the Japanese general election.
Nikko Europe, which was lead manager for the NGK Insulators deal, said the
warrants traded in a range of 13 7/8 to 14 1/8 on the bid side, while Nomura
International, lead manager for the Sumitomo Cement deal, said those
warrants traded at 13 5/8 . 'Technically, they are pretty cheap, reflecting
the relatively low investor interest,' said one house.
Outside the equity-linked sector, the international bond market saw a
handful of new issues. Bacardi-Martini Finance launched its first Eurobond
issue - a Dollars 200m, five-year deal with a 5.75 per cent coupon.
Last September, Bacardi, the Bermuda-based international rum company, paid
over Dollars 1.5bn for a majority stake in Martini Rossi, the Italian
vermouth and wines group. Yesterday's bond issue is aimed at helping to
refinance bridging loans made in connection with the deal.
The company has already done US private placements amounting to about
Dollars 450m, and expects to arrange additional financing in the form of a
syndicated loan.
The other main Eurodollar deal of the day came from the Kingdom of Denmark,
which launched a Dollars 250m, four-year bond priced to yield 20 basis
points over the interpolated yield curve.
The Kingdom of Sweden yesterday joined the steady stream of borrowers to tap
the Eurolira market with a L250bn, 10-year deal carrying a coupon of 9.75
per cent. The bonds were reoffered at 99.375 per cent to yield 9.85 per
cent.
Deutsche Bank London, which lead managed the deal, said the aim was to draw
more institutional investors into the Eurolira market, an area which
traditionally has been dominated by retail investors. 'Sweden is well-known
among institutional investors' said Deutsche Bank, claiming that some 55 per
cent of the bonds were sold to institutional investors.

Tuntex Petrochemicals yesterday confirmed plans to build Taiwan's seventh
naphtha cracker with a projected total investment of NDollars 87bn
(USDollars 3.3bn), writes Dennis Engbarth in Taipei.
The facility will have an annual throughput capacity of 10m tonnes, or
22,500 barrels a day.
A spokesman estimated that the complex's annual production could reach a
value of NTDollars 91bn. The proposed site would be close to Formosa
Plastics' cracker in a coastal industrial zone near Taihsi in Yunlin county.
The project would be the largest single investment by the Tuntex Group and
officials said that Tuntex would seek to gain the participation of domestic
and foreign investors in the project.

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Heavy demand for Rhone-Poulenc
offer
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC'S FFr4.4bn (Dollars 770m) sale of its 35 per cent stake in
Roussel-Uclaf, France's third-largest pharmaceuticals group, has been highly
oversubscribed, according to initial indications.
The international placement is said to have been oversubscribed more than
twice and the domestic public offer has also been oversubscribed. The offers
close at 5pm tomorrow.
Advisers will have to decide whether to claw back shares from the
international issue. Rhone-Poulenc's 7.8m shares were allocated equally to
the two issues.
Under Paris stock exchange rules, up to 15 per cent of shares in the
international issue could be clawed back, leaving the French public offer
with 4,483,000 shares. No clawback is possible from the domestic offer.
A decision about the clawback will be made on Friday. The criteria will
include both demand and political considerations. It is understood the
French authorities would prefer to allocate as many shares in France as is
possible.
The offer is being co-ordinated by Barclays de Zoete Weed. The two offers
are jointly managed with Banque Nationale de Paris and JP Morgan.
A price of FFr563 was set earlier this week after a two-week bookbuilding
period. The quality and the depth of the book is understood to have been
good.
Hoechst, the German chemicals group, owns 54.5 per cent of Roussel-Uclaf.

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gaylord hits the high notes with
latest craze for country music - The success and aspirations of an
entertainment group devoted to the values of rural America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRAZY as a 'coon. That, roughly speaking, was how much of the US television
industry dismissed upstart Gaylord Entertainment in 1983 when it launched a
cable network devoted to subjects which stir the soul of rural America -
such as country music, drag car racing, pick-up trucks, down-home cooking
and bass fishing.
Yet, 10 years later, Gaylord's The Nashville Network (TNN) is one of the
most successful US cable channels and a second network, Country Music
Television, which Gaylord acquired in 1991, is among America's
fastest-growing cable services.
Gaylord, in short, is riding high on a boom in country music which has made
this the fastest-growing form of popular music in the US. And now it is
hoping to export its success to Europe.
The boom seems due largely to the emergence of a new generation of young
singers - led by the phenomenally popular Garth Brooks - who are more able
to cross the boundary which has traditionally distinguished country from the
broader pop stream.
Country is also benefiting as pop fans turn away from rap and grunge, and
from a vogue for simpler, rural values.
Whatever the cause, Gaylord, based in Nashville, Tennessee, is ideally
placed to benefit, for it dominates country music in a similar manner to
Walt Disney's hold on children's entertainment, with interests ranging from
cable networks to a theme park.
At the heart of the group, giving it coherence, is its ownership of country
music's most venerated institution, the Grand Ole Opry. This is a folksy
show, broadcast from Nashville ever since 1925, which has played a central
role in the development of 'country' artists.
The Opry House, where performances are held, is a key feature of Gaylord's
nerve centre, the Opryland complex, just outside Nashville.
The complex includes its theme park and the Opryland hotel, an imposing
building in southern plantation style featuring vast glass-enclosed gardens,
complete with waterfalls and fountains synchronised to accompany evening
performances by a harpist.
'This is not just a hotel, this is an entertainment experience,' says Mr
Terry London, Gaylord's chief financial officer, sipping a drink against a
backdrop of 10,000 tropical plants.
Gaylord - quoted on the New York Stock Exchange but 59 per cent held by the
family and associates of its eponymous chairman, Mr Edward Gaylord - was an
Oklahoma-based owner of newspapers and broadcasting stations until 1983,
when it bought the Grand Ole Opry and the adjoining hotel and theme park.
It went public with a stock offering in October 1991, partly to provide for
growth and partly to give liquidity to the founding families, and since then
the share price has soared from Dollars 20.50 to around Dollars 45.
Group revenues jumped from Dollars 417m in 1988 to Dollars 643m last year
and operating cash flow from Dollars 64.4m to Dollars 150.8m.
Gaylord's growth is due to more than being in the right place at the right
time. It has gained a reputation for good management, a sensible expansion
strategy, strong finances and an ability to cross-promote its subsidiaries.
The major source of profit and revenue growth for the foreseeable future
will be the two cable networks, which already provide over 30 per cent of
cash flow.
TNN reaches 57m subscribers - 93 per cent of cable households in the US and
61 per cent of TV households.
Mr London says it still has plenty of growth potential, since cable will
continue to penetrate US homes at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent a year. Also,
TNN's advertising sales are still somewhat below those of some other
networks because of Madison Avenue's past prejudice against country music.
But Gaylord's greatest growth over the medium term is likely to come from
CMT, which broadcasts non-stop country music videos.
Since Gaylord acquired 67 per cent of CMT 18 months ago, the network has
increased its number of subscribers from 10m to around 19m. It attracts a
much more youthful audience than TNN, which should make it attractive to
advertisers, and its programming costs are small, since record companies
provide it with videos free.
Last October, CMT launched a service into the fledgling European cable
television market, which Gaylord thinks offers good long-term growth
prospects.
Says Mr London: 'Estimates suggest there will be 54m cable homes in Europe
by the year 2000. There are currently 60m in the US. So we have the
opportunity to repeat what we have done here.'
It remains a moot point, however, whether Europeans will get excited about
something as quintessentially middle-American as country music, even if CMT
waters down its programming for transatlantic consumption.
Gaylord is also looking for significant growth at the Opryland Hotel, which
is already one of the 20 largest hotels in the US in terms of guest rooms. A
leading convention centre, it has more than 2m room nights of bookings,
stretching to the year 2009, and an 86 per cent occupancy rate.
Gaylord has just announced plans for Dollars 175m of capital spending to add
979 rooms to the existing 1,891, to double the trade show facilities, and to
create another immense glass covered space called 'The Delta.'
Two main dangers would appear to face Gaylord. One is that it might grow
faster than its management resources, though it recently addressed this by
hiring Mr Richard Evans, former president of New York City's Madison Square
Garden auditorium, as chief operating officer.
The second is that country music could prove a temporary craze, as in the
past. However, Mr David Hall, general manager of TNN, argues that at the end
of each boom industry revenues have remained higher than before the craze
began, and he expects this long-term growth pattern to continue.
'We will find artists that will . . . keep pushing up that trendline further
and further, if no one goes to sleep at the wheel,' he insists. 'We're
dealing with a lifestyle here.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Northwest agrees deal with
pilots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHWEST AIRLINES, the debt-burdened US carrier which is integrating its
operations with those of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, yesterday staved off a
bankruptcy filing by reaching an agreement with its pilots' union.
The agreement, covering new contract terms and cost reductions, is a
breakthrough for the carrier.
In order for Northwest to remain viable outside the protection of the
bankruptcy court, it needs significant labour concessions.
Although the airline did not spell out details of its agreement yesterday,
the deal is believed to include savings of about Dollars 365m from the
pilots' group.
This is in keeping with Northwest's plan, announced last year, to cut labour
costs by Dollars 886m over three years.
The airline's earlier offer to give employees a 30 per cent stake in the
airline and three of its 15 board seats in exchange for pay concessions may
have changed.
The pact was approved overwhelmingly by leaders of Northwest's Air Line
Pilots Association (Alpa) and no further vote is necessary by the union.
The carrier still needs to reach revised agreements with its two other main
unions - the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing flight
attendants, and the International Association of Machinists.
In May, Northwest reached agreements in principle with both groups, but the
Teamsters halted a vote on their pact after members of the machinists' union
voted against the deal.
The airline had some success in rescheduling its loan repayments, reducing
payments falling due in the next few years. Last week, the airline's banks
approved a plan to defer most of the payments on a Dollars 1.29bn loan until
1997.
Northwest is struggling under the burden of debt acquired when the airline
was taken private in a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989.
Dire industry conditions have added to the carrier's woes. Northwest hopes
to reach a voluntary restructuring agreement rather than reorganising while
operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.
Since 1990, five big US carriers have entered Chapter 11.
The Alpa agreement revived hopes that Northwest would soon reach an
agreement with its other unions.
The Teamsters Union said yesterday that a preliminary review of the main
features of the Alpa agreement indicated that it seemed to fulfil their
requirements for protecting members' interests while adding some options
that the pilots' union had requested. The pilots' agreement, for example,
apparently adds an option under which employees could forego the guarantee
of repayment in exchange for a larger share of stock in the company.
'We are hopeful that the variation negotiated by the pilots will meet our
members' needs,' said Ms Mary Don Erskin, Teamster Local 2000 president. 'If
so, we expect to recommend ratification to our members.'

200m to cut debt

<TEXT>
SOCIEDAD Comercial del Plata, a Buenos Aires-based holding company, plans to
raise about Dollars 200m in a combined disposal of assets and international
rights issue in order to reduce its heavy debt burden.
SCP, like other large Argentine holding companies, has grown rapidly over
the past three years by buying privatised companies.
However, in the process SCP has built up Dollars 300m in debts as it has
acquired minority stakes in energy companies and utilities.
SCP has sold for Dollars 112.5m its 5 per cent stake in Cointel, a vehicle
that controls one of Argentina's two privatised telephone companies, to
Cointel's operator, Telefonica of Spain.
SCP also plans to raise Dollars 80m in a local and international rights
issue and a further Dollars 4.6m through a smaller asset sale.
Other Argentine conglomerates are reorganising and shuffling stakes in
utilities between each other as Argentina's privatisation programme winds
down.
In part, this is due to new corporate strategies and to the need to reduce
debt. In SCP's case, debt was equivalent to its 1992 turnover of Dollars
310.8m.
SCP's stake in Cointel has proved highly profitable, growing in value by
more than 500 per cent since privatisation in November 1990.
However, SCP will retain its 25 per cent holding of preferred stock in
Telefonica de Argentina, the telephone company which is controlled by
Cointel.
SCP said that as well as strengthening its balance sheet and reaping a
substantial profit from Cointel, it wanted to concentrate resources in
investments which enabled it to exercise some management control over
companies.
Last week, the Citilec consortium, in which Sociedad Comercial and National
Grid Company of the UK each have a 15 per cent stake, won a concession to
run Argentina's electricity distribution system.

<TEXT>
ABN Amro, the Dutch banking group, announced yesterday it was to increase
its presence in the Chicago retail banking market through the acquisition of
Cragin Financial Corp for about Dollars 500m in cash.
Cragin is the holding company for Cragin Federal Bank for Savings, which is
the second largest independent savings bank in Illinois, with assets of
Dollars 2.8bn and 27 offices in the Chicago area.
It will be integrated with ABN Amro's Chicago-based group of LaSalle banks,
which has assets of over Dollars 16bn in more than 40 offices.
LaSalle, a significant presence in the middle market for commercial loans,
increased its retail presence around Chicago when it acquired the Talman
savings and loans group in February 1992.
LaSalle said yesterday that the Cragin group of banks had the same product
lines as Talman and offered a good geographical fit with the earlier
acquisition.
Cragin's offices are mainly on Chicago's north-west side and in the western
and north-western suburbs.
ABN Amro's other US operations, with assets of about Dollars 40bn, include
lending to large corporations and EAB, a retail banking business based in
New York.
The Cragin deal, which is expected to close early next year, involves
payment of Dollars 38 a share to the holders of Cragin's approximately 13m
shares.
Shares in the holding company for Cragin Federal Bank for Savings were up
Dollars 9 7/8 at Dollars 35 at midday after peaking at Dollars 36, a new
high for the year.
Stet, the holding company which controls Italy's public sector
telecommunications activities, is selling a 20 per cent share in Stet Hellas
Telecommunications, its recently-created Greek subsidiary, to the US Nynex
group. Stet gave no indication of the value of the sale.

<TEXT>
ADVANCED Micro Devices reported a rise in sales and earnings for the second
quarter and said it had introduced its version of the Intel 486
microprocessor widely used in personal computers.
Net income was Dollars 64.4m, before payment of preferred stock dividends,
an increase of 55 per cent over last year's second quarter when net earnings
were Dollars 41.4m. Sales advanced to Dollars 409.1m, up from Dollars 350.2m
in the same period last year.
After the preferred dividend, net income per common share was 65 cents, up
from 43 cents.
AMD was lifted during the year by sales of its clones of Intel
microprocessors. However, the company said that during the second quarter
sales of its other products grew by nearly 14 per cent over the previous
quarter.
Sales of flash memory chips, used in portable computers as an alternative to
disk drives for data storage, increased by almost 60 per cent, the company
added.
This more than offset a decline in sales of AMD's 386 microprocessors, said
Mr Richard Previte, president and chief operating officer.
'Our 386 microprocessor business reflected the market shift toward 486-based
personal computers,' he added. 'Revenues from 386 microprocessors declined
in a softer market with lower average selling prices.'
AMD began shipping 486 microprocessors during the second quarter, and said
it expected sharply increased sales in the current quarter. 'The Am486
family will be a significant contributor to revenues in the current
quarter,' Mr Previte said.
AMD announced its first 486 microprocessors incorporating in-house developed
microcode. Microcode is internal software that controls the functions of a
microprocessor.
Previously, AMD has offered 486 microprocessors using Intel microcode.
The company is engaged in a legal battle with Intel over its rights to the
Intel technology. AMD charges that Intel has tried to prevent competition in
the microprocessor market.
'With today's announcement, AMD has achieved a milestone that assures the
continuation of free-market economics in the IBM-compatible personal
computer marketplace,' said Mr WJ Sanders III, chairman and chief executive.
For the first six months of 1993, AMD reported net income of Dollars 125.8m
before the preferred stock dividend, or Dollars 1.28 per common share after
the dividend.
Revenues were Dollars 816.5m.
In the same period of 1992, it recorded net income of Dollars 126.3m or
Dollars 1.33 per common share after the dividend. Sales amounted to Dollars
757.6m.

GROUP earnings at Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest bank, rose by 15 per
cent in the first five months of the year, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's
chief executive, said yesterday.
However, partial operating profits - excluding own-account trading profits -
remained unchanged compared with the same period last year.
The chairman's remarks amplified his observation last month that there had
been a 'double-digit' increase in profits between January and May.
Mr Kohlhaussen said the growth had come largely from own-account trading in
foreign exchange and securities. The unchanged operating profits reflected
an 8 per cent increase in administrative costs as well as reduced credit
demand from Germany's recession-weakened industrial sector.

<TEXT>
SNIA FIBRE of Italy and Rhone-Poulenc of France yesterday announced plans to
merge their textile nylon businesses, continuing the restructuring of the
European fibres industry.
The deal, if concluded, would create Europe's largest textile yarn
manufacturer, with annual sales of about FFr2.6bn (Dollars 450m). It follows
Du Pont's acquisition of ICI's fibres operations, which was completed last
week.
Snia and and Rhone-Poulenc already have a carpet fibre joint venture which
is the second-largest European manufacturer.
In the latest venture, Snia claims to have 17 per cent of the west European
market, while Rhone-Poulenc is to contribute about 20 per cent. The 50-50
joint venture will have a capacity of about 100,000 tonnes a year.
Although west European capacity is more than 350,000 tonnes a year, demand
is only 240,000 tonnes, according to the Committee of Rayon and Synthetic
Filament.
The French company said it did not expect difficulties from competition
authorities, because Europe had to be able to compete against Asian
manufacturers. Du Pont has about 25 per cent of a market which is growing at
only 2 per cent a year because of competition from other fibres such as
polyester. Radicci of Italy is the third-largest manufacturer.
The consolidation will put pressure on the remaining small manufacturers in
Italy, Spain and Germany. Mr Robin Anson, of Textiles Intelligence, the
market research group, said the deal would allow some rationalisation of the
two groups' activities.
'Integrating our respective nylon textiles activities will allow us to
optimise synergies in research, production and marketing, with the aim of
reinforcing our position in the European market,' said Mr Michel de Rosen,
managing director of Rhone-Poulenc fibres operations.
Rhone-Poulenc said the two businesses, which employ about 3,000 people, were
complimentary. Snia was strong in nylon 6 and had considered building a
plant to make nylon 66. This is where the French company is strongest.
Snia's operations are mainly in Italy, while Rhone-Poulenc's are in Germany
and France.
The French group's fibre operations in Brazil and Slovakia are not included
in the deal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-Humboldt-Deutz, the Cologne-based engineering group, is to adopt
the Volkswagen group's cost-cutting techniques in an attempt to restore
growth.
The company said yesterday it expected to break even this year for the
second year in succession despite a slow first half. But capacity and costs
had to be reduced further.
All expenditure would have to be cut, including spending on materials, fixed
and personnel costs and interest payments. However, most effort would be
focused on significantly lowering procurement costs.
Outside suppliers were expected to accept the necessary changes and use the
opportunities for greater co-operation with KHD, the company said. The
group's plans, including the loss of 2,000 jobs, will be spelt out at the
end of next month.
They appear to match closely the projects under way at VW, where protesting
suppliers have been asked for price cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Mr Werner Kirchgasser, chairman, warned of impending action last month when
he said sales for the first five months of the year were down 21 per cent
and incoming orders were 25 per cent lower than a year earlier.
The company said no improvement in its main markets could be expected in the
near future, adding that current difficulties were likely to persist into
1994.
As well as feeling the industrial recession, KHD has been badly affected by
changes in common agricultural policy, which have hit sales of tractors and
other agricultural equipment.

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Time out for Benetton game plan
 -The sports side may not be ready for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Benetton family may be having second thoughts about pressing ahead
with the planned flotation of its growing sports activities on the New York
Stock Exchange, in spite of the successful example set by the Fila sports
group in May.
Fila, best-known in Italy for its up-market sports clothing and, in the US,
for its footwear, listed 30 per cent of its ordinary shares on the Big Board
in a deal which raised about Dollars 135m for Gemina, the Fiat-controlled
investment group which owns it.
Some bankers believed Benetton Sportsystem, the holding company established
this year for the family's bulging sports portfolio, might have followed the
lead and been floated before Christmas.
However, signs now are that the Benettons, who over the past three years
have quietly acquired 10 leading sports equipment companies through their
Edizione Holding master company, may have pushed back their ambitions.
The group, which includes familiar brands such as Prince tennis racquets and
Nordica ski boots, 'still needs to be simplified', says one banker familiar
with the company. 'They need to talk to US investors, and there are still
tax implications to be worked out.'
However, the Benettons have started to spread the word. At a penthouse
showroom in New York's Fifth Avenue earlier this year, they displayed
together for the first time their full range of brands.
The target is to make Benetton Sportsystem one of the world's top five
sports groups by 1995. By then, sales should exceed Dollars 1bn, putting it
just behind Nike, Reebok, Adidas and Mizuno of Japan.
Benetton's strategy began in the late 1980s, when the fragmented sports
equipment industry was identified as offering potential for growth through
consolidation. The sector fitted in with the Benettons' experience in
manufacturing and retailing and coincided with the family's relaxed, unfussy
and vaguely 'green' business image.
The takeovers started with Italy's Nordica in May 1989. This year, the group
reached its first goal of assembling an adequate portfolio of sports brands.
'We have products for sports from January 1 to December 31, meaning we are
no longer dependent on one season,' says Mr Silvano Storer, joint managing
director of Benetton Sportsystem.
Other criteria - buying brands which were internationally known and among
the leaders in their sectors, and in sports showing rising demand  - have
also been met, he says.
With the acquisition phase complete, attention has shifted to rationalising
manufacturing and distribution to save money in production, marketing and
distribution.
Rollerblade's in-line roller skates show different parts of the group
working together to improve quality and lower costs. Buyers remark that the
boot section of the skates look increasingly like sophisticated ski boots.
The change reflects Nordica's influence. About 30 per cent of Rollerblade's
boots are now made at Nordica's plant in north-eastern Italy, and the
proportion is expected to reach 70 per cent eventually. 'The two products
meet broadly similar physical requirements. Nordica's experience in the ski
boot market gave it an edge in designing and choosing materials for in-line
roller skates, especially for comfort and strength,' says Mr Storer.
The link has helped Rollerblade, which virtually invented in-line roller
skates, to survive the 'boom-and-bust' cycle facing many innovative
companies which surge on new products but then decline as competition
sharpens.
But it is sports footwear and clothing which will need the greatest
attention if Benetton Sportsystem is to realise its growth ambitions. 'There
are a limited number of consumers for each of our sports, but many more for
related clothing,' says Mr Storer. 'To have annual sales of over Dollars
1bn, shoes and clothing would probably have to account for at least half.'
To get there, Sportsystem will have to combine skills and resources in its
component companies in much the same way as is already happening with
Nordica and Rollerblade.
The Benettons have created a new subsidiary, N &amp; Co, to co-ordinate clothes
manufacturing. Tennis fans will still have Prince apparel to match their
racquets, but production will be co-ordinated by N &amp; Co. Costs will be cut
by farming out manufacturing to eastern Asia.
A similar strategy is planned for footwear. The aim is to rationalise
individual ranges, while preserving brand identities, to create a shoe
selection spanning products for tennis and jogging to those used for hiking
and mountaineering.
The group also sees scope for improving marketing and distribution by
combining sales forces. At present, each brand has its own sales and
distribution. The aim is to reduce that to just one network for all the
brands.
Rationalisation is already under way. Nordica has signed an agreement to
distribute Rollerblade products in Europe and Japan, the areas where its
sales force is strongest.

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Merged Krupp-Hoesch group
suffers heavy loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KRUPP-HOESCH, the merged German steel and engineering group, continued its
downward slide in the first six months of the year, recording a DM320m
(Dollars 189.3m) loss.
The company's poor results are mainly attributable to high operating losses
and extraordinary expenditures in its steel divisions.
These are the first consolidated figure for the new company created when
Krupp and Hoesch, the second and third-largest steel producers in Germany,
merged in the middle of last year. The merger was formally approved by the
groups' shareholders in May.
The loss in the six months compares with an aggregate loss for the two
groups of DM250m for the whole of 1992, down DM682m from 1991 results. In
the steel divisions alone, the two groups recorded an aggregate loss of
DM450m in 1992.
Orders for the first six months fell by 10 to 15 per cent. Beside the steel
divisions, the mechanical engineering side was particularly affected, with
orders falling by more than 25 per cent.
Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, said the six months' losses came mainly
from the steel divisions. Taken together, the company's other divisions had
broken even. These included machinery, buildings, automotive parts and
trading services.
He said Krupp-Hoesch would continue to record heavy losses in the second
half - although lighter than those of the first six months - as drastic
restructuring measures took effect.
An estimated 11,000 workers are expected to be made redundant this year,
bringing total employment to 'under 80,000' from its current 91,411, Mr
Cromme said. In 1992, the two groups together cut 6,000 jobs.
Restructuring measures also include the closure of its Rheinhausen steel
mill in the Ruhr Valley, where 2,200 are employed. The plant is due to close
on August 15.
Mr Cromme said such measures and economies of scale associated with the
merger would save Krupp-Hoesch up to DM500m over the next few years. More
than 70 per cent of the business areas of the two companies are related or
comparable. In the steel divisions alone, the merger will save an estimated
DM300m.
Mr Gerhard Jooss, financial director, said the company's total debt could
rise to 'over DM5bn' by the end of the year, from its current DM4.7bn.
In 1992, aggregate sales for the two groups fell by around 9 per cent, from
DM25.5bn to DM23.2bn. Steel products and trading services together accounted
for 50 per cent of turnover. Spare parts for the automotive industry
represented 25 per cent of total sales.

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ashton Mining to float gold
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASHTON Mining, the Australian diamond miner, plans to swell the nation's
heavy schedule of private equity raisings with the ADollars 112m (USDollars
75.2m) flotation of its gold production interests.
Ashton directors said yesterday the company would consolidate its Australian
and Indonesian gold interests into a company called Aurora Gold, and
initially make a placement to institutional shareholders.
Private investors would then be offered 25 per cent of the placement shares,
with Ashton retaining a 30 per cent stake in Aurora, which would potentially
rank among the top 10 Australian gold producers.
Ashton, 47 per cent controlled by Malaysian Mining Corporation, is a partner
in the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia. Ironically, the company
appeared to be moving its investment strategy away from gold as recently as
March this year.
At that time, directors said the company would focus on opportunities in the
diamond sector and place its Mount Muro gold mine in Indonesia out to
tender.
But that was when the gold price was languishing at around Dollars 327 an
ounce. Since then, the price has strengthened by around 20 per cent,
prompting a rush by investors for Australian gold stocks.
The gold price jump was seen by analysts last night as the main factor
behind Ashton's change of heart. Assets likely to be offered in the Aurora
float include Mount Muro and interests in the Laverton, Harbour Lights, and
Bardoc properties in Western Australia.
Ashton's share of gold production from these properties rose from 131,465oz
to 135,307oz in the latest year. Mount Muro has the potential to produce
around 150,000oz per year. Ashton shares yesterday closed 6 cents higher at
ADollars 2.22 on Australian stock exchanges.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Fresh warning at Tomorrow's Leisure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW'S LEISURE, the USM-quoted hotels and leisure group, yesterday
issued a second warning of losses for the year to March 31.
The group, which in March said it was likely to incur a pre-tax loss of more
than Pounds 1m, said the figure would be 'substantially in excess' of that
amount. The shares fell 3p to 18p on the news.
The second warning is due partly to a downward valuation of assets, also
announced yesterday, reflecting current market conditions. In 1991-92 the
group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 731,000.
Mr John Roberts, a former Next director appointed chairman in February, has
resigned. Mr John Sanderson, the founder, who stepped down as chairman and
managing director in that reshuffle, has now become executive chairman. Mr
Malcolm Powell has been replaced as managing director by Mr Stephen Lovely,
a chartered accountant previously with Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Mr Sanderson, whose family has recently made a Pounds 250,000 loan to
Tomorrow's Leisure, said there had been differences of opinion.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Registered interest in BT sale disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of registrations in the sale of the government's remaining
holding in British Telecommunications remains well below the number in the
last sale of BT shares.
The Treasury yesterday announced that after 600,000 new registrations in the
last week the total number had risen to 5.2m, compared with 5.25m in 1991.
However, 2.4m individuals, being qualifying BT shareholders and eligible BT
employees, were automatically registered compared with 1.1m last time.
'After excluding those automatically registered the figures are really quite
disappointing,' said one telecommunications analyst.
Of those registering, 2m chose to go through one of the share shops with
1.4m registering with the Share Information Office. Applications through
most share shops close July 12 and the public offer in the UK closes July
14. Trading in the new shares starts July 19.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said he believed
the result showed that BT3 was on course for success.
Those applying through share shops will get a greater allocation of shares
than applicants through the information office, if there is a big demand.
UK private investors will receive discounts of 10p on all three instalments.
The overall price, which will determine the sum payable in the third
instalment, is to be determined by the bids for shares made by the
institutions after the book building exercise gets under way tomorrow.

Shares in Edmond Holdings, the housebuilder, fell 4 1/2 p to 15p after the
company warned that profits for the year were unlikely to match current
market expectations.
Trading in the first half had been in line with expectations, in conditions
which had continued to be difficult. However, despite signs of recovery in
some geographical locations, the areas in which Edmond operates -
Humberside, East Anglia and south Wales - had not experienced any positive
effects and lower volumes and weaker prices had resulted.
The board did not feel it prudent to anticipate an improvement in trading
conditions in the near future.
In 1992 the company incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 1.73m
profits).

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cost controls and improved margins help
Eurotherm advance to Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTHERM, the industrial process control equipment supplier, reported a 37
per cent increase in interim profits, reflecting cost cutting measures,
improved margins and the positive impact of sterling's devaluation.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 9.19m in the six months to April 30,
against Pounds 6.71m last time, while turnover expanded a modest 3.8 per
cent to Pounds 81m (Pounds 78.1m) reflecting the 'patchy' state of the world
economy, with few countries showing strong recovery signs.
Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said the group had been doing 'rather well in
adverse conditions,' and had concentrated on restoring profitability and
generating cash over the past 18 months.
Tight control on costs, including a further reduction in the workforce from
2,150 at the end of October to 2,080 at the period-end, helped boost
operating profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 9.27m.
Earnings per share jumped 37 per cent to 13.67p (9.97p) and the interim
dividend is lifted to 3.5p (3p).
Net interest charges dropped to Pounds 81,000 (Pounds 608,000) reflecting
the reduction in net borrowings made possible by strong cash generation.
Borrowings fell from Pounds 7.4m at the end of October to Pounds 1.8m and
gearing dropped from 12.9 per cent to 2.9 per cent.
Looking ahead Mr Leonard said that having strengthened profitability and the
financial position of the company 'our next priority is to ensure a
resumption of sales growth.'
Provided there is no marked deterioration in international trading
conditions in the second half he expects the group to achieve a
'significant' full-year profit improvement.
COMMENT
With almost 80 per cent of turnover coming from outside the UK, sterling's
devaluation has significantly improved competitiveness. Sales are lower in
Germany where the group has a relatively small presence, but are holding up
elsewhere in continental Europe and growing strongly in the US. The one
blackspot is the process automation business focused on the UK where
customers are still postponing big investment projects. But after cutting
the cost base the group is well positioned to take advantage of any upturn.
Pre-tax profits this year should reach Pounds 19.9m producing earnings per
share of 30p. Based on yesterday's share price of 591p, up 3p, the shares
are on a lofty but well deserved prospective multiple of 19.7.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Howden to spend Pounds 15m to diversify fan
side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWDEN GROUP will spend Pounds 15m on restructuring the fan manufacturers
which it has bought in an attempt to diversify out of large-scale
contracting work.
A total of Pounds 40m has recently been spent in acquiring Novenco, a Danish
maker of industrial fans, and Buffalo Forge, a US fan and air-handling
business. About 400 jobs will be shed in the US, and 250 from the enlarged
group's European fan division.
These substantial balance sheet provisions were revealed yesterday when the
group reported an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds
18.5m over the year ended May 3 1993. Sales rose from Pounds 292.3m to
Pounds 335m.
Profits were reduced by an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.46m after the
final settlement of a dispute over tunnelling machines which the group
supplied to Denmark. This ended a bitter wrangle which caused Howden heavy
losses and a crash in its share price in 1990.
Mr John Jackson, chairman, said Howden's prime objective was to complete the
successful integration of the past year's acquisitions, particularly in
North America.
Order intake totalled Pounds 266m (Pounds 278m) which was 'satisfactory' in
current circumstances. During the year management had responded to a more
competitive environment by cutting costs, and the overall workforce fell by
10 per cent to about 4,500, excluding the Buffalo acquisition.
Mr Johnny Johnsen, chief executive, said he hoped to move away from Howden's
traditional contract business of supplying specialised fans for power
stations, which came through erratically.
Instead, he wanted to focus on smaller industrial fans, which yielded higher
profit margins.
He said business was flat in the UK and Europe, but recovery was firmly
established in the US. He saw the greatest new opportunities in south-east
Asia and the group was in talks about setting up a joint venture in China.
Earnings per share came to 6p (5.5p). A final dividend of 1.45p on increased
capital gives a total for the year of 2.2p (2p).
COMMENT
Having finally got out of the hole represented by the Danish tunnelling
contract, Howden still has its work cut out. The group issued 62m shares in
the last year to fund acquisitions, and analysts estimate that pre-tax
profits will have to increase from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 24m just to avoid
dilution of earnings. Focusing on smaller fans seems plausible, but the
group makes no bones that the trading outlook is tough - particularly in
Europe and the UK. Institutional investors have supported the cash calls and
the shares have risen from 33p in October to close unchanged at 78p
yesterday. They are unlikely to advance further until the success of the new
strategy becomes clearer.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;P recovery gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;P, the personal computer distributor and computing services company, saw
pre-tax profits double on flat revenues in the six months to May 31 1993, as
it continued to recover from the effects of the debilitating price war in
the personal computer business.
Mr David Southworth, managing director, said the improvement confirmed the
strategic decision to withdraw from the distribution of low cost, high
volume, products to concentrate on high value added services, including
video conferencing and multimedia.
Profits before tax were Pounds 2m (Pounds 1m) from turnover of Pounds 121.8m
(Pounds 119.3m).
Turnover on continuing operations after disposal of the high volume business
was Pounds 104.8m (Pounds 91.6m), while operating profit on those businesses
was ahead 60 per cent at Pounds 2.4m.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 2.1p (1p) and an interim dividend of
0.8p (0.7p) is declared.
Mr Southworth said that there was 'quiet satisfaction' that the group, one
of the UK's largest personal computer distributors, was well on course for
recovery.
He said the level of corporate investment was high although small businesses
were spending money on information technology only sluggishly.
Plans to invest were still being delayed, moreover, by the need to make
decisions over future technological developments. Corporates were undecided
whether to invest in Intel's new Pentium chip technology or to opt for Risc
technologies from other suppliers.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Avesco losses Pounds 0.2m below forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AVESCO, which serves the broadcasting, television and video markets, cut
pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 1.35m in the year ended March 31
1993.
The loss was also Pounds 200,000 below the forecast made with the Pounds 12m
rights issue in March.
Shareholders' funds had more than doubled and the group was in a much
stronger financial position, said Mr Richard Murray, chairman.
VideoLogic's planned expansion continued and its alliance with IBM to
produce low cost multimedia solutions had already resulted in the first
product, Mediator LC.
Each of the service businesses was profitable and their outlook for the
coming year was encouraging with growth expected in all areas.
AVS Broadcast, the television products operation, substantially reduced its
loss in the second half and should improve in the current year.
Turnover in 1992-93 expanded from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 23.4m. To the
operating loss of Pounds 140,000 (Pounds 1.52m) VideoLogic contributed
Pounds 677,000 (Pounds 673,000), television products Pounds 558,000 (Pounds
709,000), and services division profit Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 164,000).
Discontinued activities accounted for losses of Pounds 5,000 (Pounds
202,000).
Losses per share came to 2.2p (3.4p).

<TEXT>
Evans of Leeds, the family-controlled north of England-based property
company, yesterday reported virtually static profits of Pounds 8.79m
pre-tax, against Pounds 8.52m, for the year to end-March.
Net asset value was slightly lower at 196p (201p) per share.
Mr Bill Gibson, director, said: 'Property valuations slightly went down.
Adjusting for sales and acquisitions the fall is less than 2 per cent.'
Gross rental income totalled Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 18.3m). Net rent, after
property expenses, reached Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 16.9m).
Income from the sale and development of property dipped to Pounds 4.02m
(Pounds 4.87m).
Interest accounted for Pounds 9.09m (Pounds 9.01m). The company ended the
year with gearing at 53 (58) per cent.
A proposed final dividend of 3.14p makes a 4.57p (4.15p) total. Earnings per
share improved to 11.36p (10.67p).

FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dublin approves Aer Lingus
rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AER LINGUS, the Irish state airline, last night received the government
approval for its rescue plan which includes the shedding of more than 25 per
cent of the 5,500 workforce and open up the possibility of direct
transatlantic flights between Dublin and the United States.
The cabinet finally gave clearance to the plan despite last-ditch efforts by
the airline's trade unions and supporters of the so-called Shannon stopover
to have it extensively modified.
Mr Brian Cowan, the transport minister, told the Dail (parliament) that the
airline was facing unprecedented losses and that time was running out to
save it.
This year, the air transport division is expected to loseIPounds 64m (Pounds
61m) after registering a loss of IPounds 50m last year.
The government has promised a capital injection of IPounds 175m over the
next three years conditional on union acceptance of the rescue plan.
Mr Bernie Cahill, executive chairman, last night called upon unions to
'respond positively' to the plan, adding: 'The alternative would be to
witness the inexorable decline of Aer Lingus.'
Mr Paul O'Sullivan, the main representative of the trade unions, said,
however, that he was extremely disappointed by the government's endorsement.
Business leaders in the Shannon region of the west of Ireland also expressed
anger at the decision claiming that the ending of the Shannon stopover will
have a severe adverse economic impact on the area.
For the first time direct flights will now become possible between Dublin
and the US, which should attract new carriers to the route.
Mr Cowan said he would open talks shortly with the US aviation authorities
to negotiate a new bilateral agreement covering air transport between the US
and the republic. Aer Lingus at present carries about 500,000 passengers a
year across the Atlantic.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Loss of Pounds 586,000 at Sims Food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMS FOOD GROUP, the meat processor and supplier, fell into the red in the
year to March 31 after an exceptional provision of Pounds 6.59m. A warning
of the loss had been given a month ago.
From pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.84m restated for FRS 3, the group fell to
losses of Pounds 586,000.
The exceptional charge covered the writing-off of under-utilised equipment
for storing meat under pressure, the clearing of the non-core Country Feast
and J Redmond, and the restructuring and reduction of the catering and
retail divisions to reflect more accurately lower demand.
Turnover rose 24 per cent to Pounds 312.7m (Pounds 251.4m). Stripping out
the effect of acquisitions, underlying organic growth was 9 per cent. Mr
David Brady, finance director, said this was encouraging, given static meat
prices over the year. He added however that margins had been badly eroded.
Part of the problem was that Sims had incurred EC-driven capital expenditure
more quickly than turned out to be necessary because a three-year period of
grace had been granted.
Further, the devaluation of sterling and the alignment of 'green rates of
currency' more directly with market rates led eventually to shortage-driven
price rises, only part of which the supermarkets helped absorb.
Earnings per share last time of 15.9p were turned into losses of 5p.
However, again as forewarned in June, the final dividend is reduced to 4.5p
(8.25p), resulting in a total of 7.5p (11.25p) for the year.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Midlands Electricity lifts dividend by
15.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLANDS ELECTRICITY rounded off the power company results season yesterday
with a 17.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a 15.9 per cent rise in
the dividend - one of the strongest in the sector.
Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman, described the result as 'excellent' and said it
bore out Midlands' aim to be a broadly defined energy company.
'I have great confidence in the future', he added.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 142.1m to Pounds 167.1m, equivalent to a
13.9 per cent rise in earnings per share. The board is recommending a final
dividend of 4.65p, making a total for the year of 20p including the second
interim dividend paid in April. This compares with last year's total of
17.25p.
Mr Townsend said the benefits of Midlands' performance had been shared
almost equally between shareholders, the customers who got tariff reductions
of 4 per cent, and the tax man.
Much of the profit increase came from a 6.7 per cent reduction in costs,
including the loss of 350 jobs over the year. Further manpower reductions
are envisaged, bringing annual savings to Pounds 20m. The operating profit
on distribution increased from Pounds 137.8m to Pounds 144.3m, and on supply
from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 18.8m. The number of electricity units
distributed increased by 0.3 per cent.
Midlands' interest in power generation took shape with the opening of the
Teesside gas-fired plant in which it has a 19 per cent stake. The company is
now part of an international consortium, Wing Merrill, which is looking at
further generation projects in Kuwait, China and Turkey.
Among other businesses, the new retail gas subsidiary acquired 1,000
customers and produced a small operating profit. The retailing side was also
in profit, but during the year it was merged into a new venture with
Southern and Eastern Electricity which has incurred heavy start up costs.
Gearing was reduced during the year to 1 per cent with the repayment of
Pounds 75 of government debt.
COMMENT
The shares gained 8p to 491p in a buoyant electricity market on a result
that was stronger than it looked. Midlands tucked away Pounds 38m of
provisions, and resisted the temptation to round off the results with a
dividend increase to top the rest. The prospects depend on how successful
Midlands is with its 'energy company strategy'. It makes sense to widen its
base in the business, but is it prudent for a REC to be building power
stations in China? Midlands is an average REC share, and its reluctance to
make firm pronouncements about dividend prospects mean it will probably stay
that way. The prospective yield is a shade under 6 per cent.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Greenalls sees savings from bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALLS Group, the pubs and hotels company which has made an agreed Pounds
214.3m offer for JA Devenish, the west country pubs group, said yesterday
that it expects to generate some Pounds 3.5m in annual cost savings as a
result of the proposed acquisition.
The deal would add 550 pubs to Greenall's present estate of 1,450, and the
offer document published yesterday identifies areas where cost savings are
expected to be made.
These include economies of scale and improved overhead absorption resulting
from the elimination of duplicated costs and the potential for Stretton
Leisure, Greenalls' machine distribution company, to supply amusement, games
and music machines to the Devenish pubs.
Reflecting a slightly more bullish appraisal of trading prospects Greenalls
is now predicting that, after taking into account the savings, the
acquisition of Devenish will be non-dilutive in the first full year.

AS HAD been prefigured almost a month ago Sims Food Group, the meat
processor and supplier, fell into the red in the year to March 31 after a
non-recurring exceptional provision of Pounds 6.59m.
From pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.84m restated for FRS 3, the group fell to
losses of Pounds 586,000. Turnover rose to Pounds 312.7m (Pounds 251.4m), an
advance of 24 per cent, though Sims said, stripping out the effect of
acquisitions, that there had been an underlying organic growth of 9 per
cent.
Mr David Brady, finance director, said this was 'encouraging', given overall
static meat prices over the year. Interest payable grew to Pounds 2.21m
(Pounds 1.66m).
Mr Brady said that behind the exceptional charge - to cover the writing-off
of under-utilised equipment for storing meat under pressure, the clearing of
the non-core Country Feast and J Redmond, and the restructuring and
reduction of the catering and retail divisions to more accurately reflect
lower demand - lay badly eroded margins.
Part of the problem was that Sims had outlaid EC-driven capital expenditure
more quickly than turned out to be necessary because a three-year period of
grace had been granted.
Further, the devaluation of sterling and the alignment of 'green rates of
currency' more directly with market rates led eventually to shortage-driven
price rises, only part of which the supermarkets helped absorb. Mr Brady
said that all the bad news was in these figures, though prices were unlikely
to fall much within the next two years.
Sims commands some 40 per cent of the fast-food hamburger market and is the
second biggest supplier of fresh meat to the catering trade.
Earnings per share last time of 15.9p were turned into losses of 5p.
However, again as forewarned in June, the final dividend is reduced to 4.5p
(8.25p), resulting in a total of 7.5p (11.25p) for the year.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho recruits Capel to rebuild bridges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, has recruited James Capel as
its joint stockbroker to rebuild bridges with institutional investors.
Lonrho's financial advisers see the move as part of a campaign by Mr Dieter
Bock, joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, to establish better
relations with fund managers. Institutional shareholders, disenchanted with
the group's performance, had been heavy sellers during the last few years
before Mr Bock's investment.
Mr Andrew Skinner, director of James Capel, said it had been chosen because
of its strong relationship with institutions. Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull Securities will continue to act as joint broker.
Lonrho has dismissed as 'speculation' reports that its efforts to seek a
rapprochement with the City are part of a longer-term goal of seeking new
funds via a rights issue. The group's shares yesterday rose 2p to 126p.
Capel's appointment comes more than a year after UBS, which had been the
main marketmaker in Lonrho shares, resigned in protest at Lonrho's lack of
consultation over its big deals.
UBS was particularly irritated by the group's failure to tell it of its
decision to sell a third of its holding in Metropole Hotels to the Libyan
government-controlled Libyan Arab Finance Company for Pounds 177m.
It is understood that James Capel has been assured that it will be notified
of the group's strategy before it is carried out.
In a separate move Krupp, Germany's diversified steel and engineering group,
said it was talking to Lonrho with the aim of buying back the conglomerate's
50 per cent stake in the Krupp-Lonrho trading company.
Krupp, formed through merger of the Krupp and Hoesch groups, returned a loss
of DM250m (Pounds 98.4m) in 1992.
Mr Bock has told his advisers that the sale of the stake in Krupp-Lonrho is
part of a wider strategy of good housekeeping and the relinquishing of some
of its bigger associates which have not helped cash flow.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: A complex deal to secure the future - The
rescue package agreed with Postel for Greycoat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTEL's proposed rescue package for Greycoat is a complicated deal
involving a placing, an issue of warrants, two rights issues, a property
sale and the restructuring of two bonds.
The complexity of this refinancing mirrors the traditionally complex nature
of Greycoat's funding arrangements. Until recently, Greycoat prided itself
on the sophistication of its finances as much as the quality of its
buildings.
Greycoat stood out among property companies for its innovative, carefully
structured funding arrangements. It used deep discount bonds to defer
interest payments during the early years of a development's life. It was
confident that rents would increase sufficiently to provide the income to
pay the increased interest bill when it fell due.
But the collapse in property values undermined its assumptions. It became
increasingly clear that it would have problems repaying a Pounds 50m zero
coupon bond in 1995 and paying an additional Pounds 9.375m annual interest
to holders of stepped interest bonds from September 1996.
Greycoat's increasingly parlous financial position forced it to sell
property in an attempt to reduce gearing. In the past year it sold Pounds
197m of properties, often below their March 1992 valuations.
This effort to reduce its gearing did not go far enough. Greycoat said
yesterday that if Postel's proposals were not approved 'there is a risk that
at any early stage the group would face serious difficulties which would
jeopardise its future.'
If the company went into administration, its value would be diminished by
the need to sell properties on a forced sale basis, the cost of unwinding
long-term finance and the acceleration of the repayment to bondholders.
Payments to unsecured creditors 'would be seriously at risk and, therefore,
there would be no surplus available for distribution to either preference or
ordinary shareholders,' it said.
The deal proposed by Postel involves sharing the pain between shareholders,
bondholders and preference shareholders.
Under the deal, Postel will underwrite a 4-for-1 rights issue at 12 1/2 p
per share to raise Pounds 58.9m.
It will also underwrite a further rights issue of one new ordinary share for
each existing preference share at 12 1/2 p to raise Pounds 6.25m.
The deal also involves Greycoat placing 30m shares with Postel at 15p per
share to raise Pounds 4.5m; Postel receiving 37.5m warrants convertible into
ordinary shares in Greycoat at any time up to 2000 at 25p per share.
In addition, Greycoat will buy a property called Hill House from Postel for
Pounds 58.5m in the form of 125m 9 per cent cumulative redeemable preference
shares 2014 of 40p and a cash payment of Pounds 8.5m. Greycoat needs to win
approval from its bondholders to defer its obligation to pay the Pounds 50m
zero coupon bond due in 1995. It proposes exchanging these bonds for Pounds
40m 7.5 per cent bonds due 2003, secured on Hill House.
Greycoat has also proposed that the holders of the Pounds 150m Britannic
Bond pass control of Britannic House to a new non-recourse vehicle, subject
to option that Greycoat can buy back the property at any time prior to April
2002.
Bondholders will be asked to defer any shortfall in interest for three years
to 2002.
Greycoat is also asking its preference shareholders to waive their
accumulated dividends and reduce the nominal value of their shares from 100p
to 40p and reduce the coupon from 9.5 per cent to 9 per cent.
The deal is subject to approval by Greycoat's shareholders, lending bankers,
bondholders and preference shareholders as well as the Stock Exchange and
the Takeover Panel.
City analysts were divided yesterday on whether to recommend shareholders to
take up their rights. Many said no decision should be taken until the
company publishes its results, together with a detailed circular on the
deal, in six weeks time.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sterling Publishing advances to Pounds 5.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING Publishing Group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.31m for the
year to end-March as new accounting rules forced the company to restate last
time's results as an Pounds 8.09m loss.
Adopting FRS 3, the publisher of advertising-financed journals restated the
1992 figures from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.05m by reclassifying
extraordinary provisions as exceptional charges. The provisions allowed for
disposals following an abortive diversification as well as a Pounds 1.7m
write-down of intangible assets.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 6.56m against a restated Pounds 1.52m as
turnover rose to Pounds 42m (Pounds 41.6m), including Pounds 7.63m from
discontinued operations. The company added 18 new titles in its core trading
subsidiaries, Sterling Publications and Cornhill Publications.
Ms Clare Whitley, finance director, said advertising rates had been
maintained and there had been growth in the exhibitions business. Interest
charges dropped to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.89m), reflecting lower rates
towards the end of the financial year and reduced borrowings. Net borrowings
were Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 17.8m) at the year-end.
Ms Whitley said gearing now stood at about 55 per cent. She said the balance
sheet figure for fixed assets of Pounds 27.8m (Pounds 28.3m) did not include
a value for internally generated titles which directors estimate at about
Pounds 30m, giving gearing of some 25 per cent.
Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman, said the company's telephone sales operations
allowed it to target potential advertisers worldwide: 'This has been
particularly important over the last year with the continuing weakness in
the US and UK economies and the developing recession in western Europe.'
Fully diluted earnings per share on continuing operations rose to 7.8p
(1.5p). A proposed final dividend of 2.4p gives a total for the year of 3p
(2.5p).

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Heavy trading in Celsis shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Celsis ended their first day of trading yesterday up just 1p from
the issue price of 100p after touching 117p in heavy trading.
The company hopes to replace the laboratory agar plate with a faster method
of detecting microbial contamination, but is still developing its product.
The intermediaries offer part of the new issue was nearly four times
subscribed with applications for 27m shares chasing 7m shares on offer.
Investors will have been allocated half what they applied for up to 10,000
shares; 30 per cent for additional shares up to 440,000; and about 16.66 per
cent of the number for shares applied for over and above that.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Moran administration order discharged by
High Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday discharged the administration order in place since
last August on Moran Holdings, the tea producer, freight forwarder and
property developer.
Mr Justice Harman approved a rescue plan following approval by shareholders
of a refinancing at an extraordinary meeting on Monday.
Moran plans to raise Pounds 2.3m from an underwritten rights issue and with
a further Pounds 1.1m loan from Darnforth, a British Virgins Islands-based
subsidiary of Volkart Brothers.
Partners from accountants Touche Ross were the administrators and lawyers
from Lovell White Durant were also involved in preparing the rescue.
Touche said that a last minute injunction issued in Calcutta from a minority
shareholder of Moran Tea Company (India) failed to stop the extraordinary
meeting taking place.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Colefax &amp; Fowler Pounds 395,000 in red and
dividend cut to 1p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COLEFAX &amp; Fowler, the wallpaper and furnishings fabrics manufacturing group,
finished the year to April 30 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 395,000,
compared with a profit of Pounds 704,000.
The result included an exchange gain of Pounds 418,000. Losses per share
came to 1.05p (earnings 3.7p), after a tax credit.
Following a cut of 0.8p in the interim dividend, the final dividend is
similarly reduced to 0.5p for a total of 1p (2.6p).
Mr David Green, chairman, said the decorating division's results were
affected through the weakness of the dollar, leading to a delaying of
projects by American clients, while the current UK economy had a similar
effect on UK clients in relation to decorating projects and sales of
antiques.
He said current trading in the US was slightly improved; in the UK and rest
of Europe conditions continued to be difficult.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Britton to pay Pounds 32m for Taco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITTON GROUP, the packaging company formed last October after the
acquisition by Firstland Group of Gelpack Industrial, is to treble its size
with the takeover of Taco, a privately owned polythene maker, for Pounds
31.6m in cash and shares.
Britton shares were suspended at 13 1/2 p. It is raising Pounds 33m via a
Pounds 15m placing with institutions, a 1-for-1 rights issue at 10p raising
Pounds 13.2m, and an intermediaries offer to raise a further Pounds 4.7m.
The group recently reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.32m for 1992. Mr
Simon Beart, finance director, said this was due to withdrawing from oil and
gas. Gelpack has sales of Pounds 13m and operating profit of Pounds 1.4m.
'The enlarged group will be the second largest extruder of polythene film in
the UK. We are now a substantial player with an ungeared balance sheet,' he
said.
All the company's existing shareholders, which include Mercury Asset
Management with 17 per cent and Royal Insurance with 9 per cent, are taking
up their rights. Mr Beart said 10 new institutions had been brought on board
to widen the ownership of the enlarged group.
The acquisition of Taco includes Pounds 5.4m of debt. If Taco achieves
profits before tax and interest of Pounds 5.1m in the year to April 30 1994,
the vendors will receive another Pounds 5.5m.
In the year ended April 30 1993, Taco reported sales of Pounds 28.6m and
profits before tax, interest and non-recurring costs of Pounds 4.4m.
Britton's shares will be relisted on August 2 if shareholders approve the
deal at an EGM on July 29.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Andrew Knight's trusts sell half News Corp
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FAMILY trusts of Mr Andrew Knight, executive chairman of News
International, have sold more than half their stake in Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation, the newspaper publishing group's parent company.
News Corp said yesterday that the trusts, Blomfield Trustees (Jersey) and
Ernst &amp; Young Trustees of which Mr Knight is a beneficiary, had sold a total
of 3.93m shares in two tranches on July 1 and July 2 at an undisclosed
price. Following the sales the trusts held 3.8m shares.
News Corp emphasised that the trusts had acted on their own initiative and
that the disposal was designed to diversify their holdings which until now
had been entirely in News Corp stock.
Since Mr Knight's appointment at News International in January 1990 News
Corp's shares have risen from about 175p to more than 300p. They closed down
3p at 338p last night. Mr Knight was on holiday yesterday and unavailable
for comment.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Asprey to gain full listing as Sears sells its stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the UK retailer has sold its stake in Asprey, the jewellery group,
for Pounds 92m in a deal that will also allow the USM-quoted jeweller to
graduate to the main market.
Separately, Sears said it would close its Dutch mail order business, Ter
Muelen Post, having decided it could not be turned around.
The two deals conclude a process of focusing on mass market retailing which
began in the mid-1980s when Sears had interests ranging from the William
Hill betting shop chain to engineering and house building companies.
Sears said Asprey was not central to its strategy, nor was it able to
exercise control over its investment. The sale of the Asprey stake will
produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7m. The Pounds 5.5m cost of closing Ter
Muelen, includes Pounds 1.8m in operating losses to June this year,
redundancy costs and asset write-offs.
Smith New Court is understood to have placed the 20.3m ordinary Asprey
shares, representing a 25.38 per cent stake, with about 40 institutions at
267p after taking the stock on to its books in a bought deal. Collins
Stewart converted Sears' preference shares to net 8.25 per cent preference
shares which were also placed with institutions.
The wider share distribution will allow Asprey, capitalised at Pounds 230m,
to achieve a full listing. Mr John Asprey and family trusts increased their
stake to nearly 52 per cent through the purchase of 1.1m additional shares
yesterday, securing the group from takeover.
Mr Naim Attallah, Asprey chief executive, said the group would now
concentrate on growing organically. Since taking control in 1988, Mr
Attallah has led a rapid expansion that included the 1990 purchase of the
Mappin &amp; Webb and Garrard shops from Sears for preference shares, and
Watches of Switzerland from Ratners.
'It is a time for consolidation, although we are planning to open Mappin &amp;
Webb in Prague and probably in Shanghai,' he said.
Asprey reported a pre-tax profit in the year to end-March of Pounds 21.63m
(from Pounds 19.36m) on sales up 35 per cent at Pounds 144.72m. Some Pounds
23m of this arose from sales in acquired companies.
Earnings per share fell from 15.14p to 14.44p and the group is to pay a
final dividend of 4p (from 3.75p) giving a total for the year of 5.1p (from
4.85p).
Asprey said earnings had suffered from the return to a normal tax charge and
margin erosion as the group took some of its acquired companies back
up-market. Mr Ken Taylor, Smith New Court sales director, said that before
yesterday's share placing Asprey had not had a serious institutional
following. The Sears' sale had increased the free float in the shares by 200
per cent.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Apple restructuring will cut 2,500 jobs within a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer, which last month appointed a new chief executive, is to cut
2,500 jobs, reducing its workforce by more than 15 per cent, and carry out a
broad restructuring over the next year.
Yesterday's announcement confirms widespread speculation that the US
personal computer company would make severe cutbacks to reduce costs and
boost flagging profit margins as competition intensifies.
Apple will take charges to cover the costs of redundancies in the current
quarter although it provided no estimate of the amount. Analysts, however,
calculate the charges could be well over Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) and
result in a loss for the quarter.
Most of the redundancies will occur this month. The company provided no
details of its restructuring plans which it said would be revealed later
this month.
Apple is expected to report its third-quarter earnings next week.
Mr Michael Spindler, Apple's new chief executive, who took over from Mr John
Sculley last month, was unavailable for comment on his first decisive
action. Mr Sculley, who remains Apple chairman, is on sabbatical.
However, the restructuring is expected to affect all divisions of the
company and the company's administrative operations may be particularly
vulnerable.
Last month, Mr Sculley warned that Apple's earnings in the second half of
fiscal 1993 would fall below last year's levels. He said the company would
take 'aggressive' actions to boost sales and 'appropriate' actions to create
earnings growth.
Apple's main problem is that its line of Macintosh desktop computers is no
longer gaining market share in spite of aggressive price-cutting. The
company faces intensifying competition from standard PCs based on Intel
chips running Microsoft's Windows software.
Mr Spindler's appointment is widely seen as a move to focus Apple's top
management more directly on its current problems.
Mr Sculley had shown greater interest in building new business opportunities
for Apple in the emerging field of multi-media communications.
Later this summer, Apple is expected to introduce 'Newton' its long-awaited
'personal digital assistant', a pocket-sized device.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Granada takes LWT stake to 20%: TV companies deny merger
talks but seek greater co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group yesterday
increased its stake in London Weekend Television to nearly 20 per cent, the
maximum possible under broadcasting legislation.
The deal means that Granada has invested around Pounds 84m at Pounds 5 a
share in building up its stake in London's weekend television station. It
electrified the ITV sector by buying the initial 14.99 per cent stake a week
ago.
The completion of the move - it was always Granada's intention to take its
investment to the maximum - came a day before talks between Mr Gerry
Robinson, Granada's chief executive, and Sir Christopher Bland, his
counterpart at LWT. At today's meeting the two will explore areas of
co-operation and cost saving.
'We just want to see where we go from here,' said Mr Robinson, adding that
he wanted to examine opportunities for working together.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the nine largest ITV companies, including
Granada and LWT, are forbidden from taking each other over.
The National Heritage Department, following a meeting with the chairmen of
the ITV companies, is considering the case for a relaxation of the rules,
but it is not yet clear whether the government has decided to make such a
move, which would be controversial.
A number of ITV companies, mainly potential takeover targets such as HTV and
Anglia, are opposed to a relaxation of the rules.
Granada's increased stake in LWT has galvanised the City. The shares of a
number of ITV companies have risen on the back of takeover speculation.
Sir Christopher and Mr Robinson rejected any notion that today's talks might
include even exploratory conversations on a possible merger. 'You can't
agree a non-bid and we don't intend to,' said the LWT chairman.
Granada believes that a rationalisation of the ITV ownership structure is
inevitable and views the LWT stake as 'chips' to play with if a bidding war
were to break out.
A takeover of LWT, with its slice of the lucrative south-east advertising
market, would probably be at the top of Granada's list. If that failed, the
stake might be used in a play against Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. LWT recently
bought a stake in Yorkshire.
Analysts have warned that ITV share prices are being held up by takeover
speculation and could fall rapidly if the Government decided against
relaxing the rules in the foreseeable future.

FT  07 JUL 93 / 3i surges despite large write-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i, Britain's largest venture capital company, has nearly Pounds 1bn
available for investment, but despite an upturn in activity has yet to
experience a surge in demand for funds.
A turnround in performance in the second half saw pre-tax profits increase
39 per cent to Pounds 56m for the year to March, the company announced
yesterday. This included an Pounds 8m exceptional gain in the form of
interest on a Pounds 32m tax rebate.
Sales and flotations boosted profits from disposals to Pounds 115m from
Pounds 89m.
But provisions increased sharply from Pounds 61m to Pounds 171m, including a
Pounds 72m write-off of the stake in Isosceles, the parent of Gateway
supermarkets. A further Pounds 69m was written off on UK investments and
Pounds 30m on those overseas. 3i made 644 investments worth Pounds 310m
compared with 822 investments worth Pounds 415m the year before.
It strengthened its balance sheet, reduced its borrowings and achieved a
Pounds 200m improvement in its cash flow position during the year, Mr Ewen
Macpherson, chief executive, said.
Operating costs had been reduced by staff cuts and a streamlining of its
regional office network. 3i increased its share of the market for smaller
company finance from 45 to 48 per cent.
Dividend earnings from investments rose 14 per cent to Pounds 89m while
interest earnings fell 6 per cent to Pounds 118m, reflecting generally lower
interest rates. Fees and other earnings, including the Pounds 8m of interest
on the tax overpayment, increased 21 per cent to Pounds 35m.
Net assets rose by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 1.33bn over the year after falling
by 6.4 per cent during the first half. Net assets per share advanced by 4.6
per cent to 563p.
Earnings per share grew 16 per cent to 15.8p. A final dividend of 8.2p makes
a total of 11.5p, an increase of 5.5 per cent.
3i is expected to announce at its annual meeting on July 28 that Sir George
Russell, chairman and chief executive of Marley, the building materials
group, is to become its new chairman. He is a non-executive director. The
previous chairman, Mr Alan Wheatley, resigned in April when the company
announced it had indefinitely postponed plans for a flotation.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Nokia strengthens its hand in telecoms: The Finnish group's
latest move in the mobile phone market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA, Europe's biggest manufacturer of cellular mobile telephones, moved
yesterday to strengthen its position in Asia and the US by buying out its
partner in two joint ventures.
The purchases continue the Finnish group's efforts to focus on
telecommunications and to lessen its dependence on electronics.
Nokia has bought for Dollars 31.5m (Pounds 21m) the 50 per cent stakes held
by Tandy Corporation of the US, in two mobile telephone manufacturing joint
ventures in South Korea and Texas.
It is also selling its two electrical wholesale units in Finland to Otra, of
the Netherlands, one of the world's largest electrical wholesale groups.
That deal is understood to be worth Dollars 23m.
'We have changed dramatically in the past few years towards being a
telecommunications company and that will continue,' said Mr Jorma Ollila,
Nokia's chief executive.
The moves follow the completion by Nokia last week of the placement with
international investors of 6m preference shares, which raised FM954m (Pounds
113m)to help finance the group's shift away from televisions and other
consumer electronics, which have suffered severe losses in recent years.
About half of Nokia's sales, which last year reached FM18.2bn, are now
accounted for by telecoms. Strong growth in telephone system and mobile
telephone sales enabled the group to return to profit in the first four
months, despite continued heavy losses in consumer electronics which still
make up about a third of group sales.
In the US, Nokia has a 20 per cent share of the cellular telephone
manufacturing market, second to Motorola.
Nokia began making mobile phones in South Korea with Tandy in 1984 through a
company called TMC which now produces 8 per cent of world cellular phone
output. They repeated the formula last year in Fort Worth, Texas, with TNC.
However, Tandy's decision to pull out of manufacturing prompted Nokia to buy
out its partner's shares. Mr Ollila said the ventures would continue to
supply Tandy label telephones to Tandy retail outlets, which would continue
to market Nokia label machines.
Nokia's SLO Tuottajain Kone wholesale electrical outlet in Finland, sold to
Otra, accounts for about one third of turnover in the group's cable and
machinery division, which in turn makes up about 25 per cent of Nokia's
overall turnover. They are the main non-telecoms part of the cable
operation.
With the international market for mobile telecommunications booming, Nokia's
decision to concentrate its resources in the field is unsurprising.
The number of subscribers to cellular networks worldwide rose by 43 per cent
last year, taking it to 23m in January, according to figures collected by
the FT Mobile Communications newsletter.
Growth was driven by markets in North America and south-east Asia, with
subscriber numbers rising by 46 per cent in the US, 54 per cent in
Australia, 56 per cent in South Korea and more than 400 per cent in China,
where it still stands at less than 50,000.
Although last year saw a slowing of growth in Europe, Nokia's strongest
market, momentum is likely to be regained this year with the introduction
across the continent of new digital networks operating to the pan-European
GSM standard, and competitively priced 'low user' programmes geared to the
consumer market.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Bonn sacks prosecutor over shooting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government yesterday sacked its chief state prosecutor, Mr
Alexander von Stahl, in a new, and increasingly desperate, move to allay
public disquiet over the shooting of a suspected terrorist.
The action was ordered as confusion continued to surround the precise
circumstances of how Mr Wolfgang Grams, a suspected member of the fanatical
left-wing Red Army Faction, and a member of the government's crack
anti-terrorist unit both died in a shoot-out in eastern Germany.
Mr von Stahl's enforced retirement was ordered by Ms Sabine
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, justice minister, following the resignation on
Sunday of Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister and a close ally of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The latest move was announced as a measure to preserve the dignity of the
federal prosecutor's office from the confusion surrounding the
anti-terrorist operation 10 days ago, in which Mr Grams and the young
policeman were shot dead and Ms Birgit Hogefeld, a suspected faction member,
was arrested.
Instead, the public impression is one of confusion in the highest offices of
state and an inability to allay fears that the suspected terrorist was shot
dead as he lay wounded and disarmed on the ground.
The country's top police investigator, Mr Hans Ludwig Zachert, head of the
federal criminal investigation office, confirmed yesterday that Mr Grams was
probably shot with his own gun, from extremely close range. He was unable to
confirm precisely what had happened at the end of a gun battle with the
elite GSG-9 anti-terrorist unit on the Bad Kleinen railway station near
Schwerin.
Mr von Stahl, a member of the Free Democratic party in the governing
coalition, is a political appointee, and his retirement had to be ordered by
the justice minister.
In a statement issued last night, Ms Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said that
the importance of the office meant that a prolonged debate over the occupant
would be damaging. She thanked Mr von Stahl for his efforts 'to explain the
terrible events in Bad Kleinen'.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Carmakers see sustained recovery as sales rise 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK motor industry finally acknowledged yesterday that 'clear recovery'
is under way in the UK car market, after reporting a strong rise in new car
registrations during June.
The 11.07 per cent year-on-year increase was the eighth rise in the past 10
months and has convinced the industry that dealers, manufacturers and
importers are moving out of one of the steepest car sales slumps on record.
The June increase has lifted registrations for the first half of the year by
9.14 per cent, with most of the industry expecting a further acceleration in
the second half of the year.
Mr Roger King, public affairs director of the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders, which published yesterday's figures, said: 'The recovery of the
new car market, which has been seen in all but three of the last 15 months,
is now clearly established.'
The UK statistics were released on the day that figures from the
Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers' Association indicated a
deepening of the sales crisis in other large EC markets.
The EAMA estimates that sales fell in Italy by 30 per cent last month, by 24
per cent in Germany, 21 per cent in Spain and Italy, and by lesser amounts
in other markets except Greece - which saw a 60 per cent fall.
The UK is alone among 17 west European states in recording sales growth.
Sales in the EC overall were 17.5 per cent down in the first half of the
year. The gathering gloom on the Continent is dampening some of the buoyancy
of UK-based manufacturers, whose production gains - based on a rising UK
market and a larger share for domestic producers  - are increasingly offset
by the downturn elsewhere in the EC.
Even so, UK car output in the first five months of this year was 9.1 per
cent ahead of the same 1992 period, at 608,169, with May output the highest
for that month in 16 years.
UK-based producers took a 45.52 per cent share of the market last month, up
from 43.48 per cent a year ago, and 45.91 per cent in the first half of the
year against 44.85 per cent in the same period of 1992.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Attali likely to be given Pounds 147,000 payoff by EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali, who is resigning as president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, is likely to receive a tax-free payoff of
more than Pounds 147,000.
Mrs Anne Wibble, chairman of the bank's governors who was in London
yesterday to discuss Mr Attali's compensation arrangements and procedures
for finding his successor, said she expected Mr Attali to receive a year's
salary as an allowance for termination of employment.
Mr Attali's letter of appointment, signed by one of Mrs Wibble's
predecessors, Mr Wim Kok, says his 'annual net base salary' is Pounds
147,000. Mr Attali has had a pay rise since then. 'It seems clear it (the
payoff) will be paid', she said.
Mr Attali resigned on June 25, following months of criticism of expenditure
by the bank. On the morning of his resignation, the Financial Times had
disclosed that he had been reimbursed twice for a first class return flight
to Tokyo and received Dollars 30,000 for giving a speech there.
Mr Attali's letter of appointment says he is entitled to 'a termination
allowance equivalent to one year's net base salary' unless the bank's
governors terminate his contract 'for cause'.
Mrs Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, said a decision on whether to pay Mr
Attali the termination allowance would therefore depend on the outcome of
the investigation into alleged overspending at the bank by the EBRD's audit
committee, due to be completed by mid-July.
She said Mr Attali would remain at the bank until a new president arrived,
which she hoped could be in September. Governors, representing the
governments of 54 countries and agencies which own the bank, have until July
21 to nominate candidates and the election period lasts 21 days from then.
Mrs Wibble ruled out the idea of an interim president being chosen to run
the bank before a successor arrives, although a number of the bank's
executives have been campaigning internally for an interim appointment.
Bank executives and directors believe that Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor
of the Banque de France, will succeed Mr Attali, because he has the support
of a number of the governments from the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries.
In a speech she made to the bank's staff, Mrs Wibble singled out Mr de
Larosiere and Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC economics commissioner, as
having been mentioned in the press as candidates: 'I hope that a consensus
will gradually emerge among the shareholders (the 54 governments and
agencies).'
The successful candidate needs to command the majority support of governors,
who must also own a majority of the shares. The G7 countries, which own more
than half the bank's shares, will therefore have the greatest influence on
the outcome.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UK forecasts are too optimistic, EC monetary committee warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government has come under sharp criticism from its European
Community partners for overestimating the impact of economic growth in
curbing its Pounds 50bn (Dollars 75bn) budget deficit.
The challenge to the credibility of the government's plan surfaced during a
meeting of the EC's secretive monetary committee composed of senior Treasury
and central bank officials from the 12 member states.
It is likely to reinforce the belief that tougher measures, including tax
rises and/or spending cuts, may be needed to restore the worst deterioration
in the UK's public finances since the 1976 sterling crisis.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, Britain's new chancellor of the exchequer, will be
grilled about the government's plans for bringing the economy back into
balance at next Monday's meeting of EC finance ministers.
The target of the monetary committee's criticism is the UK's 'convergence'
plan - the programme to make its economy ready for economic and monetary
union by the end of the decade. The plan is based largely on measures
announced in Mr Norman Lamont's last Budget in March.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, director of the French Treasury and chairman of the
committee, led criticism of the UK government's plans. He challenged its
argument that about 70 per cent of the deficit is 'cyclical' and would
therefore be reduced in the course of economic recovery.
In similar vein, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
estimated last week that only half of the UK's budget deficit - now
accounting for 8 per cent of gross domestic product - was cyclical. The
other half represents a structural increase in spending.
British officials - including Sir Nigel Wicks, the UK representative on the
monetary committee - were reported to have been taken aback by the attacks
on the UK convergence programme.
Officials are scrambling to brief Mr Clarke so that he can present a robust
response at next Monday's Ecofin meeting.
In a separate development, Mr Clarke can expect stiff questions about the
government's medium-term financial strategy in relation to the Maastricht
treaty's plans for economic and monetary union by 1997 at the earliest, or
by the end of the century at the latest.
Under the government's plans, the public sector borrowing requirement is set
to fall from about 8 per cent of GDP in this financial year to 3.75 per cent
by 1997-98. This figure is above the treaty's 3 per cent target. Some member
states have inferred that the UK is signalling that it does not believe in
the early Emu timetable.
British officials retort that the UK Treasury is seeking merely to be
realistic about the difficulties in reducing the deficit in the next five
years. One diplomat noted that Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister,
and Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, had raised doubts about the
1997 Emu target date.
Moreover, some member states are viewed as having produced over-ambitious
convergence programmes to pay lip service to Emu by 1997. Earlier this year,
Greece won endorsement for a plan which foresees a reduction in the budget
deficit as a proportion of GDP from 9.4 per cent in 1992 to 1.6 per cent in
1996.
The Ecofin Council described the Greek programme as 'ambitious' and
'optimistic', but said this was essential in the light of Greece's economic
problems.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the last of the electricity companies finally brings down the curtain on
this year's main results season, an irritating trend is visible. Embarrassed
executives are increasingly refusing to discuss their pay when they announce
their preliminary results, arguing that the information will be disclosed in
the annual report.
Since most publicity is focused on the preliminary results, and annual
reports are not normally newsworthy, this is a pretty clear attempt to avoid
the limelight. Perhaps future artful dodgers will get the publicity which
their shyness and pay rises really deserve.

FT  07 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada's acquisition of a further slice of LWT only makes sense as a
stepping-stone to the wider restructuring of commercial television. As a
trade investment alone the holding hardly makes sense, not least because
Granada is buying LWT shares at an unusually large price-earnings premium.
The financial risk is limited if Granada is eventually forced to sell back
to the market. But that would still tarnish the record of Mr Gerry Robinson,
which has been unblemished since he took the helm.
Mr Robinson's reading of government is clearly that an industry
rationalisation is on the cards. He is betting his reputation as well as
cash on that outcome.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is some justification in 3i's satisfaction with yesterday's annual
results. The group has managed to keep investing during the recession,
though one has to take it on trust that it is only taking on good quality
business; its cost-cutting efforts are beginning to pay off; and its balance
sheet is strong enough for it to take advantage of the recovery. These,
though, are all also reasons for disappointment at the delay in its
flotation.
The past year saw a sharp rise - to Pounds 115m from Pounds 89m - in profits
from the realisation of investments. Evidently 3i's clients have decided
that now is a good time to cash in, a view which is also reflected in the
number of new issues coming to the stock market. Its shareholders, by
contrast, are hanging on for more. This is not just because there is no
longer any need for a fire sale to help the Midland Bank. They seem
genuinely to believe that greater value may be had by waiting.
This may yet prove rash. The value of its portfolio should grow with
recovery. Provisions should also fall from last year's Pounds 171m,
including the appalling Pounds 72m on Isosceles which 3i seems all too
anxious to shrug off. But UK demand for venture capital remains weak, while
3i's relative inexperience in continental Europe makes now a risky time to
be stepping up involvement there.
Recovery has seen a narrowing of the discount to net assets at which quoted
venture capital investment trusts trade. Given its conservative valuations,
3i might not reap much advantage from this trend. It will serve 3i's
shareholders right if they become so greedy they end up losing out.

FT  07 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears' sale of its stake in Asprey and moves to start closing Ter Meulen
Post are useful bits of corporate housekeeping. In particular the cutting of
ties with Asprey underlines that Sears' chief executive, Mr Liam Strong, has
the authority to unwind decisions originally taken by Mr Geoffrey Maitland
Smith, the chairman. Still, the habit of tidiness is not enough when it
comes to squeezing an adequate return from Sears' slumbering assets. The
poor experience in the newly acquired Dutch mail order business also
suggests that accidents continue to happen.
Part of the problem faced by Mr Strong at Sears is knowing where to start.
So far his efforts have been focused on British Shoe, to some effect.
Changing such organisations requires tremendous management momentum.
Replacement of key personnel, a clearly defined and vigorous strategy from
the board and action across a wide front are all needed if the initiative is
not to be smothered with bureaucratic inertia. Witness the very different
but determined approaches of Mr John Hoerner at Burton and Mr Archie Norman
at Asda, who have certainly generated the impression of activity.
Mr Strong has been slower in that regard. While such things are partly a
matter of marketing, that is after all, Mr Strong's speciality. As yet it is
too early to say that the Sears experiment has failed. Unless results are
forthcoming, however, the time may not be far off when the question will be
asked.

FT  07 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Postel delivery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By riding to the rescue of Greycoat, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's new
boss, is indulging a long-standing fascination with property. Given Mr
George Soros' joint venture with British Land, and the spate of rights
issues in the sector, he is not alone in regarding commercial property as
cheap. But it is hardly routine for one of the nation's biggest pension
funds to assume control of a listed company. Underwriting Greycoat's rights
issue suggests greater enthusiasm for the prospects than that mustered by
his peers.
Ordinary shareholders will suffer dilution, but the more difficult task may
be winning the support of bond and preference share holders - not to mention
the banks. The approval of each is required. The rally in Greycoat's
preference shares on Monday, on the assumption that they would be spared any
serious sacrifice, now looks especially misplaced. The nominal value of the
prefs is to be more than halved, future interest payments cut, and deferred
interest lost. Greycoat could yet be undone by its proliferation of capital
instruments.
Without the promised asset valuation the fine details are difficult to
assess. If net assets have fallen anywhere near to the Pounds 80m minimum
demanded by Postel for the deal to go ahead there would be precious little
left over once the banks had exercised their security. That should focus the
minds of bondholders. The more interesting question is why Postel is going
to the trouble of taking control instead of letting Greycoat sink and buying
the best of the assets on the cheap from the banks.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Health and development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Development Report from the World Bank is a timely reminder that
at the root of the world healthcare problem lies a remarkable success: the
increase in the life expectancy of all of the world's citizens. Precisely
how long, and how healthy, their lives will be is still excessively
determined by place of birth. But the rules for serving their rising health
needs as well as possible are the same the world over.
In 1950, a child born in the developing world had a life expectancy of 40
years. Today it is 63 years. The chance of that child dying before the age
of 5 is now 1 in 10, nearly three times lower than in 1950. The World Bank's
report, Investing in Health, pays due tribute to such achievements, the
result of gains in income and education as well as concerted public health
programmes.
Not that there is room for complacency. As the report notes, infant
mortality is still 10 times higher in the developing world than in the
established market economies because easily preventable health problems
persist. Some 43 per cent of the burden of disease in Sub-Saharan Africa is
due to complaints such as measles, which are cheaply prevented or cured. The
report argues that governments could make progress even on existing budgets,
by targeting funds more effectively.
Broad scope
The Bank's recommendations see a broad scope for the developing world to
learn from the developed. Strategies which richer countries have found only
belatedly in the face of rising health costs could be adopted now in many
low and middle income countries. These would produce immediate gains in
terms of human life as well as ensuring that future economic development has
the maximum possible effect on health and living standards.
Governments must target what they spend towards those services which offer
the biggest return. The difficult calculation about the balance of spending
between highly specialised treatments and simpler procedures of wider value
applies in both rich and poor countries. In the developing world, many still
die for lack of access to clean water.
At the same time, the report encourages developing countries to promote
diversity and competition in the funding and delivery of health services.
The breadth of the Bank's experience enables it to show where lessons learnt
in high income countries - about the dangers of fee-for-service insurance
systems, for example, or scope for localised decision-making - can valuably
be applied in poorer regions.
Donors' role
Growth in understanding of these points is at least as important as overall
spending levels. The report notes that the share of overseas aid devoted to
health fell from 7 to 6 per cent during the 1980s and argues that this cut
should be restored. The Bank also points to a World Health Organisation
estimate that less than half of all medical equipment in developing
countries is usable. Donors clearly have a part to play in ensuring that
money is wisely spent.
The report also focuses upon two controversial areas: Aids and
tobacco-related diseases. On current trends, each will be killing around 2m
people a year in developing countries within 10 years. There is little
support in this report for a fashionable western view that too much money is
being spent on research into combatting Aids, although in the developing
world, the key message is that preventive measures are as potentially
effective as they are inadequately available. Diseases caused by tobacco
also call for determined preventive programmes, although here the developed
world's stance is compromised by the commercial interests of its cigarette
manufacturers.
The core message of the Bank's report is that investment in health and in
growth are two sides of the same coin. There is a 'mutually reinforcing
cycle' from improved health standards to higher productivity and stronger
economic growth. The world's richest countries, as represented today at the
G7 summit in Tokyo, have a role to play at each stage of the cycle, through
nurturing information flows, aid programmes and, most important of all, the
further development of a liberal system of international trade.
