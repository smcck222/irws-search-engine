FT  03 JUL 93 / Scepticism mounts at Westminster over claims by Mates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, ANDREW JACK, JOHN MASON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL MATES, the former Northern Ireland minister, yesterday tried to
revive his campaign for an inquiry into the Serious Fraud Office as mounting
scepticism among MPs threatened to undermine his credibility at Westminster.
Mr Mates repeated his claims of possible collusion between the SFO, the
Inland Revenue and the police in preparing a case against Mr Azil Nadir, the
fugitive businessman, calling for a 'quick, independent' inquiry.
His renewed allegations were again denied by Mr George Staple, director of
the SFO, who said his staff had 'nothing to hide'.
Meanwhile, there were reports that Mr Nadir was trying to escalate his
campaign against the SFO from his new base in Northern Cyprus by releasing
apparent transcripts of the closed court proceedings concerning allegations
of an attempt to bribe the trial judge, Mr Justice Tucker.
Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, the barrister who acted for Mr Nadir, also demanded
an inquiry into allegations of a plot to bribe the trial judge and a
conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Mr Scrivener called on Sir
Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to publish all his correspondence on
the bribery allegations.
MPs on all sides at Westminster, most of whom are against an inquiry into
the SFO, have become increasingly wary of some of Mr Mates's allegations.
Doubts about the validity of the MP's defiant campaign have been fuelled
further by apparent contradictions in his account of events over the past 10
days.
On June 24, the day before his resignation as a minister, Mr Mates indicated
through close associates that he had not made allegations of any nature
against the British security services.
He responded to newspaper reports of his alleged concern about MI6 by
suggesting that his doubts were confined to the possibility that the Greek
security service had been attempting to destabilise Mr Nadir.
But the release this week of his correspondence with the attorney-general
revealed that he had voiced concern about the possible role of MI6.
Meanwhile, Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy, rejected as
incomplete and inaccurate Mr Mates's suggestions that Mr Nadir had not had
access to the documents seized as a result of a court order.
He also revealed that as a result of redirecting Mr Nadir's mail with a
court order he had identified a Mercedes car and a Luxembourg bank account
containing several thousands of pounds which Mr Nadir had illegally failed
to disclose.
David Owen writes: The government, asked yesterday if the edited
correspondence between Mr Mates and senior law officers would ever be
published, said it could be when there was 'no longer a risk of prejudice to
the trial and publication would be consistent with the Crown's obligations
to the court'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUTH African government and the African National Congress last night
forced through agreement on a date for the country's first multiracial
election, over-ruling the objections of rightwing parties who walked out of
negotiations in protest.
The 26-party negotiating forum also agreed in principle to establish a
Transitional Executive Council to oversee government in the run-up to the
election, on April 27 next year, but avoided difficult debate on the powers
it would exercise. The Inkatha Freedom Party and its white rightwing allies,
known as the Concerned South Africans Group, rejected this as well.
However, officials of the right made clear that they would return to the
talks when negotiations resume after a two-week break.
Yesterday's deal, which is of little more than symbolic importance, was
clearly timed to coincide with the visit to the US of Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC
leader, and President FW de Klerk. Yesterday the two separately met
President Bill Clinton, and were obviously keen to present him with evidence
of progress in democracy talks.
Mr de Klerk said he was confident the remaining US economic sanctions
against South Africa would be lifted soon. 'We will make the necessary
breakthroughs. It is just a matter of time,' he said after a meeting with Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
Mr Mandela had planned to use his US visit to call for the lifting of
remaining sanctions, but Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said ANC
preconditions for lifting sanctions had not been met by yesterday's
agreement.
Mr Ramaphosa still lauded yesterday's deal, saying 'the democracy train is
on track'.
Despite the fanfare, little concrete progress towards democracy was made
yesterday. Decisions on the toughest constitutional issues, including
whether South Africa should be a unitary or a federal state, how power
should be shared in the first elected government and how the country should
be governed in the run-up to the first election, were largely deferred.
The forum simply finalised an earlier agreement in principle on the date,
which must remain merely a target until a new constitution has been agreed.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Clinton cautious over progress on trade at summit: President
doubts G7 meeting will stop economic friction between Japan and US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has only modest hopes that next week's summit in
Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations can achieve a
critical breakthrough in the long-stalled Uruguay Round of trade talks.
He also doubts that an agreement with Japan on bilateral frictions can be
reached in Tokyo, largely because of current Japanese political uncertainty.
But he said the Japanese people should view their political transition with
'excitement and interest' and as a positive development.
His comments came in an Oval Office interview with journalists from the G7
nations, of which the Financial Times was the UK newspaper representative.
It is believed to be the first session Mr Clinton has held exclusively with
foreign correspondents since taking office in January.
In general, he was bullish about the prospects for the summit. He predicted
'serious discussions' on co-ordinating macro-economic policies, trade and
exploring new ways of attacking structural economic difficulties,
particularly unemployment. He suggested this last category would be explored
fully at a summit 'for perhaps the first time'.
He hoped for 'genuine progress' on the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But he fell short of predicting summit
agreement, preferring instead to talk of 'increasing the chances that we
will successfully conclude Gatt by the end of this year'.
Anticipating that Tokyo might confine itself only to a general exhortation,
he said the words in the communique should be seen as far less important
than the 'tone, atmosphere and ideas' discussed in the Japanese capital.
He was sure the G7 process served a purpose. 'Our job is to lead. I know it
is difficult to lead when you have troubles yourselves, and all of us have
economic troubles. All of us to a greater and lesser extent also have
political conflict within our countries.'
But if the G7 played to its strengths - he cited its innovative workforces,
technological competence and understanding of how economies worked - and if
co-ordinated policies were put in place, 'I think G7 meetings can really
make a difference'.
Administration officials have ducked questions about any failure to make a
final push towards a Uruguay Round agreement. But, in a briefing this week,
one senior official hinted that the US might be prepared to accept, as an
interim measure, a more limited pact on market access measures.
On Japan, Mr Clinton was insistent on 'some realignment in our trade
relations - and I think we're going to work that out'. But he stressed 'the
lots of other things we have in common', on both the economic and security
policy fronts.
Mr Clinton emphasised examples of US economic leadership and rejected
suggestions that there were doubts about the US will to lead. His Dollars
500bn (Pounds 333.3bn) five-year budget deficit reduction plan, now facing a
final test in Congress, constituted the sort of action that other summit
nations had been demanding of the US for years.
He was proud of the initiative to develop a substantial assistance package
for Russia, discussion of which is also on the Tokyo agenda. 'The commitment
to do more for Russia will be clear, substantial and generous because of all
the problems all of our countries have at home,' he said. 'I am expecting a
very successful summit, particularly concerning Russia.'
But he said, with a tacit nod to poor US unemployment figures released
yesterday, that there was only so much the US could do to improve its own
economy. Job creation in the US, two-thirds of which has stemmed recently
from exports, was dependent on recoveries in Japan and Europe.
He also declined to criticise the Bundesbank for being dilatory in cutting
German interest rates, saying that independent central banks should be free
of external criticism. The health of the German economy, he said, was 'vital
for all Americans'.
The latest French complaints about US anti-dumping rulings on steel imports
failed to recognise that US laws were consistent with Gatt rules, he said.
But if France wanted to propose stronger trade enforcement mechanisms he was
always ready to consider them.
On non-economic issues, he said disagreement with Europe over Bosnia was
'the only point of contention between us'.

Intel
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROHM, a Japanese semiconductor maker, said its US subsidiary would claim
royalty fees from Intel of the US and other manufacturers of 'flash memory'
chips. The move follows a US court ruling in a patent dispute between Rohm
and Intel.
Exel Microelectronics, a division of Rohm's US subsidiary, said the US Court
of Appeals had set aside an earlier decision by the US Patent Office
granting Intel 'priority' on the flash memory patent. The issue has been
referred back to the patent office.
'No makers can make flash memories without using Rohm's patent,' Mr Junichi
Shikita, managing director of Rohm's semiconductor operations, said.
Intel, however, said it expected the patent office to reaffirm its earlier
ruling. The process could take one to two years.
It said: 'We don't believe that Rohm has a basis upon which to collect
royalties.'
Flash memory chips represent the fastest-growing segment of the memory chip
market. Although world sales last year were only Dollars 310m, analysts
project 'explosive growth', to Dollars 2.8bn by 1997.
Flash memory can be used as an alternative to personal computer disk drives
for storing programs and data. The chips are smaller, lighter and more
rugged than magnetic data storage devices and are beginning to be used in
the latest pocket-sized and notebook computers.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Manchester picks operator for arena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OGDEN Entertainment Services of New York has signed a 20-year contract to
operate Manchester's new 20,000-seat, Pounds 49m indoor arena. It will
become the company's flagship for European expansion.
Ogden already operates more than 100 venues throughout the US and Canada.
Manchester's arena - which will be the biggest in Europe - is being built as
part of the redevelopment of the city centre's Victoria Station area and
will open in two years. It will be one of the main venues for the Olympic
Games in the year 2000 if the city stages them.
Mr Frank Russo, Ogden's vice-president for international operations, said
yesterday: 'When you look at this from New York, Manchester jumps out at you
as one of the great virgin markets of the world. It has 6.5m people within
one hour's travel. Also, the city really has got its act together.
'This is going to be a 'must play' venue on the world tour.'
The arena will be used for concerts and family shows as well as sporting
events. Mr Russo expects the US National Basketball Association and National
Hockey League to award European franchises, with Manchester an obvious
contender.
The arena will operate with up to 40 full-time staff and 500 part-timers,
some of whom will be required to work up to 60-hour weeks during the
September-April main season. There will also be about 200 contractual
service providers.
Ticket sales in the first year have been budgeted at more than Pounds 15m,
with 1.7m spectators. Ogden's US experience suggests people spend Pounds 10
each on food, souvenirs and other merchandise at each event.

<TEXT>
Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay stockbroker at the heart of India's Rs50bn
financial scandal has claimed that the prime minister's office directly
intervened to help his associate brokers on the stock market in January
1992, two months after Mr Mehta had allegedly given Mr Narasimha Rao Rs10m
for his by-election campaign, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Mr Mehta is being cross-examined by a joint parliamentary committee
investigating the Bombay stock scandal.
The stock-broker made a lengthy written submission detailing the number of
telephone calls he had made to the prime minister's office before he was
nailed as the man who started the financial scandal.
He claimed that two of his associate brokers were saved from disciplinary
action by the Bombay Stock Exchange board when the finance ministry's lone
representative on the board reversed a unanimous decision of 21 directors to
penalise the brokers at the behest of the prime minister's personal
assistant.
Mr Narasimha Rao, on a four-day tour of his home state of Andhra Pradesh,
reiterated at a series of public meetings that he had not taken any money
from Mr Mehta, and rejected opposition demands for his resignation.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Taiwan aims to attract investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS ENGBARTH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN yesterday approved a draft economic programme and a package of
measures to promote private investment in manufacturing and to stem the flow
of capital to China.
The draft, prepared by the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), highlighted the sluggish state of manufacturing and emphasised the
need to promote private investment.
Superficially, Taiwan's economy seems strong. Average real economic growth
between 1988 and 1992 was 6.7 per cent compared to the average world rate of
2.4 per cent over the period.
Government planners expect a 6.33 per cent rise for 1993.
However, the growth in fixed capital investment has been declining from
between 25 and 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the early
1980s to 21.6 per cent of GDP over the past five years. Private capital
investment has been rising by an annual average of only 8.5 per cent from
1988-92.
Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of the CEPD, acknowledged that many manufacturers
'have set up factories in foreign countries or the (Chinese) mainland'.
Estimates of the accumulated capital outflow from Taiwan to mainland China
range from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 20bn since mid-1987 when Taipei began to
lift restrictions on contacts there.
Data from the Central Bank of China show that total net outflow on the
capital account of Taiwan's balance of payments amounted to Dollars 61.9bn
from 1987-91, third only to Japan and Germany.
Mr Siew said the CEPD hoped the measures 'could effectively solve a wide
range of problems faced by private investors such as access to land, labour
supply and higher levels of technology.'
He also said the plan would further Taiwan's development as a regional
centre for research and development, manufacturing, transport and
communications.
The programme includes a medium-term plan to establish a free trade zone on
Taiwan's west coast.
It also promises financial help for large and small-to-medium sized
manufacturers through a NTDollars 40 billion (Dollars 1.5bn) allocation from
the postal savings system. A NTDollars 20bn fund will also be set up to
support technology investments.
Among other measures are a review of Taiwan's land-use development rules, a
review of policy regarding foreign workers to ease labour shortages and
stepped-up efforts to revise the island's working practices.
The plan also calls for streamlining of government organisations and
accelerated efforts to privatise state industries and utilities.

FT  02 JUL 93 / US steel contract back in melting pot: Pensions and profits
block six-year agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MUCH-HERALDED labour agreement by the United Steel Workers Union and one
of the largest US steelmakers has come apart during ratification, sending
negotiators back to the bargaining table.
The contract hit a snag shortly after ratification ballot papers had been
sent to the 9,000 USW members covered by the pact.
The union and Chicago-based Inland Steel discovered serious differences in
the accountancy used to determine pension liabilities and profit-sharing
rights. The differences resulted in about Dollars 5m in lost income for
union members, union negotiators said.
Rather than open the completed ballot papers, which were expected to approve
the contract, local union leaders held them for nearly a week at a post
office in East Chicago, Indiana, and then burned them on Wednesday.
'We're going to have to send a whole new ballot out,' said Mr Gary Hubbard,
a spokesman at the union's national office in Pittsburgh.
Inland Steel and the union announced tentative agreement on the
unprecedented six-year contract on May 27. The current Inland contract is to
expire on July 31.
The new pact was to serve as a model for negotiations at LTV, Bethlehem
Steel and National Steel, the country's largest integrated steel producers,
which also have July 31 contract deadlines.
The agreement provided for high levels of co-operation between the union and
Inland, with both sides seeing it as a stabilising influence on the
industry.
The US steel industry has undergone drastic restructuring in the past
decade. It is fighting competition from abroad and from more efficient
domestic mini-mills with non-union labour.
The incident is an embarrassment for the union and a frustration for Inland.
'It is troubling - we're trying to demonstrate a new partnership and
power-sharing with this contract,' Mr Hubbard said.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Greens withdraw from talks on nuclear energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A YEAR-LONG attempt to reach an all-party consensus on the future of
Germany's nuclear energy has failed following the decision by the Green
party to withdraw from the talks.
The Greens, who want all nuclear plants in Germany closed down, said the
talks were meaningless because the government coalition parties were
unwilling to compromise on their pro-nuclear position.
However, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who have called for phasing
out nuclear energy, said they would continue talks with the government and
the nuclear industry.
In lower Saxony, which has a SPD/Greens coalition government, Mr Gerhard
Schroder, the premier, and a key player in the negotiations, said his party
would spend the summer trying to define the areas in which a compromise
could be reached.
The talks aimed to clarify the long-term prospects for Germany's nuclear
industry. Issues include deciding on how many years existing plants can
continue to operate, whether they will be replaced at the end of their
lifetime and how to dispose of nuclear waste.
Atomforum, the nuclear industry's main lobby, welcomed the fact that
negotiations between the SPD and the government parties would continue.
It said the departure of the Greens would facilitate a compromise.
But the break-down of the consensus talks will make it more difficult to
reach a solution on the disposal of nuclear waste. The Greens are members of
the SPD coalition government in two states where nuclear waste disposal
plans have been mooted.
Seven leading European electricity companies yesterday repeated opposition
to proposals for a European Community energy tax, intended to help combat
global warming, adds Bronwen Maddox, Environment Correspondent.
The joint statement, first made a year ago, was reissued yesterday in London
at a conference because the companies believe there is growing pressure for

FT  02 JUL 93 / Romanian ships deal blocked

<TEXT>
PETROMIN, Romania's largest shipping company, is expected to remain in
Romanian hands after local courts began proceedings to cancel a contract
which would have ceded control to Forum Maritime, a little-known Greek
company.
But the controversy surrounding the proposed deal, and the Romanian
government's failure to come clean about its involvement in the affair, have
done little to enhance the reputation of a country battling to improve its
image with investors.
The deal has revealed the damage caused by the failure to get the country's
privatisation scheme off the ground. Fewer than 100 of the 6,300 state
companies have been transferred into private hands and only four have been
purchased by foreign investors.
It has also emerged that of Petromin's 92 vessels, 14 are already involved
in joint ventures with foreign partners; 18 are under management contracts
with foreign operators; 29 are leased to Romanian companies; while most of
the remainder are broken or still under construction.

FT  02 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent weakness in Standard Chartered, prompted by stories that Lloyds
Bank may well be considering the sale of its near 5 per cent stake in the
bank, was reversed after James Capel, the leading UK agency broker was said
to have upgraded its earnings forecasts. Cazenove, Standard's broker, was
said to have been a strong supporter of Standard shares, with dealers taking
the view that Cazenove had also increased its earnings estimates for the
bank. Turnover in Standard, however, was an unspectacular 865,000 shares.
Barclays continued to attract support on the back of the improving market
for land and property in the south-east, highlighted in the recent joint
survey by Flemings and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and moved up 4 more to 487p. Talk
in the market continued to suggest that news of the appointment of a new
chief executive is imminent.
The Kuwait Investment Office was thought to have sold its 12.34 per cent
stake in Bradstock Group, the insurance broker,via a bought deal. The KIO's
stake of around 6.5m shares were sold at 127p to one of the leading broking
houses, who sold the stock on at 128 1/2 p a share. Bradstock shares closed
unchanged at 141p.
HSBC gave up an early 3p gain to end a busy session a net 5 off at 662p
following what was said to have been aggressive selling by Swiss Bank
Corporation. Turnover in HSBC was 2.5m shares.
Higher half-year losses and a profits warnings sent Eurocamp tumbling, the
shares shedding 28 to 203p. Leisure analysts were told by the company that
one-off factors had been largely responsible for the poor showing and that
fundamentally the group remained sound.
However, some specialists expressed fears that increasing competition in the
continental camping business might be a more pertinent reason for the
decline and posed a longer-term threat to the company's profitability. Mr
Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett said the market was undecided as to whether
Eurocamp's current problems were transitory or not. 'Only time will tell,'
he said. 'In the meantime, the yield will support the shares but they carry
a fairly large risk.' Airtours closed a penny up at 341p.
Southern Electricity surged into the lead in the current spate of dividend
payouts from the 'recs', with a hefty increase of 17.6 per cent. Southern
said its total dividend was 19.6p per share for the year to end March
compared with analysts' expectations which ranged from 18.7p to 19.1p, and
last time's 16.7p. Profits rose to Pounds 187.3m against Pounds 166.3m
previously. The shares put on 10 to 482p.
The remainder of the scrip issue was thought to have been placed in Redland
as two large lumps of 4.2m went through the market to take the day's
turnover to 10m. The shares jumped 7 to 483p as selected building materials
stocks responded positively to the German interest rate cut. Among which,
RMC Group gained 12 to 748p.
City presentations by Tarmac were generally well received, according to
analysts, although the shares declined 3 to 137p as worries persisted over
debt levels and some thoughts that they were fully valued.
A big seller in Spring Ram sparked renewed fears over the group's trading
and the shares dropped 6 to 44p. Results from BPB contained few surprises
and the shares drifted down a penny to 223p.
There was yet another cash call in the stirring property sector as Asda
Property launched a 2-for-5 issue to raise Pounds 16.3m. The shares fell 3
to 86p, 11p below the 75p rights price.
Guinness shares continued their good run, although drinks analysts continued
to talk down any impact from the Japanese duty reductions. The shares gained
5 to 476p. Vaux benefited from optimism in the hotel market and added 5 to
235p.
A rumoured downgrade in Storehouse, said by dealers to be from James Capel,
saw the shares drop back 6 to 206p. A positive statement and results from
Tie Rack helped it to move ahead 3 to 130p. There was some reported
switching out of Kingfisher, off 5 at 599p, and into WH Smith, ahead 8 1/2
at 441p.
Hopes of a settlement between Eurotunnel and the construction contractors
boosted shares in the channel tunnel operator. They added 7 to 413p. Bargain
hunters in Tiphook helped the shares recover from recent falls to end 7
better at 329p.
Strong two-way business was seen in international conglomerate Hanson,
following Wednesday's announcement that it is to buy Quantum Chemical of the
US in a Dollars 3.2bn deal. Turnover for the day was just over 22m as the
shares followed the market lower, closing 1 1/2 down at 225p.
Standard &amp; Poors, the US credit rating agency, said it had affirmed its A+
rating on Hanson Overseas BV and an A-1+ rating on Hanson Finance UK in the
wake of the agreed bid.
Several stocks in the motor sector with substantial German interests were
boosted by the news of the reduction in interest rates.
These included Lucas Industries 4 better at 140p, with sentiment boosted by
further reflection on Wednesday's announcement that the company is to supply
its electronic diesel fuel injection system to Mercedes Benz.

<TEXT>
Oil shares were largely unmoved by news that Iraq may well agree terms with
the UN at a meeting on Wednesday and sell up to 600,000 barrels of oil a day
on the international market for humanitarian reasons. Oil prices tumbled as
the news emerged, with August Brent sliding around 30 cents a barrel.
'The news is worrying and in any event oil shares have not reflected the
fall in sterling oil prices since the Opec meeting,' said Mr Brendan Wilders
at Hoare Govett. 'We view the sector as fully valued,' he added.
No real pressure emerged in the sector, however, despite the opening decline
on Wall Street. BP settled 3 down at 305 1/2 p on relatively small turnover
of 9.9m, while Shell dipped 4 to 627p on 4.2m traded.

<TEXT>
In a perky food manufacturing sector, Hillsdown Holdings led the way forward
as the group said trading was in line with market expectations and that
interim operating profits to June would be at least Pounds 80m against
Pounds 81.8m last year. Dealers said there was a considerable relief factor
that Hillsdown had made a good recovery from its problems. Last year's
profits were dented by oversupply in the chicken market. Hillsdown shares
added 7 to 144p on hefty turnover of 13m.
A rumoured review of the food manufacturing stocks, said to be by UBS, added
spice to the sector which has languished in the doldrums in recent sessions.
Associated British Food gained 5 to 489p, Booker 6 to 393p, and
Cadbury-Schweppes 3 to 467p. Devro International's second day in the market
brought further rewards, the shares adding 6 to 199p. They came to the
market at 170p on Wednesday.

CABLE and Wireless advanced strongly as it announced a new pricing structure
for its Mercury telecommunications subsidiary. The shares jumped 12 to 787p,
before fading at the close to finish a net 6 ahead at 781p. Turnover was an
unimpressive 1.2m.
Telecoms specialists said the Mercury move was an attempt to spike British
Telecom's guns, which is thought likely to publish its revised tariff list
later in the summer. C&amp;W said it was introducing 'duration discounts' -
initially between the UK and US - which would give lower charges for longer
residential telephone calls.
It also revealed lower charges for a range of international destinations -
designated as a key battle area between BT and Mercury by telecoms analysts.
However, line rentals increases are also planned, C&amp;W said. BT declined 3
1/2 to 425p.

FT  02 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities unsettled by profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AIR of anti-climax pervaded London's equity market yesterday with
periodic bouts of profit-taking eroding share prices despite a wave of good
news on the international interest rate front.
Adding to a generally uneasy close in London was renewed concern about Wall
Street and what is increasingly viewed by many as a faltering US economy.
The widespread profit-taking in London share prices saw the FT-SE 100 index
give up all its hard won gains that followed the interest rate reductions
instigated by the Swiss and German authorities. The FT-SE 100 ended a
volatile session a net 11.2 off at 2,888.8.
There was more comfort for investors, however, in the performance of the
wider market, where the second-tier UK stocks continued to make strong
progress. The FT-SE Mid 250 index continued its recent upward move,
attaining another record closing high point of 3,241.7, up six points on the
session and well below its intra-day high-point.
Turnover in London picked up from the rather depressed levels seen earlier
in the week. Over 650m shares were traded yesterday, well up on Wednesday's
550.4m.
The concentration of turnover in non-FT-SE 100 stocks, where some 410m
shares traded compared with 240m FT-SE 100 shares illustrated the underlying
strength of the UK market, dealers said.
The value of customer business remained above the crucial Pounds 1bn level
on Wednesday when turnover was recorded by the stock exchange as being worth
Pounds 1.1bn.
The market session began on a steady note with dealers reluctant to take on
any substantial positions ahead of the news from Leipzig where the
Bundesbank meeting was being held. The FT-SE 100 index opened moderately
higher and held above the 2,900 level for much of the morning before
attracting pockets of resistance in the middle of the morning session
despite the cut in Swiss interest rates, seen as a harbinger of a reduction
in German interest rates.
London's response to the 0.25 per cent reduction in Germany's Lombard rate
and the 0.5 per cent fall in the discount rate was immediate, with leading
shares moving up strongly. The 100 index reached the day's high, up 6.7 at
2,906.7 within twenty minutes of the news from Germany, but thereafter
drifted off, hit by profit-taking, a feeling that the market had probably
run too far ahead of itself and on a growing conviction that Wall Street may
be due a tumble. Wall Street opened more than six points lower after what
was said to have been more disappointing news on the US economy, before
stabilising and moving into positive territory as London closed.
Financials remained one of the market's best performing areas. Standard
Chartered staged a strong recovery after earnings upgrades by at least one
of the market's leading brokers.
The drugs sector, on the other hand, continued to suffer, with Goldman
Sachs, the leading US investment bank said to have upset the international
drugs stocks by downgrading its sector estimates.
Traders remained happy about the short term outlook for the market. 'It's a
test of nerves and the general consensus is that we're at the top of the
trading range, but the market still feels OK,' said one trader.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG buying of stock index futures following the reduction of interest
rates in several European countries ran out of steam leaving the futures
contract to once again test the 2,900 resistance level, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened quietly at 2,901. Anticipation of
a reduction in German Interest rates drove it gently forward on a squeeze
and the cut in France only served to push it higher.
However, the reduction in German rates just before lunch led to frantic
buying of September. This boosted the contract to the day's best of 2,930,
also helping pull the underlying market higher.
But, with the long anticipated reduction out of the way, dealers chose to
cash in on earlier gains. Together with the dull opening on Wall Street, the
September contract went into retreat surrendering earlier gains.
It finished at 2,902, down 15 on its previous close and around 2 points
ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 11 points.
Volume at the official close was 8,812, though that total improved in after
hours business.
Volume for traded options fell back to 23,886 against a previous total of
32,581 contracts. Some 4,640 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,177 in
the Euro FT-SE 100 option. GEC was the busiest stock option with a day's
total of 3,056 lots.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICAN stocks recovered after opening sharply weaker on fears that a US
court ruling could delay the implementation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, agencies report from Mexico City.
The 38-share IPC index was finally quoted up 1.46 points at 1,671.75
compared with1,795.44 at the end of 1992. The volume yesterday was 142m
shares of which 55m corresponded to public offerings.
The IPC index had fallen on Wednesday and then again in early trading
yesterday after a US federal judge had ruled Wednesday that the US Trade
Representative's Office must prepare an environmental impact statement on
the Nafta before its implementation.
Stocks showed remarkable resilience yesterday to settle mainly flat despite
the US judgement ruling Wednesday that many feared had sounded the death
knell for the accord on which Mexico sets such store.
'That's not how the market sees it,' said one Mexican floor trader. He said
reports from Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon Bros. Inc, saying the NAFTA
should be in place by the Jan. 1 deadline reassured investors looking for an
opportunity to cover short.
In spite of the apparent setback US, Mexican and Canadian officials
commented that they believed that the deadline of January 1, 1994 for
implementation of the agreement could still be met.

FT  02 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats after drop in
NAPM index

Wall Street
AFTER a brief move upwards at the opening, US share prices fell back in the
wake of more bad economic news to end little changed on the day, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.54 at 3,510.54.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finished 1.53 lower at 449.00,
while the Amex composite ended up 1.63 at 435.87, and the Nasdaq composite
down 0.36 at 703.59. Trading volume on the NYSE was 283m shares.
Prices opened slightly firmer, helped by reports of an 11,000 decline in the
latest weekly jobless claims numbers. The fall was bigger than expected and
briefly raised hopes that today's employment report for June will not be as
weak as feared.
The markets could not hold on to their initial gains, however, and prices
turned tail soon after the National Association of Purchasing Management
reported that its index of manufacturing activity had dropped from 51.1 per
cent in May to 49.8 per cent in June. Any reading below 50 per cent is
regarded as indicative of a contraction in the manufacturing economy.
Moreover, the June figure was the lowest level in the NAPM index since
December 1991, a time when the economy was in recession.
The data was especially worrying because it suggested that it was unlikely
that manufacturers added to their payrolls in any significant numbers last
month. Consequently, today's June employment report could prove even weaker
than anticipated. The latest batch of Wall Street forecasts predict that
non-farm payrolls will have risen by between 100,000 and 150,000 last month,
and that the unemployment rate will be at 7.0 per cent.
Cyclicals ended mixed despite the fresh economic worries. General Electric
dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 95, Caterpillar gave up Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 74, but Minnesota Mining&amp;Manufacturing held steady at Dollars 108,
and International Paper bounced back from early losses to finish Dollars 1
3/8 higher at Dollars 65 3/8 ,.
Aluminium Company of America rallied strongly, rising Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 72 1/8 as the stock continued to benefit from its recent decision to
cut its aluminium production capacity.
Westinghouse Electric firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 16 as investors
responded mostly favourably to the appointment of Mr Michael Jordan as
chairman and chief executive.
Santa Fe Pacific slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 after Merrill Lynch cut
its short-term rating on the stock from above average to neutral.
Drug stocks ran into heavy selling after two of the sector's biggest
constituents - Merck and Pfizer - were cut from the recommended list of
Goldman Sachs. Pfizer tumbled Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 64 7/8 in volume of
2.1m shares, Merck gave up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 34 7/8 , Bristol-Myers
Squibb dropped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 57 and Schering-Plough fell Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 68 1/2 .
Toronto was closed yesterday for Canada Day.

FT  02 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo volume declines to
four month low

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES-LINKED buying pushed up share prices at the end of the session, but
activity remained subdued and volume was at its the thinnest in four months,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 334.61, or 1.7 per cent to 19,924.61, the highest
point of the day. The index opened at the day's low of 19,638.79 and
remained marginally higher throughout the day. A sharp rise in the futures
market towards the close of the session sparked arbitrage buying.
Volume fell to 220m shares against 233m. Gainers led losers by 693 to 292
with 175 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 17.78 to 1,598.03 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
1.62 to 1,210.32.
Traders expect the Nikkei to fluctuate within a narrow range until the July
18 general elections. 'The downside is firm around the 18,000 level thanks
to the government's public support, but valuation problems prevent the
Nikkei from rising above the 20,000 level,' said Mr Chris Newton at James
Capel. He added that with bond yields at some 4 per cent, the fair value of
the Nikkei was around 14,300.
Investors focused on Rohm, the integrated circuit maker, due to the lack of
fresh news. The company's US subsidiary won a patent in the US for the next
generation of flash memory chips and is planning to charge companies using
the technology, including Intel of the US, Toshiba and Hitachi.
Rohm failed to trade due to the lack of sellers and closed at a bid price of
Y2,890. Sumitomo Bakelit, which provides synthetic resins for Rohm's chips,
rose Y64 to Y584.
Non-bank financial institutions gained ground on the ministry of finance's
decision to allow the companies to issue commercial paper. Orix rose Y200 to
Y3,330.
Chori, a textile trader, fell Y100 to Y434 on reports of its lending
exposure to Hanix, the over-the-counter construction machinery maker which
filed for court protection last month.
Nikkatsu, the film maker, was suspended after reports of dishonoured bills.
After the market closed, the company announced that it had filed for court
protection due to funding problems.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 238.73 to 21,919.12 in volume of 14.5m
shares. The index rose for the first time in three days, on buying triggered
by the popularity of Rohm.
Roundup
MANY of the region's markets continued their strong runs. Taiwan, Bangkok,
Pakistan and India were closed for holidays.
HONG KONG rose sharply on hopes that the UK might be ready to compromise
with China over the colony's political future.
The Hang Seng index closed up 106.10, or 1.5 per cent, at 7,205.38, its high
for the day. Turnover was HKDollars 3.67bn against Wednesday's HKDollars
4bn.
Among the actives, HSBC was HKDollars 1 higher at HKDollars 74.50 and Swire
Pacific up HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 41.00.
SEOUL rose for the third consecutive session with interest particularly
concentrated in companies with low p/e ratios. The composite index gained
4.39 to 753.26, off the day's low of 747.73.
MANILA closed higher as local investors sustained a technical rally which
began on Monday. The composite index rose 9.51 to 1,586.98.
Secondary commercial issues led the rise with a new listing, Bacnotan
Cement, climbing 75 centavos to 14.50 pesos.
Combined turnover slipped to 530.03m pesos from 687.10m.
AUSTRALIA moved higher on the first day of the new financial year, the All
Ordinaries index closing 17.2 higher at 1,755.3.
NEW ZEALAND was quiet ahead of yesterday's budget which was announced after
the close. The NZSE-40 index gained 5.82 to 1,686.49 in turnover of
NZDollars 26.2m.

FT  02 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses slow after Buba cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INITIAL, enthusiastic reaction among bourses to the Bundesbank's cut in
key interest rates, and those elsewhere which preceded and followed it, was
reflected in a rise of 12.69, or more than 1 per cent in the Eurotrack 100
index at midday in London. But the gains were mostly dissipated as the
afternoon wore on, writes Our Markets Staff.
Fine words from German politicians and bankers were tested, and found
wanting: the economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, said that the cuts would
boost the economy of Germany and of its EMS partners; but Mr Julian Callow,
an economist at Kleinwort Benson, said that Germany's planned financial
retrenchment will sap strength out of the economy, 'suggesting that 1994 and
1995 will be very sluggish years for economic growth'. This outcome, too,
would reflect on the performance of other EMS countries.
There was a corollary. 'For the markets', said Mr Callow, 'this in turn
implies that German short term interest rates have substantially further to
decline. . .' However, he added, given that the discount rate cut was twice
the 25 basis points mostly widely cited, yesterday's cuts might well be the
last for another couple of months.
FRANKFURT went both ways in the official session and down in the
post-bourse. The DAX index reached a high of 1,715.25 on the rate cut news
but subsided to 1,706.63, up 9.00 at the close. In the afternoon, it
followed the bond market down, with a late indication of 1,699.06.
The big carmakers, chemicals and most banks registered subdued share price
performances, although Dresdner rose DM8 to DM385 during the session, on a
rumoured joint venture agreement with an English investment bank.
Thyssen slipped for the second day, down DM4.00 to DM185.60 following a
meeting in which it told analysts that, in addition to the 9,000 layoffs in
its steel unit previously announced, a further 5,400 jobs would be cut in
1993/4.
PARIS, too, enjoyed an initial early boost following the news from Germany,
with the CAC-40 index rising to a day's high of 1,994, before falling back
sharply to close down 11.72 at 1,960.15.
Turnover was a firm FFr3.7bn. Some brokers attributed the bourse's decline
to a weaker Matif market, as well as US institutional selling and a slightly
weaker franc. However, expectations are that the French authorities will cut
domestic rates again on Monday.
The market might also have given some thought to trade data released
yesterday: while showing a widening in the trade surplus in March it also
revealed a significant fall in both exports and imports on a year-on-year
basis. James Capel, commenting on the figures, note that this appears to
reflect the impact of currency movements.
Eurotunnel advanced 45 centimes to FFr35.60 on news that resolution of its
dispute with contractors could be nearer.
AMSTERDAM saw a year's high in the CBS Tendency index during the session
before the market eased back gently to close 0.2 higher at 112.7. As
expected after the close the central bank cut key domestic rates.
MILAN performed strongly following the Buba rate cut, before easing later.
However, domestic interest remained concentrated on Fiat, following
Wednesday's warning of a L1,000bn operating loss in 1993.
The Comit index ended down 1.37 at 534.78. Fiat fixed down L330 at L6,160 as
investors reacted to the statement from Mr Giovanni Agnelli at the annual
meeting. Some analysts commented that the market had, to some extent, been
taken by surprise by the news, as it had been concentrating less on
fundamentals in recent weeks.
The Fiat share price has gained 50 per cent since the start of the year on a
number of speculative stories.
One of these involved expectations of asset sales by the group, confirmed by
Mr Agnelli at the annual meeting.
As a result, Rinascente, one of the non-strategic divisions expected to be
sold, leapt L101 to L8,900.
There was considerable activity in possible privatisation candidates after
the government said on Wednesday night that it hoped to begin the
privatisation of seven groups within the next month. Among those on the
list, Credito Italiano rose L130 to L2,611, BCI by L163 to L5,098 and Stet
by L70 to L3,610.
ZURICH moved on an early, and unexpected domestic rate cut, with good buying
of banking stocks; but it saw a wave of profit-taking later, and no response
to the Bundesbank move. The SMI index closed 0.2 lower at 2,376.0.
Union Bank rose SFr11 to SFr1,111, while Surveillance gained SFr17 to
SFr1,748 on the firm dollar.
MADRID waited for Buba, then rose and fell to close with the general index
just 0.47 higher at 260.31. Turnover was healthy at Pta19.6bn.
BRUSSELS, bullish already, took the day's news as an excuse to hit a second
consecutive all-time high, the Bel-20 index closing 12.83, or 1 per cent
higher at 1,292.36. This was the Bel-20's 19th higher close in succession,
adding up to a rise of more than 9 per cent since the rally began on June 4.
OSLO also ended at a new high, the all share index rising 7.83, or 1.6 per
cent to 495.32 in turnover of NKr395m. Shipping stocks were again strong on
hopes of an upturn in chartering rates.
ISTANBUL advanced some 3.4 per cent after Wednesday's 2.9 per cent fall on
hopes that the new cabinet would win a vote of confidence scheduled for
Monday.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark defends position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK rose against the dollar and other European currencies yesterday,
in spite of the Bundesbank's announcement of its long awaited rate cuts,
writes Gillian Tett.
Speculation about the rate cuts before the German central bank's
announcement initially pushed the dollar up above DM1.71 during morning
trading in Europe.
But following a brief surge in the aftermath of the announcement, the D-Mark
then staged a surprising rally, recouping its losses to close at DM1.699 to
the dollar, around  1/2 pfennig stronger than the previous day.
The D-Mark also strengthened against the French franc, finishing at
FFr3.377, up on the previous day's close of FFr3.371. Against the Italian
lira and Spanish peseta the D-Mark closed little changed.
Dealers said one reason for the D-Mark's rally was that the market had
already been pricing in a rate cut, either at yesterday's council meeting or
later this month.
'Although the D-Mark did weaken at first, the dollar quickly ran into profit
taking,' explained Mr Michael Feeny, market analyst at Sumitomo Bank.
'Everybody knew that the Bundesbank would have to cut soon.'
However, another reason for the dollar's drop was the release of figures
from the National Association of Purchasing Management in the US, which
showed a sharp fall in confidence among US manufacturers.
Coupled with the growing fears that today's US non-farm employment figures
might also prove disappointing, the survey prompted concern about the patchy
nature of the US recovery.
'A lot now depends on the US non-farm payroll figures,' said Ms Alison
Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, who predicts
that any big fall in jobs could severely undermine the dollar, particularly
against the yen in the coming days .
Nevertheless, rumours that the Bank of Japan was now preparing for a rate
cut allowed the dollar to gain against the yen in late trading, leaving it
closing at Y107.4 up on a previous day's close of Y106.4.
In spite of the D-Mark's general rally, sterling continued to strengthen
against the German currency.
After rising in the morning on the back of the Bundesbank announcement, it
then fell back after speculation grew in London markets about the
possibility of further UK rate cuts.
However, a lunchtime statement by the Treasury discounting the possibility
of rate cuts in the near future pushed sterling up again, leaving it at
DM2.5625 at the end of the day - its strongest position since devaluation
last September.
It also closed up against the dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.5085, up from
the previous day's position of Dollars 1.4935.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Money Markets: German futures record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK'S long awaited announcement of lower interest rates yesterday
triggered a spate of rate cuts across Europe and lead to record volumes of
trading in German D-Mark futures, writes Gillian Tett.
The German central bank cut its discount rate by 0.5 per cent to 6.75 per
cent, and the Lombard rate by 0.25 per cent to 8.25 per cent.
The move was matched by similar cuts in Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium,
Holland, Denmark, Austria and Ireland, pushing many European official rates
back below German levels.
The Bank of Switzerland started the trend by cutting its discount rate from
5.0 per cent to 4.5 per cent. This was followed by a 25 basis point cut in
the Bank of Austria's Lombard and discount rates, bringing them to 7.25 and
6 per cent respectively.
The Irish central bank announced a similar 25 basis point cut in its short
term facility rate, bringing it to 7.5 per cent. Denmark's central bank said
it would lower its key discount and deposit rates to 7.25 per cent from 7.75
per cent from tomorrow.
Finally, the Dutch central bank cut its advances rate from 6.90 per cent to
6.70 per cent, prompting Belgium to announce an identical cut in its money
market central rate, and a 0.25 point cut in its discount rate, bringing it
to 6.00 per cent.
The Bundesbank's move triggered record levels of trade in the German D-Mark
futures market, with the day's estimated volume exceeding 223,000 contracts.
The previous record, 196,173, which was set during sterling's suspension
from the ERM last September.
The activity pushed the September Euro D-Mark contract some 10 basis points
higher in the morning. However, it later fell back, closing around 93.24,
little changed on the day, reflecting, dealers said, the fact that the
market had already been pricing in some type of German rate cut this month.
In London, as the Bundesbank's move fuelled hopes that the British
authorities might follow the trend and cut their own interest rates,
September sterling futures rose 10 basis points to 94.33.
But, a lunchtime announcement from the Treasury signalling no easing in
monetary conditions dampened the optimism, pushing the contract back to the
previous day's level of around 94.23.
Three month interbank rates closed little changed at 5 7/8 per cent.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ wool growers face another
tough year as prices languish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND'S sheep farmers, the world's second largest producers of wool,
can expect yet another year of slack world demand and low prices, economists
warned yesterday, the first day of the 1993-94 season, reports Reuter from
Wellington.
'There's more belt tightening in store,' said New Zealand Wool Board senior
economist Mr Patrick Conway.
The industry, which produces 12 per cent of the world's wool, had begun last
season with high hopes of recovery despite large world stockpiles. The
average indicator price had recovered from a post-war low of NZDollars
Dollars 3.50 (USDollars 1.86) a kilogram (clean) in early 1991 to about
Dollars 5.00 a kilogram by June 1992. World economic growth and the return
of buyers from China, who have bought up to a quarter of New Zealand's wool
in recent years, had been expected to boost prices further.
Instead, the large industrialised economies actually fell further into
recession and the Chinese buying interest slackened again.
'The long-awaited recovery in Western Europe and Japan just never came, in
fact it got worse,' said Mr Conway yesterday. 'There's been a general
deterioration in demand for world textiles.'
The average indicator fell from NZDollars 4.71 at the first sale of the
1992-93 season to NZDollars 3.77 by the last sale.
New Zealand's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries noted in its annual
agricultural outlook that Chinese demand had been sluggish for much of the
second half of the season. 'This can be attributed to many factors, such as
the depreciation of China's currency, foreign exchange allocation problems
and temporary disruption to buying as responsibility for purchasing is
transferred from state to local enterprises,' it said.
The weight of wool stockpiles overhanging the world market compounded the
problem of slackening demand, economists explained.
'Falling production continues to be masked by the enormous stockpiles,' said
ANZ bank economist Mr Paul Stewert.
With stocks at present equivalent to 35 per cent of annual world production
economists said nervousness surrounding the growth of the world's largest
stockpile in Australia had helped depress prices.
Although rescheduling of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission's debt
repayments by the Australian government in April helped ease the tension,
the stockpile was expected to remain a problem while the world economic
recovery stuttered.
'Given the sluggish outlook for demand and continuing large wool
availabilities, prices for the 1993-94 season are not forecast to increase
substantially,' the ministry said.
The continued absence of buyers from the former Soviet Union would also
constrain prices. . . 'particularly since they've been the major buyers in
the past of those shorter crossbred wools,' Mr Conway warned.
Most of New Zealand's 54m sheep are crossbred to produce both meat and wool.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina aims to cash in on
mineral wealth: Law changes designed to attract investors to under-explored
areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA OWNS half the mineral-rich southern Andes but its mining industry
accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of its GDP. Unlike Chile, which owns the
other half of the southern Andes and has built up a multi-billion dollar
mining industry, mining in Argentina has never caught on.
Political instability, unpredictable shifts in government policy, complex
and xenophobic regulations have actually discouraged mining.
For instance, the Andean border region was declared a security zone and
closed to foreign investment, while exports were taxed.
The government says this is all changing, however, with the approval a few
weeks ago of new investor-friendly mining laws that it hopes will open up
Argentina's vast and under-explored interior to local and especially to
foreign companies.
These new laws follow Argentina's introduction four years ago of free market
reforms that have transformed the country into one of the fastest-growing
economies in the region.
The government is offering mining companies a generous tax regime that
includes a promise not to change the tax structure of investment projects
for 30 years and allows them to import machinery duty free.
Companies can write off all their exploration costs against future corporate
tax once a project begins generating profits.
The laws will also allow companies to set up free trade zones in which
remaining tax and import restrictions will be waived. The intention is to
attract international companies based on the Chilean side of the Andes to
cross into Argentina.
Argentina badly needs to attract foreign investment because it lacks
home-grown mining expertise. As a result of the endemic indifference to
mining, only 17 per cent of its territory has been adequately surveyed.
Major mining companies began sniffing around Argentina well before the new
mining policies came into effect. The government's mining secretariat
reports that 20 companies, nearly all of them foreign, have already
committed USDollars 103m in investments to study 64 mining projects.
This may be small change by international standards, but it represents a
hefty capital influx for an industry that turns over barely Dollars 400m a
year.
Argentina's great attraction is its virgin geology and consequently the
chance of finding major undeveloped deposits with quick payback periods.
Some, like Canada's Musto, claim they have already found highly attractive
properties.
Musto is working on an 18-month, USDollars 7m feasibility study of what it
claims to be an exceptionally rich, world-class gold deposit in the Andean
foothills.
The company says the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit is 'one of the largest
proven unexploited porphyry copper/gold deposits in South America'. It
believes the deposit could produce 140m lb of copper and 200,000 ounces of
gold a year for 20 years.
Mr Jorge Jones, Musto's Argentine general manager, says that if Musto takes
up an option to develop Bajo de la Alumbrera, the project will need at least
Dollars 450m in investments and would therefore require co-financing from
other joint venture partners.
The mining secretariat says international companies have at least four other
major gold, copper, lithium and potassium projects under consideration,
which would be worth over Dollars 500m in investments if taken beyond their
present exploration stages.
Argentina is so anxious to attract investment that the government has even
reassured companies that they have little to fear from its feeble
environmental laws.
At an international mining conference in Denver in June, Mining Secretary
Angel Maza was quoted as saying: 'We would not think of subordinating the
interests of development to those of the environment'.
Despite its fiscal and geological attractions, Argentina is far from
becoming a mining paradise. To start with, its geology is less favourable
than Chile's, where rich mineral veins are closer to the surface and
therefore cheap to mine.
And companies already operating Argentina, like RTZ affiliate Minera
Aguilar, which produces lead, silver and zinc close to the Bolivian border,
are losing money because prices are low, while their costs are high.
Operating costs are high because the currency is overvalued, labour
productivity is low and inputs are overpriced. For example, Aguilar has to
import items ranging from explosives to spare parts because locally-made
products are so expensive.
Finding financial backing for mining projects is both difficult and
expensive.
Local banks are unwilling to lend for long periods, while international
banks are unhappy lending for mining projects in a country with little
mining tradition.
Deficient infrastructure also adds heavily to development costs. Roads and
power supplies, especially in remote mountain locations are inadequate.
Transport and port facilities are also poor, although the government has
recently privatised the rail network and drastically reduced port charges.
The government is also negotiating with Chile a series of agreements which
would enable companies operating in Argentina's sector of the Andes to buy
Chilean electricity and ship minerals to Chilean Pacific ports.
Not only are Chile's ports closer, but its road and rail network is far
superior to Argentina's.
But Mr David Ancieta, Aguilar's executive director, says he is optimistic
that Argentina is overcoming what was once seen as its greatest single
deterrent - political turbulence.
'There is a determination to change and I think that Argentina will become a
politically stable country,' he says. 'Periodic adjustments to economic
policy will be necessary, but there is confidence that Argentina will stay
with these economic policies.'

<TEXT>
London COCOA prices edged ahead. The main talking point remained the
possibility of a squeeze on the nearby July contract. The uncovered position
remains steady, reinforcing sentiment that a major long position holder may
take delivery of a substantial tonnage. News that 3,397 lots were tendered
against July on the first notice day was broadly in line with forecasts. The
COPPER market on the LME, trading for the first time in US dollars,
continued to focus on news from US producers Kennecott and Phelps Dodge,
where labour contracts expired on Wednesday, but the mines continue to
operate. Other factors preoccupying the market were conflicting ideas on
warehouse stock movements, as the possibility of significant withdrawals by
Chinese interests was being countered by talk of a large arrival.
Three-month ALUMINIUM fluctuated either side of Dollars 1,250 a tonne,
reflecting heightened expectations of further production cuts in the wake of
Alcoa earlier this week. In North America Kaiser has ruled out following
suit, Reynolds continues to evaluate the situation, while Alcan says it has
no plans.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining chief accused over
aborigine claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS Minister Mr Robert Tickner yesterday accused Hugh Morgan,
managing director of Australia's Western Mining Corporation Holdings, of
waging a hate campaign over a court decision granting aborigines land title.
Mr Morgan, head of one of Australia's biggest mining groups, said a landmark
1992 High Court ruling on native land title, known as the Mabo ruling after
one of the original plaintiffs, would create racial tension and economic
stagnation.
'You've got a representative of one of Australia's mining giants waging this
campaign of hate and bitterness against aboriginal people and it's just got
to stop,' Mr Tickner said in a radio interview.
'It's so far over the top, so divisive, and for any of us to give it any
credibility. . . is, I think, profoundly un-Australian.'

FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton unveils compromise plan
for US forestry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled his plan to bridge the chasm
between environmentalists and loggers over the timber harvest in the
endangered old growth forests of the Pacific north-west.
The plan will allow about 2bn board feet of Forest Service timber sales from
the region this year, as previously arranged sales move through the
pipeline, but would then settle on a much lower timber harvest of some 1.2bn
board feet a year.
This would be one third of the yield reached in the late 1980s but would
allow more timber to be cut than at present, with logging held up by a
variety of court orders.
Mr Clinton said he would also restore the ban on exporting raw logs from
publicly owned land, a moved designed to create jobs in north-west wood
processing plants.
The plan will satisfy neither side in the long-running battle over the
remaining acres of north-western forest, where the intensive logging allowed
under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush has slowed to a trickle as
the courts have held the government to its obligation under the Endangered
Species Act to protect the habitat of the dwindling population of northern
spotted owls.
Mr Clinton said the plan was scientifically sound and complied with the law.
While the proposed annual yield is smaller than timber interests had wanted,
the plan does not have some of the protections environmental groups had
sought; it would, for example, allow some salvage cutting and thinning in
protected areas of owl habitat.
The administration plan offers Dollars 270m of economic aid next year to
help the region adjust to reduced timber harvests, and Dollars 1.2bn over
five years, creating jobs in watershed restoration and ecological
preservation.
'Had this crisis been dealt with years ago, we might have a plan with a
higher yield and with more environmentally protected areas. We are doing the
best we can with the facts as they now exist in the Pacific north-west,' Mr
Clinton said yesterday.
Lumber prices rose sharply in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in anticipation of lower timber harvests under the Clinton plan,
moving limit up ahead of the announcement. But they fell back later.
Mr Clinton also announced that he would seek additional funding from
congress to pay for flood damage in the upper Mississippi basin, where
governors of five states have sought aid for farmers whose crops have been
washed out.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Almond prices soar after
Californian estimate is cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP downward revision in the estimate for this year's almond harvest in
California has sent prices up by 10 per cent in 48 hours.
The US Department of Agriculture in May estimated that the crop in
California - by far the world's biggest supplier - would be 520m lb at
harvest in September. But the first objective estimate in the Sacramento and
San Joaquim valleys produced a figure of 470m lb.
The price per tonne, which stood at Dollars 3,600 in January, has surged to
Dollars 4,600 a tonne, traders said yesterday. One estimated that a further
gain of Dollars 250 was possible.
'The big problem of the past few years has been oversupply,' said a leading
London trader. 'That has now disappeared, and the coming crop will be very
short.'
In the past six years the crop has reached as high as 660m lb. Shipments
from California, including those for US consumption, have averaged 530m lb.
The sharp reduction in this year's crop is blamed on poor pollination in
February because of wet weather. It came as stocks were 'at a bare minimum
for the industry', the London trader said.
Stocks in California are estimated at 56m lb, while unsold European stocks
are around 1,000 tonnes. 'The balance of the old crop is very small,' said
Mr Michael Becker, of Eurobroker, the Paris based broker of dried fruit and
edible nuts. 'Total world supply is 10 to 15 per cent smaller than it was at
this time last year.'
He estimated European demand at up to 4,000 tonnes in the high season of
August and September, when European manufacturers start to prepare for
Christmas. New crop California almonds will not arrive in Europe until the
end of September at the earliest.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Goldsmith announcement 'not
responsible for gold spike'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JAMES Goldsmith's announcement that he was to swap gold shares for gold
bullion had nothing to do with a sharp rise in the gold price yesterday,
according to traders and analysts.
The price, which moved through the important Dollars 380 a troy ounce level,
was driven by activity on New York futures markets, they suggested.
Traders were deeply suspicious of Sir James's motives. They insisted no
professional speculator would reveal his hand so clearly before completing a
deal. 'He won't get the money from the share sale for a week or two. Does he
expect us to believe he would then buy gold in a rising market?' was a
typical comment. 'He has either already bought the gold or he doesn't intend
to buy any.'
Sir James and Lord Rothschild announced on Wednesday that they would offer
the public 9.65m shares in, or 14 per cent of, Newmont Mining, North
America's biggest gold producer. When the sale is completed, they will in
the space of less than a year have reduced their combined holdings in
Newmont from 49 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
In London yesterday gold started quietly and ended the formal morning fixing
at Dollars 377.85 an ounce, down about Dollars 1 from Wednesday's closing
price. Traders said business was quiet as gold producers were not selling
and demand was minimal.
Then New York investment funds re-discovered silver yesterday, pushing the
price up by 17 1/2 cents an ounce to Dollars 4.74 by the close in London.
Gold was dragged up because computer trading programmes frequently link the
two precious metals.
Gold closed in London at its highest level for the day, Dollars 384.50, up
Dollars 5.25 an ounce. Traders suggested that, as the price was being driven
by technical factors, it would probably move to Dollars 385 which was the
next important chart point.
One said that if Sir James used only half the Dollars 440m proceeds expected
from his share sale to buy gold call options, it would probably be enough to
drive the price above Dollars 400.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Surprise German rate cuts prompt
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SURPRISE cuts in Germany's key interest rates yesterday signalled a wave of
rate reductions throughout Europe and prompted profit-taking in government
bond markets.
The Bundesbank had been under intense pressure to ease rates for some time
both within the market and also from the international community.
The central bank's perceived desire to double bluff the markets and its will
to maintain its independence from French pressure were seen as cogent
reasons why it might delay any changes until the next meeting on July 15.
But when the Swiss National Bank cut its discount rate by half a point to
4.5 per cent, the market was fully prepared for a German move.
The Bundesbank's reduction of its key discount lending rate by half a point,
to 6.75 per cent, and of its Lombard rate by a quarter of a point, to 8.25
per cent, was seen as bowing to the inevitable.
The Bundesbank also cut its repo rate by 28 basis points to 7.3 per cent.
The central bank gave a favourable exchange rate as the rational for
cutting, but most economists felt this was disingenuous and argued that the
broadcasting of the government's spending cut proposals provided the main
impetus.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, economist with Citibank, said the government's proposed
DM25bn in spending cuts were not big enough.
'I think we will see further rate cuts in the months ahead. Much depends on
money supply growth and inflation but I forecast a discount rate of 5 per
cent by the end of the year,' Mr MacKinnon added.
Bund futures for September were sold down half a point to 95.36.
Meanwhile, it was announced in Frankfurt that Treuhand, the agency charged
with the privatisation of former east German assets, would launch a new
10-year bond on Tuesday.
THE GERMAN move could give France an opportunity to reduce its own rates
next week, but the immediate reaction in the French government bond market
was sharp profit-taking.
September futures on the Matif fell just under half a point to 119.38, with
dealers saying a French easing was already priced into the market.
One economist said that investors had heavy positions in French OATs and
were looking for the next rising market.
There are various comparable benchmarks for short-term benchmarks, but a
number of investment houses are looking at the French intervention rate,
which sets the floor for French money market rates, and the German discount
rates.
Ten days ago, the intervention rate fell the below the discount for the
first time in 26 years.
To sustain that position, the Banque de France would need to ease by half a
point, but most analysts feel it will do so in two stages rather than make a
dramatic point when it conducts its money market operations on Monday.
IN LONDON, gilts traded lower, partly because the appetite for stock was
taken up with the latest tap.
Buying of the Bank of England's Pounds 800m issue of 9 per cent stock dated
2008 began yesterday morning. The first tranche of the partly-paid stock was
sold at 30 and the second tranche at 30.04. The issue was not fully cleared
by the close of trading.
The market was also digesting Tuesday's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 8 per
cent stock due 2003.
At Wednesday's auction, the average accepted price was 101.29 to give an
average yield of 7.72 per cent.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, a number of central banks cut rates. Denmark lowered
its discount rate to 7.25 per cent from 7.75 per cent, effective today.
Austria cut its discount, Gomex and Lombard rates by 25 basis points
effective today. The new discount rate will be 6 per cent, the Gomex money
market intervention rate will be 6.75 per cent and the Lombard rate will be
7.25 per cent.
Ireland cut its short-term rates by 0.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
In Sweden, the Riksbank announced an expected cut in the key marginal
lending rate to 8.5 per cent from 8.75 per cent effective July 5.
Belgium and the Netherlands, cut their discount rates to 6 per cent from
6.25 per cent and their emergency lending rates by the same margin to 8.50
per cent effective today.
US TREASURY prices were mixed in light trading yesterday, with activity
subdued ahead of today's employment report. In late trading the benchmark
30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 105 5/8 , yielding 6.683 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/4 ,
to yield 3.977 per cent.
The day's economic news - a larger-than-expected 11,000 drop in weekly
jobless claims, and a decline in the National Association of Purchasing
Managers' index from 51.1 in May to 48.3 in June - had mixed implications
for bonds.
The NAPM figure, which was weaker than expected, lifted prices slightly,
buoying hopes that today's employment report for June would display
continued weakness in the labour market. Later in the day, however,
longer-dated Treasuries fell back following a surge in commodities prices.
The only other feature of the day was some early speculative buying on
rumours that the Federal Reserve had called an emergency meeting for today.
It did not take long, however, for the Fed to explain that there was no
emergency, and that its routine Monday meeting had simply been brought
forward because of the Independence Day holiday.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: US debt and equity issues at
record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US COMPANIES issued record amounts of debt and equity during the first half
of this year, according to the financial information group Securities Data.
Stocks and bonds worth Dollars 530bn were sold in the first six months of
1993, well above the previous record of Dollars 445bn set in the first half
of 1992.
The continued boom in debt offerings was fuelled by the lowest interest
rates in three decades, which encouraged many companies to pay off older,
more expensive, debt with new, cheaper debt.
This corporate refinancing was accompanied by continued strong demand for
equity from companies.
A record Dollars 47bn in new shares was sold between January and the end of
June, more than half of it in the form of initial public offerings (IPOs),
or company flotations. Rising stock prices (the Dow Jones Industrial Average
hit an all-time high in May) and heavy demand from investors were the main
factors behind the rush into equity.
The surge in underwriting business has filled the coffers of Wall Street
securities firms, which earned a record Dollars 4.3bn in fees during the
first half of the year. Merrill Lynch once again led the field, earning
Dollars 878m from domestic underwriting, followed by Goldman Sachs, Lehman
Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers.
Although debt and equity issuance hit a record, the pace of growth is
slowing slightly. The amount of new securities sold in the second quarter
was down 5 per cent from the first quarter, to Dollars 258bn.

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S high-yielding government bond markets topped the bond performance
charts for June, reflecting expectations that interest rates in Europe will
continue to fall.
Italy showed the strongest performance in local currency terms with a gain
of 4.65 per cent last month, according to JP Morgan's Government Bond Index
Monitor.
Spain showed a return of 3.61 per cent - as the general election result in
early June sparked a rally in the market, - followed by Denmark, with 3.44
per cent, and the UK, with 3.36 per cent.
'Pressure continues to mount for high European real interest rates to
decline,' JP Morgan points out in its monthly report. Although France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Ireland all eased during the
month, the combination of slow growth, rising unemployment and concern about
structural deficits has raised hope of further easing in interest rates.
'Bond markets worldwide provided investors with positive returns during
June. These local currency gains were recorded as the marketplace adjusted
to the realisation of deep-seated economic weakness throughout Europe, and
the concomitant implications for future yield curve movements', JP Morgan
says.
The US bank points out that while the Italian-German 10-year yield spread
has narrowed from about 627 basis points at the start of the year to 461
basis points, 'yields in Italy still have room to moderate, especially in
view of recent currency stability'.
For US-based investors, the strength of the dollar has meant that the US
Treasury bond market has provided the biggest monthly return, with a gain of
2.04 per cent, followed by Japanese government bonds with a return of 1.94
per cent.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National takes advantage of
bullish Eurolira sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to cut interest rates provided a bullish backdrop
for the international bond market, and helped to ensure a good reception for
yesterday's trickle of new bond issues.
Abbey National Treasury Services launched a L200bn, 10-year issue with a 10
per cent coupon which attracted considerable interest from investors who
cherish a high return, especially continental European retail investors. The
borrower was particularly keen to take advantage of the bullish tone in the
Eurolira sector.
'The interest in Italian lira stems from people looking for the extra
yield,' said Mr Roger Bates, at lead-manager Deutsche Bank London. 'For
investors, this is probably one of the few remaining chances to buy a
double-digit coupon, added to which this is a well-respected borrower.'
The German rate cut boosted the Italian government bond market and helped to
lift prices in the Eurolira sector.
The bonds, issued at 101.075, traded within full fees of 2 points throughout
the day, rallying to 99.80 by mid-afternoon.
Abbey National last tapped the Eurolira sector in June 1991 with a five-year
issue. Mr Alex Brown, head of capital markets at Abbey National, said the
proceeds would be used to fund the UK bank's mortgage subsidiary in Italy.
The bonds were swapped into floating rate lira to give funding at the London
interbank offered rate.
Rank Xerox Finance yesterday tapped the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds
125m, 10-year issue priced to yield 105 basis points over the 10-year gilt.
CSFB, the lead manager, said the deal was snapped up largely by UK investors
although there was some overseas interest.
Other sterling houses praised the deal, noting that there has been good
demand for sterling paper recently. 'The deal offers a healthy spread over
the gilt, and there are plenty of UK institutions looking for greater yield
enhancement' said one syndicate head.
Mr John Edwards, deputy group treasurer at Rank Xerox, said the borrower had
been keen to extend its debt profile and take advantage of the relatively
attractive swap opportunities. Some of the deal was swapped into floating
rate sterling while some was kept in fixed rate sterling.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: IBM wins rulings against
Comdisco
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has won two rulings in its lawsuit against
Comdisco, the leading computer leasing company. A Delaware court has ruled
that Comdisco misappropriated IBM property by removing and then selling or
leasing parts of a computer owned by IBM Credit.
The court granted summary judgment to IBM, and ruled that other charges
brought against Comdisco should go to a jury for final determination.
The IBM lawsuit, filed in 1991, charged that Comdisco engaged in 'elaborate
schemes in which property belonging to IBM Credit Corporation was illegally
transferred, released, or sold'. The suit was part of a broader dispute
between IBM and the computer leasing industry over business practices.
Comdisco and other computer leasing companies complained that IBM was
attempting to thwart competition in the market. Parts of mainframe computers
are typically swapped during the upgrading the equipment. IBM claimed,
however, that this practice prevented it from keeping track of its property
and violated its leasing agreements.
'From the outset, our position was that you cannot take and dispose of
property that belongs to someone else, said Mr Harry Kavetas, IBM
vice-president and president of IBM Credit Corporation.
Comdisco, however, said it was pleased the court remanded to trial other
aspects of the dispute. 'We look forward to the opportunity to present our
case on the issues involving sub-leasing and over-leasing, said Mr Kenneth
Pontikes, chairman and president.
'Comdisco's ultimate vindication in this case will also be a victory for the
computer leasing industry generally, which has been operating under a great
cloud of uncertainty since IBM first filed this litigation two years ago.'

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: NTT's regional telephone units
post pre-tax loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's leading telecommunications group,
said its 11 regional local telephone divisions posted a pre-tax loss of
Y175.7bn (Dollars 1.64bn) for the year to March.
The figure will strengthen NTT's argument for dearerlocal calls, to which
the ministry of posts and telecommunications has remained reluctant. In May,
the company announced a 29 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y247.2bn for
the year to March.
NTT has been lobbying heavily since the start of this year for a rise in
local rates. This, together with announcements to restructure operations by
reducing the number of employees by 30,000 and retail outlets to one-third,
has pushed up NTT's stock. Yesterday, NTT's share price rose 2.4 per cent to
Y883,000.
In spite of a cut in long-distance inter-city rates in the last fiscal year,
due to increasing pressure from competitors, NTT's long-distance division
posted a pre-tax profit of Y454.7bn.
The company also announced its business results by type of services.
Operating revenue of NTT's call charge service totalled Y561.9bn, while its
pay phone service posted an operating loss of Y22.6bn. NTT's car phone
service saw an operating loss of Y1.9bn, while its telephone number
information service posted an operating loss of Y173.4bn.

OPSM Protector's chairman, Mr Adrian Lane, said yesterday the Sabre

'We now have a major presence in the European personal protection equipment

'Sabre has annual sales of approximately ADollars 37m, of which about 75 per

Australian grocer

<TEXT>
KMART, the US retailer, has put itself into the forefront of the battle to
rationalise the Australian grocery industry by paying ADollars 20.5m
(USDollars 13.7m) for a 10.8 per cent stake in Independent Holdings, the
South Australian wholesaler.
Kmart, which controls just over 20 per cent of Coles Myer, Australia's
biggest retailer, revealed itself yesterday as the buyer of a parcel of 3.2m
Independent shares traded at ADollars 6.45 earlier this week.
The Kmart move follows the recent purchase of a 19.9 per cent stake in
Independent by Davids Holdings, the privately-controlled Australian grocery
wholesaler. Foodland Associated, another big Australian grocery group, also
controls 18.5 per cent of Independent.
The Kmart purchase was seen yesterday by analysts as a move friendly to
Coles Myer, which has recently moved to block acquisitions in the grocery
industry which is one of its major supply sources.
Earlier this year, Coles acquired a 15 per cent stake in QIW, a Queensland
grocery group, helping to thwart a hostile take over attempt by Davids
Holdings. The Trade Practices Commission said yesterday it would hold an
inquiry into Kmart's acquisition of Independent shares.
At its Michigan headquarters, Kmart remained tight-lipped about the share
purchase. Although the company has been putting increased emphasis on
international opportunities recently, and purchased stores in the Czech
Republic and Slovakia last year, it described the Independent stake was a
'non-strategic investment'.
Kmart declined to say whether it had discussed the share purchase with Coles
Myer.
In the context of Kmart, one of the largest retailers in sales terms in the
US, the funds involved in the purchase are extremely modest. Kmart's assets
at end-January, for example, were put at almost Dollars 19bn.

THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange and the Matif, the Paris futures exchange,
are to tap into each other's products on the electronic after-hours trading
system, Globex.
The Matif began listing on Globex in March, but trading on the French
futures and options products has been limited to Matif members.
Starting today, US and French futures traders will have cross-exchange
access. 'Cross-exchange access is the next logical step in the
internationalisation of Globex,' said Mr Jack Sandner, Globex chairman.
UK futures traders with Globex terminals are still without access to the
Matif products, because the cross-border transactions lack the necessary UK
Treasury approvals.
The Matif is the only non-US exchange to have signed on to Globex, a joint
venture between the CME, the Chicago Board of Trade, and Reuters.
The year-old system averaged 20,000 per session in June, with more than
two-thirds of the volume made up of Matif contracts.
The CBoT will continue to list July, August, and September futures contracts
for the high-cap stock index, but has delisted its December and March and
June, 1994 contracts. Its agreement with the Amex expires in October, when
the contract will presumably move to the CME.
The American Stock Exchange has confirmed it is to end its 10-year
relationship with the Chicago Board of Trade as licensee to trade futures on
Amex's Major Market Index.
Mr Howard Baker, senior vice-president of the Amex, said the exchange was
negotiating an agreement with the CME, subject to legal and regulatory
approvals.
While MMI futures generated very little volume for the CBoT, loss of the
contract is a blow to the exchange's prestige.

protection

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIKKATSU, a Japanese film producer and distributor listed on the main
section of the Tokyo stock exchange, yesterday filed for court protection
with debts totalling Y49.7bn (Dollars 464.5m).
It is the first time in eight years that a company listed on the TSE first
section has filed for court protection under the corporate rehabilitation
law.
Nikkatsu, which had diversified into the real estate and golf membership
businesses in the late 1980s, said it had been hit by the sharp fall in golf
membership prices and interest payment burdens stemming from its real estate
business.
Japanese film producers have been facing hard times due to the lack of hits
and waning interest among consumers for Japanese films.
The downturn of the industry forced most companies to diversify into areas
such as real estate and development of old film theatres.
Nikkatsu turned itself into a film producer in the 1970s, later moving into
property, golf resorts, and video game arcade businesses in the 1980s, while
returning to films for the general audience.
Unlike other Japanese leading film-makers and distributing companies,
Nikkatsu lacks the ties with large keiretsu or corporate groupings. Teikoku
Data Bank, a private credit research company, said Nikkatsu lost control
over its book keeping after the rapid diversification into various
businesses.
Nikkatsu's investments in its video software business also became a burden,
while the company also faced large losses from its film Rakuyo distributed
last summer which was a major box-office failure. For the year to last
January, Nikkatsu posted an after-tax loss of Y6.9bn on sales of Y10.5bn.
According to Teikoku, leading lenders to Nikkatsu, which are likely to help

helicopter plans on hold

McDONNELL Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, said yesterday that
it had decided not to actively pursue the sale of its helicopter business or
its involvement in a joint venture.
The company, which announced last year that it was exploring partnership and
sale possibilities, said it had intensively evaluated a number of serious
prospects but had concluded that a partnership or sale at this time was not
in the best interests of the company or its customers.
The helicopter unit, which is based at Mesa, Arizona, produces the AH-64
Apache attack helicopter and the MD 500 and MD Explorer commercial lines.
McDonnell Douglas said it would now fully integrate the unit into its
McDonnell Douglas aerospace business.
McDonnell Douglas also announced yesterday that its second-quarter results
would include Dollars 57m of unusual after-tax gains. Some Dollars 43m would
come from the partial reversal of a charge taken in the first quarter of
last year for the adoption of a new accounting standard on retirees' health
benefits.

joint venture terms

ILLINOIS-BASED IMC Fertilizer Group and Freeport-McMoRan Resources Partners
have finalised the combination of their phosphate fertiliser businesses.
The joint venture, to be called IMC-Agrico company, becomes one of the
largest phosphate fertiliser operations in the world, and represents about
30 per cent of US market share.
The venture, first announced in January, is expected to achieve about
Dollars 95m in cost savings for the two companies. Estimated sales for the
company are Dollars 1bn, and combined phosphate rock capacity will be about
30m tons a year.
The consolidation was driven by a long-term slump in world fertiliser
prices. World prices are at 20-year lows, in part because the former states
of the Soviet Union have been aggressively marketing their phosphate
resources internationally.
India and China have also reduced their central purchases of the commodity,
and demand has been curtailed in eastern and western Europe because of
economic slumps and agricultural reforms.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Moody's reviews debt rating at
Eli Lilly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investor Service, the US rating agency, is reviewing the long-term
debt of Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals group, for possible downgrade from
its current Triple A rating.
Moody's said the review was provoked by concerns the company's product
pipeline might not generate enough revenues and profits to justify the
agency's highest rating. About Dollars 900m of long-term debt of Lilly and
guaranteed entities would be affected.
The review comes after last week's abrupt resignation of Mr Vaugh Bryson,
Lilly's chief executive, who had been in charge for just 20 months.
Mr Bryson took the blame for Lilly's disappointing sales and product
development, losing out in a boardroom struggle. He was replaced by Mr
Randall Tobias, a well-regarded vice-chairman at AT&amp;T.
Lilly this week suspended trials of the anti-viral drug Fialuridine (FIAU),
once thought to be a potential money-spinner. The drug, seen as a possible
cure for hepatitis B, was licensed by Lilly last year. It halted trials
after adverse side-effects, and will conduct further studies before deciding
whether tests will resume.
Moody's said: 'Without FIAU, Lilly's new product line is unusually lean for
the intermediate term and may be hard-pressed to offset the maturity of the
existing product portfolio.' It said the debt review would assess Lilly's
product pipeline, prospects for profitability, and the impact on capital.
Lilly is heavily dependent on sales of the anti-depressant, Prozac, which
faces increasing competition, and the anti-biotic, Ceclor, which lost part
of its patent protection last year, and will lose the rest in 1994. Sales of
new drugs, such as Lorabid, an intended replacement for Ceclor, have not
taken off.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ford to acquire Czech parts
maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD has reached agreement with the Czech government to acquire Autopol, a
components manufacturer specialising in automotive lighting and heat
exchanger equipment including air conditioning. The producer has annual
turnover of Pounds 50m (Dollars 75m).
The acquisition, for an undisclosed sum, was decribed by Mr Jacques Nasser,
Ford of Europe chairman, as part of Ford's strategy to establish a stronger
presence in the emerging economies of central and eastern Europe.
The acquisition provides Ford, for the first time, with an in-house
capability to produce lighting in Europe. In the long term, this may means
reduced business for Hella, Carello, Bosch and Valeo, its European lighting
suppliers.
It also gives Autopol a significant role in Europe's fast-growing car
air-conditioning market. In 1987, only one car in 200 was ordered with
air-conditioning. Now the level is 11 per cent and is expected to grow to 25
per cent - representing around 3m units - by 1995.
Ford has been among the most cautious of western vehicle producers in
exploring manufacturing ventures in the region.
However, it has identified Poland, Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia as
offering most potential.
It is also setting up a greenfield operation in Hungary to manufacture
induction coils, and is in the final stages of negotiations with the Polish
authorities to establish a soft trim factory. It already has car sales and
service networks in the region.
The Autopol plant, which employs 2,700, has Lada and Volkswagen-controlled
Skoda as its biggest customers. However, Mr Nasser said: 'We believe our
investment will enable Autopol to become an internationally competitive
supplier throughout Europe.'
Ford intends to introduce new equipment, systems and methods at the five
plants operated by Autopol.
However, it says the company will not need to overhaul and cut jobs as much
as in some other Western takeovers of east European motor industry ventures.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: BMW moves into aluminium
components
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW of Germany yesterday became the latest important producer to reveal a
special interest in developing aluminium car components by signing a
co-operation agreement with Norway's Hydro Aluminium. The deal may even
involve the production of complete 'space frames', skeleton-like frames to
which body panels can be fixed.
The two companies said they had been working together for several years to
increase the use of aluminium in car structures, and they had now formalised
the arrangement.
Car companies are being driven to use much more aluminium to reduce the
weight of cars so that they can meet increasingly stringent fuel economy and
pollution regulations.
BMW's move comes a few months before the launch by its rival, Audi, part of
the Volkswagen group, of an 'aluminium-intensive,' top-of-the-range, V8
model, developed with Alcoa of the US, the world's biggest aluminium group.
However, BMW said it had no plans for volume production of an entire
aluminium car like Audi's.
BMW's M-Technik offshoot is using an aluminium space frame in its prototype
E1 electric vehicle for California. At the Geneva Motor Show recently, the
group presented the Z13 concept 'city car', which has an aluminium frame,
recycled plastic panels, and a motor-cycle engine.
Hydro is part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group and 51 per
cent owned by the state. It is quoted on several stock exchanges.
It is the world's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions, and this year
started supplying space frames from a Michigan factory for General Motors'
new Corvette sports car.
It has also been co-operating on car space-frame concepts since the
mid-1980s with various groups, including Renault in France, Porsche in
Germany and Pininfarina in Italy.

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, is reshuffling its
international management team following the departure of Mr Paul Stern, the
former chairman.
Mr Jean Monty, who took over from Mr Stern as president and chief executive
in spring, has promoted several long-serving officers to top strategic
positions.
Analysts say this is only the first wave of a broad management
restructuring. More changes are due shortly as Nortel moves to shore up its
worldwide utility customer base, rebuild labour relations, and restore
investor confidence.
The group stock has fallen about 20 per cent in heavy trading on North
American exchanges following Mr Monty's warning a week ago that the company
would report a second-quarter loss after special charges.
The leading appointments are:
Mr Roy Merrills, head of the US subsidiary, becomes executive vice-president
of a new Americas division and responsible for all marketing in North and
South America and the Caribbean.
Mr Gedas Sakus, now head of the Canadian subsidiary, will head switching
equipment operations worldwide, in charge of both manufacturing and product
development. He replaces Mr Alan Lutz. Mr James Long, now head of the
Asia-Pacific subsidiary in Tokyo, becomes executive vice-president of a new
division responsible for Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc to divide shares
in lead-up to float
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals company poised for privatisation by the
new centre-right government, will this month divide its shares in a
four-for-one split.
The share split, scheduled for July 12, will apply to Rhone-Poulenc's
preferred investment certificates as well as to its ordinary shares.
The nominal value of the shares and certificates will be reduced from FFr100
to FFr25, with investors receiving four new shares for each one already
held.
Analysts have interpreted the share split as a means of improving the
liquidity of Rhone-Poulenc's equity in the approach to privatisation.
The company confirmed one of its motives was to make its stock more liquid,
but said the main reason was to harmonise the price trading level of its
ordinary shares in Paris and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in New
York.
French companies have traditionally attached far higher nominal value to
their shares than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts.
Rhone-Poulenc, quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, gave its ADRs a
nominal value of a quarter of its ordinary shares, to make them easier to
trade in the US. The share split will ensure that both the ADRs and ordinary
shares have the same nominal value.
The group has made no secret of its hopes of being one of the first
state-controlled companies to be sold in the privatisation drive.
The Balladur government, now putting the finishing touches to its
privatisation legislation, has identified 21 candidates for sale and plans
to include between three and six in the first round of sales due in
September.
The share split should make Rhone-Poulenc's shares more marketable to
international investors.
Just over 37 per cent of the group's equity is in public issue, with the
state owning 43.4 per cent directly and controlling the rest through
public-sector institutions.

AN accounting rule change forcing companies to disclose the value of options

The US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has published its
exposure draft which is essentially unchanged from an earlier FASB proposal
which would force companies to recognise stock options and other stock-based
compensation rewards as an expense.
The FASB wants comments on the draft by December 31.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ryder System to spin off
aviation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RYDER SYSTEM, the Miami-based transportation group, plans to spin off its
aviation business as a separately-quoted company and take a net
second-quarter restructuring charge of Dollars 169.4m. The plan involves a
large jet turbine overhaul shop in Prestwick, Scotland, bought from British
Caledonian in 1986.
Existing Ryder shareholders will be offered shares in the aviation company
through a tax-free distribution of stock. The new group will be based in
Dallas and take in Ryder Airline Services, Ryder Aviall, and Inventory
Locator Service.
Included in its assets will be the Prestwick facility, which employs about
800 and works on General Electric engines for airlines such as British
Airways, Continental, USAir and British Midland.
Ryder claims to be the world's largest independent supplier of turbine
aircraft engine repair services and the biggest distributor of aviation
parts and supplies.
Although it plans to shed peripheral operations - Ryder Aviall's business
aviation and helicopter engine repair business; its aircraft and terminal
services operation at Dallas's Love Field; and a sales unit in Miami - the
new company would have had revenues of Dollars 1.2bn in 1992, and assets, at
end-1992, of Dollars 1.2bn.
Profits from the aviation interests, however, fell last year - a trend
blamed on lower demand, but which continued in the first quarter of 1993.
About Dollars 500m of debt - just over a quarter of the total at Ryder -
attaches to the aviation interests, and will transfer to the demerged
entity.
Demergers have become increasingly popular in the US recently, as companies
have attempted to generate investor interest by reshaping.
Ryder claimed the deal would allow both its 'highway' transportation
interests and the aviation units to 'focus more sharply' on their respective
markets.

<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest listed company, and Statoil, the Norwegian
state oil company, have agreed to swap shareholdings in a planned pipeline
and two oil and gas fields which are under development.
The terms of the deal call for Statoil to receive from Norsk Hydro a cash
payment of between NKr150m (Dollars 20.8m) and NKr170m (Dollars 23.5m), a
1.25 per cent stake in the Heidrun oil and gas field, and a 1.25 per cent
stake in the planned Haltenpipe pipeline.
In exchange, Norsk Hydro will receive from Statoil a 10 per cent
shareholding - half of which is owned by the state - in the Brage oil and
gas field, which Hydro operates.
The deal boosts Hydro's stake in the Brage field to 23.2 per cent from 13.2
per cent. Statoil's stake in the Heidrun field will be lifted to 11.25 per
cent from 10 per cent as will its shareholding in the Haltenpipe pipeline.
The exchange of assets will have to be approved by the industry and energy
ministry.
The state owns a 65 per cent stake in both the Heidrun field and in
Haltenpipe and 33.4 per cent of Brage. Statoil's share in the Brage field is
reduced to 12.6 per cent, while Norsk Hydro will relinquish to Statoil its
shareholdings in both Heidrun and Haltenpipe, according to the terms of the
deal.
The NKr10.5bn Brage field is due to come on stream on November 15, earlier
than planned originally. It contains an estimated 38.5m cubic metres of oil
and 2.8bn cubic metres of natural gas.
The NKr25bn Heidrun field is due to come on stream in the third quarter of
1995, when Statoil will take over its operation from Conoco Norway.
The Haltenpipe pipeline, operated by Statoil, is designed to handle a
minimum throughput of 2.2bn cubic metres of gas a year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUNDIG, Germany's leading home electronics group, returned a loss of DM296m
(Dollars 175.1m) last year as falling prices, exchange rate movements and
rationalisation costs and poor industry conditions took their toll.
The company, which is owned 32 per cent owned by Philips, the Dutch
electronics group, said last year's deficit compared with a relatively
modest loss of DM18.6m in the previous year. Extraordinary costs were
DM119m.
The result was worse than the loss of DM200m which the company forecast in
the autumn of last year. It blamed the increased losses on overcapacity in
the worldwide home electronics industry - which hit the group's margins - as
well as the cost of reducing its own capacity through the closure of plant
and the reduction of the workforce.
Turnover fell to DM3.71bn from DM4.24bn. Mr Pieter Harmsen, chief executive,
said yesterday that falling prices and exchange rate movements trimmed sales
by DM270m last year.
Mr Harmsen warned that further rationalisation was necessary. Last year,
total jobs fell to 16,706 from 20,473 and the chief executive said agreement
had been reached with workforce representatives for a further 2,000 job cuts
across the group in the current year.
Stripping out the effect of price falls and exchange rate changes, sales
would have risen by 1 per cent, Mr Harmsen said at yesterday's press
conference in Nuremberg. This was a sign that the group had improved its
market position despite the poor conditions for the sector.
The loss on ordinary trading activities was DM187m, against a profit of
DM75m in the previous year. Domestic turnover fell to DM2.07bn from DM2.31bn
while abroad it dropped back to DM1.64bn from DM1.93bn in 1991.
In March, Philips reported a loss of Fl 900m (Dollars 473.6m) last year,
blaming 'unprecedented conditions' in worldwide consumer electronics
markets. It said then that in response it planned to cut 12,000 to 15,000
jobs worldwide and that it would work to eliminate duplication of production
and development activities between the parent company and Grundig.

<TEXT>
IBM, the US computer maker, plans to form a subsidiary to sell low-cost
personal computers in the US under the Ambra brand name, mirroring its
earlier moves in Europe and Canada.
It has also formed a new division within its personal systems organisation
to develop a new generation of high-performance desktop and PCs based on the
Power PC microprocessor it has developed with Apple Computer and Motorola of
the US.
The moves reflect IBM's determination to extend its lead in the PC market by
offering products that appeal to all segments.
While the formation of the US Ambra subsidiary may give IBM a boost in PC
profits in the near term, the new division represents a long-term strategic
effort to ensure IBM is strongly positioned in an emerging segment of the PC
market.
Ambra will offer products aimed at price sensitive buyers and will compete
directly with the 'clones' of IBM's PCs offered by lesser-known
manufacturers. As in the UK, where Ambra was introduced last year, the
product line will not carry IBM's name and the subsidiary company will
operate independently.
Ambra US could represent a serious threat to second and third-tier PC
manufacturers in the US who are already feeling the pressure of intense
price competition.
In contrast, the newly-formed Power Personal Systems division is an in-house
effort to benefit from IBM's substantial investments in Power PC
microprocessors for PC products.
By placing the development group in a separate division, IBM aims to
maintain the focus of its existing PC business on development of PCs using
Intel microprocessors.
IBM's semiconductor partner in the Power PC chip effort is touting the new
chips as having 'the power to blow away Pentium,' Intel's latest
microprocessor chip.
IBM PC, however, has no plans to abandon the Intel architecture and is
developing PC products using 'Pentium and future Intel microprocessors,' a
spokesman said.
However, IBM aims to make the most of its investment in Power PC by offering
the broadest possible range of products using the new technology.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Leading French food retailer
reduces deficit

<TEXT>
SODIAAL, one of France's leading food groups, yesterday said it had cut its
net loss last year to FFr36m (Dollars 6.31m) from FFr272m in 1991 despite a
heavy deficit from its Spanish subsidiary.
However, Mr Nicolas Le Chatelier, chief executive, criticised the 'crazy
trend' for big French food retailers to try to compete on price against the
German-style discount outlets that are now expanding aggressively in France.
He said Sodiaal, which is best known for its Yoplait yoghurt and Candia milk
brands, was willing to increase its output of cheaper unbranded products,
particularly in the fresh foods sector. But he stressed that the group was
also determined 'to protect its brands'.
The French food market has had a tough time in the past year due to the
parallel pressures of economic recession and a stream of mergers among the
powerful hypermarket chains.
French producers, such as Sodiaal, have also faced stiff competition from
the fast-expanding European groups including Nestle of Switzerland and the
Anglo-Dutch Unilever.
Sodiaal suffered a fall in turnover from FFr17.6bn (Dollars 3.08bn) in 1991
to FFr16.3bn in 1992, due to exchange rate fluctuations after the September
currency crisis.
The group's Spanish business was in the red with a FFr167m loss.
Mr Le Chatelier said it had reorganised its activities in Spain, by buying
out its local partner to take full control, in the hope that the business
would break even this year.
The Spanish loss cancelled out a net profit of FFr130m from Sodiaal's French
interests, which have benefited from restructuring.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nokia to increase size of
placement

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group which has recently moved back into
profit on the back of rapid telecommunications sales, said yesterday it was
increasing the size of an international share placement, originally
announced in May, to 5.22m preference shares from 3.8m in response to strong
demand.
The offer price was set at FM159 (Dollars 28.07) per share, promising Nokia
around FM830m in new capital which, the group said, made the offering the
biggest international issue by a Finnish company.
Lead-managers Credit Suisse First Boston and Enskilda Corporate have also
been given an option to sell a further 780,000 shares to cover
oversubscriptions.
The price compared with a market level of just over FM160 earlier this week.
Nokia yesterday expressed satisfaction that the issue, which will result in
a near-10 per cent dilution of existing Nokia stock, had not dented demand
on the Helsinki stock exchange. Volume was strong yesterday at around
600,000 shares traded and the price moved above FM170.
Before the issue, some 20 per cent of Nokia stock was foreign-held following
the relaxation of restrictions on foreign share ownership from the start of
this year.
Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive, said the new capital would greatly
strengthen Nokia's balance sheet, helping it fund a surge by its
telecommunications and mobile telephone businesses recently in Europe and
eastern Asia.
Last month, Nokia reported a pre-tax profit for the first four months of
FM154m, rebounding from a FM280m loss at the same stage last year and an
overall loss in 1992 of FM158m.
The chief factor behind the improvement was a 109 per cent rise in mobile
phone sales and an 80 per cent rise in telecommunications sales.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN and former chairman of Metrologie International, the French
information services group, have been fined by the Commission des Operations
de Bourse, the Paris stock market watchdog, after an investigation into
movements in its shares.
Mr Alain Fraiberger, chairman of Metrologie, and Mr Roger Haddad, his
predecessor, have been fined FFr300,000 (Dollars 52,219) and FFr350,000
respectively. They are the largest of the FFr950,000 in fines imposed by the
COB on senior executives of Metrologie.
The COB began its investigation following sharp fluctuations in Metrologie's
share price at the end of 1991. It has criticised Metrologie executives for
selling shares in the company in 1991 prior to the publication of a gloomy
announcement about the company's financial performance.
Metrologie said that Mr Fraiberger was appealing against the COB report.

confidence

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the diversified Italian holding
company with borrowings of more than L31,000bn (Dollars 20bn), hit a new low
in Milan yesterday in response to a further loss of investor confidence.
Ferfin ordinary shares fell almost 9 per cent to L408.2, taking the
cumulative fall to 61.6 per cent since the end of May, when the company
announced a L1,519bn loss for 1992. This week, it revised its loss to
L1,667bn after the disclosure of more losses at its Montedison industrial
subsidiary.
Yesterday's drop came in reaction to the announcement at Ferfin's
shareholders' meeting on Wednesday of a meeting at the end of August to
approve a write-down of the group's capital.
The August assembly is likely to be followed by a big rights issue, which
will cement creditor banks' control over the group. Last month, Ferfin and
the controlling Ferruzzi family called on the group's five main creditor
banks to work out a rescue package.
Analysts said the share price drop was also influenced by continuing
investigations by Milan magistrates monitoring the rescue package on behalf
of minority shareholders.
The magistrates this week questioned Mr Roberto Michetti, the ex-finance
director of Montedison, who now works for Mr Raul Gardini, Ferfin's former
guiding light who has now set up his own group.
The investigations follow Monday's revelations of an additional L435bn
write-off in Montedison's 1992 accounts owing to an 'irrecoverable' loan by
an obscure Curacao-based subsidiary. Mr Michetti was also chairman of
Montedison International Holding, the Swiss subsidiary which indirectly
controlled the Curacao company.
The inquiries came against a bizarre twist at Fondiaria, the big Florentine
insurance company controlled jointly by Ferfin and the heirs of the late Mr
Camillo De Benedetti.
Shareholders at Fondiaria's AGM on Wednesday were astonished to be told it
had received a letter from Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former Ferfin executive
now being sought by magistrates, resigning from the board.
Mr Garofano disappeared earlier this year Milan after magistrates issued a
warrant against him regarding a L250m payment to the Christian Democrat
party. Mr Garofano claimed the money was his own, and not funds from the
Ferruzzi group.
The letter, dated June 16 and written by hand on Mr Garofano's personal
notepaper, was delivered without a stamp or postmark. It helps confirms the
widespread view that Mr Garofano, a chemical engineer, is alive and in
hiding.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Citicorp spins off venture side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the US banking group, has spun off its European venture capital
activities into an independent company, CVC Capital Partners.
CVC will be wholly owned by Citicorp's existing European management team.
This move will free the venture capital operations from US banking
regulations which have in the past limited the scale of their activities.
As a first move, CVC intends to raise at least Dollars 150m (Pounds 100m) of
new finance on top of the Dollars 550m already available.
The bank has specialised in financing medium-sized and large management
buy-outs, often involving businesses with activities in several countries.
Citicorp has signed a long-term agreement to provide funds to CVC, said Mr
Michael Smith, managing director of venture capital operations. He declined
to disclose exact figures but the Dollars 550m package available comprises
this Citicorp commitment, the existing venture capital portfolio and Dollars
150m of funds raised two years ago.
The creation of a separate venture capital management company will allow
'some enhancement' of the earnings of the management team, said Mr Smith.
Bank-owned venture capital companies frequently have difficulty matching the
remuneration packages of independent funds though Citicorp had a competitive
earnings package, he said. Nine of Citicorp's 36 European venture capital
executives will become shareholders in the new company.
Mr Peter Burnim, managing director of corporate finance at Citicorp, said
the new arrangement brought its venture capital business into line with
common industry practice.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pace hots up for new equity issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS been a surge of new equity issues on the London Stock Exchange
with the amount raised in the first half of this year already exceeding the
total for the whole of last year by 6.6 per cent.
According to a survey by IFR Securities Data, a total of Pounds 11.8bn has
so far been raised this year, compared with Pounds 11bn in the previous 12
months. This year's first half total of 294 new issues is 72 per cent ahead
of the same stage last year.
IFR said this represented a remarkable turnaround in both the willingness of
companies to seek new capital, and in investor confidence.
Rights issues continued to be the preferred method of capital raising, with
Pounds 7.48bn of the Pounds 11.8bn raised this year having been through cash
calls. Last year they accounted for 34 per cent of the volume underwritten,
but the figure now stands at 64 per cent.
The Zeneca cash call represented 18 per cent of this total, and 11.5 per
cent of the whole domestic new equity issues market. The property sector
accounted for 12.8 per cent of rights activity, with large issues from
Slough Estates, Hammerson, British Land and MEPC.
SG Warburg leads the league table of merchant bankers handling the new
equity issues, having raised Pounds 1.96bn so far this year - 16.6 per cent
of the total - from 39 issues. IFR said that Warburg's dominance of the
market this year already seemed assured.
Lazard Brothers is second, with Pounds 1.18bn underwritten in the first half
from 11 issues. BZW is third, with a total of Pounds 1.15bn from 20 issues.
Morgan Grenfell is fourth, having raised Pounds 1.12bn from eight issues.
With established UK houses at the top, the survey said Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley were leading a cautious American move into the market.

SG WARBURG Securities took the title of top stockbroking research company
for the third year running in Extel's 1993 Survey of Financial Analysts.
James Capel, which dominated the awards for the entire 1980s, reclaimed the
number two slot from NatWest Securities which slipped to third.
Extel had replies to its survey from 122 fund managers who collectively
manage Pounds 725bn of funds.
UBS slipped furthest, from 4th to 6th position and was voted as having shown
the most deterioration in quality of research. Credit Lyonnais Laing (10th)
and Smith New Court (7th) showed the greatest quality improvement and were
only a few votes short of UBS.
Kleinwort Benson's water team won Extel's 'all stars' team award for the
highest number of votes in any sector.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Inkjet print battle leaves its mark /
Details of a niche market which is dominated by UK-owned companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROGRESS of one of Britain's few high technology leaders is charted in a
laconic note at the back of GEC's results statement this week. 'Videojet's
sales and profits advanced, with new operations established in the
Netherlands and Ireland'.
The bland commentary camouflages the new aggression that the company, based
in the US but owned by GEC, is displaying in the European marketplace,
unsettling its chief competitors and forcing them on the defensive.
Mr Michael Keeling, managing director of Linx Printing Technologies, one of
Videojet's newest challengers, said wryly yesterday: 'Videojet has been
growing much faster than people anticipated.'
Videojet specialises in continuous or industrial inkjet printing. Its
systems are designed to print numbers, letters, barcodes and graphics on
almost anything and are sufficiently delicate to print on fresh eggs and
accurate enough for telephone cabling.
Industrial inkjet printers differ from their office equivalents in
robustness and speed. They are the only machines capable of labelling
products on ultra high speed production lines.
A small but growing niche market, it is dominated by British-owned
companies. Videojet disputes overall leadership with Domino Printing
Sciences, the Cambridge company, each having close to a third of the world
market. Linx and another UK company, Willett, have under 10 per cent each.
The overseas competition is represented by Imaje of France with about 16 per
cent, and Hitachi of Japan with 7 per cent.
The market has grown rapidly in the past few years, driven by national and
international legislation demanding the marking of foods, beverages and
drugs with batch numbers and sell-by dates.
'Everybody did well,' said Mr Howard Whitesmith, Domino's managing director.
Domino's share price reached 620p earlier this year, while Linx came to the
market in October 1992 at 130p and saw the shares advance to 220p.
Now the boom has petered out and supply exceeds demand in Europe for the
first time since the 1980s. Imaje, which moved ambitiously from distribution
to direct sales, is losing money and shedding staff.
Domino issued a profits warning in March and Linx followed suit in May.
Yesterday their shares were trading at 430p and 117p respectively.
However, Mr Adrian Shepherd, managing director of Videojet in the UK, does
not think the inkjet printing bubble has burst. 'There is a lot of business
out there to be had, although the market is becoming more competitive.'
He points to the possibility of new legislation forcing producers to label
eggs and a spread of opportunities in the labelling of pharmaceuticals and
automotive parts.
He believes his business grew 15 per cent in the UK last year compared with
9 per cent for Domino and an estimated 4 per cent for Linx.
Hard numbers are difficult to come by in this business. The fact that
Videojet's figures are not reported separately in GEC's corporate results
makes analysis difficult.
Mr Whitesmith, for example, estimates that 9,000 small character inkjet
printers were sold worldwide in the first half of 1993, of which Domino had
a 29 per cent share and Videojet 1 per cent less. Mr Shepherd reckons the
total to be 10,500 units with Videojet in the lead with 30 per cent and
Domino in the high 20s.
A principal battleground is the US, where Videojet is synonymous with
industrial inkjet printing, having at least 55 per cent. Domino, however,
has failed to make much impression.
Domino produced gross profits up 21 per cent in the six months to April but
the pre-tax figure fell from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 3.7m. The main reason was
the cost of taking on 14 additional sales staff together with support in the
US, so far without much result.
Mr Whitesmith blames a reluctance to invest while US business assesses the
impact of the Clinton administration. Others argue that Domino
underestimated the strength of Videojet's hold on the market.
Mr Whitesmith is confident about the coming year, pointing to strong sales
in the UK and France where its blue chip customers include Citroen, the
motor manufacturer, and Nestle, owner of the Vittel bottled water brand.
Mr Keeling blames the company's likelihood of flat profits this year on
competition from Videojet coupled with inexperience in operating as a public
company.
'The effort of going public took more senior management attention than we
anticipated. It has been a hard year and we have to do things differently.'
The company recently took on an experienced senior executive from Videojet
to run sales and marketing. It has performed particularly well in Japan and
the Far East, now its biggest market. Hitachi, the Japanese challenger,
seems content to stay on its home turf.
Given the interest in industrial labelling, the inkjet printer market seems
certain to continue to expand although at a modest 10 per cent a year or so
compared to the exuberant rates of 25 per cent to 30 per cent in earlier
years when legislation forced the pace.
The days of easy pickings have gone. With Videojet taking the battle to
Europe, Domino, Imaje and the others have a fight on their hands.
If Videojet gets permission to break out its figures from GEC's results, the
full extent of the threat would be revealed.

the cost of taking on 14 additional sales staff together with support in the
US, so far without much result.
Mr Whitesmith blames a reluctance to invest while US business assesses the
impact of the Clinton administration. Others argue that Domino
underestimated the strength of Videojet's hold on the market.
Mr Whitesmith is confident about the coming year, pointing to strong sales
in the UK and France where its blue chip customers include Citroen, the
motor manufacturer, and Nestle, owner of the Vittel bottled water brand.
Mr Keeling blames the company's likelihood of flat profits this year on
competition from Videojet coupled with inexperience in operating as a public
company.
'The effort of going public took more senior management attention than we
anticipated. It has been a hard year and we have to do things differently.'
The company recently took on an experienced senior executive from Videojet
to run sales and marketing. It has performed particularly well in Japan and
the Far East, now its biggest market. Hitachi, the Japanese challenger,
seems content to stay on its home turf.
Given the interest in industrial labelling, the inkjet printer market seems
certain to continue to expand although at a modest 10 per cent a year or so
compared to the exuberant rates of 25 per cent to 30 per cent in earlier
years when legislation forced the pace.
The days of easy pickings have gone. With Videojet taking the battle to
Europe, Domino, Imaje and the others have a fight on their hands. If
Videojet gets permission to break out its figures from GEC's results, the
full extent of the threat would be revealed.

FT  02 JUL 93 / The Property Market: An uncertain game plan - BR's vast
holdings post-privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the game of Monopoly, few investments are more reliable and
straightforward than station property. But in the real world, the opposite
may apply. The opportunity to invest in railway property after British
Rail's privatisation is likely to be greeted with perplexity and caution.
This is not for lack of opportunity. British Rail owns land on a scale
unmatched by any other nationalised business. It owns 156,000 acres of land,
2,500 stations and a tenanted estate with an annual income of Pounds 148m.
Although BR refuses to divulge the results of a recent property revaluation,
its property assets undoubtedly runs into billions of pounds.
Initially at least, privatisation is likely to offer plum opportunities for
chartered surveyors, rather than investors or the taxpayer. The new
structure for the railways will create many landlords and tenants, each of
which will require property advice. 'It will be a bonanza for property
advisers,' says Mr Bob Hill, managing director of British Rail Property
Board (BRPB), which manages BR's tenanted estate.
Unlike some privatisations, investors are not being lured by the promise of
a rich vein of under-exploited property. 'There is as much effort going into
ensuring that in the future assets are properly managed as looking for scope
for exploitation,' says Mr Stephen Barter of chartered surveyors Richard
Ellis, which is advising the Department of Transport on the property
implications of privatisation.
The question of how privatisation will improve the management of BR property
assets provokes answers that are long on rhetoric and short on detail. The
government's advisers say that privatisation will identify and exploit those
opportunities where greater competition and the involvement of private
sector finance and management skills can provide better value for money.
There are two ways in which privatisation is expected to lead to better
property man-agement:
Privatisation may lead to more cost-effective management of the railway
estate, since privatised station operators will have greater incentive to
contain their costs.
Privatisation will overcome the allegedly unhelpful division of management
within stations between British Rail, which manages the train operations and
is responsible for issues such as safety, and BRPB, which manages the
buildings. These different responsibilities will be handled by a single
authority when a station is sold to a private operator, which will have an
incentive to improve both the running and the facilities of the station.
Just how far British Rail needs to improve its property management is a moot
point. In 1985 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission published a highly
critical report about BRPB. The report slammed everything from its marketing
skills to its filing system. But in recent years, BRPB is credited with
having exploited the 1980s development boom adroitly. In conjuction with
Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, it was responsible for the Broadgate and
Ludgate complexes in the City of London, some of London's better new
developments.
Given British Rail's proven ability to co-operate with the private sector in
projects such as Broadgate and Ludgate, there is some scepticism within the
organisation about the advantages offered under the new regime.
According to Richard Ellis, an important difference under the new system is
that the private sector will be able to undertake developments inside
stations, as well as above and alongside them. Investors might, for
instance, see opportunities for installing shopping plazas inside stations
located in city centres.
At this stage, discussions with potential investors are tentative. The
Department of Transport is unable to market the opportunities too
energetically because of the poor state of the property market and the large
number of policy questions which still answers. Even the plans that have
been worked out could be altered by parliament before the bill receives
royal consent, probably in October.
In broad outline, the privatisation plan is to split BR's estate into two
parts. One half, which may be known as BR Property, will manage its
non-operational property, such as disused viaducts. The other half will
comprise station freeholds and other operational property. These will be
owned by Railtrack, the track authority, which in turn will be owned by the
government, although it has been earmarked for privatisation in the medium
term.
There is still considerable uncertainty about how these arrangements will
work in practice. It is unclear, for instance, how much Railtrack will be
able to borrow; which assets Railtrack will own; and which of BRPB's staff
will join Railtrack (Mr Bob Hill, managing director of BRPB, has already
been appointed Railtrack's property director).
Once these questions have been resolved, there will be an extensive overhaul
of the railways' property management. But there is some scepticism among
BR's senior management about the significance of these changes. In the view
of Mr Hill, the impact will be muted. 'I think the reality is that there
won't be a dramatic difference in terms of what happens to property,' he
says.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Gibbs Mew to near doubled
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIBBS MEW, the family-controlled brewer and commercial property group, which
last year fought off a hostile bid from Brierley Investments, yesterday
reported a near-doubling of annual profits.
On group turnover of Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 20.1m) pre-tax profits for the 53
weeks to April 3 advanced from Pounds 633,000 to Pounds 1.23m. The outcome
was buoyed by a six month contribution from UK D which accounted for
turnover of Pounds 7m and operating profits of Pounds 471,000.
The core brewing, wholesaling and retailing side lifted operating profits by
11 per cent to Pounds 2.16m although bad trade loan and debt provisions
amounting to Pounds 262,000 were taken as an exceptional charge.
Mr Peter Gibbs, chairman, said that sales of Deacon, the group's new cask
beer, were 'most encouraging'. The trading environment for both tenanted and
managed houses, however, remained 'testing'.
As stated at the interim stage, costs of Pounds 129,000 relating to the bid
defence were taken below the line, leaving attributable profits of Pounds
948,000 (Pounds 657,000). Brierley Investments, which first acquired a
holding in the company in 1987, has since disposed of its 19 per cent stake
to a number of institutions.
Fully diluted earnings per share emerged at 16.74p (11.87p) and a
recommended final dividend of 4.5p lifts the total to 7.5p (6.75p).
The shares, traded on the USM, rose 13p to 263p.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: HunterPrint shares fall 17p as talks end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN HunterPrint yesterday fell 17p to 50p after the specialist printer
announced that talks with a possible bidder had ended.
The Corby-based company, which ousted Sir Ian MacGregor, its former
chairman, in August and pushed through its second refinancing package in two
years in December, was forced to reveal that it had been contacted by an
unidentified potential bidder after a sharp rise in its share price in early
May.
The board, however, yesterday issued a brief statement saying that 'the
talks resulting from these contacts had been inconclusive and have
consequently been terminated'.
Last year HunterPrint reported Pounds 12.2m of losses on turnover of Pounds
52.2m.
However, in the six months to end-March, the group managed a turnround to
profitability following the refinancing with pre-tax profits of Pounds
330,000 on sales of Pounds 26.6m.
The complex December refinancing package, including a Pounds 20m placing and
offer, was put together by Mr Jeff Samson, chairman, and Mr Tony Caplin,
chief executive.
It raised a net Pounds 18.3m and was mainly designed to reduce lease
obligations on printing machinery at the Corby printing plant.
New investors, including lessors, picked up 47.1 per cent of the 40m shares
issued and as a result of the refinancing, Ferag, a Swiss company which
supplied binding machinery to the Corby factory, became HunterPrint's
largest shareholder with 6.9m shares, equivalent to an 11.9 per cent stake.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Storm writes off brush with Russian
paintings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORM GROUP, the UK animation, licensing and merchandising company, is
writing off the last of its paintings received from the Soviet Union instead
of royalties in view of the fall in the art market.
Mr Jim Driscoll, executive chairman of the USM-quoted group, said: 'We
expect to be able to sell them when the market improves but we wanted to
clear the decks as part of the change of direction of the company.'
The paintings, all by 20th century Russian artists, had been in the books at
Pounds 276,000. Their write-off formed part of an exceptional charge of
Pounds 2.08m in the 1992 results.
Mr Driscoll said the company had raised Pounds 100,000 from sales of
paintings to cover the value of the royalties.
Pre-tax losses came out at Pounds 2.11m (against Pounds 848,000) on turnover
of Pounds 6.04m (up from Pounds 1.43m). During the year the company decided
to pull out of investing in cartoon productions. It will concentrate on
licensing and merchandising.
As a result of the change, film costs are being written off as they are
incurred.
This accounted for Pounds 1.54m of the exceptional costs for 1992, with
Pounds 750,000 being charged to the previous year.
The company fell into operating losses in the second half of the year. It
said it expected to return to profits for the first half of 1993. Mr
Driscoll said he was confident the improving trend would continue in the
second half.
Losses per share were 2.8p (against 1.7p).

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eurocamp hit by sharp downturn in bookings
 -Shares fall 28p on warning of full year setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 15 per cent fall in the market for self-drive camping and caravanning
holidays from the UK to France has hit Eurocamp, which warned yesterday that
annual pre-tax profits would fall by 30 to 35 per cent from the Pounds 9.4m
recorded in 1992.
In the half year ended April, Eurocamp, the market leader, saw pre-tax
losses up slightly from Pounds 4.96m to Pounds 5.12m.
The shares dropped 28p to 203p on the news, although the interim dividend is
held at 3.45p and the group said it would be cash neutral during the year.
Mr Tom Neville, chairman, said that booking volumes were 5 per cent down for
the 1993 summer season. Earlier in the year the group decided to maintain
its capacity in hope of a late booking surge, but this had not happened with
the consequence that occupancy rates fell by 6 per cent.
Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said sales for June and July had
been particularly poor. Holidaymakers had been put off by the fall in the
pound against the French franc, and the poor weather in France in 1992.
Mr Gordon Harman, finance director, said the fall in UK bookings had been
partly offset by a 5 per cent rise in bookings from the Netherlands and
Belgium and a 10 per cent increase from Germany and Switzerland.
The fall in occupancy rates had a 'material effect on profits' Mr Harman
said. However, he added that at 96 nights out of a 115 night season, the
occupancy level was still high by industry standards. The break-even rate
was 35 nights, he said.
The forecast fall in profits would leave margins at about 11 per cent
against 15.5 per cent last year. Mr Harman said that it was now unrealistic
to expect to regain the group's historical level of margins, although some
recovery was looked for in 1994.
Mr Atkinson said the group was looking at cost control, though it did not
want to compromise on its standards of tents and mobile homes which are
higher than its competitors. It would have to address customers looking for
value, though would not chase those only concerned with the lowest price.
Operating losses were Pounds 4.87m (Pounds 4.57m) and net interest costs
were down from Pounds 392,000 to Pounds 266,000. Losses per share were 13.2p
(12.9p).
COMMENT
Eurocamp has found the competition tougher in a declining market and will
have to demonstrate a strong response before investors can become
enthusiastic about the shares. The lead times in the business mean that it
will be next March before there are firm signs about 1994 bookings. Before
then Eurocamp has to fix its brochure prices, with a structure tailored to
address the problem of poor mid-season bookings. The forecast fall in
profits suggests an outcome of about Pounds 6.35m, and a prospective p/e of
12.5. Unless everything is gloomy the final dividend should be maintained
giving a yield of 6.4 per cent covered 1.6 to 1.7 times.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown first-half trading on target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings yesterday issued a trading statement saying that first
half profits were likely to be 'very much in line with the budget for the
period'.
The shares rose 7p to 144p.
One stockbroker explained the reaction to a seemingly innocuous statement
saying, 'it was the first in-line trading statement from Hillsdown in
years'.
Hillsdown is the latest of a series of companies which have put out trading
statements to avoid any suggestion that they are giving price sensitive
information to a select audience.
The company's half year ended on June 30 and it is seeing analysts next
week. It felt that in the light of recent events - such as the Stock
Exchange censuring London International Group when it briefed analysts on
profits ahead of announcing results - it was better 'to err on the side of
caution'.
Hillsdown said that operating profits from continuing businesses would be
not less than Pounds 80m in the half year, compared to Pounds 81.8m in the
first half of 1992.
It also published last year's interim results restated on an FRS 3 basis, to
give analysts a base to work from. These showed pre-tax profits of Pounds
74.8m rather than the Pounds 78.1m originally published.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Crest Nicholson reduces interim deficit to
Pounds 3.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREST Nicholson, the Surrey-based housebuilder, incurred a pre-tax deficit
of Pounds 3.9m in the six months to April 30.
The outcome compared with a restated loss of Pounds 4.39m last time; figures
for both periods were calculated on the basis of the new FRS 3 accounting
standard.
Directors said that in the light of the outcome they had decided it would
not be appropriate to pay an interim dividend but would review the position
at the end of the year.
After all deductions, the group incurred a retained deficit of Pounds 3.7m
(Pounds 4.55m), equivalent to losses per share of 4.84p (5.95p).
Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, said the group had made a loss despite a
'robust improvement' in the UK housing market since the new year.
Housing sales and reservations were up about 15 per cent since the end of
October. The rate of recovery, however, had slowed since the end of May.
Housing operations made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.45m, against losses
last time of Pounds 1.64m. Mr Callcutt said that this was a creditable
performance given that the first half, traditionally, is weaker for house
sales.
The results were also helped by a 20 per cent reduction in overheads
compared with a year ago.
Crest was let down by its commercial property operations which incurred a
Pounds 3.9m pre-tax loss (Pounds 1.45m loss) and by its construction
division which lost Pounds 255,000 compared with profits of Pounds 2.55m.
The market for commercial property had improved in recent weeks. During the
past three months Crest had agreed to let or sell 161,000 sq ft of the
263,000 sq ft of premises either built or under construction.
Mr Callcutt said most of the deals were for letting but this should make the
sale of the properties easier to achieve.
Sale proceeds would be used to reduce net debt, which by the period end had
climbed from Pounds 54m to Pounds 72.1m, equivalent to a rise in gearing
from 53 per cent to 71 per cent. Borrowings were well within the company's
bank facilities of Pounds 150m, said Mr Callcutt.
Despite the rise in debt, interest charges were reduced from Pounds 3.73m to
Pounds 3.29m reflecting lower UK interest rates.
COMMENT
Crest's performance in surviving the recession intact is to be
congratulated. Borrowings, which at one stage exceeded Pounds 110m, have
been steadily reduced through property disposals, land sales and sales of
non-core businesses. It is a case of so far so good. Further progress will
depend upon the company's ability to make additional property sales to
reduce debt to a target level of Pounds 50m. It may also need some housing
land sales if it is to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m this year to
justify payment of a small final dividend. There is still ground to be made
up and those wishing to invest in a housing recovery may get better value by
looking elsewhere.

A look at the proposed rescue package for Aer Lingus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORPORATE rescue plan for Aer Lingus, Ireland's state airline, still
lanquishes in a government in-tray two weeks after Mr Bernie Cahill,
executive chairman, presented it for cabinet approval with a warning that
urgent and drastic action was needed if the airline was to survive.
The airline is losing money faster than a Jumbo jet burns aviation fuel  -
IPounds 120 a minute, IPounds 1.2m per week - and its bankers have
threatened to shut off the financial fuel taps next month unless a
restructuring plan is rapidly put in place.
The core of Mr Cahill's plan, drawn up with Mr Peter Owen, the chief
executive who was a former senior executive of British Airways during its
preparation for privatisation, is to cut operating costs of the air
transport division by some 10 per cent, or IPounds 50m (Pounds 48m)
annually, to radically overhaul working practices and to scrap the
controversial Shannon stopover to allow direct flights between Dublin and
the US.
A one-off IPounds 175m cash injection from the government is being sought.
About 70 per cent of the savings would be achieved through payroll cuts
involving 1,280 redundancies from the airline's 5,500 staff employed
worldwide.
The remainder would be achieved through improved operational efficiencies.
Not surprisingly, the government has been faced with intense lobbying to
drastically modify the plan.
Pressure has come mostly from trade unions and supporters in the west of
Ireland of the Shannon stopover, although backbench unease within the two
coalition parties in government has also spilled into the open, as electoral
promises made last year - especially by the Labour party - will be blatantly
broken if the plan goes through as it stands.
Significantly, Mr Cahill stepped outside of his brief in recommending an end
to the Shannon stopover, and has made no apologies for doing so. He told
trade union representatives last weekend that the airline would be unlikely
to survive without the change, as 65 per cent of Dublin-US traffic was now
being routed via the UK and being lost to Aer Lingus.
Will the plan be sufficient to turn the airline around? Its critics argue
that by opening up Dublin to direct flights to the US, reciprocal
arrangements will have to be offered to stronger competitors who will be
able to undercut Aer Lingus.
The novel aspect of Mr Cahill's proposal is that the Shannon stopover would
be modified rather than totally abandoned. Instead of being based at Dublin,
the airline's Boeing 747 fleet would in future turn round at Shannon, but
make a stopover at Dublin. Direct flights to the US from Dublin could
thereby be offered, which would link up with feeder flights from the
airline's European network.
That was expected to be more attractive to business travellers which the
airline desperately needs to attract to boost the average fare obtained for
each seat sold, and to win back passengers who have deserted Aer Lingus to
UK hubs.
The catch for the transatlantic competition is that they could be offered
reciprocal direct-flight arrangements to Dublin as long as they also serve
Shannon like Aer Lingus.
What Aer Lingus does not yet appear to have worked out though is whether
such an obligation could be enforced under existing bilateral aviation
agreements with the US, or indeed whether it would be possible to maintain
in the climate of EC deregulation of the airways.
The company has no answer to this at present.
Another key element to the rescue plan is the reorganisation of the European
network with the creation of an 'Aer Lingus express' division which would
offer a cut-rate, no-frills service on certain routes which face intense
competition such as Dublin-London.
About 40 per cent of Aer Lingus' passengers travel this route, but each one
is losing the airline money at present due to stiff competition from Ryanair
and British Midland.
Aer Lingus said: 'We want to create a price-driven operation to be able to
react to challenges in an opportunistic way. If we get our cost-base right
we can compete, and we might even expand routes rather than contract them.
Price wars are a fact of life.'
Strategic alliances with other airlines are also under serious consideration
'once we are in a stronger financial position,' the company said.
A gradual disposal of non-core assets such as the Copthorne Hotel group
would play a vital part in reducing the IPounds 550m debt burden and
interest payments which were currently running at close to IPounds 60m per
year.
Aer Lingus's survival as an independent airline thus hinges on some speedy,
but politically difficult, decisions to be made by the government.
For most Irish people the disappearance of the 'shamrock-in-the-sky' would
be unthinkable, but if Mr Cahill and Mr Owen have done their sums correctly
that could indeed be the outcome if their plan is now rejected or
substantially modified for reasons of political expediency.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Field oversubscribed and goes to ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC offer for sale of shares in Field Group, the carton maker, was
7.4 times subscribed and smaller applications will go into a ballot for
shares.
Ballots are generally used in cases of heavy over-subscription for new
issues, and were frequently used at times when the flotation market became
overheated.
Bankers yesterday were trying to recall when a ballot was last used, giving
examples such as the flotations of Harry Ramsden's, the fish and chip shop,
in 1989 and Thorntons, the chocolate retailer, in 1988.
The group offered 12.1m shares to the public after placing 22.5m shares with
institutions. There were 46,280 applications in the public offer for a total
of 89.7m shares.
When the issue was priced at 250p a share some analysts said the pricing was
on the high side, giving an historic p/e of 17.7.
Dealings will start on Wednesday July 7.
Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive, said he was pleased with the response.
Field and its advisers had run various methods of allocating the shares
through a computer but could not find a way to allocate economic quantities
of shares without a ballot.
Applications for 200 to 500 shares will go into a weighted ballot for 200
shares, and applications for 750 to 2,000 shares will be in a weighted
ballot for 400 shares.
Higher applications will be scaled down, with 3,000 to 10,000 share requests
getting 13.5 per cent of the amount, and applicants for 15,000 to 500,000
getting 10 per cent. Applications above 500,000 will get nothing.
Over half of those who applied will get something, but those in the ballot

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Measurement an irony of fund management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been an irony of index fund management that the total returns of fund
managers depended to a certain extent on just who was measuring.
Thus, the daily publication starting today of the FT-SE and FT-Actuaries
indices showing total returns represents an effort by the two main
performance measurement services to agree on the best way to measure it.
For the 1992 calendar year, for instance, Combined Actuarial Performance
Services calculated the total return of the FT-A All-Share Index at 20.6
while WM Company, its leading competitor, calculated it at 20.4 per cent. In
previous years, the divergence has been as wide as 0.4 per cent - a
significant divergence for fund managers who promise to track the index
within 0.1 per cent of its total return.
'It is all about accountability,' said Mr James Woodlock, managing director
of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, the UK's largest
index-tracking fund manager. 'I have frequently been asked at trustee
meetings to explain the divergence between our own performance and that of
the index,' he said.
The most significant factor has been the assumptions made about
reinvestment. 'If I know how the index is calculated, I can run my
reinvestment on that same basis.'
Thus, publication of clearly defined and uniform criteria may cause some
shifts in the way passive index-tracking fund managers handle assets under
their control.
Mr John Clamp, chief executive of CAPS, said that the chief distortion in
calculations of total returns may have come during periods when dividends
were rising sharply. 'The use of gross dividend yield in a period when
dividends are rising sharply will underestimate the total return.'
CAPS intends to retroactively calculate its indices back to 1987 so that
pension fund trustees may form a different view of performance, he said.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hays expands in Pounds 32m German
acquisition: Services group to benefit from European unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYS, the UK business services group, has furthered its pan-European
ambitions by acquiring a national distribution business in Germany.
Hays will pay an initial Pounds 32m in cash for a 75.1 per cent stake in
Mordhurst, a private company with more than 500 employees and operations
throughout Germany, including the former East Germany.
Mordhurst, based in Kiel, specialises in multi-user warehousing and next-day
delivery for manufacturers of car parts, agricultural chemicals, oils,
office products and wine and spirits.
Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of Hays, said: 'We believe that the
current recession in Germany will accelerate the trend towards the use of
third party distribution contractors such as Mordhurst, as has been the case
in the UK and France.'
Hays, which in the UK distributes for retailers such as J Sainsbury and
Marks and Spencer, last year paid Pounds 37.5m for Fril, a French
distribution company with a national network.
Mr Frost said: 'We will now be able to offer pan-European manufacturing and
retail customers a comprehensive distribution service operating on both a
dedicated and multi-user basis.'
Last year Mordhurst made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.5m on turnover of
Pounds 64.8m. It has net assets of Pounds 10m and borrowings of Pounds 8m.
The acquisition will increase Hays' gearing from 30 to 55 per cent.
The remaining 24.9 per cent of Mordhurst's equity is owned by Mr Hermann
Rothert, managing director, who will continue to run the business. Hays has
a profit-related option to acquire his stake from 1998, for a maximum of
Pounds 34m.
Mr Frost said: 'As Germany recovers from recession, we expect the economies
of eastern Europe to grow particularly strongly. German manufacturers will
take advantage of this growth and are expected increasingly to use third
party contract distribution specialists to provide an efficient service
throughout Germany and into eastern Europe.'
On current trading, Mr Frost said a number of the group's businesses had
seen clear, measurable signs of recovery in the UK.
Hays shares closed 5p higher at 239p.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: London &amp; Met talks to banks again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; METROPOLITAN, a property company with negative net worth of Pounds
54m, has begun discussions with its bankers aimed at securing agreement on
its second financial restructuring in three years.
The company, which has debts of Pounds 120m, said yesterday that the
discussions with its banks, led by the Bank of Scotland, were 'proceeding
satisfactorily'.
In a statement which accompanied the 1992 results, which showed reduced
losses, the company said it hoped an agreement could be reached
'expeditiously', and that details of the restructuring would be available by
the end of August.
The latest discussions were made necessary by the increase in negative net
worth from Pounds 44m at the end of 1991, and because the banks' loans and
working capital facilities expired at the end of June having been extended
for a year last summer.
The company has been struggling since a Pounds 100.3m loss in 1990, mainly
reflecting provisions against falling property values, precipitated a
financial restructuring in March 1991.
At the time the banks accepted warrants in return for injecting new working
capital, converting unsecured debt into five year debt and extending their
secured debt.
Yesterday the group reported a reduced operating loss on continuing
operations of Pounds 7.4m in the year to December 31 compared to a Pounds
13.7m loss the previous year. Turnover fell to Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 28.4m).
Net interest costs fell slightly to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 12.3m) producing a
pre-tax loss on ordinary activities of Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 26m). The loss
attributable to shareholders was Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 25.2m) and losses per
share dropped to 30.2p compared with 44.3p a year earlier.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ICI to get Pounds 235m in swap with Du Pont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Indus-tries, the UK group, and Du Pont of the US,
yesterday announced the completion of the swap of their respective fibres
and acrylics operations.
ICI will be paid up to Pounds 235m because of the difference in value
between the two businesses. This is less than the Pounds 250m mentioned at
the time the deal was first struck in April last year because of the
deteriorating market for European fibres. ICI stressed yesterday it was
exiting a business that loses money for one that makes it.
The British company will receive Pounds 100m shortly after the deal is
completed. A series of deferred payments totalling Pounds 110m will follow
between 1994 and 2002. There is also a performance related payment of up to
Pounds 25m if turnover at ICI's nylon textile filament business meets agreed
targets between 1994 and the end of the decade.
The disposal of ICI's nylon business and associated costs will lead to an
exceptional pre-tax loss of about Pounds 70m. ICI loses about 5,200
employees from the deal, while it recruits about 350 from Du Pont.
The deal had been delayed by the US Federal Trade Commission. The FTC has
insisted that ICI divests to a third party a proportion of its downstream
acrylics polymer production. It is understood that this will affect one US
plant which was not acquired as part of the deal. ICI already has two
American acrylics operations, K-S-H, which it bought in 1989, and
Continental Polymers which it acquired in 1991. Both manufacture acrylic
extruded sheet and moulding polymer.
Du Pont's acrylics business, had turnover last year of about Pounds 200m.
The assets, stock and goodwill of the business, which is profitable, was
estimated at Pounds 180m-Pounds 190m.
ICI's fibres operations had a turnover of Pounds 585m last year, and
incurred a loss of Pounds 13m. Assets, stock and goodwill were valued at
about Pounds 360m.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Asda Property calls for Pounds 16.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA PROPERTY Holdings yesterday announced a Pounds 16.3m rights issue on a
2-for-5 basis to finance more property deals.
The Davidson family, which owns a controlling stake, will not take up its
rights entitlement which will be placed with institutions. Its stake will be
reduced from 56.5 per cent to 40.4 per cent.
The cash call involves the issue of 22.4m shares.
The group is gradually pulling out of the tenanted residential sector, which
accounts for just 10 per cent of its holdings. It has reinvested the money
in commercial property, which has absorbed Pounds 42m in new acquisitions
since September 1991.
The rights issue will reduce the company's gearing from 135 per cent
(treating convertible preference shares as debt) to 85 per cent. However, Mr
Tony Roscoe, managing director, said Asda was expecting to make about Pounds
30m of acquisitions by the end of the year which would push gearing back to
its pre-issue level.
'The board believes that the combination of a large number of unwilling
holders of property and the relatively small number of well-financed active
property companies specialising in the smaller end of the sector will mean
that further attractive opportunities to make selective acquisitions will be
available,' it said.
COMMENT
Despite the glut of rights issues from property companies that need to be
absorbed by institutions, Asda's cash call will probably be well received.
The company is generally well liked in the City, having made some shrewd
investments at the bottom of the property cycle. This issue will give it the
opportunity to make another Pounds 30m of acquisitions, which will be
focused on small, high yielding property where there is scope to improve
value by active management. The issue involves a relatively modest dilution
of Asda's assets of about 2 per cent. The Davidson family's decision not to
take up a rights issue may benefit the company in that it will increase the
liquidity of the shares. Where the company's other shareholders are
concerned, the issue is likely to be supported.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Policy Port joins market in placing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Policy Portfolio, a market-maker in second-hand endowment policies, is
joining the main market via a placing of 3.6m shares at 130p per share.
The company will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 10.4m at the placing
price. Exactly 2.5m new shares are being issued, raising Pounds 2.9m for the
company after expenses, with 1.1m shares being sold by existing
shareholders.
Following the placing, the Rubin family and associates will control 54 per
cent and have undertaken not to sell further shares until January 1 1995.
Pre-tax profits have increased from Pounds 245,000 in the year ended March
30 1991, to Pounds 817,000 in the year to end March 1993. At the placing
price, the shares are on a p/e ratio of 13.3.
The directors expect to recommend a dividend of 4.5p in the year to end
March 1994, putting the shares on a notional gross dividend yield of 5.8 per
cent.

FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices table, published on the London Stock
Exchange page, includes for the first time two new features approved by the
FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Steering Committee last April.
Total return figures, calculated at the close of each trading day, will now
be shown for the FT-SE 100, FT-SE Mid 250, FT-SE-Actuaries 350, FT-SE
SmallCap and FT-Actuaries All-Share indices.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, calculated in real time and displayed from
yesterday on many information services' screens, will be shown both in its
present form and without its investment trust company constituents.
A further small improvement in the presentation of the table has been
introduced, altering the order of the columns of calculated ratios so as to
place dividend yield before earnings yield.
The total return indices are designed to take account both of the price
performance of stocks and also of the income received from dividends, thus
providing investors with an accurate measure of each sector of the market
against which the performance of a portfolio can be compared.
The total return figures are calculated gross of tax and assume that
dividends and tax credits are reinvested immediately on the ex-dividend
date.
Investors who wish to calculate their total return net of tax can do so by
using the ex-dividend adjustment data already published daily in the FT-SE
Actuaries Share Indices table.
The total return indices have been calculated since December 31 1992, when
the value was set at 1000.00.
Back data from December 31 1987 for the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index and the
FT-SE 100 Index has been calculated by the London Stock Ex-change.
The method for calculating the total return indices was designed by a
working party set up by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of
Actuaries, chaired by Mr David Wilkie of R Watson &amp; Son.
Calculation of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index without investment trusts is expected
to show significant divergence from the performance of Mid 250 itself, based
on experience since the start of this year when the FT-SE SmallCap was first
calculated with and without investment trusts.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index currently contains 32 investment trust companies,
accounting for about 10 per cent of market capitalisation. Their exclusion
provides investors with an opportunity to measure the market in shares of
medium-sized companies without 'double counting' of shares held in the
investment trusts' portfolios.
Information on the method for calculating the total return indices is
available from The Manager, FT Statistics, One Southwark Bridge, London SE1
9HL. Fax: 071-873-3090. Tel: 071-873-4007.
Information regarding historical data for the new total return indices is

FT  02 JUL 93 / Fund managers move to in-house research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL fund managers are increasingly bypassing stockbrokers and
making direct contact with companies' senior management, according to the
Extel Survey of Investment Analysts.
More than one-third of the fund managers questioned said they were paying
more visits to companies, with most of the trips initiated by themselves
rather than the company or the broker.
The trend towards more direct contact with companies will add to the
competitive pressure on smaller stockbroking houses, already been hit by
institutions reducing the number of brokers they use.
Mr Geoffrey Osmint, consulting editor of the Extel survey, said fund
managers were doing more in-house research on their own ideas, and spending
less time talking to brokers. 'It used to be the case that no-one would
invest a penny in smaller companies without seeing the colour of the
management's eyes.' Increasing numbers of institutions were now applying the
same rigour to investing in larger companies.
Some of the 122 fund managers who responded had made several hundred company
visits. One institution recorded 600 visits. Overall, two-thirds of all
company visits were initiated by the managers or the company and not the
broker.
The fund managers said the quality of research had generally improved. They
would prefer to see fewer 'overnight notes' - sometimes produced in haste
after a big event. They needed more research on medium and smaller companies
and more 'thematic pieces'. Research covering the UK economy was 'least
useful'.
Last year's enthusiasm for pan-European markets had been replaced by a need
for more research on emerging markets.
SG Warburg Securities took the title of top stockbroking research company
for the third year in a row. James Capel reclaimed the number two slot from
NatWest Securities.
Credit Lyonnais Laing and Smith New Court were voted as having shown the
most improvement in quality.

FT  02 JUL 93 / BPB gains 52% as peace breaks out on prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, have
jumped 52 per cent following the end of a price war in the UK, France and
Germany.
Group pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 37.8m to Pounds 57.5m in the 12
months to March. Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.12bn.
The UK company has cut its final dividend from 7.25p to 4.8p, as forecast in
February when it raised Pounds 64m in a convertible bond issue. The total
payout is 11.25p.
Mr John Maxwell, chief executive, said BPB had decided to rebase its
dividend 'in view of the unprecedented economic uncertainties facing the
group's main European markets'.
Group pre-tax profits, which four years ago exceeded Pounds 200m, were
unlikely to return to previous levels even when construction markets
recovered, he said. Earnings per share, which rose from 6p to 8.1p, were
less than a third of the 32.2p made in 1988-89.
Mr Maxwell said western European plasterboard prices, which have risen by an
average of 29 per cent since February 1992, were still well below levels
prevailing at the end of the 1980s.
The increases follow the ending of a price war between the three largest
plasterboard producers: BPB, Knauf of Germany and Lafarge-Coppee of France.
This left BPB's share of the European market relatively unscathed at between
50 and 55 per cent. The company's share of the UK market, where it
previously had a near monopoly, has fallen from more than 90 per cent to
about 65 per cent.
Mr Maxwell said that Knauf and Lafarge-Coppee now appeared more interested
in improving profitability than pursuing market share and that further price
rises were likely.
BPB's target was to double its return on sales from 7 to 15 per cent and the
return on capital from 10 to 20 per cent.
Mr Maxwell warned of further job losses as the group sought to cut costs.
Some 700 jobs were axed last year resulting in a redundancy cost of Pounds
11m.
He expected European plasterboard sales to fall over the next 12 months
despite a 'still strong market in Germany' and a faltering recovery in the
UK.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Governments may act on Channel tunnel date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SUGGESTION that the UK and French governments appoint an independent
mediator to try to resolve the conflict between Eurotunnel and its
contractors over the opening date of the Channel tunnel has been discussed
by the two countries.
The UK transport department confirmed that the suggestion had been raised by
French officials, but said the UK government had no plans to appoint a
mediator. Any such appointment would be a matter for the Bank of England to
decide rather than government.
Contractors are seeking substantial additional payments to cover the cost of
building the tunnel which, including interest payments, has risen from
Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to approaching Pounds 10bn.
The contractors' claims are already being considered by an independent
disputes panel.
The initiative proposed by the French would seek to get Eurotunnel and its
contractors to agree an opening date rather than try to resolve the payments
issue.
Contractors have said that the project, which had been due to open in May
this year, will not open until next summer unless agreement can be reached.
Eurotunnel in Paris yesterday confirmed that it was in discussions with the
French government over the appointment of a separate mediator to try to
resolve the conflict over the opening date.
The company said the idea of a mediator - or a Monsieur de Bons Offices -
had come from the government. Eurotunnel said it supported the initiative.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Southern hits the front in dividend race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW leader emerged in the electricity industry's dividend race yesterday
as Southern Electric increased its payout to shareholders by 17.6 per cent,
the highest so far.
Southern's increase capped the 15.9 per cent set by Seeboard earlier this
week, and virtually ensures the Berkshire-based utility first place when the
six-week long electricity results season ends next Tuesday.
In common with other electricity company chairmen, Southern's Mr Geoffrey
Wilson, denied that a race existed. 'We are not looking over our shoulders
and trying to be top of the pops,' he said yesterday. The increase was
justified by Southern's strong financial performance, which included a rise
of 12.6 per cent pre-tax profits to Pounds 187m on sales of Pounds 1.8bn
(Pounds 1.75bn), and its success in bringing down costs.
Although the increase to 19.6p caused a fall in Southern's dividend cover -
earnings per share rose to 54.5p (47.8p) - Mr Wilson said that several other
electricity utilities paid larger dividends.
He also stressed that Southern's domestic customers were sharing in the
benefits. Tariffs had fallen by at least 2.5 per cent this year, with a
further rebate promised for next year.
The casualties of Southern's success are its own staff. After shedding 600
jobs this year, the company warned that a further 1,000 jobs would have to
go over the next three years, bringing annual savings of Pounds 20m. Mr
Wilson said the redundancies would be achieved through early retirement and
natural wastage.
Southern, one of the 12 regional electricity distributors privatised two
years ago, serves central southern England, and has been among the most
aggressive in cutting costs inherited from the days of state ownership. Mr
Wilson said yesterday it aimed to have the lowest costs of all the
utilities.
The biggest blot on yesterday's result was a Pounds 7.2m loss in the
company's electrical appliance retailing subsidiary, E&amp;S, set up jointly
with Eastern Electricity last year. But Mr Henry Casley, Southern's chief
executive, said the losses would be eliminated as the company became more
established. 'We are confident it was the right thing to do,' he said.
A big influence on the electricity sector's results is the price review
being conducted by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator.
Regional companies have been anxious to cut costs in anticipation of a
tightening of price controls.
However, there has been some anxiety in the markets that the double-digit
dividend increases announced by most electricity companies could encourage
the regulator to take a tougher line.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Biotech babies find haven in London: The birth of a stock
market sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENCOURAGED by a relaxation of stock exchange rules, the UK's emerging
biotechnology industry is flocking to the London market.
More than a decade after Genentech's float on Nasdaq launched one of
America's raciest stock market sectors, the UK is on the verge of providing
a home-grown source of capital for European scientists.
British Bio-technology, which reported full-year results on Tuesday, was the
first company to persuade the exchange to loosen listing requirements for
its Pounds 150m flotation last June.
By next week, when the diagnostics group Celsis starts trading, there will
be eight UK-quoted biotech companies and 11 more pencilled in for flotation,
mostly within the next year.
By US standards the sector is hardly off the starting blocks - there are 225
US bioscience companies with a combined market capitalisation of Dollars
35bn (Pounds 23.3bn). But at least the UK has joined the race.
The rush to float does not imply British science is suddenly ready to move
from the laboratory to the market place with a string of ideas based on
molecular biology and genetic research.
Rather, research-based companies have discovered that flotation is now an
option in the UK - even though many still look as though they belong in the
venture capital nursery.
Most of the newcomers are either still developing their product or have
negligible sales. Many will require additional capital after flotation and
will not record significant profits until the late 1990s. All are benefiting
from the stock exchange's change of attitude.
'For many years it has not really been possible to obtain a (UK) listing for
businesses of this type, where the value is in the technology and has not
shown through in the sales or the profits,' says Ms Janice Anderson,
director of Grosvenor Development Capital. 'So people have had to go to the
US.'
Notable among these forced exiles are Cantab Pharmaceutical and Ethical
Holdings. Encouraged to prevent this trickle becoming a flood, the London
Stock Exchange last year allowed British Bio-technology to float without the
usual three-year record of trading profits.
The window of opportunity in the UK coincides with the US bio-science sector
losing some of its sparkle. Genentech has disappointed with its TPA
'clotbuster' heart attack drug; and Synergen's sepsis treatment has not
lived up to earlier expectations, according to stockbrokers Barclays de
Zoete Wedd.
The tempering of enthusiasm in the US should strike a note of caution. Some
new biodrugs that have passed successfully through clinical trials have
worked no better than existing chemically synthesised versions.
Even if investors choose to ignore this, the prospectuses should leave
little doubt about the risks.
A typical health warning appears in the listing particulars of Celsis, which
wants to replace the laboratory agar plate with a kit for faster measurement
of microbial contamination.
Private investors, who can apply for shares until this morning, are told:
'There can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant
revenues or profitable operations.'
The warning may not be as prominent as it would be in the US - where the
face of the prospectus often boasts the warning like an 'X' rating on a
movie - but at least it is there.
To counter these sobering statements, the newcomers have to rely on the
feel-good factor. Celsis, for example, carries 'validations' from
organisations ranging from the Laboratory of the Government Chemist to such
heavyweight companies as Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. The newcomers are
also recruiting big names from the pharmaceutical industry.
Thus, the non-executive chairman of Celsis is Mr John Precious, finance
director of Wellcome; British Bio-technology picked up Mr Keith McCullagh as
chief executive when GD Searle, the US drug maker, was bought by Monsanto;
and Chiros, which will float next year, can boast the backing of Mr George
Rathman, the founder of Amgen, widely recognised as the most successful
biotechnology company yet formed.
The holy grail for all the new drug companies, needless to say, is the
discovery and development of a blockbuster - unofficially defined as having
annual sales of more than Dollars 500m. Few drugs are likely to match
Glaxo's Zantac ulcer treatment, which transformed the company's fortunes in
the 1980s. But according to BZW, the bioscience sector's 'hit rate' is not
as low as many believe. The 75 longest-established companies in the US have
already brought 12 new bioscience drugs to market.
The newcomers also point to the prices some large pharmaceutical companies
have paid to get aboard the bioscience research train.
A dramatic illustration of value came when Switzerland's Sandoz group paid
Dollars 392m for a 60 per cent stake in Systemix, a Californian company
researching gene therapy, only a year after it floated.
Such anecdotes do not, however, make valuation any easier. With no profits
forecasts, valuation remains a hugely imprecise science.
'You have to take a view on the science, the people and the prospects and
this is the only way to get to the valuation,' says one pharmaceutical
executive.
With valuation so inexact, some analysts believe venture capitalists should
still be supplying the development funds. Mr Chris Evans, a microbiologist
and founder of Celsis and Chiros, which will float next year, vehemently
disagrees. Raising venture capital is extremely time consuming, distracts
management and is no way to fund the development of a global market, he
says.
But more fundamentally, he says, the supply of equity finance is there.
'Institutional investors have seen people make outrageous capital gains from
loss-making companies,' he says. 'If the stock market is prepared to finance
development, why give a large slice of the company to venture capitalists?'
Relaxed listing rules will, inevitably, lead to riskier ventures being
quoted. But the stock exchange is trying to close the door on the worst
forms of abuse. Rules now in draft form propose that most of the capital
raised on flotation should be used to fund drug or product development.
Founding shareholders will also, usually, be prevented from selling shares
for two years after flotation. Both these rules should prevent them walking
away with the cash before the venture proves itself.
It is early days. But the often maligned stock exchange has been widely
applauded for relaxing rules that could sustain a new, albeit risky stock
market sector.

FT  02 JUL 93 / College lecturers plan action over changes in contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLLEGE LECTURERS are likely to plan strike action after the introduction of
tough contracts yesterday cutting their holidays in half and adding an hour
to their working day.
The change follows the transfer in April of further education colleges from
local authorities to national government control. The contracts alter terms
and conditions in place for two decades.
Since the switch of control, the College Employers' Forum, which represents
360 further education colleges in England and Wales with 55,000 lecturers,
has sought to establish itself as a tough public sector employer.
Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the CEF, said the contracts were in line
with requests by Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, for
employers to 'rapidly introduce' changes in lecturers' conditions.
The contracts, initially only for starters and those lecturers who are
moving colleges or have been promoted, make several changes to the old
arrangement:
The 30-hour working week is abolished and increased to 37 hours (36 in
London).
Holiday entitlement is cut to seven weeks per year, plus statutory holidays,
from 14.
Redundancy notice periods are cut from 12 months to between one and three
months.
Lecturers must gain their principal's permission before taking on any
outside work. Confidentiality agreements must now be signed to prevent
lecturers divulging information about their old departments if they move to
a new college. Lecturers will be barred from moving to companies which
compete with their old college.
Employers say the alterations are to accommodate the changing role of
further education which involves offering part-time courses throughout the
year.
The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education has
refused to negotiate with the CEF if the contracts are on the agenda. Its
conference starts tomorrow and is likely to prepare for strike action.

FT  02 JUL 93 / City leaders back checkpoint cordon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING and business leaders yesterday backed the decision to ring the City
of London with police checkpoints from midnight tonight in an attempt to
combat terrorism.
They had warned that without greater security London's reputation as an
international financial centre could be damaged. 'We welcome these
proposals,' the Stock Exchange said. 'We have been wanting improved security
for some time.'
Under the scheme, unveiled by the City of London police yesterday as the
first stage in a package of measures, 18 access roads leading into the
Square Mile - the financial centre which surrounds the Bank of England -
will be closed to traffic.
Twenty-four hour police check points, with powers to stop and search
suspicious vehicles, will be mounted on seven other entry points. An eighth,
on the edge of London Wall and Moorgate, will be limited to buses and taxis.
The Treasury yesterday denied that the cordon would undermine London's
reputation as a financial centre. 'This can only be good for London. The
fact is that terrorism is an international threat,' it said.
Mr Owen Kelly, the City of London police commissioner, said the scheme had
government backing and shrugged off charges that the measures might be
playing into the hands of the IRA. 'If we allow the terrorists to plant
another large bomb just think what a propaganda coup that would be,' he
said.
In addition to the checkpoints, other security measures will include the
deployment of powerful video cameras, the use of new electronic sniffers and
increased numbers of sniffer dogs, the experimental use of X-ray systems to
examine the contents of vans and the deployment of more police across the
city.
Mr Kelly said the measures were planned for a 12 month period, pending a
public inquiry into a tougher set of security schemes currently being drawn
up by the Corporation of London.

FT  02 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Securities settlement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The report by the Bank of England's task force on securities settlement
comes as a welcome relief after the Taurus fiasco. The collapse of Taurus
after more than a decade of work left London in urgent need of a reliable,
inexpensive and quick settlement system that would narrow its embarrassing
gap with other centres. The task force does not aim to please everybody, but
it does hold out the prospect of a reasonably timely move to five-day
rolling settlement. Its decision to drop the idea of a central register may
help to keep the banks on side. Their role will be crucial to accompanying
payments arrangements.
Yet moving from theory to practice remains a daunting task. On the one hand
are practical problems over and above the need to develop reliable
technology: the initial move to a shorter settlement period while still
using a paper-based system may make life harder for private client brokers.
On the other, are more political questions - notably the ultimate ownership
of Crest, the settlement service which the report envisages.
Since it will effectively have a monopoly position, it would be undesirable
for Crest to be in the hands of a single commercial owner. A consortium
approach will be more desirable but one which also requires strong
leadership. After Taurus, the Stock Exchange lacks any credibility. That
leaves the Bank, which may yet have to bang heads together at the
development stage. It may need to remain actively involved once Crest is up
and running as well.

FT  02 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: BPB Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having played fast and loose with previous predictions when tapping
shareholders for more money, it is hard to know how seriously to take BPB's
present sunny prognosis for the plasterboard industry. A 52 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits certainly lends weight to the benign outlook. The 33 per
cent dividend cut, though, provides a nasty reminder of how faulty the
company's judgment has proved in the past.
Peace does appear to have broken out between the big three plasterboard
manufacturers after they came close to bleeding each other dry. Prices have
climbed 29 per cent in the past 18 months. BPB's profits have benefited
mightily from the trend, especially when combined with its cost reduction
programme. These factors should push BPB's profits sharply higher this year
too as UK demand twitches upwards. A forward multiple of about 20 certainly
anticipates as much.
Yet BPB's recovery is built on fragile foundations. The cut dividend is
still scarcely covered and any growth will be painfully slow. Fortunately,
investors may now be more concerned with earnings prospects than yield.
Moreover, plasterboard overcapacity in the UK may undermine price stability
as manufacturers defend market share. The greatest uncertainty, though, is
about how far the French market will fall. Both Knauf and Lafarge appear far
gloomier than BPB on this score. If they prove right, things may grow
particularly messy for BPB. France is its biggest market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Electric's attempt to win this year's dividend race by a short head
is of little fundamental significance. Yet it does re-focus attention on the
financial strength of the regional electricity companies. The review of
transmission prices over the next year will cut into the RECs margins.
Average dividend cover is, however, around three times and strong cash flow
continues to cut gearing. Since electricity prices will be falling from
1995, political pressure on the sector may be slight. None of the range of
probable outcomes of the transmission review are likely to cut into
Southern's ability to pay 8 per cent real dividend increases through the
rest of the decade.
That is in contrast to the water sector where gearing is rising sharply.
Shares in the water sector have fallen, and there are fears that once the
transmission review is under way, electricity may suffer too. Yet the
sector's high yield relative to the market already discounts much of the
risk. On a prospective basis, electricity shares yield almost as much as
water, which is surely too cautious given their markedly different
prospects.
Southern and the other RECs which are getting on with cost cutting look
sensible, since Offer is unlikely to be hoodwinked about the costs of
companies which are merely lazy. Yet Southern's zeal in setting up new pay
bargaining arrangements and 2.9 per cent award to staff sits oddly besides
the directors' higher pay awards and continuing three-year rolling
contracts. The company seems to be learning 1980s-style management
techniques in the 1990s.

FT  02 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Schlesinger marks time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the time it took to get round to it, yesterday's half point cut in the
Bundesbank's discount rate was less dramatic than it seems - which is
perhaps why, after a moment of initial excitement, exchange and bond markets
shrugged it off. It is two months since the Bundesbank last cut official
rates: the looming summer holiday period means it could be almost two before
it cuts again. That is a long time to wait for only half a point. In past
recessions, the bank has cut by a point at a time. Yesterday's decision
simply means that the policy of drip-feeding tiny cuts in the repurchase
rate will continue.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger of the Bundesbank presumably feels comfortable with
this because he believes the German recession has reached its nadir. Latest
industrial production and business confidence data at least suggest that
economic output may have stopped falling. But it is hard to see where
recovery will come from and the Bundesbank's continuing caution may place
worrying pressures on France. The bank's behaviour indicates a determination
to ensure that the German currency does not lose its anchor role within the
ERM. That, in turn, means France will be lucky to get away with interest
rates lower than those of Germany over anything other than the short term.
The Bundesbank may have given it some leeway to do so by a small amount if
only because the markets will anticipate another German rate cut at the end
of August. Whether that will be enough to alleviate the strain on the French
economy is moot.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Trade accord vital for recovery, says OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FAILURE to reach agreement on trade liberalisation would threaten prospects
for economic recovery in the industrialised world, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development warned yesterday.
Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of the OECD's economic department, said
pressures on governments to increase protectionism represented the biggest
'downside risk' to immediate prospects for world recovery and longer term
economic performance.
Presenting the OECD's half-yearly economic outlook, Mr Shigehara said
successful completion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade would provide a much-needed boost to confidence at a time
when the world's industrial economies were either in recession or
experiencing only fitful recoveries.
Agreement would 'not only encourage trade and activity, but boost
confidence, as it would define the clear direction for policy in the trade
area which at the moment is lacking', he said.
The latest shaving of German interest rates did not alter the OECD's view
that recovery in continental Europe will be delayed until well into next
year unless the German authorities significantly ease monetary conditions.
It believes growth in the 24 member states of the organisation will amount
to only 1.2 per cent this year with high European interest rates and
continued debt reduction hindering a more dynamic recovery.
Mr Shigehara said 1993 would be 'the third successive year in which growth
in the OECD area as a whole, at just over 1 per cent, will be
unsatisfactory'.
The UK is one of the few member economies forecast to show buoyant growth
this year, but the OECD is not yet convinced that the government's medium
term strategy for controlling inflation is sufficient to prevent a return to
rapid price rises in the long term.
Mr Stephen Potter, director for country studies and economic prospects, said
the UK government appeared to be placing a greater emphasis on monitoring
inflation than it had done in previous upswings, but on the UK's past record
it was necessary to be sceptical.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Bundesbank eases rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BY EASING interest rates, the Bundesbank has made the task of defending
German economic policy at next week's summit meeting of the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries in Tokyo just a bit easier. But it will not be
that easy. German monetary policy remains restrictive, while its effects on
those linked to the D-Mark remain unpleasant. So long as this continues, US
and French pressure on the Bundesbank is certain.
Yesterday's reduction in the discount rate, to 6.75 per cent, is the fifth
since last September, the cumulative reduction now being 2 percentage
points. But the discount rate is only a floor, just as the Lombard rate,
lowered a quarter of a percentage point yesterday, to 8.25 per cent, is the
ceiling. What matters for the market is the repurchase, or 'repo', rate,
which stood at 7.3 per cent yesterday, a decline of 2.4 percentage points
from levels reached in the summer of 1992. The decline in short-term
interest rates does appear substantial. But appearances are deceiving.
In the first place, Germany is in deep recession. In the year to February
1993, German industrial production fell 12 per cent, though from a high
level. Meanwhile, gross national product declined 2.9 per cent in the year
to the first quarter of 1993. In its latest Economic Outlook, the OECD
forecasts a fall of 1.9 per cent in German gross domestic product between
1992 and 1993.
Restrictive policy
Admittedly, the OECD is modestly optimistic about next year, expecting gross
domestic product to increase by 2 per cent in the first half of 1994 and 2.8
per cent in the second half. Similarly, Bundesbank president Helmut
Schlesinger stated yesterday that the council believes the economy is at its
low point. But both institutions have been too optimistic about the strength
of the German economy in the recent past. Only last December the OECD
thought the German economy would grow 1.2 per cent between 1992 and 1993.
In the second place, the Bundesbank's monetary policy remains restrictive.
The best single measure of the monetary stance is the relation between
short-term and long-term interest rates. The stance is restrictive when
short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates and easy when they
are lower.
Even after these latest cuts, the Bundesbank's short-term rates of interest
remain well above long-term rates, now a little above 6 1/2 per cent. Not
only is the monetary stance restrictive, but it has eased rather little,
mainly because long-term rates of interest have, as intended, declined with
short-term rates. Last September, three-month rates of interest were 2
percentage points above long-term ones. After yesterday's cuts, they were
still three-quarters of a percentage point higher.
Slow lane
The Bundesbank remains cautious, as Mr Schlesinger remarked. Yesterday's
cuts will not do much to transform the miserable short-term prospects that
are now worrying the French government. The OECD expects German short-term
interest rates to be 4 1/2 per cent by the second half of next year. Even
this may be neither low enough nor soon enough. Not only would the
Bundesbank's policy still be less expansionary than the Federal Reserve's of
today, but the more slowly it eases, the further it may have to go.
The Bundesbank has at least given its dependants some encouragement. As and
when monetary growth falls well within its target range, further interest
rate reductions are to be expected. This thought must encourage beleaguered
French politicians to hang on. After last week's rebuff by the German
finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, to its request for joint discussion of
interest rate policy, the French government must have prayed for just such
encouragement. But it has not received that much. Meanwhile, Mr Waigel must
have disappointed the French yesterday by admitting that Germany would not
be ready for economic and monetary union in 1997 or in 1999, if public
deficits were not first reduced.
What is often flatteringly described as the European Community's 'fast lane'
is set to remain among the slowest places in the world economy. So long as
this continues, the EC will be subject to fierce criticism not only by its
partners but also, more worryingly, by its citizens.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Personal View: New rhythm for the tax and spend rhyme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DILNOT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rhythm of life is changing. Chancellors of the exchequer will no longer
hold Mr Gladstone's box aloft on a sunny afternoon in the spring, but in the
dingy gloom of late November. The second Budget of 1993 seems set for
November 30, St Andrew's Day. The change was announced in the 1992
pre-election Budget of the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, with the
claim that the new timetable would 'enable all concerned - parliament, the
public, and government - to consider spending proposals alongside the tax
proposals needed to pay for them'.
In future, details of both public spending and tax plans will be announced
together on Budget day in late November. This means delaying the
announcement of spending decisions by two or three weeks compared to the old
timetable, and accelerating the announcement of tax changes by three or four
months. The government has made a number of claims about the benefits that
will flow from this change in timetable: that it will improve
decision-taking, improve presentation, stimulate more informed debate and
provide benefits for taxpayers.
On the quality of decision-taking, the white paper announcing the change
comments that 'ministers will be better able to judge the merits of public
spending proposals in the light of the overall fiscal position and the
implications for taxation. And the potential trade-offs between tax reliefs
and public spending can be more carefully considered'.
All this would be true if decisions were to be made together. But all that
is really happening is that they are to be presented together. The overall
levels of public spending for the next three years were decided in a cabinet
meeting in mid-June, and these are now fixed and 'are not to be reopened in
subsequent cabinet discussion'. All that remains to be decided on spending
is the allocation between departments. But because of the potential burden
on officials and ministers caused by bringing together the tax and spending
process, the spending process is to be accelerated so that the relevant
cabinet committee can carry out the bulk of its work in September.
As the all-party Treasury and Civil Service Committee said in its report on
the new time-table, if the only way of coping is to separate the
decision-making processes (either in time or by allowing different personnel
to concentrate on the expenditure and revenue side respectively), much of
the claimed advantages of better decision-taking within government will
prove illusory. Nor does it seem likely that 'potential trade-offs' between
taxation and expenditure will be any better considered than previously if
the expenditure decisions have largely been taken two months before the
unified Budget.
Given the recent suggestion by the new chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, that
he will decide three or four weeks before the Budget whether to raise taxes,
the fact that the level of spending will be set five months before the
Budget and its allocation at least two months before the Budget, makes
suggestions of truly joint decision-making seem fanciful.
In hoping for better presentation and more informed debate, the government
is on firmer ground. By announcing tax and spending plans together, it
should be possible to increase awareness of the costs of higher spending in
terms of higher taxes, and of lower taxes in terms of lower spending. The
main complaint to make here is that, while debate may be more informed,
there are no proposals to create any new opportunities for parliament to
engage in decision-making as opposed to debate. And the chance offered by an
earlier Budget to extend the period of debate on the finance bill has been
missed.
The final stated advantage, that there will be benefits to taxpayers, has
some weight. The announcement of changes to income tax four months before
they are to be implemented will mean that pay-as-you-earn will work smoothly
and that there will be scope in some cases for taxpayers to take advantage
of pre-announced changes to minimise their tax payments. The announcement of
indirect tax changes in the run-up to Christmas may not seem such a benefit.
To describe the new unified Budget statement as much more than a shift in
the timing of the announcement of tax and spending decisions is to
exaggerate. This bringing together of announcements has some advantages and
should lead to a better-informed debate. But we are not going to see tax and
spending decisions made together, nor is the change a way of extending
consultation. Much more could and should have been done.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Leading Article: The reshaping of British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
APART FROM the issue of British Gas's domestic gas monopoly, which the FT
has argued (June 29) should be abolished, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission must make two other important recommendations: on a rate of
return for the company's pipeline business and whether British Gas's
structure is itself against the public interest.
Structure is a central question. Some think that, even if its formal
monopoly is breached, British Gas will, in its existing form, retain an
unacceptably dominant position. Ofgas, the gas regulator, has argued for it
to be split into a number of elements, including a gas pipeline company and
one, or possibly a series, of regionally defined gas trading companies that
would sell gas to homes and businesses. The advantage would be to open up
further the market in gas supply, while placing the natural monopoly of the
pipeline under impartial ownership.
British Gas's position is that this would multiply costs without discernible
benefit to customers. It wants to retain the monopoly, but has offered to
split itself into five units for accounting purposes, with a view to
reassuring the regulator that it is dealing fairly with competitors and
customers. The company also argues that it needs to be large and integrated
to compete on the world stage.
In theory, the break-up argument has clear attractions and would be the
right way forward were British Gas now being brought in to the private
sector. But there is no denying that today it would also bring great
uncertainties, not least for shareholders, and potential rewards which
no-one, including Ofgas, has yet convincingly quantified. It feels like a
step too far.
Serious defects
Equally, however, British Gas's position has serious defects. Accounting
separation within a centralist culture like British Gas's might have limited
impact, in practice. If British Gas also wins the argument for keeping its
monopolies, it would rule out the benefits that competition can bring:
innovation, better service and a tougher pricing environment. On the other
hand, if the domestic monopoly is ended, an integrated British Gas would be
so powerful that it would be able to frustrate new competitors.
One compromise, already adopted in the industrial gas business, would be to
require British Gas to surrender fixed percentages of its market over time,
but that is a crude device which attracts regulated entrants rather than
true competitors. Better at this stage to establish British Gas's pipeline
and trading arms as wholly separate subsidiaries, so creating at least some
of the transparency needed for a genuine market. In these circumstances, the
threat of full-scale dismemberment could be held in reserve should British
Gas abuse its position.
Contrary proposals
Whichever route is chosen, the MMC will have to determine an appropriate
level of profitability for the pipeline monopoly. This issue has been
enlivened by provocative and contrary proposals from Ofgas and British Gas.
The right rate of return figure probably lies in the middle of these
pitches, between 5 and 8 per cent in real terms, offering a premium on top
of index-linked gilts without excessive reward for a low-risk business.
Although new assets should be valued on a replacement cost basis, the
company's assets at privatisation cannot be since they were sold at a
substantial discount to book value.
These are complex but important issues. British Gas's argument is, at core,
that its customers are happy, its would-be competitors unimpressive and that
it should be left to emerge as a great, international, integrated gas
company, with interests from the oilfield to the showroom.
It is an argument which might well appeal to the present government, but it
ignores the fact that the combination of privatisation and competition has
yielded rich benefits across the utilities in terms of efficiency,
innovation, prices, service and transparency, and that the same process can
be taken much further in the gas industry. Nor is there any evidence that
size is a qualification for effective international expansion. The MMC and
the government will be right to urge careful change, but badly misguided if
they resist change at all.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Cuts may not be deep enough: Quentin Peel says the German
government's assault on the welfare state has provoked bitter opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to know who should be believed.
Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's increasingly weary finance minister, has persuaded
his partners in government to accept a painful package of cuts, mainly in
unemployment and social benefits. It is intended to save DM25bn (Pounds
9.8bn) next year, and up to DM35bn by 1996, and thus keep the federal budget
deficit to manageable proportions. The aim is to bring the deficit down from
about DM70bn today, or 15 per cent of the federal budget, to just 10 per
cent by 1996.
Unemployment pay will come down three percentage points (from 68 to 65 per
cent of previous earnings for a married man), and related social benefits
will be cut by the same amount. A time limit will be fixed for
earnings-related benefits, and a drive launched to stem social insurance
fraud is intended to save up to DM6bn.
No less than DM14bn of the savings in 1994 come from direct cuts in welfare
payments for the needy, at a time of severe recession and rising
unemployment.
Little wonder that Ms Ursula Engelen-Kefer, the deputy chairman of the
German trade union federation, says it is the most devastating assault on
the welfare state since the early 1930s - when the harsh fate of the
unemployed was a key factor behind the rise of Hitler.
Yet Mr Helmut Geiger, president of the savings banks' association, fears it
is too little, too late, to cure the federal government's fiscal laxity. It
still leaves a 'horror scenario' of an intractable structural budget deficit
from 1995, when the full burden of borrowing to finance unification will
fall on the central exchequer, he says. And he doubts whether anything like
DM6bn can be saved in combating fraud.
Only the German Bundesbank was yesterday prepared to give Mr Waigel the
benefit of the doubt. The bank indicated its modest approval by shaving its
discount rate by 0.5 points.
It was scarcely a vote of great confidence. And when the finance minister
travels to Tokyo next week with Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the Group of
Seven summit of leading industrial nations, he will almost certainly meet
more of the Geiger-style sceptics among his international colleagues.
If the savings plan has pleased almost no one, why is Mr Waigel forcing it
through?
Coming six months before the start of a mammoth election year in Germany,
when 19 separate polls at national, state and local level will decide the
country's political complexion for the next four years, his move looks
almost foolhardy.
Yet few in government doubt that the finance minister had any choice but to
tackle the sacred cow of social spending. Like the rest of the
industrialised world, Germany faces a demographic shift, which means that
ever fewer workers are contributing to the soaring social costs of ever
increasing numbers of the old, the young, and the needy. Unlike the rest of
the industrialised world, Germany's problem has been massively compounded by
unification.
The three pillars of the German welfare state - health insurance, pensions,
and unemployment insurance - have always been generous in their benefits.
Unlike the British system, where social security is closely controlled by
the Treasury, German insurance funds are self-financing and
contribution-driven. It is only when payments outstrip contributions that
the state steps in to subsidise. Unemployed workers have until now received
two-thirds of their former salary for 32 months, and then a few percentage
points less, indefinitely.
It has always been easier to allow insurance contributions to rise as social
spending has soared, rather than switch a part of the burden to the general
taxpayer. The result has been a rising burden not only on individual
workers, but on their employers, who share the insurance contributions for
all three funds on a 50:50 basis.
The proportion of gross income which the worker and the employer must
jointly pay in insurance has risen from just 26.5 per cent, in 1970, to a
forecast of at least 39.2 per cent next year.
According to the German Federation of Industry's economy institute in
Cologne, the whole gamut of extra payments, such as holiday pay, per
employee amounts to 86.5 per cent of basic wages, giving western Germany the
highest wage costs per hour of any industrialised state: almost DM42 per
hour in 1992, compared with DM39.24 in Switzerland, DM30 in Japan, and less
than DM25 in the US.
German employers have complained bitterly about their social burden for more
than a decade, and Mr Kohl's conservative coalition has been cautiously
attempting to curb it. The advent of east Germany, with huge social needs,
and very modest contributions, has turned a long-term structural problem
into a short-term crisis.
Social spending, which increased from DM180bn in 1970 to DM744bn in 1990,
shot up to more than DM1,000bn by 1992, because of the east. And the burden
has been borne by western German workers, employers, and the federal budget.
The government has already started to cut social spending with health
reforms agreed last year. In the health sector, doctors' prescription
budgets have been capped, and the number of drugs paid for by health
insurance limited. The changes have shown significant savings but these have
been at the expense of German drug manufacturers and pharmacists.
As for the pension funds, they cannot be touched, even by Mr Waigel. A
proposal in May mooted by the finance ministry for a reduction in benefits
was met with an instant denial by Chancellor Kohl. Yet the funds are
transferring a net DM14bn from west to east, according to Mr Reinhold
Schulze, chairman of the federal fund for white-collar workers. East Germany
had inadequate funds to finance western-level pensions for its old people.
The result is a forecast increase from 17.5 to 19.3 per cent of individual
wages in pensions contributions next year.
The only significant area of social spending left for Mr Waigel to squeeze
was the unemployment funds, which finance not just dole payments, but also
retraining schemes, job creation measures, and even language training for
returning German emigres.
To finance labour market transfers to the east, running at some DM35bn a
year, the federal labour office, which administers the system, had to
increase contributions from 4.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent in March 1991. Even
then, the government is having to pay a subsidy of DM18bn towards its DM90bn
budget this year, and a probable DM20bn out of DM100bn next year.
Yet Mr Waigel's savings package is tackling only the short-term problem. His
colleague, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economy minister, is equally worried about
the inexorable increase in all forms of social spending in the long term,
with a shrinking workforce to pay the contributions. His answer is to
propose a strict ceiling on contributions, and simultaneously to launch a
campaign for longer working hours, shorter holidays, and longer working
lives: against all current trends.
'We will have severe problems around the end of the century,' according to a
senior official in the ministry. 'If we can reverse the trend, and have
longer working lives, very small changes can have a huge effect. One more
month's work means one more month's contributions, and one month less of
pension payments.'
If Mr Waigel's savings package has caused offence to the unions and the SPD,
Mr Rexrodt's proposals seem to be just as sensational. The slightest hint of
returning to a 40-hour week is anathema to the trade union leadership.
Yet there is one area of reform where the opposition and unions are prepared
to co-operate: to take on more of the social burdens on the taxpayer, and
relieve the burden of direct insurance payments.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, the new leader of IG Metall, the engineering workers'
union, sees such a change as justified by the new demands in the east, which
should not be borne by western workers alone. Some 2m civil servants, and
the same number of self-employed, make no contribution.
If Mr Waigel were able to offer some sort of trade-off between capping
social benefits, and a fairer distribution of the costs, he might still be
able to bring the opposition and unions to a negotiating table. But for the
time being, he looks condemned to force through his savings package in
splendid isolation.

Asked for a job by the smallest man he'd ever seen, the lumberjack boss
challenged him to prove his worth by chopping down the biggest tree in
sight. Whereupon he grabbed an axe and, with a
blur of movement, felled the tree within seconds.
Flabbergasted, the boss asked where he had learned such amazing skill.
'Working in the Sahara,' the axeman answered.
'But there aren't any trees there,' spluttered the boss.
'Of course there aren't, now,' said the midget.

'Let's hope it isn't given the bird,' said Observer just four weeks ago
about the musical, Leonardo, then opening in London and financed by the

<TEXT>
Mind you, the local boy's promotion isn't lifting hearts in all the
businesses in George's neighbourhood. His implacable stance on inflation, in
particular, is the focus of gloom in several of the cluster of shops just
down the street from his home.
Take Bartley's Fruiterers, whose owner Arnold Levinrad says: 'Low inflation
by itself is not good enough, there also has to be growth.' And his view
that both Bank and Treasury haven't done enough to oil economic wheels is
shared, for instance, by chemist Dhiru Patel and Robert Smith who runs the
local showroom of the S G Smith Motor Group.
Moreover, they have local evidence to back up their argument. Not only are
the fruiterer's takings down 30 per cent from two years ago, but of the 15
shops in the cluster, three stand empty.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Observer: Smokey's send-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Though the sun was shining and the champagne flowing, the first reception
for the Bank of England's new governor was but sparsely attended. Besides
Eddie George - otherwise known as Smokey Joe - the octet present included
Mrs George, Bernie Kemp, who organised the bash and bestowed the nickname,
and top professional toastmaster Ivor Spencer, replete with presentational
magnum.
Possibly the thin crowd reflected the impromptu nature as well as the site
of the occasion: outside North Dulwich railway station. Invitations had been
strictly by word of mouth, in whispers.
The champagne launching was newsagent Bernie's tribute to the governor not
only for rising to the office from humble beginnings, but also for buying
the FT from him for years.
They are almost neighbours. For the past quarter century Smokey Joe - so
called because he always has a gasper on the go when he picks up his paper -
has lived in a semi only a few roads away from the station, above which
Bernie has lived for his whole life.
Like his customer, he is moving up in the world. He has diversified into
double-glazing, painting and decorating, plumbing, carpentry and
window-cleaning for offices, all without having to advertise.
Along the way he has served other distinguished customers, in Lady Thatcher
and the ex-premier of Thailand, and he is currently in the running to help
to build a Greek airport . . .
But there the chat ends. He must rush off to make sure that what could well
be the last time Smokey Joe goes to work by train - the 7.32 to London
Bridge - isn't the first time he misses it.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Observer: Bus-lord's holiday
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With his Pounds 2bn-plus agreed bid for Quantum Chemical now in the bag,
whither Lord Hanson? A clue lies in his other bag and baggage, including 13
suitcases, seen in a dark green Mercedes estate with silver terrier mascot
and personal number plate, disembarking at Nice from the night train from
Calais.
The car then sped off in the tracks of the 'Gatsby set' of novelist Scott
Fitzgerald - the very rich, he said, 'are different from you and me' - to
the Hotel du Cap d'Antibes. The good lord himself will be following by
private jet, of course.
With his family and sometimes friends too, he has gone summer after summer
to the ludicrously expensive establishment looking over the bay of Cannes.
He is also a regular patron of the hotel's Eden Roc beach club, haven of
film stars and old family money as well as international tycoons.
This time the scheduled stay is unusually if not extraordinarily long. He is
booked in for three weeks - his doctors have ordered him to take things
easy, though more to convalesce after a disc operation than because they
think he needs a rest from the strains of business.
That is no doubt just as well. His suite at the hotel is being transformed
into an office-in-exile, equipped with all manner of high-tech widgetry to
keep him in constant touch with the affairs of his conglomerate.
Nevertheless, his aides are offering even odds on two eventualities. One is
that he won't be able to stick out for a whole three weeks away from
headquarters. The other is that, if he does, he'll need another holiday to
recover from it.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: Role for small shareholder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J A CUNLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As this company's logo featured prominently at the head of Tony
Jackson's article, 'Voice of the little guy: the small shareholder's right
to speak' (June 21), may I comment on our attitude towards small
shareholders, which is certainly not one of antipathy.
In recent years, our AGM has seen many questions, and some disruption, by
anti-apartheid activists, but we would not share the description of them, or
activists generally, as cranks. Far from attempting, or wanting, to stifle
debate, successive chairmen have believed that the company has had good
counter-arguments to present. Our AGM is not tightly controlled - although
we hope it is run in a businesslike manner - and shareholders are free to
ask any question relating to the company's affairs, without notice.
Compared with their total number, few private shareholders attend the AGM,
many no doubt for reasons of time and distance; others perhaps are not
attracted by its formality. Therefore, since 1977, Shell Transport has each
year arranged informal meetings for shareholders around the country which
provide the opportunity to meet and question senior executives. They have
proved very popular.
Also, each shareholder receives an annual chairman's bulletin and, whenever
we can, we invite shareholders to visit Shell installations. For example, in
May a Shell tanker berthed for several days in the Mersey after taking part
in the Royal Review to commemorate the Battle of the Atlantic. In four days,
more than 7,000 shareholders and their guests visited the vessel.
We believe that the private individual shareholder has an important role to
play in corporate governance. We try to bring the shareholder and the
company closer together.
J A Cunliffe,
secretary,
Shell Transport and Trading Company.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: A superior record on economic forecasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof TIM CONGDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his story, 'Treasury 'wise man' calls for skills cash' (June 28),
about the London Business School's latest Economic Outlook, Peter Marsh
makes some quotes from the publication. Broad money is said not to have been
'a reliable indicator', while 'advocacy of this indicator' has been
'accompanied by exaggerated claims for Tim Congdon's forecasting prowess
that does not bear close examination'.
I first began to provide detailed macroeconomic forecasts in 1986 when I
worked at Shearson Lehman. The subsequent record of quarterly forecasts has
been continuous, apart from a period in late 1988 and early 1989, just
before I founded Lombard Street Research. Over this seven-year period I do
not believe that the London Business School (or, indeed, the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research) has once produced an end-year
forecast for the subsequent year that has been as accurate as mine. (Of
course, I did not have an end-year forecast in late 1988 for 1989, but I
believe that my mid-year forecast was in this case better than the LBS's
end-year forecast.) I may be incorrect in making these claims, but I find it
interesting that - since making them - no LBS or National Institute
economist has taken up the challenge of comparing my forecasts with theirs.
Happily, all the forecasts are matters of public record.
There is no doubt that, on average, my forecasting record has over the last
seven years been superior to the LBS's and the National Institute's. I have
tried to explain - to economists at both institutions and anyone else who
may be interested - why I think they have been better. It has nothing to do
with 'forecasting prowess', whatever that is or may be, but with the
application of certain basic ideas in economic theory. In particular, every
forecast that I have prepared has paid careful attention to various economic
agents' demands to hold money balances, and the relationship between these
demands and the actual quantity of money balances in existence. The need to
equilibrate the demand for money with the money supply is an essential
aspect of any meaningful attempt to understand the forces determining
national income.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Punishment meted out / Examining London's new
carrot-and-stick approach to parking control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Mr Nick Lester about to become the most hated man in London? He stands a
chance: for as the capital's first parking director, he is about to launch
the biggest crackdown on illegal parking the capital's motorists have yet
known.
The good news for drivers is that, under the Road Traffic Act 1991, illegal
parking is to be decriminalised. This means responsibility for enforcing
parking restrictions on all but the main strategic routes will be
transferred from the police to local authorities, with fines being treated
as civil debts rather than an issue for the magistrates' courts.
The bad news is that motorists will stand much less chance of parking
illegally without being caught; and that those who do break the rules,
particularly persistent offenders, will suffer through swingeing penalties
and targeted use of wheel-clamping and vehicle removal.
Under the existing system, parking restrictions in the capital are enforced
by about 1,500 traffic wardens employed by the Metropolitan Police. In
addition, some local authorities employ wardens to patrol parking meters and
residents' parking spaces.
The system, however, is hopelessly ineffective. On average, the London
motorist can expect to pick up only one parking ticket for every 50
infringements. With odds as favourable as that, illegal parking has become
an epidemic, so worsening congestion and increasing journey times.
The main reason why so few offenders are caught is that the Pounds 60m
collected in penalty income each year goes not to the Metropolitan Police,
but to the exchequer. As a result, the police have little incentive to
invest scant resources in employing more wardens or to increase the
productivity of the existing warden force.
Under the new system, local authorities will be able to keep the proceeds of
parking fines instead of passing them on to central government, so they will
be seeking to maximise revenues. By the end of next year, the London
boroughs expect to employ an extra 1,000 wardens - or parking attendants, as
they are to be known.
The increase in numbers will be reinforced by an increase in productivity
because local authorities will aim to make a profit from this new source of
revenue. If they succeed, they will be able to use the surpluses to provide
more off-street parking or to improve roads or public transport.
According to Mr Lester, director of the Parking Committee for London which
is funded jointly by the capital's 33 local authorities, the aim of the new
regime is to adopt a carrot-and-stick approach to parking enforcement. 'On
the one hand, we are introducing rules that make sense and are easily
explained, but on the other, we are getting away from the 'lucky dip'
approach as far as parking illegally is concerned.'
Briefly, the system will work like this:
Responsibility for parking enforcement will be transferred area by area to
local authorities over the next year. Pilot schemes will start in the
Clapham Junction and Putney areas of Wandsworth on Monday, followed by the
first three fully fledged schemes covering the boroughs of Hammersmith and
Fulham, Lewisham and Bromley in October.
When the transfer is complete, the 1,500-strong Metropolitan Police warden
force will concentrate solely on the capital's main strategic roads, now
being redesignated 'red routes', with much stricter curbs on parking. All
other roads will be patrolled by local authority forces - separately
managed, but following the same rules.
The Pounds 40 parking penalty on red routes will be unchanged, but on other
roads, the Pounds 30 penalty will rise to Pounds 60 in central London and
Pounds 40 in the rest of inner London. In outer London, it will stay the
same.
Mr Lester says the carrot for motorists will be much better signposting for
motorists explaining when and where they can park legally, together with a
review of existing restrictions to see where more parking space can be
released.
Conversely, the stick will be the very much greater likelihood of being
caught when parking illegally, combined with the prospect of tougher
penalties. Attendants will also be able to mete out punishment selectively,
for they will carry hand-held computers enabling them to check vehicles'
records. While occasional wrong-doers will get a ticket, frequent offenders
will have their vehicles clamped or towed away - and from next year, their
vehicles will not be released until all outstanding penalties have been
paid.
The carrot-and-stick approach will continue after the ticket has been
issued. The sanction against a motorist who does not pay up will be the same
as that for any other civil debt - registration of the fine in a county
court and, ultimately, a visit from the bailiffs.
But motorists will be encouraged to pay promptly by the offer of a 50 per
cent discount for penalties paid in 14 days and the threat of a 50 per cent
surcharge after two months. Those who believe they have been wronged will be
able to book an appointment for an informal adjudication, at which they will
get an on-the-spot decision after a five-minute hearing.
Although new to Britain, the London enforcement system is largely modelled
on schemes introduced in US cities over the past two years - notably in
Chicago, where a similar regime has succeeded in reducing congestion and
cutting journey times. It will be closely watched by cities elsewhere in the
UK and Europe.
Yet, as Mr Lester acknowledges, in one sense it is attacking the symptoms
rather than the cause of London's traffic problems. The real issue is the
fact that, at present rates of growth, the number of vehicles owned by
Londoners will sooner or later outstrip the amount of roadside space
available to accommodate them.
No one has yet thought of a solution to that particular conundrum, for few
of the possible solutions are attractive. Available evidence does not
support the notion that improvements in public transport would stop people
wanting to own cars. Building underground car parks is rarely feasible and
always expensive. Knocking down houses to create more space would not win
many votes.
In all likelihood, therefore, the answer will lie in ever-greater extension
of parking restrictions and ever-higher parking charges, using price as the
regulator between supply and demand. The regime about to come into force may
just be a foretaste of more draconian measures to come.
Not that Mr Lester need worry: he cannot drive. 'But I come from a
car-owning household,' he protests. 'And no one's in this business to bash
motorists over the head.'
At least, that is, not yet.

Sir, On my return from China I read with interest your six-page survey on
Shanghai (June 2). You wrote that this booming port intends to become a
leading financial centre in Asia and that the year 2010 is mentioned as the
target for the city to overtake Hong Kong as a financial services and
trading giant.
I hope the Foreign Office read the survey. At present the British consulate
in Shanghai consists of three Britons and a Chinese staff of seven. The
members of the UK business community with whom I spoke were unanimous in
saying that the consulate offered them no help or support.
Meanwhile the Australian consulate has a staff of 50; the French consulate,
20.
Why doesn't the Foreign Office stop being so archaic and get down to

FT  02 JUL 93 / Pawn and a white knight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Pawn, the member for northern Cyprus, deserves thanks. He has
diverted us, and made a sunny week delightful. His participation in the
muddying of the waters in the case of Mr Asil Not-here produced stunning
Wednesday theatre. The futile attempts by Madam Speaker to stop him must
have been music to the ears of Sir Anthony Scribbler QC. The whole
performance must have confused the courts and bamboozled the public. No one
would then ask how much money his client, Mr Not-here, is alleged to have
pocketed before he scarpered.
The plot would be perfect if, following the Americans' line on General
Noriega, Mr Not-here could be brought here. Perhaps the task could be given
to Group 4, the security specialists. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservatives'
chairman, could demonstrate that he is unafraid of revelations by the
champion donor to party funds. He could arrange for this excellent firm, to
which his connection has been noted, to kidnap our fugitive and bring him to
court. Even if that denouement, which I recommend, is denied us, Mr Pawn's
claim to Tory gratitude is safe. For he has rendered a service to the
government: he has drawn attention to his own shortcomings, and thus, for a
few blessed moments, directed our gaze away from the misfortunes of Mr John
Major.
Could he thus become known to history as the Pawn of Fate, the sincere idiot
who not only made the mistake of helping Mr Nadir broadcast the cry of the
accused throughout the ages - 'I wuz framed' - but who also inadvertently
bequeathed the prime minister a necessary breathing space? In mad moments,
in which one entertains the proposition that Mr Major will be PM until the
year 2000, this is as realistic a postulate as any.
Take it further. The recovery comes to life. The buoyancy of UK share prices
continues. People perceive that there are jobs to be had and that house
prices are no longer falling. Interest rate reductions in Germany and France
are followed by cuts in Britain. The Tokyo meeting of the G7 gives Mr Major
another week's respite from the rotten cabbages and custard pies of a
relentless media audience.
As the long summer break approaches, accidents stop happening to the
government. Ordinary business is taken seriously. The proposed restructuring
of police pay and administration tops one week's political agenda, the
report of the Royal Commission on the Criminal Justice system another. The
final Maastricht rebellion, the one that is supposed to erupt when the bill
returns to the Commons, fizzles. Lose or scrape home, the Conservatives are
less humiliated in the forthcoming Christchurch by-election than expected.
Whew] August, that month of civic forgetfulness, passes safely by; the
anniversary of Black Wednesday is a subdued affair and the Conservative
party conference in October is not the destructive shambles we saw last
year.
Writing it down makes it impossible to believe, but it is what Mr Major's
colleagues are praying for. Someone high up, I forget who, mumbled in my ear
the other evening that what the prime minister needs is some good luck,
'like a Falkland's war'. Another relevant interlocutor commented that the
first Black Wednesday, last September, had disenchanted the public while the
second, the occasion of Mr Norman Lamont's resignation speech, had perhaps
irrevocably damaged Mr Major's standing with his colleagues, particularly in
the light of his poor parliamentary response.
Perhaps the prime minister could make his own luck by finding a David R
Gergen. Mr Gergen is the political professional, a former counsellor to
three Republican presidents, brought in by the Democratic President Bill
Clinton to strengthen his support staff. Tomahawk Bill's popularity began to
rise after Mr Gergen arrived. I cast no aspersions on the Downing Street
staff; all I would venture is that Mr Major needs more people around him who
know how to do politics. He could turn to some of Lady Thatcher's
assistants, such as Sir Charles Powell, or Sir Bernard Ingham. No? Then
maybe he should think about Mr Tom McNally, erstwhile adviser to Lord
Callaghan. No.
The prime minister is not given to such imaginative strokes. He does,
however, require a chorus of articulate voices to speak on his behalf. For
lead propagandist he will rely on Mr Kenneth Clarke, his bluff new
chancellor. But Mr Clarke cannot do the job on his own. Mr Michael Heseltine
is off sick. An eager volunteer is to be found in Mr David Hunt, the new
employment secretary. Mr Hunt enhanced his reputation when he stood in for
the stricken Mr Heseltine in a recent debate on opposition accusations that
the funding of the Tory Party is corrupt and sleaze-ridden. He put aside his
nice-guy smile and slung as much mud across the despatch box as he had
received.
Tomorrow we shall hear from Hunt the aspirant statesman and popular
philosopher. He will address the annual conference of the Tory Reform Group
at Worcester College, Oxford, on 'the Conservative party and Europe - a
Christian Democratic perspective'. He will sound a bit like the absent Mr
Christopher Patten, who is unavoidably detained in Hong Kong. Mr Hunt is
unashamedly European - albeit with a politically correct emphasis on
competition - and a proponent of the social market. He says that companies
should take responsibility for the welfare of their employees, and employees
for the quality of their work.
At the core of Conservative belief, he argues, is the concept of the
individual citizen as a moral agent, responsible for his or her own actions.
He is a competent sloganeer - we shall soon hear about a new apprenticeship
system for the new century - and a student of the theories of John Rawls,
which he believes go some way to providing a secular moral basis for the
free market system. Curious: Mr Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader of
the Labour party, was wont to cite Rawls in defence of socialism. Mr Hunt's
forthcoming manifesto for one-nation Toryism should nevertheless be noted.
It says what Mr Major cannot find the words to say. It amplifies Mr Clarke's
'hard centre' definition of Conservatism. Whether Mr Major stays in office,
rescued by Mr Michael Mates as pawn, or whether he goes, Mr Hunt is a
politician to watch.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: UK must form a long-term energy policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER VINCENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On June 21 you reported that British Coal expects to close within the
next year some of the 19 pits previously regarded as 'core pits' ('Key pits
face closure threat'). On June 23 private mining companies were quoted as
describing the government's plans to privatise British Coal as being little
more than a 'farce'.
Both reports illustrate the government's failure to develop a long-term
national energy policy which recognises the need to make best use of all
Britain's energy resources, including coal.
The UK is fortunate in having access to the four principal sources of energy
for generating electricity: gas, oil, nuclear power and coal. We see little
sense in creating a domestic energy market in which coal is effectively
'priced out', thereby wiping out the massive past investment in this
strategic resource.
The government has said that private mining companies are free to bid for
the pits that British Coal no longer requires. But it has done nothing to
increase the market for coal; nor has it got round to repealing the
legislation which bars such companies from operating mines which employ more
than 150 men underground.
In such circumstances it is hardly surprising that private companies have
been reluctant to bid. And those that do may see it merely as an asset
stripping exercise.
If the government were serious about throwing a life-line to the 'reprieved'
pits it would have ensured that a legislative framework was in place which
would at least allow them to function under private ownership before it put
them up for sale. We can only hope that its privatisation bill will be
thought out more carefully or, in five years, we may have no deep mining
industry left. Peter Vincent,

FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: No vagaries if peat-free
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms BARBARA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peat producers hampered by wet weather this year would suffer less from
the vagaries of the British climate if they switched to making peat-free
composts in future ('Scottish peat profits bogged down by squelchy weather',
June 29).
Fine weather is needed for peat extraction, but not for the production of
adequate substitutes based on plant waste and coconut fibre. Increased use
of these products would reduce the pressure on threatened peat bogs, home to
many rare plants, animals, birds and insects, and also help address waste
disposal problems.
Peat use could be cut by 70 per cent by the end of 1994 if the government
introduced fiscal incentives to support this growing industry. This would
undoubtedly offer compost producers a more secure future than a change in
the weather.

Sir, On Wednesday I took a letter to my local post office and to my

FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: Cherubini's Beethoven - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not old Cherubini the Franco-Italian opera composer, but the young(ish),
all-German Cherubini Quartet, who are delivering the complete 'cycle' of
Beethoven quartets at the Wigmore Hall. Though they have not yet recorded
anything by their eponym, their recent recording of all Mendelssohn's
quartets has excited admiration and delight.
On Wednesday, during the first three numbers of Beethoven's opus 18, one
could hear what excellent Mendelssohn interpreters they must be. About their
Beethoven I was less persuaded. Since they are not merely born-again
Mendelssohnians but highly cultivated performers, they offered many passing
rewards and suave insights; transparent balance too, unimpeachable tempi, a
cool, intellectual grasp of structure - and even some calculatedly playful
moments. Yet there was never much muscle, despite their incisive fortissimo
playing, nor much sign of young Beethoven's truculent thrust.
Their leader, Christoph Poppen, is a violinist with a soft, sensitive timbre
of no great amplitude. In the romantic drama of the 'Adagio affetuoso ed
appassionata' of the F major quartet, for example, while the lower strings
grew properly forceful and doomy his own song - which should carry warmly
over it all - remained gentle and wan. In the G major, where Beethoven plays
at being gracious whilst emitting constant hints of something more
rumbustious, graciousness was all.
More typical of their best strengths was their subito diminuendo, an artful
drop into keen whispers, which they exploited often; also their delicate,
knowing indentation of musical paragraphs, accomplished with unanimous
fluency. Finesse of that kind is ideal for Mendelssohn, a precociously
conservative composer who never needed to advertise himself, whose radical
turns were always disguised by perfect polish. The Beethoven of the opus 18
quartets, however, was determined to show not only how well he had mastered
the arch-Classical medium, after Haydn and Mozart, but how much unfamiliar,
unsettling power he could invest in it.
That was scarcely to be felt here. At the Cherubini's hands, the young Turk
was made to sound like a serenely assured old pro. Far from aiming to
recapture the original force of the music, they dressed it reverently in
period costume. It should be interesting, at least, to hear how they adapt
their pretty style to the towering last quartets which come at the end of
their cycle on July 7, 9 and 10.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: A weird variety - Why the BT New Contemporaries show
is loaded with references
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public reaction to the work of young artists can provide a measure of
our response to the complex and difficult universe of modern art. Perhaps
because their work is by definition 'unknown', its display can give licence
to express an underlying anxiety about the contemporary art world, that
perplexing place where constant contradictions reduce even sophisticated and
erudite commentators to occasional bursts of bile and which nevertheless
these novitiates still choose to enter. Their work bears the burden of our
own anxiety, wary consumers, faced with a new and unknown product. For just
as the artists must make their offerings naked, without benefit of history,
so the viewers must make their judgments likewise, without the comforting
cloak of consensus.
With this in mind, a hostile response to the BT New Contemporaries
exhibition, which began a national tour in Manchester last week, is not in
itself surprising, but it raises questions about our expectations of
artists, and the myths about their genesis, which are worthy of
consideration. The show was chosen by professionals, two artists, Caroline
Russell and Willie Doherty, and the critic Stuart Morgan, and has a 'look',
a homogeneity which suggests not so much a similarity of original offerings
but the inevitable consensus reached in hammering out a final selection of
27 exhibitors from an open slide submission which attracted more than 1,000
entries. For all the works, however different in form, are couched in the
common language of these difficult times, a language in which no object or
offering is innocent, but comes loaded with references both to history and
the cultural stew of the present.
Thus 'The Hooded Pitohui (Shit Painting 2)' by Chris Ofili, combines his
remaking of Australian Aboriginal paintings with abstraction and the irony
of Piero Manzoni, as well as demonstrating considerable painterly panache.
Another gifted painter is Laura Daly, whose large abstracts feature
multicoloured dashes of paint arranged in vertical columns on single
coloured backgrounds, evoking Jackson Pollock and Ian Davenport, an old
master and a young pro, in a teasing mixture. The references of some of the
other works are more elusive. Objects, whether found or created, are used to
convey resonance, although their meaning may never be quite clear. The fat
white candle lying on the floor with a leather belt round its middle by
Andrew Bannister entitled 'Fuse' plays with sexuality as dynamite, while his
'Cell,' a wall panel made of white ceramic tiles with an inset photograph of
a room, empty but for a white draped bed, suggests isolation and menace.
As well as this reliance on the inherent mysteriousness of objects to lend
substance where content remains obscure, the exhibitors also demonstrate a
need for drama. Edwin David in 'Towards a Museum of Misreading' assembles a
shotgun, a plinth, a reproduction of Rossetti's 'Rape of Proserpine', a
quote from Freud, a chair, a pomegranate and a pile of broken glass to
suggest a museum incident of unknown significance. Edward Harper goes for it
more directly, arranging some green struts, floorboards and a silver salver
on the gallery floor to impersonate Manet's 'The Balcony.' Those spurious
philosophers of our time, the serial killers, also make a guest appearance.
'Handshake with Nilsen, Using Projector, Draws Olympia to the Phone' by
Thomas Sharpe combines a shaky drawing of the famous murderer of young men
with the image of 'Twin Peaks' star Sherilyn Fenn cut into flesh coloured
PVC dotted with plastic toy noses, an array of references bedazzling in its
lunatic range.
Why such weird variety? Why should a mass murderer be as inspiring as a
great painter? It is simple, really. Not for a century or so have visual
artists typically served apprenticeships in a master's studio, learning to
paint or sculpt while assisting in the manufacture of commissions. The
'apprenticeship' of an art student today is likely to be a more lonely
journey, often conducted in a makeshift 'space' staked out within the rooms
of an institution the nature and even name of which may have undergone
several changes during the student's time of attendance. With few immediate
fixed parameters, a young artist's boundaries, the things against which
skill and understanding must be tested, inevitably stretch both infinitely
outwards across the ocean of mass media culture which engulfs us all, and
deep within, with intuition alone guiding the choice of subject and
material.
The mixed media panels by Marcus Coates offer a touching image of the
complexity of allusion and aspiration which may result from a position at
once so knowledgeable and so vulnerable. He has taken details of two
paintings of women by Jan Van Eyck and blown them up photographically,
separating head-dress from head and head from body. The delicate features
thus unadorned gaze out from above his own naked torso, substituted for the
original sumptuously costumed body. His skill has allowed this young artist
to enter history, paraphrasing the masterpiece in the questioning technology
of our times.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: Oleanna - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advance publicity was misleading; David Mamet's Oleanna is a much more
subtle, cerebral play than you may have been encouraged to believe.
To dispense with the title first: Oleanna is simply the name of an American
folk song (Ole Anna), played once as the piece opens and never again. Then
we get down to business. The subject is not primarily sexual harassment,
though that helps to make the play topical and talked about. Nor is Oleanna
even necessarily about male-female relationships, though again that provides
an added thrust.
Mamet's work is much more about the current pursuit of political correctness
in American universities. Yet even that is an inadequate description. The
real subject is witch-hunting or McCarthyism, whether from the left or the
right. That has a long history in American politics, and indeed in the
American theatre.
To make the point starkly: Oleanna might be an even more interesting and
provocative play than it is if the professor were played by a woman and the
female student who accuses him of sexual harassment and elitism were played
by a man. There is very little evidence in Harold Pinter's production at the
Royal Court that sexual harassment takes place: perhaps a scintilla of doubt
to make it teasing, not much more.
The basic struggle is between liberals and illiberals. The clash between the
sexes may add to the box office (and who in the theatre can quarrel with
that?), but gender is immaterial to the argument. Carol, the protesting
student in Oleanna could just as well be black, rich, Hispanic, Asian, male
or any such combination. The same goes for the professor, John. The
difference between the two of them is that the professor believes that words
have a definable meaning while the student resorts to a group movement that
prefers slogans.
In the process Carol picks up language first used by the professor, though
without the understanding. At the start she queries him for using long
latinate words where shorter ones might do. By the end, to the professor's
ironic amusement, she is doing the same thing herself, but cannot see the
distinction between what the professor calls an accusation and what she
calls a fact. If the committee of the student body on the campus says it is
a fact, a fact it must be, however monstrous the distortion. The students'
organisation apes the authority that runs the university.
There is a similar transition in the resort to the law. At the beginning,
the professor is calling a lawyer to supervise the purchase of a new house.
In the devastating second act, it is the student who calls the law to allege
rape. Someone, incidentally, should write a thesis on the use of the
telephone in contemporary theatre: it must have cost thousands of actors'
jobs as there is no need to pay an unheard voice.
This is a marvellous play that could only have been written by someone with
a deep understanding of linguistics. But it is more than word play. Oleanna
contains a serious discourse on the value of higher education. Is it a right
owed to every student, whether they are capable of appreciating it or not?
Does more perhaps mean worse? Sir Kingsley Amis would love it, and there is
just a touch in Oleanna of a debt to Lucky Jim.
Mamet writes like an educated angel: terse, taut and to the point. Not a
word in this quietly spoken production is redundant. It is ideal material
for Pinter to direct: always disturbing, frequently menacing, but only at
the end breaking into violence. Pinter's control is immaculate.
There is a controversy about the conclusion, of which more than one version
exists. The Royal Court has gone, with Mamet's agreement, for his original
text which ends with the professor grovelling to political correctness
rather than the more brutal finale in the script published by Methuen and
played in New York. I do not think that it makes a huge difference either
way. By then you can draw your own conclusions from a totally adult play, a
tribute I normally reserve for Harley Granville Barker who also performed at
the Court.
The professor is played by David Suchet, the student by Lia Williams. Suchet
catches to perfection that pedagogic, sometimes seemingly patronising manner
of a man trying to be rational against the odds, struggling to find words
for things that cannot be said because even language is imperfect as a means
of communication. Ms Williams is quiet and fumbling to start with, as the
part demands. She becomes a fury, the essence of a semi-educated sub-culture
taking over. In this role she deserves a congratulatory first.

BBC radio has clearly discovered what those of us born in Scarborough have

FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: New York Balanchine bonanza - David Vaughan attends
the final gala performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New York City Ballet's Balanchine Celebration, about which Clement Crisp
wrote in its early stages, came to a triumphant end on Sunday with a gala
performance that began at 4 in the afternoon and lasted until 10.30 in the
evening, with intermissions when cocktails and zakouski (Russian hors
d'oeuvres) or American dessert (brownies and carrot cake) were served, and a
longer break when you could get a box supper prepared according to
Balanchine's own recipes.
As for the dancing, the programme reprised the chronological format of the
season as a whole, but with an international flavour to illustrate the fact
that Balanchine generously gave his ballets to companies all over the world.
Guest artists from the Kirov, the Paris Opera, the Royal Ballet, American
Ballet Theatre, Dance Theatre of Harlem, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific
Northwest Ballet (Seattle) appeared alongside City Ballet dancers.
Thus, there was a multinational Apollo with the Danish/American Nilas
Martins and Zhanna Ayupova (Kirov), Patricia Barker (Seattle) and Isabelle
Guerin (Paris) as his muses. The sensation of the evening was Darcy Bussell
in the pas de deux from Agon (with Lindsay Fischer), proving that she is a
born Balanchine dancer. In Who Cares? Viviana Durante danced 'The Man I
Love' with Robert LaFosse and Elizabeth Loscavio (San Francisco) spun
vertiginously through 'My One and Only.' At the end dancers and audience
joined in a vodka toast to Mr B. The waiter with the drinks for Peter
Martins, Lincoln Kirstein and Jerome Robbins was none other than Mikhail
Baryshnikov.
As Clement Crisp indicated, the heroines of this extraordinary marathon were
Kyra Nichols and Darci Kistler, to whom I would add Nichol Hlinka, who gave
a delicious account of Donizetti Variations with Nikolaj Haabbe, the
company's latest Danish recruit and of Columbine in Harlequinade, opposite a
mercurial Damian Woetzel, and, with Peter Boal, realised all the tragic
poetry of the Divertimento from 'Le Baiser de la fee'. It must be added that
some ballets were sadly undercast, most conspicuously when Nilas Martins,
the son of Peter Martins, ballet master in chief, attempted roles like
Orpheus and Apollo.
There is a dwindling number of dancers in the principal ranks who knew
Balanchine. The next generation will come from the School of American
Ballet, whose senior students also danced a selection of Balanchine excerpts
in this year's 'Workshop' performances, as well as one complete ballet,
Symphonie Concertante, in acknowledgment of the fact that it was originally
made for the school, in 1945. Nearly 50 years later, the very promising
Rachel Rutherford and Tara Keim danced the leading roles. Rutherford,
partnered by the elegant Peter Hansen, was also ravishing in 'Tales from the
Vienna Woods' from Vienna Waltzes.
Symphonie Concertante was also in the repertory of American Ballet Theatre
this year at the Metropolitan Opera House. Kevin McKenzie, the highly
respected dancer who has taken over the artistic direction, announced before
the season that he intended to take the company back to its old policy of
emphasising the 'theatre' aspect of the company's title. No brand-new works
were given, but the company took into its repertory Kenneth MacMillan's
Manon and Christian Holder's Les Liaisons dangereuses. Concerning the
latter, I can only echo Clement Crisp's remark about Glen Tetley's La Ronde:
'it lasts - was that all? - 50 minutes.' Manon is probably the best of
MacMillan's full-length ballets, certainly the one most accessible to
companies other than the Royal Ballet. Alessandra Ferri and Cynthia Harvey
have both danced the title role there, and are thoroughly at home in it.
Ferri was partnered by Julio Bocca, not the subtlest of dance actors. But
the supporting company, led by such artists as Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace
(who both danced Lescaut), Kathleen Moore, Victor Barbee, and Ethan Brown,
showed that they can form an acting ensemble worthy of comparison with the
Royal Ballet itself.
The revival of David Blair's production of Swan Lake looked rather dated,
but it is at least a straightforward rendering of the traditional
choreography. Nina Ananiashvili and Bocca gave it the old fashioned star
treatment, neither to their own nor to the ballet's advantage. Otherwise, it
was the ballets with the highest dance values that came off best, notably
Ashton's Symphonic Variations and Mark Morris's Drink to me only with thine
eyes.
Another Mark Morris work was seen in the brief season at the City Center of
Les Grands Ballets Canadiens: Paukenschlag, to Haydn's Symphony No. 94 (the
'Surprise'). Morris is sometimes criticised for being too close to the
music, but what he does in a ballet like this is wittily and inventively to
clarify the music's structure.
Morris has been busily turning out new pieces for his own company, which
will be seen later in the summer at Edinburgh.

computer simulation.
The UK company has become a Sega technology partner along with Martin
Marietta of the US, a leading electronics supplier and specialist in
simulation and training systems.
It will work with Sega on the development of a new arcade game to be
launched in early 1994. No details of the new game are being released. The
deal is worth Pounds 3.5m over two years to W Industries, followed by a
further Pounds 1.3m a year in licensing fees. W Industries has a letter of
intent from Sega for further games research.
According to Jon Waldern, W Industries chief executive, Sega chose to use
the British company's virtual reality system over its own and that of
leading US virtual reality suppliers.
W Industries, now six years old, is the UK's leading exponent of virtual
reality for entertainment. It specialises in 'immersive' virtual reality in
which players wear video helmets and sensory gloves to enter an imaginary
electronic world. It has recently won an industry award for 'Legend Quest' a
dungeons and dragons game installed in the Tower Pageant at the Tower of
London. For four players, the game involves a search for treasure through a
maze of rooms. Wearing helmets which transmit three-dimensional images of
the rooms, the players co-operate in the quest. They 'see' each other as the
fictional characters they play.
Sega, a leader in computer graphics for entertainment, bucked the trend
among Japanese electronics companies this year, returning taxable profits of
Y55,000bn (Pounds 342m), up 64 per cent on the previous year.
Developments of the kind Sega and W Industries are pioneering are changing
the image of games arcades from haunts of bored teenagers to family
entertainment centres. Worth some Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) a year worldwide,
the electronic arcade business is growing at 18 per cent annually.
UK companies including W Industries and Division are among the world leaders
in virtual reality.

Geoffrey Chamberlain (right), formerly chairman of the London Traded Options
market before its merger with Liffe, London's successful futures market, is
pursuing his aim of bringing stock options to the UK private investor
through other channels.
Yesterday, he launched a bi-weekly guide called The Option Trader, which
seeks to persuade private investors of the 'exciting and potentially
rewarding opportunities offered by the medium of traded options'. The
magazine includes analysis, recommendations and a back-to-basics educational
section.
Under the same parent company, Financial Publications, Chamberlain also runs
a retail client broking firm, Durlacher &amp; Co., formed in January 1992 by the
merger of two existing companies. His publishing company, Throgmorton Press,
plans to launch further publications, or to buy existing subscription-based
magazines aimed at the retail market.

Domestic appliance manufacturer Whirlpool has beaten other US manufacturers
in the Dollars 30m winner-take-all competition to try to develop and produce
chlorofluorocarbon-free super-efficient refrigerators.
The prize money will help keep down the cost to the consumer of the new
refrigerators when they are marketed in the US from next year.
Whirlpool fought the use of CFCs on two fronts. First, the ozone-depleting
coolant has been replaced by HFC-134a; second, the chemical used to expand
the foam insulation is to be replaced by HCFC-141b. This contains some CFCs,
but will be replaced once a suitable alternative has been found. Whirlpool:

Publicity surrounding sex chat lines gave premium rate phone services a bad
name. But according to research carried out by the London-based Eurodata
foundation, premium rate services are increasingly seen as an acceptable way
of getting business and leisure information.
Interviews with 1,400 phone users in 12 countries showed consumers were most
likely to use premium services in the Netherlands. There 38 per cent of
business people surveyed and 31 per cent of consumers had used a premium
rate service.
Overall, The Eurodata Premium Rate Services Report concludes that the
European market for such services will grow from Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m)
in 1992 to more than Dollars 2bn in 1995. Eurodata: UK, 071 629 0774.

FT  02 JUL 93 / People: Compass swings towards Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In an unusual move, health care and catering company Compass Group has hired
a non-executive director, Austrian-born Fritz Ternofsky (right), as a
full-time board member.
Chief executive Francis Mackay, who quips that the typical non-executive is
there 'to create maximum embarrassment with the least amount of effort',
agrees that it is usually difficult to judge the true ability of a part-time
director.
However, he had been impressed by Ternofsky's knowledge of branded retail
catering, and by his input into Compass's strategy review over the past
eighteen months. 'It also helps in terms of perception - we instantly become
a more European company.'
Last month, Compass acquired the airport restaurant and contract catering
business of SAS Service Partner, and Ternofsky will be responsible for
developing that operation. His native tongue will also come in handy in
Germany where Compass is interested in building on the two hospital
contracts that came as part of the SAS deal, as well as searching out other
suitable acquisitions in contract, airport, and station catering.
Ternofsky, 49, has worked in Britain since 1964. In his last job he worked
for Canadian company Scott's Hospitality as managing director and chief
executive officer of its European business, which included UK Marriott
Hotels and Perfect Pizza outlets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dick Eats, who resigned as managing director of GT Unit Managers a year ago,
has resurfaced at a similar job at its bigger rival Henderson
Administration. He joins next week as managing director of the unit trust
company, reporting to Paul Manduca, who is chairman of the retail division
and deputy managing director of the group.
Following Henderson's acquisition of Touche Remnant, group managing director
Jeremy Edwards says he had had Graham Kane, from the Touche side, in mind
for the job but the latter left for Morgan Grenfell. The group had earlier
lost Henderson's Robin Berrill.
Eats, 47, has gathered some twenty years' experience in the unit trust
industry. He joined GT in 1985, initially as marketing director. Former GT
colleagues say his departure was hastened because the requirements of the
job had changed; the group perceived a need for someone with sales as well
as marketing skills, the latter being Eats' forte.
Edwards says the rationalisation of the two separate unit trust operations
is well under way, with the process set to be completed, subject to unit
holders' approval, by mid September, so that Eats' chief task will be 'to
market these funds to a broad audience'.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Technology: Hologram on wheels - A way of making car
production more efficient by spotting design flaws earlier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even from 15 feet away, Clive Buckberry's song was deeply moving to the
five-litre can of oil he was serenading. Every surface quivered violently in
response.
Buckberry is a research engineer at Rover Group's Gaydon test centre in
Warwickshire. He was demonstrating, via what has come to be known around the
Gaydon lab as the 'karaoke can', some of the capabilities of a television
holography system developed by Rover's applied optics laboratory.
The screen's depiction of materials, showing a vastly greater response to
even the slightest pressure than many an engineer might suspect, is a
spectacular side-effect of the equipment's underlying purpose.
Rover is using it to design, develop and produce its cars more quickly and
efficiently. For example, the system can determine the exact points on car
bodies where drumming and vibrations originate in response to inputs such as
road surface irregularities, wind pressure and engine and gearbox shaft
rotation.
The normal industry practice is to apply large areas of sound-deadening
panel to damp overall noise levels. The holography system, say Gaydon
scientists, allows the identification of 'culprit' areas, which may be
little more than an inch square, and promises significant weight savings in
present and future models.
The system's potential applications cover almost every aspect of a car's
engineering. One of the most telling illustrations of the system's
capabilities is provided by the action of bolting a cylinder head to the
engine block. A video camera, when aimed up the cylinder bore towards the
combustion chamber, relays to the screen pictures showing spectacular
distortion of the combustion chamber and its environs as the bolts are
tightened.
The real physical distortion is magnified on the screen many times. But it
shows that, in this particular engine, normal tightening is causing
sufficient distortion for valves to be unseated by up to four thousandths of
an inch - enough to prevent it ever sealing itself properly into the head.
The initial reference image and subsequent ones showing the distortion are
converted by the system's image processing software into a variety of
optical data, from colour-coded contour 'maps' to rotatable 'wireframe'
structures.
Data from such tests and observations have already begun to play a
substantial role in designing future engines as free as possible of such
vulnerability to assembly distortions. The system has already been used to:
Help design the most efficient water flow in engine cylinder heads for
optimum cooling without distortion;
Locate exactly where on the engine a combustion knock sensor should be
placed to pick up early warning of the potentially damaging combustion
problem;
Redesign turbocharger impellers to eliminate high-speed 'whistle' and
vibration;
Analyse fuel/air mixture dynamics for optimum combustion;
Track the vibration of light bulb filaments, with a view to increasing
durability and light emission.
Holography has been used, on a more limited basis, for this type of work for
some years. But until now, says Buckberry, it has involved taking a sequence
of still holographs, developing each one separately, and then comparing them
with a 'reference' hologram taken before forces were applied.
But the 'contour lines' of stress variation can be as little as two
thousandths of a millimetre apart, so keeping the subject stable enough to
register such minute variation was difficult.
Working with Loughborough University, Gaydon's technologists hit on the idea
of substituting the stills with a video camera capable of recording
distortions being caused in the subject material continuously, and in 'real
time'.
In the 'holovision' camera, designed at Gaydon, the normal optical
components of a video camera are replaced by a fibre-optic system coupled to
the laser needed to 'read' the subject material's surface holographically.
The camera is connected by another fibre-optic 'umbilical cord', carrying
all control and monitoring signals, to two state-of-the-art image data
processing boards.
One board monitors the operation of the camera, collects the data generated

In the 1980s Gaydon, which occupies nearly 1,000 acres of Warwickshire and
includes a high-speed test track, was changed from an entirely in-house
research and technology centre to a stand-alone profit centre charged with
seeking consultancy business from outside customers.
After the British Aerospace takeover Gaydon again became a mainly in-house
research and development arm.
However, Gaydon remains free to sell some technology outside when considered
appropriate and not prejudicial to Rover's own interests. The company has
already sold two of the Holovision systems - to Ford.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Management: GrandMet's life on the streets - A new age in
corporate responsibility is dawning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trevor, kitted out uneasily in the Job Club's communal suit, prepares to
leave for an interview. Eviction only hours earlier from the hostel next
door for failing to pay his rent means he badly needs work.
Brian Stack, manager of the Centrepoint Job Club, close to London's Vauxhall
Bridge, gives Trevor his fare and a quick pep-talk. 'He wants to work and,
with our help, he will work,' Stack insists.
Stack's cramped, spartan premises are a world apart from the stylish, St
James' Square headquarters of Grand Metropolitan, the international food,
drink and retailing group. But his job club owes its existence to the
financial support and manpower provided by a business best known for brands
like Smirnoff, Haagen-Dazs and Burger King.
'I asked the employment service how we could help young people arriving in
London looking for jobs. They told me, rather unhelpfully, to stop them
getting off the coach at Victoria station,' adds Stack. Now 90 per cent of
his clients - around 40 a week sign on - end up getting a job, usually
within five weeks.
Through its ambitious community programme GrandMet is now one of the UK's
largest providers of training and job counselling for the unemployed. Last
year, more than 20,000 people received help under GrandMet-funded schemes.
In one of its newest initiatives, the group is committed in London's East
End - in partnership with the Cities in Schools (CIS) organisation and Tower
Hamlets council - to help persistent school truants complete their education
and prepare for work.
GrandMet has provided manpower, funds and premises to assist the CIS
programme and this month will see the opening in London's Docklands of the
first UK Burger King Academy for truants, based on an already successful US
formula.
Some of the group's landlords, currently joining battle over leases which
they claim threaten the very future of the British pub, might sneer at the
GrandMet imagery of harmony and co-operation between business and community.
But it is the vision which lies behind a global community programme now
costing Pounds 20m a year and undertaken in partnership with a range of
organisations and authorities.
Community involvement for companies is not a new concept but Sir Allen
Sheppard, GrandMet chairman and group chief executive, says it now
represents a core element of corporate responsibility in what he describes
as the new age of consumer-driven capitalism.
'Customers are increasingly looking through the front door of the companies
they buy from. If they do not like what they see in terms of social
responsibility, community involvement, equality of opportunity, they won't
go in.'
He recognises that there are plenty of cynics as well as some company
executives more driven by public relations than genuine commitment. But he
reckons hypocrites are quickly sniffed out, particularly by the voluntary
agencies involved in many community activities.
The strategy supporting GrandMet's programme is to give a lead in helping
combat the growth of an underclass by promoting the concept of self-help.
Howard Chandler, head of GrandMet's worldwide community programmes, says
they are aimed at those 'not getting a fair shake'.
But, he emphasises: 'We are not a refuge for the unemployed and unmotivated.
We believe in self-development and personal initiative but companies like
ours must play a critical role in helping the process along.' Integration
into the community of those who might otherwise remain excluded is a key
objective.
Group community initiatives embrace schemes for inner city regeneration, as
well as a range of educational and training projects and sponsorship
programmes. There is help for potential school drop-outs, for the young,
homeless unemployed and support for a range of charities. GrandMet employees
are also encouraged to join volunteering programmes.
Sir Allen says: 'It's a big part of career development. I like to see people
in the trenches, not stuck in the back office. It's better than 1,000
management courses. It's playing the game for real.'
There is no compulsion on staff to participate but the chairman is not
unhappy for employees to believe that taking part will do no harm to their
career prospects.
Although GrandMet embarked on its community programme a decade ago, it
recently realised that its efforts needed reappraisal. Its efforts to fulfil
its broader social obligations had to be scrutinised like any other part of
the business.
'There was a scatter-gun approach, under which individual businesses pursued
as far as possible their own ideas. Initiatives also tended to be reactive,
rather than proactive,' says Sir Allen.
Now, GrandMet identifies its community action priorities from the centre,
agrees the scale of its rolling commitments - it currently allocates between
1.5 and 2 per cent of profits before tax - and continuously monitors what it
now regards as a more cohesive strategy.
The group lays heavy emphasis on forward planning for its community work,
conscious that anything less than a consistent, longer-term approach could
be disastrously counter-productive. Three-year plans are reviewed annually
and the core charities it backs - now including the Civic Trust, the British
Sports Association for the Disabled, Cities in Schools and Foyer Federation
for Youth - can expect help for at least three years.
'It is high risk,' warns Sir Allen. 'The worst thing you can do is flash a
chequebook around, especially as it's not your money. If you go up front and
make a big song and dance about helping out and are then forced to retract,
your reputation can fall a long way.
'Each time you put up a significant amount of money you have got to agree
clear success criteria with your partners and then monitor effectiveness. We
can never measure performance as scientifically as other parts of the
business but we are building up a great deal of best practice.'
Sir Allen is in no doubt that business has no choice but to play a full role
in shaping - to quote the prime minister's phrase - 'a country at ease with
itself'. More pointedly, he warns: 'Businesses which don't recognise their
obligations in this respect face a stark choice - they will either fail
rapidly or progressively.'

FT  02 JUL 93 / Management: Corporate venturing back in vogue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE a good 1960s pop song, the idea that large companies need an
invigorating dose of internal entrepreneurship is forever bouncing back into
fashion. Like Elvis Presley's 'I Can't Help Falling In Love', which has
again hit the charts this summer - sung this time by UB40, a leading pop
group - it tends each time to be re-orchestrated, or given a few extra
chords.
But unlike most songs, it also usually changes its name. In the 1960s it was
christened 'venture management'. In the late 1970s, to distinguish it from
the emergent venture capital craze, it was rechristened 'internal corporate
venturing'. In the mid-1980s it reappeared under the dreadful name of
'intrapreneurship'. Now it is emerging once more in practice and on paper,
sometimes with its old 1970s label, but also under the broader imprint of
'new business development'.
The reason for its latest revival is that corporate entrepreneurship is
becoming more vital than ever before to the survival of large organisations.
But it remains damned hard to do - just ask IBM, General Motors or countless
others why they have failed to emulate the few brilliant examplars, such as
3M or Hewlett-Packard.
Time and time again, multinationals of all shapes and sizes have launched a
'new ventures' drive, only to drop it prematurely a few years later when -
surprise, surprise - few if any ventures have yet grown to a size or level
of profitability which is significant to the company.
On one notable occasion, the night of Margaret Thatcher's first general
election victory in 1979, I attended an enthusiastic gathering of 'venture
group' managers from two dozen British companies. Three years later almost
all the venture groups had been killed off by parent companies impatient for
immediate profits and cash savings amid recession.
A fortnight ago I took part in a similarly hopeful meeting of 'business
development' and strategy managers, but this time at Breda in the
Netherlands, with managers from several continental European countries. It
was the fifth annual 'longest day' on new business and creativity which an
enterprising Dutch consultancy has organised around the summer solstice - a
sort of corporate version of Britain's Glastonbury music and arts festival.
The event illustrated vividly that the practice of internal venturing has
moved on in several important ways since the heady 1960s, and even since the
1980s.
First, interest in venturing is at last ceasing to wax and wane in tandem
with companies' faith - or loss of it - in diversification by takeover. The
latter is rightly out of fashion, but managers are recognising that new
business development has been made more important than ever by the
shortening of product life cycles and development times. As one hard-pressed
Dutchman said: 'We need to create more with less, faster.'
Second, corporate venturers are benefiting from the newly popular concept of
'core competences' (or 'core capabilities').
This is not at all the same thing as a 'core business'. Instead, it
emphasises a company's unique, competitively relevant, and defensible
expertise in such things as technology, production, marketing, distribution,
customer service, or alliance management. One example is Honda's competence
in engine technology, another 3M's unusually innovative culture, plus its
experience in abrasives.
The emphasis on core competences is causing many companies to look again at
how they can exploit more effectively what they already know - or 'leverage'
it, in American parlance - rather than forever chasing after some new
hare-brained diversification.
As the Breda conference showed, this is giving 'internal venturing' a new
lift. It is also stimulating a third new variation: greater selectivity.
Most companies used to take a 'casino' approach: they spawned scores of new
ventures, covering a wide range of frequently unrelated activities and
compentences. They then ran them in parallel, in the hope that the
proverbial one in seven or so would be successful after up to 10 years
(eight was the popular average).
As a manager from one Belgian company said: 'We had 25 projects taking 10
years to be completed. Now we have only a handful and they'll succeed in
three or four years - or we'll fail them.' Another had 86 projects a year
ago, but now has only five. They are larger than before, and are being given
far greater resources, so that they have a better chance of rapid take-off
and success.
A fourth variation is that many companies are no longer putting all their
eggs into one isolated 'new ventures division', where they tend to get
forgotten or squashed when their top management sponsor moves on.
Which brings us to the fifth and most important variation. Instead of
thinking that they can 'nurture' ventures in a ghetto in one corner of the
company, as conventional wisdom used to suggest, today's venture managers
realise they will not get far unless the corporate culture of the whole
enterprise around them can be made much more innovative.
Of the 30 participants at Breda, no fewer than 19 voted 'management mindset'
or 'conflict with the corporate elephant' as the prime challenge to their
new business efforts.
This frustration now needs to be harnessed in helping large companies see
the urgent need not merely to raise their productivity through
're-engineering' and other measures, but also to unleash the internal
entrepreneurship which is essential if they are to create new businesses,
and thereby regenerate themselves.
For many companies it may, in the words of another Presley song due for
revival, be a case of 'It's Now Or Never'.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Revenue disclaims link in Polly
case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue said yesterday that the connection between a senior tax
investigator and the Serious Fraud Office in relation to Polly Peck
International was 'complete news to us'.
In wider-ranging comments than it has previously made, it admitted that Mr
Allcock, the head of special office 2, which deals with tax issues connected
to City fraud, had been suspending as a result of alleged public corruption
offences including bribery.
Mr Allcock strenuously denies the charges, but said through his solicitor on
Wednesday that he was instrumental in the referral to the SFO of the affairs
of Mr Asil Nadir, the chairman of Polly Peck International who jumped bail
for northern Cyprus in May.
Under section 182 of the 1989 Finance Act the Revenue is prevented in all
but the most exceptional conditions from discussing taxpayers' affairs with
third parties, including the police.
But it said yesterday it would permit tax investigators to 'drop a hint (to
other relevant authorities) if something funny is going on, if we get
something worthwhile in return'.
The Revenue rejected suggestions that Mr Allcock's suspension had in any way
jeopardised other tax investigations being conducted by special office 2.
It also said it was unaware of any connection between the suspension and any
specific cases such as the affairs of Mr Nadir.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Letters show a persistent Mates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLICATION of edited letters yesterday between Mr Michael Mates and the
government's most senior law officers paints an extraordinary picture of a
lone minister increasingly convinced of a conspiracy to damn Mr Asil Nadir.
In representations to two attorneys-general over the past 18 months Mr Mates
appeared to have become increasingly consumed with the alleged treatment of
Mr Nadir and determined to expose what he believed to be a catalogue of
abuse by the authorities.
In spite of repeated denials from Sir Patrick Mayhew and Sir Nicholas Lyell,
his successor as attorney-general, Mr Mates alleged numerous intimidatory
and improper acts by the Serious Fraud Office and also claimed collusion
between the SFO and the Inland Revenue.
Throughout, Mr Mates suggested that Mr Nadir, in spite of his departure from
the UK, remained anxious to return to the UK in order to clear his name.
The most startling claim in his personal campaign to protect Mr Nadir's
rights involved the suggestion that the fugitive businessman's empire, which
dominates the economy of northern Cyprus, was at the centre of an
intelligence service plot to destabilise the country. His fears on this
front rose when he heard that similar allegations might be included in a
proposed television programme.
Much of the correspondence published yesterday covers ground covered in the
statement which Mr Mates managed, in spite of the reluctance of the Speaker,
to make earlier this week in the Commons. It omits, however, all reference
to his allegations of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by
bribing Mr Justice Tucker, the Nadir trial judge.
The letters date from September 20 1991, following a meeting the previous
day between Mr Mates and Sir Patrick. The MP complained that privileged
documents removed from Mr Nadir's office were opened, contrary to an
agreement, by the SFO and demanded that it 'tell the whole truth' about the
matter.
He also accused the SFO of arranging publicity for raids on Polly Peck
International, Mr Nadir's company, and of excessive delays which continued
to deny the businessman the chance to state his case in court.
Sir Patrick rejected the idea of any improper motives and said that, on all
the counts raised by Mr Mates, he was satisfied the SFO had acted carefully
and responsibly.
Last December Mr Mates met Sir Nicholas, now attorney-general, to press his
case that Mr Nadir was being unjustly treated and first raised the
possibility that intelligence services might be involved. He complained that
the businessman had been arrested eight times without warning, in spite of
meeting all his bail conditions.
Sir Nicholas also categorically denied the assertion that police officers,
SFO staff or anyone else connected with the Nadir investigation had gone to
Cyprus.
Mr Mates finally met the attorney-general on May 10, when Sir Nicholas
assured the minister that each issue he had raised had been examined very
carefully. Undeterred, Mr Mates pressed home his concerns about the conduct
of the case.
One June 8 Sir Nicholas made a further attempt to ease some of Mr Mates'
concerns, re-emphasising that claims of collusion to undermine Polly Peck
were unsupported by any evidence. Mr Mates, frustrated by his lack of
progress but determined not to let the subject drop, was reaching the end of
his ministerial career.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Carlile demands investigation into
SFO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALEX CARLILE called yester-day for an inquiry into working practices at
the Serious Fraud Office.
The proposal by the Liberal Democrat parliamentary spokesman on employment
came in the middle of a day of complicated statements and counter-statements
that ended with Mr George Staple, SFO director, announcing that he had
instructed staff to use 'the utmost care' in dealing with the press.
Mr Carlile referred to documents which he said provided 'strong
circumstantial evidence' that the SFO or police officers working for it had
tipped off the press about raids related to the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International inquiry carried out in October 1991. Mr Carlile said the
documents left 'genuine public concern' about working practices at the SFO.
The SFO retorted that documents prepared on the day of the raid were not
press releases to be issued to journalists, but internal briefing papers.
Their purpose had been to help staff in briefing reporters after the raid.
The SFO also tried to distance itself from a controversy surrounding a
forged letter purporting to come from the former Liberal leader Sir David
Steel, by passing the blame to the City of London Police.
The move came as Mr Carlile said he had been told there was a second forged
letter relating to the same inquiry. Mr Carlile said the second letter
purported to be from Mr David Freeman, a London solicitor. He had not seen
the letter, but was given to understand it was dated April 1.
Mr Staple said last night that he had asked the police 'to ensure that no
occurrence of this type would occur in the future'.
He emphasised that 'no SFO lawyer or other member of the SFO' was involved
in the forgery of the 'Steel' letter which was found to have been sent as an
April's Fool joke last year.
'The letter was written and sent by an officer or officers of the City of
London Police who had been working in conjunction with the SFO on the BCCI
investigation,' Mr Staple added.
The SFO said the second letter mentioned by Mr Carlile was not a letter but
a fax cover note attached to the 'Steel' letter 'as part of the same
misguided April fool joke'.
The SFO confirmed that on April 1 last year a senior lawyer working on the
BCCI investigation received a faxed copy of the letter which appeared to
come from Sir David. It was written on House of Commons paper and said that
Sir David would be attending court later that day in relation to a
defendant's bail application.
According to Mr Staple's statement the senior SFO lawyer believed the letter
to be genuine and showed it to the defendant's lawyers.
The City of London Police said last night that the forged letter had been
sent by one of its officers who was on secondment to the SFO. The force said
its own inquiry 'did not result in any disciplinary proceedings'.
Mr Carlile said both forged letters were prepared by officers of the City of
London police who were then working 'with or as part of' the SFO.
Mr Carlile said it was 'outrageous' that those responsible for the letters
had not been demoted 'at the very least'. He would be 'reluctant to see
police officers who do this kind of thing even arresting a shoplifter in
Boots'.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major attacks Labour over policy on
Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday triggered a rare political row on Northern Ireland
at Westminster by angrily denouncing an idea floated by Labour that
responsibility for the province should be shared between London and Dublin.
He cheered Unionist MPs by saying Conservatives stood 'four square' behind
the union with Britain. But the prime minster's comments infuriated
nationalist MPs and could set back still further the chances of round-table
talks on Northern Ireland resuming this year.
Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
said Mr Major was 'playing politics' while lives were being lost.
Last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, wrote to Mr John
Smith, Labour leader, asking for clarification of Labour's Ulster policy.
Earlier Sir Patrick said uncertainty about Northern Ireland's constitutional
status 'must make the task of the security forces harder.'
The government has in the past tried to act as a neutral 'facilitator' in
negotiations and has enjoyed backing from Labour for its efforts. It has
said Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK as long as a majority of
the population want that.
But Mr Major firmly rejected 'shared responsibility' which, he said, would
have to be imposed against the wishes the province's population.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown calls for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN SHOULD cut its interest rates in line with the reduction in the cost
of borrowing in Germany, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's Treasury spokesman, said
last night.
Speaking after the Treasury and Bank of England refused to follow the
Bundesbank's decision to cut Germany's discount rate, Mr Brown signalled a
fresh attempt by Labour to set the pace at Westminster in debate on the
economy.
He attacked Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saying: 'For weeks we have
had much talk from the new Chancellor but little in the way of action,' Mr
Brown said.
He also said that next week's meeting in Japan of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations should address the need for co-ordinated world-wide
action to boost growth and employment.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs back plan for aerospace
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLS FOR the government to develop a technology acquisition plan for the
aerospace industry have been strongly endorsed by an influential cross-party
committee of MPs, David Owen writes.
The MPs are expected to echo in a report to be published later this month
calls by the Department of Trade and Industry's aviation committee for
increased government backing for the sector to help British aerospace
companies keep pace with their overseas rivals.
The MPs - on the trade and industry select committee - will recommend that
the DTI should work more closely with the Ministry of Defence, the
industry's biggest customer, to chart a strategic course for Britain's
aerospace sector.
They are expected to urge that a regular survey of the level of government
support for aerospace in Britain and other countries be compiled and to warn
that Britain could be squeezed out of international markets unless adequate
resources for technological R&amp;D are provided.
In a confidential report last October the aviation committee - which
includes civil servants and industry representatives - called for Britain to
develop a national strategic technology acquisition plan.
It said it was 'imperative' to protect Britain's position as a world class
aerospace manufacturer that the government-corporate sector partnership in
research and technology acquisition be reinforced.
Funding by the government-industry partnership should 'at least be in
proportion to the investment undertaken by our closest competitors and
collaborators'.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Drawing out lines of argument /
Reviewing the implications of revised electoral boundaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAWING of electoral boundaries is doubly in the news. A dreary and
technical subject, it can nonetheless be political dynamite.
Last Wednesday the home secretary forced through the second reading of a
bill to give England five more seats in the European parliament. Wales is to
get one more and Scotland none. Special commissions are being hastily set up
to draw the boundaries but, against recent precedent, there will be no
public inquiries. Objections must be expressed by letter.
The reason for this arbitrariness is the shortage of time. To add six to the
existing 81 seats must involve a drastic transformation of the UK electoral
map. The government did nothing until this week, although the European
elections are due in June next year.
Parties and candidates are desperate to have the boundaries settled as soon
as possible - certainly by the end of the year. Home secretary Michael
Howard says it is too late to follow customary procedure.
But perhaps it does not matter. Euro-constituencies are arbitrary areas,
each made up of seven or eight Westminster seats and containing about
500,000 electors. Experiments have shown that, in almost all circumstances,
the party consequences of alternative maps will differ negligibly.
The government has been generous - or politic - in giving Wales an extra
seat (almost necessarily a Labour one). In strict arithmetic terms all six
new MEPs should come from England. Scotland has no claim whatsoever.
Of course, the main objection to the bill is that it preserves the
first-past-the-post system. It would have been simple to allocate the six
seats on a proportional basis.
All parties except the Conservatives favour proportional representation for
the European parliament. Even the government is committed by treaty to
implement a common electoral system for Europe which, given the practice of
the other eleven countries, necessarily means a proportional system.
On the basis of opinion polls the 1979 result could easily be reversed next
year with the Conservatives down to 17 seats or less. On the basis of the
county elections last May they would only get 11.
A switch from 60 to 17 seats means a change of 86 in the right-left balance
at Strasbourg. The government's insistence on first-past-the-post may give
Mr Jacques Delors an easier ride in the next Euro-parliament.
But another bombshell is approaching. For the last two years the UK boundary
commissions have been redesigning parliamentary constituencies. By next week
all their provisional proposals will have been published.
When parliament has approved them the decks will be clear for the next
general election. The Conservatives will benefit from the changes - the
drift from cities always guarantees that - but their gain, perhaps 10 or a
dozen seats in an evenly balanced parliament, will be less than most have
predicted. It would, however, be enough to decide many general elections -
six of the 13 contests since 1950 have produced a majority of less than 20.
But there is a snag to the timetable. The new boundaries can be challenged
in the courts. Judges are reluctant to get involved in these political
matters, as was shown in a long case brought by the Labour Party in 1983.
But the frontiers of judicial review are extending and new grounds have just
been provided for challenging the work of the boundary commissions.
They are operating, as required by statute, on the basis of the 1991
electoral register. But last week OPCS published a study - showing the scale
of error in the register.
Using the 1991 census - itself flawed - as a base, the OPCS research found
that nationally, 7.1 per cent of the eligible names were missing from the
1991 register. For Inner London the proportion was a staggering 20.4 per
cent.
On the basis of the 1991 register Inner London is set to get only 24 MPs,
but on the basis of the 1991 census it would be entitled to 28.
Activist councillors in boroughs that are being cut from three to two MPs or
indeed the London Labour Party as a whole, have prima facie grounds for
seeking to enjoin the boundary commissioners from presenting their proposals
to the Home Secretary. Judicial caution may frustrate them, but who can
tell?

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard seeks new drive on crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW campaign to enlist support from the public in combating the crime wave
was launched by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, in the Commons last
night.
Opening a debate on law and order, he said: 'I want to channel the public's
energies in a constructive way to build a new, stronger and more effective
alliance against crime.'
Tory backbenchers joined with the minister in seeking to counter the impact
made by Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, in his recent call
for a crusade against crime.
Mr Howard said he wanted to create an atmosphere in which criminals were
'frightened' and not members of the public.
He also wanted to make local communities feel that 'we can act together to
do something about crime'.
Mr Howard promised: 'We will do that by taking a long-term approach to
crime, by attacking it from every quarter'.
However, the government may be facing embarrassment after the Tory candidate
in the Christchurch by-election sought to outflank his Liberal Democrat
rival by setting crime and capital punishment at the top of his agenda -
even though the home secretary opposes hanging.
Mr Robert Hayward yesterday angered Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat
leader, by launching a survey of public opinion in Christchurch on capital
punishment.
The Tory campaign team's high-risk strategy could succeed in diverting
attention from disquiet over government policies. But Mr Hayward could
embarrass ministers, most of whom are opposed to hanging.
During the Commons debate yesterday Mr Howard, regarded as being on the Tory
right wing, said he had previously supported capital punishment but was now
opposed because of the initial failure of the appeals procedures in cases
such as that of the six men wrongly convicted of the Birmingham pub
bombings.
No date has been set for the Christchurch by-election, caused by the death
of Mr Robert Adley, the Conservative MP who had a 23,000 majority at the
last general election. Yet later this month is still regarded as the most
likely date.

damage Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAIMS THAT intelligence services were involved in a plot to undermine Mr
Asil Nadir and help destroy the economy of northern Cyprus yesterday
heightened the row at Westminster over the treatment of the fugitive
businessman.
Detailed allegations and answers in the 48 pages of papers published by Sir
Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, again raised concerns at Westminster
over the activities of the Serious Fraud Office.
The row also spilled over into renewed efforts by Labour to turn the focus
back on to politically embarrassing donations to the Conservative party.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday attempted during Commons
question time to heighten the funding controversy by demanding that the
Tories returned Pounds 1m which he said had been donated to the party by Mr
Octav Botnar, the chairman of Nissan UK.
Mr Botnar has been accused by the Inland Revenue in court of being the prime
mover behind Britain's largest-ever tax fraud.
The most serious claim by Mr Michael Mates, the former minister, was raised
in a meeting last December, when he told Sir Nicholas that he believed there
might be 'strong political pressure for Mr Nadir to be convicted in order to
provide a solution to the problem of northern Cyprus'.
Just over three months later he telephoned the attorney-general's office to
report that BBC television's Panorama was planning a programme alleging a
conspiracy involving the Cypriot, British and US intelligence services. The
intention was to bring about Mr Nadir's downfall. Downing Street yesterday
called the suggestion 'rubbish'.
It also emerged last night that Mr Peter Lloyd, a home office minister, was
among the other hitherto unnamed MPs who had made representations to the
attorney-general about the SFO's handling of the case against Mr Nadir. Mr
Lloyd passed on the complaints of a constituent about the case.

<TEXT>
THE bizarre train of events which has engulfed the prosecution of Mr Asir
Nadir took another tortuous twist last night with the disclosure of a
crudely forged letter attempting to link the fugitive businessman to a
former minister, Philip Stephens writes.
But the document - offered for sale to at least one national newspaper  -
appeared to have no direct link with the separate controversy over the
activities of the Serious Fraud Office. The view at Westminster last night
was that it was a 'freelance' attempt by someone seeking to defraud the
media.
Whitehall officials said that Mr David Mellor, the former heritage
secretary, had informed Mr John Major's office about the circulation of a
forged letter he was said to have written to Mr Nadir, thanking him for the
contributions of Pounds 440,000 he had made to the Conservative party.
Officials dismissed suggestions that Mr Major had personally authorised a
police investigation.

and British involvement in international projects.
On diversification within the sector, the MPs will recommend that the

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rail fare plans may displease
Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yes-terday appeared to be risking further backbench
displeasure over its rail privatisation plans by proposing only loose
controls over fares in an amendment to the Railways Bill, Richard Tomkins
writes.
Five weeks ago Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, headed off a
backbench revolt over the rail privatisation plans by promising measures to
guard against big fare increases and to ensure continuation of discount
fares for the young and old.
The government's proposals yesterday went before the Lords committee which
yesterday started its detailed examination of the bill.
The new clause on fares does not give the government direct control.
Instead, it authorises the franchising director to tackle the subject in
franchising agreements.
The franchising director is not compelled to do this, however. The clause
only requires it 'if it appears to the franchising director that the
interests of persons who use, or who are likely to use, franchised services
so require'.
The new clause says every franchisee will be required to participate in
every discount fare scheme approved by the franchising director for the
young, elderly or disabled.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: SFO tries to sidestep row over
Steel document
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office yesterday attempted to distance itself from a
controversy surrounding a forged letter purporting to come from the former
liberal leader Sir David Steel, by passing the blame to the City of London
Police.
The SFO director Mr George Staple said last night that he had asked the
police 'to insure that no occurence of this type would occur in the future'.
Mr Staple emphasised that 'no SFO lawyer or other member of the SFO' was
involved in the forgery of a letter which was found to have been sent as an
April's Fool joke last year.
'The letter was written and sent by an officer or officers of the City of
London Police who had been working in conjunction with the SFO on the BCCI
investigation,' Mr Staple added.
The SFO confirmed that on April 1 1992, a senior lawyer working on the BCCI
investigation received a faxed copy of the letter which appeared to come
from Sir David. It was written on House of Commons paper and said that Sir
David would be attending court later that day in relation to a defendant's
bail application.
According to Mr Staple's statement the senior SFO lawyer believed the letter
to be genuine and showed it to the defendant's lawyers.
The City of London Police said last night that the forged letter had been
sent by one of its officers who was on secondment to the SFO. The force said
its own inquiry 'did not result in any displinary proceedings'.
Mr Alex Carlile, a Liberal Democrat MP, said he had evidence of a second
forged letter relating to the same case, purporting to be from Mr David
Freeman, a London solicitor.

<TEXT>
THE TORY candidate in the Christchurch by-election has sought to outflank
his Liberal Democrat rival by setting crime and capital punishment at the
top of his agenda - even though Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, opposes
hanging.
Mr Robert Hayward yesterday angered Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat
leader, by launching a survey of public opinion in Christchurch on capital
punishment.
Mr Hayward said crime had been raised far more often than the economy by
constituents he had met so far. 'It is the largest single issue, no question
about it,' he said.
The Conservative's campaign team's high-risk strategy could succeed in
diverting attention from government policies. But Mr Hayward could embarrass
ministers, most of whom are opposed to hanging.
During a Commons debate on law and order yesterday Mr Howard, regarded as
being on the Tory right wing, said he had previously supported capital
punishment but was now opposed because of the initial failure of the appeals
procedures in cases such as the 'Birmingham Six'.
No date has been set for the Christchurch by-election, caused by the death
of Mr Robert Adley who had 23,000 conservative majority at the last
election. But later this month is still regarded as the most likely date.
Mr Hayward, formerly Conservative MP for Kingswood, said he had voted in
favour of hanging for terrorists and for those who murdered policemen, as
well as other categories.
For the Liberal Democrats Mr Ashdown protested that capital punishment was
'an issue of conscience' on which British political parties did not take a
formal position. He described the Conservative's move as 'a clear sign of
desperation'.
In the Commons last night Mr Howard launched a drive to enlist support from
the public in combating the crime wave.
He said: 'I want to channel the public's energies in a constructive way to
build a new, stronger and more effective alliance against crime.'
Tory backbenchers joined with the minister in seeking to counter the impact

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM slams 'shared responsibility' on
Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday triggered a rare political row on Northern Ireland
at Westminster by angrily denouncing an idea floated by Labour that
responsibility for the province should be shared between London and Dublin.
He cheered Unionist MPs by saying Conservatives stood 'four square' behind
the union with Britain. But the prime minster's comments infuriated
nationalist MPs and could set back still further the chances of round-table
talks on Northern Ireland resuming this year.
Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
said Mr Major was 'playing politics' while lives were being lost.
Last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, wrote to Mr John
Smith, Labour leader, asking for clarification of Labour's Ulster policy.
Earlier Sir Patrick said uncertainty about Northern Ireland's constitutional
status 'must make the task of the security forces harder.'
The government has in the past tried to act as a neutral 'facilitator' in
negotiations and has enjoyed backing from Labour for its efforts. It has
said Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK as long as a majority of
the population want that.
But Mr Major firmly rejected 'shared responsibility' which, he said, would
have to be imposed against the wishes the province's population.
Separately, Sir Patrick provided further encouragement for Unionist MPs,
telling the Commons that round-table talks could replace the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement with a pact that included a 'unambiguous statement' on
the future of Northern Ireland.
Mr Major's comments put the Labour leadership on the defensive. A spokesman
said the document prepared for Mr Kevin McNamara, Northern Ireland
spokesman, was 'invalid' as a policy paper - although he did not deny
proposals for 'responsibility sharing' were under consideration.
Mr McNamara later made clear that Labour was sticking to its 1992 manifesto
of unification by consent.
But he believes that, in the absence of agreement between local Unionist and
nationalist politicians, London and Dublin would have a duty to set up new
political institutions to replace 'direct rule' from Westminster. A
discussion paper is expected in October.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Intelligence claims fuel furore
over Nadir - Row over funding heightened after release of documents showing
former minister's collusion allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAIMS THAT intelligence services were involved in a plot to undermine Mr
Asil Nadir and help destroy the economy of northern Cyprus yesterday fuelled
the furore at Westminster over the treatment of the fugitive businessman.
Detailed allegations and answers in the 48 pages of papers published by Sir
Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, again raised the temperature at
Westminster over the activities of the Serious Fraud Office.
The row also spilled into renewed efforts by Labour to turn the focus back
on to politically embarrassing donations to the Conservative party.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday attempted to heighten the
funding controversy by demanding that the Tories returned Pounds 1m which he
claimed had been donated to the party by Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman of
Nissan UK.
Mr Botnar has been accused by the Inland Revenue in court of being the prime
mover behind Britain's largest-ever tax fraud.
The most serious claim by Mr Michael Mates, the former northern Ireland
minister, was raised in a meeting last December, when he told Sir Nicholas
that he believed there might be 'strong political pressure for Mr Nadir to
be convicted in order to provide a solution to the problem of northern
Cyprus'.
Just over three months later he telephoned the attorney-general's office to
report that BBC television's Panorama was planning a programme alleging a
conspiracy involving the Cypriot, British and US intelligence services. The
intention was to bring about Mr Nadir's downfall.
Downing Street yesterday called the suggestion 'rubbish'.
One of the more extraordinary revelations contained in the documentation
concerns details of a meeting held in September 1990 at the London offices
of Vizards, solicitors representing Mr Nadir, at which Mr Michael Allcock,
the suspended head of the Inland Revenue's section dealing with high-profile
tax investigations, described the earlier SFO raid on a property management
company run by Mr Nadir as 'a monumental disaster caused by the SFO'.
At Westminster there remained more general concern about the behaviour of
the SFO, with MPs clearly still not satisfied that it did not give the media
advance information about arrests. Sir Nicholas was said to have raised the
matter again with Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, who was
expected to issue a further reminder that such behaviour was reprehensible.
Mr Mates yesterday welcomed this move, but renewed his demand for an
independent inquiry.
At question time in the Commons Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, challenged
Mr John Major to commit the Tory party to returning donations from Mr
Botnar.
Mr Major said that he hoped Mr Smith would accept that 'where tainted money
has been provided to the Conservative Party, we will replace it'.
But Labour seized on his inability to tell MPs whether Mr Botnar had given
money to the Conservative party. 'Everyone is saying, including Mr Botnar,
that he gave the Tory party Pounds 1m,' Mr Smith said later. 'Surely the
prime minster has a duty to return this money to the Inland Revenue.'

FT  02 JUL 93 / Project to tackle poor literacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN against poor literacy among school-leavers was launched
yesterday. It came after complaints about school-leavers from the Dixons and
John Lewis Partnership retail chains.
John Lewis complained in a letter to the Industry in Education group which
was copied to Mr John Patten, the education secretary, that some
school-leavers were 'poorly prepared and not creating a good impression'.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, endorsed the contents of the letter,
but said his store did not discriminate against 16-year-olds in recruitment.
'But a lot of them do not have the skills for applying for a job, and have
not been shown by their careers officers how to fill out a CV,' he added.
He said an analysis of staff productivity had encouraged the company to
concentrate more on recruiting older people with more of the skills and
experience needed in dealing with the public.
The aim of the National Literacy Association campaign, which has cross-party
and union support, is to adopt the target that by 1999 99 per cent of
children should leave school with adequate literacy for living and working.
The campaign will concentrate on six points:
Adopting the 99 per cent figure as a fixed national target.
Providing volunteers in playgroups, libraries and nurseries to help parents
who cannot read to their children.
Increasing promotion of the use of children's libraries and wider
distribution of books to homes and schools.
Aiding parents who are illiterate with a national programme of meeting
parents outside schools.
Introducing a national programme for teachers of initial and in-service
training in reading, writing and literacy.
Expanding reading recovery programmes, in which young children with
difficulties are identified in the classroom and given intensive tutoring.

FT  02 JUL 93 / British companies 'take longer to pay debts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES take significantly longer to pay their debts than their
European competitors, says a survey by Intrum Justitia, the continent's
largest debt collection company.
Companies are paid on average 53 days after invoicing on domestic debts and
74 days later on exports, compared with average contracts for payment of 29
days and 50 days respectively.
The survey, which questioned 1,782 companies employing 408,000 people,
highlights widespread difficulties of late debt payments.
British companies said late payment caused liquidity problems, loss of
profit and higher interest costs.
Across Europe, payments are made on average 15 days late for domestic trade
and 16 days late for export trade. That compares with average agreed credit
terms of 36 days and 40 days respectively.
Nearly 60 per cent of companies said payment habits had deteriorated in the
past year, with greatest difficulties in Germany and Switzerland.
Other countries with longer overdue payment periods include Belgium, the
Netherlands, Italy and France.
The survey says the UK is the worst, with the lowest level of legislation
and no right to interest on overdue amounts.
The UK government is considering measures on late payment, including
disclosure of speed of payment in company annual reports.
The EC is considering a directive on the subject.
Credit terms vary widely, with Italy providing long agreed terms of 60 days
on average and France 66 days.
Few companies check the creditworthiness of clients after they have started
trading with them.

FT  02 JUL 93 / City gives cautious nod to Taurus replacement: Bank of
England outlines simpler system for Stock Exchange business in wake of
earlier disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR an electronic settlement system to replace the failed Taurus
project received a cautious cheer from the City yesterday.
Institutional fund managers, brokers and custodians said they generally
welcomed the plans to move as quickly as possible to a speedier form of
settlement and gave a thumbs-up to the significantly less ambitious outline
of the new settlements project.
The costly failure of the Stock Exchange's Taurus project is widely seen as
the result of an excessively complex system being devised in an effort to
satisfy too many competing commercial interests.
Mr Richard Weir, director-general of the Institutional Fund Managers
Association, a trade group of leading investors, said: 'We are very pleased
because they seem to have met our greatest concerns - speed of settlement
and sponsorship by the Bank of England.'
Mr Weir said the fact that the Bank would play a guiding role in setting
specifications for the new system and could possibly operate it, at least
initially, 'should restore confidence in the City of London.'
Elements of the task force's plans, however, are causing consternation among
some City practitioners. Mr Stuart Valentine, director of research at
ProShare, an organisation promoting individual share ownership, said there
was concern about pressures to push private clients into registering the
ownership of their shares in the names of nominees. The task force said this
might be necessary to allow private clients to enjoy the benefits of a
shortened settlement period.
Mr Valentine acknowledged that some private investors benefited from the
inefficiencies a 14-day settlement period offersed. 'There is no question
that some investors exploit the account settlement period.' The change might
reduce private investor activity, he said.
Some custodians expressed concern at the ability of the system to adapt to
five-day rolling settlement in a system still requiring bits of paper to be
transmitted to various institutions.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Patten lists tight curbs for student unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, announced yesterday that student
unions are to be made voluntary organisations. They will be barred from
using public funds for political campaigning.
Proposals he intends to include in an education bill in the next session of
parliament would limit public funding to a small group of core activities.
Fees to affiliate to political organisations, including the National Union
of Students, would not be paid by the state. Unions would have to ask
students to opt into them by paying individual fees.
Mr Patten said: 'Student unions should be more accountable and fully
representative. We shall therefore provide for institutions to develop and
implement codes of practice governing the conduct and behaviour of their
campus unions.
'Our intention is not to impede students' activities. It is to limit the
purposes for which stud-ent unions can spend public money.'
Dr David Harrison of Exeter University, who chairs the Committee of
Vice-chancellors and Principals, said the proposals were 'a steam hammer to
crack a nut'.
He attacked the decision to limit students' unions to a specific list of
activities. He said: 'The CVCP has told ministers that it is extremely
difficult to define core activities in this way. It is very curious that the
government's list does not include academic, artistic and cultural
activities, but does include sports and catering.'
Dr Harrison also criticised the three-month consultation period, which
starts just as university terms are ending, and will end when students start
to return in October.
Ms Lorna Fitzsimons, president of the National Union of Students, agreed
with Dr Harrison. She said: 'It's a very expensive bone for Mr Patten to
toss to the right wing and save his popularity.'
The students' union at the London School of Economics also attacked the
proposals. An official said it might prevent unions from taking part in
'such vital areas as rag charity fund-raising'. It would also put an end to
the LSE union's policy of paying for scholarships for those in need.

FT  02 JUL 93 / ITV may take legal action to change timing of News At Ten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies have not yet ruled out a legal challenge to the insistence
of the Independent Television Commission that News At Ten has to stay in its
traditional time slot.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV companies, told the Commons national
heritage committee yesterday that ITV had obtained a legal opinion which
disagreed with the ITC's interpretation of the law.
On Wednesday the commission wrote to all ITV chairmen warning that the
companies would be in breach of their licences if the programme was moved
without permission.
Mr Dyke told the committee: 'We will not rush off to law. We will not rush
into a decision.' It is clear, however, that challenging the ITC's
interpretation of the law will be one of the options at Monday's meeting of
the ITV council, when the News At Ten issue is discussed.
Mr Dyke, who is also chief executive of London Weekend Television, told MPs
he did not believe his company was commited to running News at Ten in its
present slot. The commitment, he believed, was to run a main news in prime
time, which the ITC has defined as 6.30pm to 10.30pm.
Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Network Centre, set out the
commercial case for moving News At Ten.
At 10pm, Mr Quinn said, BBC, Channel 4 and BSkyB were eating into ITV
ratings. In May an ITV audience share of 46 per cent at 9pm fell to 35 per
cent at 10pm - and the audience was older and less up-market.
Mr Quinn added that advertisers were prepared to pay a premium of up to 100
per cent to advertise in programmes such as Inspector Morse instead of News
At Ten.
The audience for News At Ten is volatile - in the week ending June 6 the
audience ranged from 9.8m to 3.7m when scheduled against the BBC's 999.
Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central, told MPs that this year ITV would pay
the government a total of Pounds 367m. Under the old levy system the total
would have been Pounds 150m.
On the News At Ten issue, MPs expressed surprise that ITV was trying to make
such a fundamental change only six months into new franchises.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Settlement time to decrease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England-sponsored task force on securities settlement in London
has outlined a slimmed-down version of the overly ambitious plans contained
in the Stock Exchange's ill-fated Taurus project.
At the heart of the new plan is an electronic settlements system, likely to
be run initially under the auspices of the Bank of England, but conceivably
contracted out to a commercial supplier. The Stock Exchange is unlikely to
have a further role in the settlement of securities transactions.
Settlement is the completion of a transaction after the delivery of
securities to the buyer and the delivery of payment to the seller has been
achieved, along with the transfer of title of the securities.
Britain's two-week settlement period is far longer than that of other main
markets and regulators are concerned about the risks that poses. Should
either party fail, losses to other market participants with unsettled trades
could pose a risk to everyone.
Key elements of the plan are: By July 1994 the Stock Exchange's Talisman
system will be adapted to accommodate 10-day 'rolling' settlement.
By January 1995 the system will be able to accommodate five-day rolling
settlement, although private investors will be free to negotiate a different
settlement period with their broker if they wish.
The move to five-day rolling settlement is likely to force private investors
to place their stock in the nominee name of their broker - a move many are
likely to resist.
A new system to replace Talisman will be set up and carry the acronym Crest.
It is not expected to be operational until 1996 and will be a transfer
mechanism for equity trades allowing those holding stock within the system
to electronically receive stock and receive payment.
The system will eventually be capable of settling transactions on the same
day that bargains are struck.
Participants will have the option of 'dematerialisation' - receiving
notification of ownership by computer only - or may receive certificates if
they wish.
Membership in Crest will be optional but those wishing to join will have to
meet specific criteria. This especially applies to registrars who maintain
records of share ownership - some of whom may have to upgrade their systems
significantly to accommodate the faster settlement times.
Membership will be open to institutional investors, stock brokers,
registrars and custodians.
Crest will also have the capacity to handle most so-called 'stock events'
such as dividends, announcements of rights issues and proxy voting in
conjunction with registrars.
It is recommended that a bank acting for Crest, likely to be the Bank of
England, could be at the centre of the payments system and have real-time
accounts for each of the settlement banks.
Participants would have to have accounts at one of the settlement banks. The
Bank of England intends to admit as settlement banks only those which are
currently now part of the Clearing House Automated Payments System.

FT  02 JUL 93 / BBC expected to announce doubling of operating surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is in a stronger financial position than widely reported. The
1992-93 annual report, to be published at the end of this month, is expected
to show a doubled operating surplus.
Last year the corporation had an operating surplus of about Pounds 30m.
Potential overspends on programme making of Pounds 15.9m in 1992-93 and
Pounds 38m in the previous year have been compensated for by savings in the
overall budget.
The BBC is, however, still in deficit because of the cost of a planned
restructuring programme. The four-year programme - which has one more year
to run - and its associated redundancy payments are costing the BBC a total
of Pounds 215m.
The corporation, which has licence fee income of about Pounds 1.4bn a year,
has managed to remain within its borrowing limits of Pounds 200m.
Mr Rodney Baker-Bates, the new finance director of the BBC who is former
group finance director of Midland Bank, has asked for further cuts in
corporation overheads to put more money into programmes.
Mr Baker-Bates is looking for a 10 per cent cut in the 1994-95 financial
year in the budget of the BBC's central administration, which accounts for
about 7 per cent of total BBC expenditure.
A budget cut of 3 per cent is being levied on the rest of the BBC. As a
result an estimated extra Pounds 50m is expected to be directed into
programme making.
Mr Barker-Bates plans to issue budgetary guidelines covering the period up
to the end of 1996 - when the BBC royal charter runs out.
The government has commissioned consultants from Touche Ross to check on BBC
efforts to become more efficient.
The Touche Ross report is expected to inform government decisions on the
licence fee until the end of the charter period. The BBC hopes that the
licence fee will continue to be linked to retail prices.
'I think the BBC has a good story to tell and we can defend our corner,'
said Mr Baker-Bates.

FT  02 JUL 93 / BBC Enterprises doubles its profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES ARISING from programmes such as Michael Palin's Pole To Pole and Noddy
helped BBC Enterprises double its profits last year, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Before tax and interest Enterprises made Pounds 11.8m in the year to April.
It made Pounds 5.6m in the previous year.
The commercial wing of the BBC was able to contribute Pounds 60m during the
year - Pounds 7m more than last time - to the making of new television and
radio programmes. This amounts to almost Pounds 3 for every licence payer.
Mr James Arnold-Baker, chief executive of Enterprises, said yesterday:
'Although the recession continued longer and deeper than predicted, BBC
Enterprises had some outstanding hits during the year.'
Pole to Pole, the story of Michael Palin's journey from the North to the
South Pole, was seen in more than 20 countries. The hardback book of the
series has sold 500,000 copies and the video helped make BBC Video the top
video label in the UK.
'In all areas of our business we have built on the reputation of BBC
programmes to develop multi-media marketing opportunities,' Mr Arnold-Baker
said.
In children's programmes Noddy also had the multi-media treatment with the
animated series being backed up by a range of books, video and audio tapes,
a fortnightly magazine and a range of licensed toys.
All the proceeds of Enterprises go back into BBC programme making.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Export bankers settle interest-rate row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG-STANDING row between the government and British export bankers was
defused yesterday.
The row has concerned proposed cuts in the interest support intended to
compensate export bankers for the cost of arranging financing packages for
overseas projects.
The banks are to receive reduced support, but believe higher levels of
export activity will make up for the loss.
News of a deal came in an answer to a parliamentary question by Mr Richard
Needham, minister for trade.
At issue have been proposed cuts in the margins of fixed- rate export
finance - called Frefs by bankers. These were cut sharply five years ago in
the wake of criticisms by the comptroller and auditor general that they were
not necessary to secure overseas contracts, and were not of benefit to the
economy.
As the government has pressed for further cuts as part of its spending cuts,
bankers have argued the last round of cuts had already prompted a steady
withdrawal of bank support for exporters. Also, large exporters have
expressed concern about the 'dwindling band' of banks able to support their
export efforts.
New Fref rates will range from just under 0.5 of a percentage point to 0.7,
depending on the life of a loan and the currency it is denominated in.
This amounts to a cut of just over  1/8 of a point, though bankers were
quick to point out yesterday that the lion's share of the cut had been made
possible at no cost to themselves because the government had abandoned a
1/8 of a point margin for potential mismatches between sterling, and loans
raised in foreign currencies.
Mr Philip Hills, managing director of Samuel Montagu Export and Project
Finance, said: 'We generally agree that we have a fair deal. There have been
some very good things the Department of Trade has been able to achieve in
terms of enhanced export credit cover, and adjustments to premium rates. The
banks took the view there would be higher volumes of business to compensate
for lower margins.'
The new five-year agreement is expected to start on Monday.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Council's computer dispute resolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COSTLY three-year legal dispute has been settled over the assets of a
council's privatised computer services business which went into liquidation.
Former officials of the local authority subsequently faced fraud charges.
West Wiltshire district council, based in Trowbridge, privatised its
computer systems division in 1989 as West Wiltshire Information Systems, a
company run by Mr Gerald Garland, the council's former chief executive, and
other ex-council officials.
The council received no cash for the business, which was independently
valued at between Pounds 6m and Pounds 8m.
The new chief executive, Mr Don Latham, called in the district auditor who
produced highly critical reports which resulted, after legal advice, in the
council cancelling its own contract with the company and taking back the
business. The company went into liquidation in July 1990 and a police
investigation started.
The subsequent dispute has been between the council and the liquidator, Mr
Robert Buller of Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, over the ownership of
soft-ware.
Under the terms of the settlement the council will retain those rights but
will make payments, plus interest, which will allow the claims of 35
creditors of the company who are owed more than Pounds 200,000 to be met in
full. Shareholders, who are principally the directors, will receive nothing.
Mr Latham said yesterday that the litigation had cost the council Pounds
750,000 but the council now had undisputed ownership of the business, which
made a surplus last year of Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Garland and seven others have been bailed to appear in court on fraud
charges in October.
The council also has a civil claim seeking to recover a total of Pounds
779,000 from seven of the defendants.

IN SPAIN, licensed vigilantes carrying revolvers are employed to guard some
retail chains. In the US stores display signs boasting their prices are low
not because they are such efficient retailers, but because 'we have theft
under control'.
The suggestion on Tuesday by Dixons chairman Mr Stanley Kalms that UK
retailers might have to adopt vigilante tactics and turn their stores into
'fortresses' to deal with a rising tide of crime may not have been welcomed
by all retailers. But its substance met with little disagreement.
The British Retail Consortium believes crime costs UK retailers at least
Pounds 2.5bn a year. The true figure may be much higher because many
retailers do not bother to report small crimes as there is little chance of
getting a conviction. Marks and Spencer, the UK's biggest clothing and food
retailer, says the problem is 'the equivalent of a Brink's Mat bullion
robbery every four days'.
M&amp;S says: 'Some people think retail crime is relatively insignificant
because it is seen as victimless. But it makes victims out of all of us
because we are paying for it every time we do our shopping.' The company
says customers are paying up to 1p out of every Pounds 1 to cover the costs
of crime.
Mr Kalms focused on the problem of organised crime, describing how
'alternative entrepreneurs' robbed shops, often through ramraiding, then
sold the goods through an elaborate network of 'squatter stores' and
car-boot sales.
But shops suffer from a range of problems, from petty pilfering - sometimes
by their own staff - and casual shoplifting, to attacks on staff and,
increasingly, armed robbery. Credit-card and cheque fraud are also thought
to cost retailers up to Pounds 300m a year.
A survey in 1991 by Touche Ross, the management consultancy, found retailers
spending an average of 0.3 per cent of turnover on security measures. For
large retailers with turnovers of billions of pounds that represents tens of
millions of pounds of investment in security. It also found that stores were
increasingly investing in sophisticated computer systems, video equipment
and alarms rather than relying on store detectives.
Mr Kalms said crime and investment in measures to prevent it were costing
Dixons Pounds 20m a year. M&amp;S says it is losing Pounds 30m a year through
crime, and spending Pounds 21m on combating it.
The subject is a sensitive one, some retailers being wary of creating too
much of a fuss, or making their security measures too visible, for fear of
intimidating shoppers.
M&amp;S, however, says its own research suggests shoppers are reassured by
visible security measures such as cameras and guards.
It may have been frustration at the unwillingness of many retailers to talk
openly about the problem that prompted Mr Kalms to speak out. But some
believe he has gone too far.
Mr Frank Pegg of Volumatic Systems, a manufacturer of security devices with
30 years' experience of advising retailers, says: 'Things are getting worse
in the retail trade, and we all appreciate that today's crime is tomorrow's
price rise, but I don't think what Mr Kalms said was helpful. To say British
shopkeepers are being forced to adopt vigilante tactics is a bit much, and
may put off shoppers.'
One large store chain suggests Mr Kalms has 'overstated the case'. Retailers
also feel he is wrong to criticise the police.
Certainly, his remarks did not go down well with the Metropolitan Police,
who described his jibe that the police were little more than a
data-collection agency as 'absolute nonsense'.
Most retailers say they do not agree with his vision of 'vigilantes'
patrollingshops and shopping centres.
Mr William Hucklesby, head of group security at Sears, and chairman of the
security committee of the Oxford Street Association, says it is 'vital that
retailers should work in partnership with the police'. He agrees that the
police need more resources. Action is being taken at an industry level to
deal with the problem.
The British Retail Consortium has launched a special initiative on crime
following a meeting of retailers in January with Mr Ian Jack, Home Office
minister.
The meeting agreed to fund jointly a director for the initiative - recently
named as Mr John Burrows, a partner in Morgan Harris Burrows, a consultancy
specialising in crime risk management, and a former security adviser to
Dixons. The initiative plans to develop a database on the extent of retail
crime, something on which neither the Home Office nor the police now has
reliable information.
By monitoring the success of the initiative, it hopes to produce
recommendations on best practice for consortium members. The security
industry, meanwhile, is developing ever more sophisticated methods of
dealing with retail crime, and has seen a big increase in its business.
The British Security Industry Association says total turnover of member
companies grew from Pounds 1.1bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.4bn in 1992. Spending
on closed-circuit television equipment rose from Pounds 37m to Pounds 64m.
In addition to physical barriers such as laminated glass, reinforced
shutters and car-traps to deter ramraiding and smash-and-grab raids, stores
can choose from a range of in-store technology.
Modern closed-circuit television systems can produce a high-definition image
of suspect shoppers even at considerable distances.
Radio-based product tags which activate alarms at shop exits have long been
common in the fashion business, but are increasingly being replaced by
electromagnetic tabs which can be incorporated into bar codes on even the
smallest items and deactivated when the item is scanned at the check-out.
But Mr Grenville Peacock, chief executive of the Bentalls department store
chain in south-east England, warns that tagging can be of little use against
the hardened criminals who now attack shops.
'Shop crime is becoming much more blatant, much more open, much more daring.
It's difficult to deal with because you are exposing your people to being
thumped - or worse.'

FT  02 JUL 93 / Seven shops - three raids a week: And teenage black
marketeers send 7-year-olds in to shoplift for them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE MAN who has no hesitation in supporting the views of Mr Stanley Kalms is
Mr Leo Gillen, Hartlepool's largest independent newsagent. He has seven
shops in the town and they are the target for an average of three attempted
break-ins every week.
'What he's saying is basically right,' says Mr Gillen. 'The government is
not addressing the issue of law and order properly. Retailers are having to
fight crime themselves.'
Security devices at Mr Gillen's shops, which stock a range of goods, consume
10 per cent of his net profit.
All have steel doors and shutters with security locks and anti-ramraid
bollards in front. They also have dedicated phone lines to a burglar alarm
company - alarm bells proved useless when the thieves put them out of action
by swamping them with foam.
Most of the shops have closed-circuit television and all have vigilant
staff. But they still suffer from organised thieving, especially of tights,
hair mousse, coffee, tinned tuna, salmon and bacon. A black market exists
for these products. The hair products are sold to small hairdressers, says
Mr Gillen, and the other items are sold door-to-door. 'You have youths of 17
and 18 who send children of seven or eight into the shops to steal because
nothing happens to them. It's a real problem.'
The problems, which Mr Gillen has noticed accelerating in the past five to
six years, extend to harassment of employees. 'You get children throwing
stones at the staff and abusing them,' he says.
Three weeks ago an employee quit because of problems with youths. Only this
week two teenagers in balaclavas, carrying water pistols, walked into two of
Mr Gillen's shops. 'We didn't know whether it was an attempted raid or a
joke,' he says. In one incident youths pulled down and locked the security
shutters of one shop, trapping the staff inside.
Mr Gillen also owns a pub and fish-and-chip shop in Hartlepool. His annual
turnover totals Pounds 5.5m.
He is chairman of the Owton Manor police steering committee, a community
consultation panel on one of Hartlepool's hard-up estates. The committee has
helped, he says, but the problem goes deeper than anything police or
magistrates can solve.
'I feel there are too many people cast out of society with the high
unemployment figures,' he says. In Hartlepool, for a long time one of
Britain's unemployment blackspots, many 15-year-olds have grown up in
families where nobody works, he says.
This breeds a lack of aspiration. 'When you have people running around
lawless they have no comprehension of moral law.'

FT  02 JUL 93 / BMA votes out moderate leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR JEREMY Lee-Potter, the moderate leader of the British Medical Association
who re-established relationships with the government after confrontation
over the National Health Service reforms, yesterday lost his post as
chairman of the BMA council.
He fell to a challenge to his leadership by 36 votes to 17 at a council
meeting at the end of the BMA conference in Torquay. His successor is Dr
Alexander Macara, 61, a Bristol University consultant lecturer in public
health medicine and former chairman of the BMA medical ethics committee.
Dr Lee-Potter became chairman three years ago at a time of open hostility
between the BMA and government. He accepted the reality of health reforms
and returned the association to dialogue with the government.
His conciliatory stance never found favour with sections of the BMA. As the
conference made clear, many doctors continue to believe that government
reforms are undermining the principles of the NHS and aggravating funding
problems.
Dr Macara, who wants an early meeting with health secretary Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, denied he would be more confrontational but added there would be
a change of style.
He said: 'I fear that the secretary of state gets false reassurances from
her courtiers who tell her what she wants to hear. We have to have
consistent and vigorous proposals to persuade her to re-examine the evidence
for change.'

FT  02 JUL 93 / Government sells property concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of part of the Property Services Agency, which manages the
government's property estate, was announced yesterday.
The government has sold two of the agency's five building-management
businesses to a joint venture between Amec, the contractor, and Pell
Frischmann, an engineering and project-management consultancy. The sale
figure was a net Pounds 11.4m over the next four years.
The joint venture has bought the BM South East and BM South &amp; West
businesses. The government has guaranteed work worth Pounds 400m during the
next five years.
The Department of the Environment said it would meet the cost of
redundancies over the next five years, up to an agreed figure. Many of the
3,300 staff are expected to seek redundancy although Amec said it would seek
to persuade the entire staff to transfer to the new company.
The sale of the remaining three building-management businesses is expected
within the next few weeks.
Their sale will complete the privatisation of the Property Services Agency.
The sell-off began last year with the sale of its project division to
Tarmac, the construction and building materials group.
Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of Speyhawk, the property company which went
into receivership in May, will be chairman of the joint venture.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Foreign investors prefer Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK continues to account for about a third of inward investment into
European Community countries although the number of projects involved has
fallen for the second year running.
Government figures published yesterday show overseas investors sanctioned
303 new capital expenditure projects last year, creating or safeguarding
more than 56,000 jobs - 5,000 more than in the previous year.
The biggest inward investor into the UK last year was the US, with 126
projects involving new investment, expansion or acquisition. Germany was
second, followed by Japan and Switzerland.
The Invest in Britain Bureau, part of the Department of Trade and Industry,
said it could not place a value on 1992 inward investment because some
companies had not disclosed details. New capital investment in the previous
year was estimated at Pounds 1.3bn.
The peak year for inward investment into the UK was 1990, when 350 projects
were started, with the total falling to 332 in 1991. It is thought, however,
that the UK is still taking about one third of EC inward investment.
Announcing details, Baroness Denton, small firms minister, said the UK was
maintaining its position as the preferred investment location in Europe for
companies based outside the EC. Many of them were making an increasingly
important contribution to UK exporting efforts.
She said that in spite of rising competition in the EC to attract inward
investors Britain remained the 'number one choice' for US and Japanese
investors.
The minister said that the UK had 'stolen a march' on France and Germany,
which had initially discouraged foreign investment.
US and Japanese companies are making about 40 per cent of all EC-based
investment in the UK, with the electronics and automotive sectors among the
most active. Regional selective assistance of Pounds 103m was made available
to inward-investing companies in 1992.
The bureau calculates that although overseas companies investing in the UK
still represent only 1 per cent of UK business, they account for 16 per cent
of UK manufacturing jobs, 22 per cent of net output and 27 per cent of net
capital expenditure.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday announced an Pounds 8.25m regional
selective assistance grant to Europa Magnetic Corporation of Taiwan, which
is to locate its European headquarters at Cramlington in Northumberland. The
floppy disk assembly operation, to serve European and US markets, will
create 550 jobs.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Stronger pound may have the shine taken off it / Assessing
why sterling has been climbing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pound is no longer the sickly weakling of nine months ago. But talk of
it entering a new phase of upswing against other important currencies is
probably overdone.
Helped by the Bundesbank's cut in interest rates and a Treasury statement
signalling no immediate easing in UK monetary policy, the pound yesterday
consolidated its recent good run against the D-Mark.
Last night sterling closed in London up 1 3/4 pfennigs on the day at
DM2.5625, its highest level since last September's devaluation.
Because of a less robust performance against other currencies, notably the
dollar and yen, the pound has looked slightly less perky when measured by
the Bank of England's trade-weighted index.
It closed last night on this index at 80.9, slightly below its best level
this year about two months ago, but comfortably up on its historic low of
75.7 in February.
An important aspect which will almost certainly restrain the pound's rise is
that any further strengthening would go down badly with manufacturers. They
are flavour of the month at the Treasury in the light of comments by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that he wants to make the department more
sympathetic to industry.
Echoing the concerns of big manufacturers that any new increase in the
pound's value would reduce the competitiveness of UK goods and choke off
encouraging signs of export growth, Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the
Engineering Employers' Federation, said he 'views with concern' the general
drift upward by sterling.
As a result of such sentiments and acting in concert with the Treasury, the
Bank of England has in recent weeks discreetly sold sterling both to reduce
its value and boost its heavily depleted foreign currency reserves.
But sterling's upward movement has been unmistakable. The reasons include:
Better growth prospects this year for Britain than for most European
countries.
Strong buying by Japanese institutional investors, many of which, especially
given the high recent value of the yen, view the pound as cheap.
The weakness of the D-Mark, resulting from concern about the fragile state
of the German economy and speculation about cuts in German interest rates -
duly served up yesterday.
Heavy purchases in the past month by overseas institutions of gilt-edged
securities which, notwithstanding the relative lack of success of this
week's big gilts auction, have helped to push up the pound.
Mr Clarke's ruling out of cuts in base rates in the near term unless the
economy shows a sudden slide.
Many City economists believe sterling is unlikely to rise above DM2.6 by the
end of the summer.
Also the pound may find it hard to sustain its rise yesterday against the
dollar, which was sparked mainly by a US report indicating doubts about the
strength of US industrial growth. Sterling was quoted last night in London
at Dollars 1.5085, up 1 1/2 cents.
Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank in London, said there were
still 'some pitfalls' ahead for the UK economy which might constrain
sterling. He was sceptical about the note of euphoria which has crept into
discussion about the pound, pointing out that growth in consumer spending
might be extremely fragile.
Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, said Mr
Clarke might ease monetary policy if sterling's growth made life more
difficult for manufacturers. 'The perception that Mr Clarke is more growth
orientated than his predecessor has boosted market feeling that interest
rates might be cut if sterling surged.'
Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the weakness of
the D-Mark might soon pass. Any strengthening in the German currency would
take some of the shine off sterling.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Square Mile gets a ring of confidence: But terrorism experts
warn that a cordon couldlead to a false sense of security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE plans for a checkpoint cordon around London's Square Mile will be a
welcome boost for the City's confidence, business and banking institutions
in London said yesterday.
But security experts yesterday warned that the scheme could create a false
sense of security - and small businesses servicing the City predicted
soaring traffic congestion.
Judging from the experience of security checkpoints in Belfast, most
security analysts accepted that the scheme, although low key, should be a
powerful deterrent to terrorist vehicle attacks.
'Terrorists don't like being caught,' said Professor Paul Wilkinson of St
Andrews University, an expert on international terrorism. 'The very fact
that there is a chance that they will be stopped will make them think twice
about the risk.'
But amid police calls for businesses to step up their own security checks,
he warned that experience in Northern Ireland suggested terrorists were
likely to respond to the new threat by moving their targets.
'Obviously the City remains the most attractive target. But terrorists could
switch out to the suburbs or to other cities, and we can't set up
checkpoints in all the cities,' he added, stressing that the only way of
beating terrorists in the long term was through improved intelligence.
Although the police plans for new X-ray vehicle search machines and
electronic sniffer devices were considered technologically feasible,
analysts warned that they were still not entirely reliable.
Mr John Wyatt, security expert at Search Training International, said: 'This
will probably serve to screen out the big vehicle bombs. But it's not going
to stop the small bombs in the bins or even on motorcycle panniers -
although those will never cause nearly as much devastation.'
Business leaders, who have been warning that without tighter security
measures London's reputation as a financial centre could suffer, yesterday
said that they did not expect the low-key scheme to present many problems.
However, small businesses servicing the City yesterday warned that if, as
suggested, the checkpoints carried out regular searches of commercial
vehicles and closed vans, it could hit their trade hard.
Mr Andrew Conroy, a truck driver with Harvey's Office Furniture company
which provides the City with office furniture, said: 'It's bloody
ridiculous. It can't last. If you've got 200 filing cabinets in the back of
your lorry it will take hours for the police to search it.'
Mrs Denise Jenkins, who tends office plants in the City, said: 'It will all
take much more time and that will cost money. Of course it will make
business harder.'
With more than 90 per cent of London's business community using public
transport to commute to the City, many regular workers also backed the
measures. 'I'm all for it,' said Mr Paul Blackman, a money market dealer
with the Sumitomo Bank, who travels into the City by train.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Biggest union has easy birth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S newest and biggest union - Unison - was yesterday formally
launched through a merger of the Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse public-service
unions. The new organisation will represent more than half the employees in
the National Health Service.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, former head of Nalgo, is the overall chief with Mr Rodney
Bickerstaffe, former head of Nupe, and Mr Hector MacKenzie, former head of
Cohse, as the two associate general secretaries.
The 1.4m-strong union has a combined subscription income of more than Pounds
100m. In contrast to some recent mergers, the arrival of Unison has been
meticulously prepared.
Welding together the three has caused some unavoidable friction in the
distribution of top jobs. For example, Cohse, the smallest of the three
unions, has won only one regional secretary post compared with seven for
Nalgo and five for Nupe.
But the biggest question marks hang over the economics of the merger and the
role of women in the new union. When the Unison idea was launched more than
two years ago one of the selling points was that women, who make up 1m of
the membership, would dominate the executive with 44 positions reserved out
of 67. Yet the most senior women in the new union come some way down in the
pecking order.
Under the male triumvirate at the top come three male deputy general
secretaries. Mr Colm O'Kane of Cohse will be in charge of finance and
administration, Mr Tom Sawyer of Nupe will head development and services,
and Mr Dave Prentis of Nalgo will be the bargaining chief.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Formation of 'incorporated Names' begins

<TEXT>
A Pounds 200m-Pounds 300m investment company that could develop the first
'incorporated Names' at Lloyd's is to be launched by Sedgwick, the insurance
broker, in the autumn. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities house,
announced yesterday that it was to advise Sedgwick on the formation of the
company.
BZW will work on the project with CLM, a Sedgwick subsidiary formed earlier
this year, and aims to launch the investment company in the autumn in time
to participate at the market next year.
The new company will participate in Lloyd's through a group of subsidiaries,
each of which would function as an 'incorporated Name', backing a number of
underwriting syndicates. BZW will market the company among both institutions
and individual investors. It intends to seek a listing on the London Stock
Exchange.
The announcement of BZW's backing for the project represents an important
fillip for Lloyd's, which yesterday announced that it was confident that the
regulatory hurdles preventing the entry of corporate capital to the market
would be overcome.
Lloyd's announced in its business plan that it intended to persuade
corporate investors to join the market in April, following the erosion of
its capital base in recent years.
The new document provides details not included in the business plan. For
example, Lloyd's aims to limit the amount that an incorporated Name can
invest on any one syndicate to 20 per cent of the syndicate's capacity (the
amount of premium it is allowed to underwrite) while in the aggregate,
incorporated Names will be allowed to provide no more than half of a
syndicate's overall capacity.
However, there are indications that Lloyd's, which last week posted a record
loss of Pounds 2.91bn for 1990, has some way to go before it can convince
existing Names to fully support its plans.
Many Names attending the annual meeting of the Association of Lloyd's
Members, the largest organisation of Names, believed that they were being
discriminated against in favour of corporate investors. Mr Larry Scott, of
Grimston Scott, a firm of Lloyd's advisers, said: 'There is enormous
suspicion of corporate capital.' He said many Names were going through a
crash course learning about Lloyd's business.
There are indications that publicity linked to the mounting legal disputes
involving Names has been hampering the efforts of financiers working on
corporate capital schemes.
Although bankers involved in a number of corporate capital schemes are
bullish about the prospects for profits as a result of rising insurance
rates, they say that some possible investors have been put off by adverse
publicity linked to the legal actions.

THE European Community's long-delayed eco-labelling scheme was launched
yesterday for washing machines and dishwashers.
The scheme will award labels to products which satisfy environmental
criteria devised in Brussels, and is intended to help consumers identify
products which are least harmful to the environment. It relies on
manufacturers voluntarily submitting their products to be assessed.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Marine pollution inquiry ends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Donaldson inquiry into marine pollution ended yesterday after nine weeks
of taking evidence in London.
The inquiry followed the Braer oil tanker disaster off Shetland this year.
The report and recommendations of Lord Donaldson, former Master of the
Rolls, are not expected to be published until early next year.
He is likely to call for more action by the government to protect coastlines
while urging stricter checks on how ships dispose of their waste. He is also
likely to question the cost-effectiveness of aerial spraying of oil spills
and may recommend that the government spend more on research into oil
clean-up technology.
Lord Donaldson is almost certain to recommend that Whitehall should consider
contributing to a network of strategically located tugs to help ships facing
emergencies.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Move on train fares defeated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to put tight obligations on private rail operators to continue
concessionary fare schemes was defeated by the government last night.
The Lords voted by 81 to 51 during the Railways Bill's committee stage to
reject an opposition amendment which would have made the secretary of state
for transport, before appointing the railway franchising director, publish
rules detailing a full range of concessionary fares.
Lord Clinton-Davis, for Labour, said ministers had argued that innovatory
marketing operations such as the issuing of railcards would continue after
privatisation because operators would find it in their commercial interests.
But one operator would be unlikely to accept another's railcard, he warned.
The Earl of Caithness, transport minister, said a new clause, foreshadowed
during the Commons report stage, would deal with the concerns. He said fears
that existing network benefits would disappear were 'misplaced'.

DELEGATES at the RMT rail union's annual conference yesterday voted
unanimously to ballot the union's membership on industrial action over rail
privatisation, Diane Summers writes.
Talks between the union and British Rail, focusing on pay and conditions,
will be held next month. The industrial action ballot is likely to be

warned.
BR said it would discuss with the union 'at every stage any changes that

FT  02 JUL 93 / Dozen directors earn Pounds 1m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MORE THAN 50 quoted companies at least one director earned Pounds 500,000
or more last year, while a dozen received Pounds 1m or just under.
The figures are revealed today in an analysis of company annual reports for
1992.
The median increase in the highest paid directors' earnings was 5.5 per
cent, says the survey by Monks Partnership, a pay research group.
At the same time, many top executives in the largest companies took an
earnings cut. In more than a quarter of companies with a turnover greater
than Pounds 50m, the highest paid directors' earnings were reduced. Overall
the rate of top earnings increases continued to fall.
Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt from Monks said it was important to view the
increases in context. 'Most companies reporting to November 1992 or later
will have set base earnings changes for their executives in October or
November 1991. At that time the underlying growth in average earnings was
7.25 per cent, so an increase of 5 per cent would be looked on as perfectly
fair and reasonable.'
Performance bonuses, as well as base pay, are included in the survey figures
 -not all companies currently separate the two in their annual reports.
Listed companies reporting on years ending after June 30 1993 will be
required to state the extent to which they have complied with the Cadbury
best-practice code.
One of the code's requirements is that 'separate figures should be given for
salary and performance-related elements and the basis on which performance
is measured should be explained'.
Monks said that, where companies now disclose the presence of incentive
plans, 'there appears to be a reasonable correlation between the payment of
an annual cash incentive and company results'.
Where it seemed there was a mismatch, it was often because of the payment of
longer-term incentives which were dependent on the achievement of pre-set
targets over three or more years, the company said. However, it added:
'There is no doubt that, in some cases, there is no discernible, or
declared, relationship between individual rewards and corporate
performance'.

FT  02 JUL 93 / 2.1 per cent pay rise in manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY RISES in manufacturing averaged 2.1 per cent in the three months to the
end of April - the lowest figure recorded by the Confederation of British
Industry since its pay databank started in 1977.
One in six companies reviewing pay between February and April introduced
freezes for six months or longer, and a further one in six reported freezes
lasting for six months, the CBI said.
Manufacturers are expecting productivity over the next 12 months to outstrip
pay settlements, the survey found.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said the expected reduction in unit
labour costs was 'very encouraging'.
Service sector settlements are also falling sharply, according to the CBI:
the average was 2.5 per cent, compared with 4.1 per cent in the same period
last year.

FT  02 JUL 93 / BZW to give advice on 'incorporated Name'
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd yesterday announced that it is to advise Sedgwick
Group, the insurance broker, on the formation of a Pounds 200m to Pounds
300m investment company. The company could be the first 'incorporated Name'
at Lloyd's.
At the same time, Lloyd's published a consultative document providing more
information on how new corporate investors will participate at the insurance
market.
BZW, the securities house, will work on the project with CLM, a Sedgwick
subsidiary formed earlier this year, and aims to launch the investment
company in the autumn in time to participate at the market next year.
The new company will participate in Lloyd's through a group of subsidiaries,

represents a group of badly hit Names, said: 'There is an awful lot of

corporate capital schemes.
Although bankers involved in a number of corporate capital schemes are

THE Department of Transport defended the practice of aerial spraying to
counter coastal oil pollution when the government's contingency plans came
under scrutiny at the Donaldson inquiry this week.
The hearing is looking at the wider implications of the Braer tanker
disaster off Shetland this year. There has been evidence that questions the
government's emergency strategy which relies on aerial spraying as the first
line of defence.
Questioned by Lord Donaldson, Mr Chris Harris, head of the Department of
Transport's Marine Pollution Control Unit, insisted there was international
agreement that chemical dispersants were an effective way of breaking up oil
spills.
The inquiry continues.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Recovery in west Midlands 'slows'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACE of recovery among west Midlands manufacturers and service companies
has slowed over the past three months, the latest survey of 580 companies by
the regional group of Chambers of Commerce shows, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The growth in orders reported by companies in the first quarter of the year
petered out between March and June, emphasising that the movement out of
recession remains tentative.
The survey, published today, shows that in June 32 per cent of manufacturing
companies had more domestic and export orders than three months before. Yet
this is scarcely changed from March when companies were reporting a marked
upturn in orders compared with last December.
The same trend is apparent with service companies, among which the
proportion working at full capacity dropped between March and June from 22
per cent to 17 per cent. Among manufacturers, 86 per cent of companies are
working at less than 80 per cent of capacity.

FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Court blow to Nafta might not be fatal,
but it's messy - A US order for an environmental delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BLOW dealt on Wednesday to the North American Free Trade Agreement by a
federal judge in Washington was not fatal, but it provided one more
complication to passage of a pact which is as unpopular as any in recent
memory.
Lawyers and lobbyists yesterday were scrutinising the order by Judge Charles
Richey that President Bill Clinton's administration prepare an environmental
impact statement - a procedure which can take months, even years - for
submission to Congress.
The order is to go on expedited appeal, which could take about two months.
Meanwhile, the ruling will not delay the tight schedule for the agreement's
passage, since the administration intends to proceed with the Nafta
implementing legislation.
But if the appeal fails, there will be no possibility of Nafta coming into
effect on its intended implementation date, January 1 1994. Moreover, the
administration would then face new political battles over the environmental
consequences of the pact which might be highlighted by the EIS.
The law requires that the administration submit an EIS with every bill
having an impact on the environment, but it has never been applied to trade
agreements. The court has not specifically ordered the administration to
submit one with the proposed Nafta legislation and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative, yesterday insisted he could go forward without it.
The implementing legislation for Nafta, which was negotiated by the
administration of Mr George Bush, contains various changes in tariffs
schedules and laws necessary for the trade pact to go forward.
Ms Lori Wallach, a lawyer with Public Citizen, a consumer and environmental
group, yesterday said the court could not issue an order to the president
because of the separation of powers provided in the US Constitution. The
court, however, ordered the US trade representative to negotiate a schedule
for the EIS with the three organisations which brought the suit.
Ms Wallach, however, said the US trade representative may refuse to
negotiate while the appeal is pending.
Mr Kantor and his counterparts in Canada and Mexico will continue trying to
find their way out of the existing stalemate on environmental and labour
side agreements.
If the Canadians and Mexicans were ever in doubt about the clout and
resolution of the environmental lobby, they were given a dramatic
demonstration of it on Wednesday.
The administration has a tentative deadline of July 15 for completion of the
side agreements. Work is well under way on the implementing legislation,
which must be voted on within 90 days of being submitted. Several weeks more
will be needed to prepare legislation for the side agreements.
It is likely they will go to Congress in September, but the time squeeze is
severe since preparations will also have to be made to get new tariff
schedules ready.
Environmentalists contend that if the court orders an EIS or if the
administration prepares one unilaterally, the environmental damage it
highlights would hurt the prospects for the pact. Nafta proponents, such as
Mr Chip Brown, chief economist for Solomon Brothers, say the reverse is more
likely.
'Mexico is not going to go back to where it was 20 years ago,' Mr Brown
said. 'The only issue is will Mexico industrialise in the context of a Nafta
or without Nafta.'
There has been increasing criticism of Mr Clinton for a lack of leadership
in trying to turn around public sentiment on the Nafta. Congressman Lee
Hamilton, a Nafta supporter, this week said the lobbying effort has begun to
build but what has been lacking is 'the president's personal voice'.

FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: EC chemicals curbs sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S chemical industry association has called on the EC to apply trade
measures against east and central European chemicals manufacturers.
Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council, has asked for intervention
after substantial increases in imports from the east at low prices. It
claims these have not always been set by market economy principles.
The body warns that parts of the EC industry could be forced to close plants
and shed jobs. The five areas affected are fertilisers, soda ash, polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), caprolactam (a precursor of nylon), and melamine (a
plastic).
PVC imports from the east have increased from 84,000 tonnes in 1989 to about
270,000 tonnes last year, while prices have fallen about 30 per cent. Soda
ash imports have also risen, from 27,000 tonnes to 162,000 tonnes, as prices
fell 10 per cent. Caprolactam imports shot up from 606 tonnes to 33,000, as
prices fell 30 per cent.
Nevertheless the EC's overall surplus in chemicals trade with eastern
neighbours rose to Ecu1.01bn (Pounds 774m) from Ecu527m in 1990.

FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: A cloud in the Mexican sky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORTH American Free Trade Agreement has become the most cherished
foreign and economic policy initiative of President Carlos Salinas of
Mexico, in the three years since it was first proposed.
Significant delay, or even rejection, of Nafta is unlikely to lead to
national economic collapse, but would probably damage US-Mexican relations,
reduce Mexican economic growth, and affect the race to succeed Mr Salinas.
Indeed, so much has the Mexican government invested in the treaty that
officials refuse publicly to speculate on the consequences of rejection,
repeating that the treaty's approval is 'inevitable'. Soon after the US
judge's decision on Wednesday, that the treaty must be delayed on
environmental grounds, Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican trade minister,
insisted: 'This decision will absolutely not delay the process of
negotiation.'
However, news of the judge's ruling caused an immediate drop in the Mexican
stock market, which closed down 30 points (1.81 per cent) in unusually heavy
trading. It opened lower yesterday but recovered its losses to close
slightly higher. Foreign investors also shied away from Mexican paper in the
US, where Mexican par bonds showed a large one-day move by falling from 73
1/8 to 71 7/8 on Wednesday.
If Nafta were delayed, Mexico's economy would be the first to suffer. The
government has had to run a budget surplus and keep real interest rates
above 5 per cent so as to cool the economy and finance a huge trade deficit.
It was hoping that Nafta's passage would attract more foreign capital to
Mexico, and thus raise growth before the presidential election next year.
If the fate of Nafta were still not sealed early next year, its fortunes and
the Mexican presidential campaign would become intertwined. The nationalist
opposition, led by Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is likely to argue that the
government made a bad error in betting so much on the good intentions of the
US, and it would offer voters a more independent foreign and economic
policy.
Rejection of Nafta would probably feed the old Mexican distrust of the US,
and partly reverse the recent improvement in US-Mexican relations.
Ramifications would also be felt throughout Latin America, where many
leaders see Nafta as an indicator of US interest in the region.
Mr Salinas would be awkwardly placed if the treaty were called off. His
government could be under domestic poliical pressure to re-affirm Mexico's
sovereignty by launching a nationalist initiative, but foreign investors
would be seeking a signal that his government's pro-market economic policy
was on course.
The president is likely to try for a middle course, sending appropriate
signals at home and abroad, but there can be little doubt his prestige, and
that of pro-US technocrats in his government, would be badly hurt if Nafta
were derailed.

FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Warning for glass makers in Japan

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry has warned leading
sheet glass makers to end a system of kickbacks to dealers, which the Fair
Trade Commission has suggested is a restriction on industry competition.
But one of the makers, Asahi Glass, said an FTC report describing the
industry's behaviour as inappropriate had vindicated its way of doing
business because 'they found that we do not violate the anti-monopoly law'.
Three companies - Asahi, Nippon Sheet Glass and Central Glass - dominate the
Japanese market. The FTC found they run a dealer network that tends to
exclude competitors, including foreigners.
After publication of the FTC report, the ministry warned the three companies
that they should change their ways, in particular payments to dealers who
achieve sales targets set by the manufacturers.
The ministry's ceramics and construction material division asked the
companies to 'observe anti-monopoly laws more thoroughly' and ensure their
contracts with dealers include no clause to stop them selling competitors'
products.
They were also told to 'educate employees to avoid market activities that
might cause illegal mutual dealing' - a reference to what is sometimes
friendly co-operation among the three companies.
But the removal of contract clauses to restrict dealers' contact with other
suppliers might not clear a path for foreign suppliers. An FTC study of car
dealers found that about half believed they were restricted to sell one make
of vehicle, even though there is no specific limitation in their contracts.
After suggesting that the FTC report had vindicated the glass makers, Asahi
Glass said the company would examine whether measures could be taken to
ensure that the market remain open to foreign competition.

FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: G7 summit 'crucial' to Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFLICT over international trade liberalisation will provide 'a major test
of post-cold war leadership' at next week's Tokyo summit of the Group of
Seven industrial countries, according to Mr Peter Sutherland, the new
director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Predicting that the summit will be a 'crucial catalyst' for rescuing the
stalled Uruguay Round talks on international trade liberalisation, after
months of 'obfuscation and paralysis', Mr Sutherland said that if leaders
failed to reach agreement, the round would be 'a pipe dream'.
'I don't see any point in fooling ourselves about the seriousness of the
situation. It will be extremely difficult - even utopian - to deliver the
Uruguay Round by the end of the year if the G7 fails.'
A successful agreement could generate Dollars 200bn (Pounds 133bn) in new
trade each year. Failure is almost certain to trigger damaging tit-for-tat
protection among industrial powers.
Noting that he was 'increasingly apprehensive' about setbacks in the past
week between trade negotiators on market access for manufactured exports and
on the US-Japan trade relationship, he said: 'So much rests on the G7, I can
only hope the negative feelings of recent days are not the reality.
'It is simply not good enough for the G7 to make general protestations in
favour of trade reform, as they have for the past five summits,' he said:
'We need a detailed communique that allows negotiators to move on to a
multilateral treaty. If the outcome is unclear, it is negative.'
France has in recent days set increasingly stringent conditions for any G7
agreement on trade reform.
Mr Sutherland would not comment yesterday on his talks with French President
Francois Mitterrand: 'France is the world's fourth largest exporter, and the
second largest exporter of services. It has a crucial interest in a
satisfactory outcome of the round, whatever the temporary pressures for
protection: the inexorable logic of this should be as clear to the posers
that be in France as it is to us.'
Mr Sutherland, speaking on his first day in office at the head of Gatt, was
emphatic that his own role was limited: 'I can't be presented as a magician.
I am a facilitator. There is no point in lecturing about banging heads
together if the basic will is not there.'
He plans to meet Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign minister, in London today, as part of a flurry of
briefings with G7 leaders ahead of the G7 summit.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Iraq wants to discuss lifting of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ'S Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said last night he believed Iraq had
done enough to warrant the lifting of sanctions against it.
In an interview with the US Cable News Network, CNN, he said his government
wanted to open 'technical, legal and objective' discussions with the UN
Security Council about all outstanding issues with a view to easing
sanctions soon.
He went on to express Iraq's fear that even if every detail of Gulf War
ceasefire resolution 687 was implemented, the 33-month-old sanctions might
not be lifted. 'We don't have a solid promise that sanctions will be lifted
when all the resolutions are implemented,' he said. He called for a review
by the Security Council to examine exactly where Iraq stood and discussion
of all the remaining issues.
Mr Aziz's comments come five days after the US launched a missile attack
against Baghdad intelligence headquarters which killed six civilians and
wounded many others. He decried the attack as 'totally unjustified' and said
Iraq wanted 'a quiet and normal relationship with the US'.
Referring to the 'ceasefire' announced by President Saddam Hussein on
January 19 after the previous allied air attack on Baghdad, he said Iraq had
'shown good intentions' which had been rejected by the US. In contrast to
more belligerent statements by Iraqi officials this week, the minister said
Iraq would not 'condone any acts of aggression' in retaliation against the
US strike.
Meanwhile, there seemed little development on the deadlock between the UN
and Iraq over the UN demand to install cameras at two ballistic missile
sites outside Baghdad.

FT  02 JUL 93 / US backs Japanese, German UN bid
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday formally supported the admission of Germany and Japan to
permanent membership of the UN Security Council, but Britain cautioned
against 'precipitate action'.
Noting that the 15-nation council had finally assumed its intended position
'at the centre of world affairs', Britain argued there was no pressing need
for change, although 'success should be built upon'.
While backing the well known aspirations of Bonn and Tokyo to join the
present five founding permanent members, the US added a caveat that they
must be prepared to be active in global peace and security activities. That
would involve being ready to provide UN peacekeepers, for which both
countries would need constitutional amendments.
However, not all members would welcome an increased military role for the
former second world war enemy states, whose defeat led to the creation of
the UN.
The US and British statements responded to a resolution requesting members'
views on 'Equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the
Security Council'. The issue will be debated by the General Assembly later
this year.
While backing Germany and Japan for permanent seats, the US emphasised that
the current big five - also including France, Russia and China - had
political and economic influence and the capacity and will to enhance global
security through peace keeping and other activities. 'Their status on the
council should remain unaltered.'
Thus, fears that the US might eventually be willing to see Britain and
France superseded, as declining powers, were emphatically allayed.
In reply, Britain made no mention of Germany and Japan but stressed the
present council had been able to respond rapidly to international crises and
permitted equitable representation from all regions working with the
permanent members. No fewer than 70 resolutions were adopted last year alone
and 60,000 UN peace keepers were deployed.

FT  02 JUL 93 / New push and old pull rock Japan's politics / Chronicles of
the many dilemmas facing a leading member of the LDP rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KAZUO Aichi was understandably nervous. Before him were 200 local
dignatories who lead the group that supports him as a member of the Japanese
parliament - village mayors, president of parents associations, doctors.
Many could recall Mr Aichi's father, a former top bureaucrat who became a
powerful Liberal Democratic party politician, standing before them asking
for their support. Yet his son was there to warn them that he would probably
rebel against the LDP leadership, help to launch a rival party led by Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister and so crack open the post-war
structure of Japanese politics.
A week later Mr Aichi and more than 30 LDP rebels defeated Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa's government by voting with an opposition no-confidence motion. One
of Mr Aichi's aides recalls: 'If the leaders of the support group had gone
against, it would have risked our entire local organisation. But even the
80-year-olds fully supported it.'
Yet their reasons highlight the ambiguous character of the dramatic changes
unleashed by the Hata rebels. Mr Aichi's group supported him out of loyalty
to the family name rather than because they want sweeping reform of Japan's
corrupt, introspective and slow moving political system.
Mr Aichi's reliance upon traditional supporters and methods while advocating
radical reform is symptomatic of the dilemmas faced by all Japan's would be
reformers.
The gravity of Mr Aichi's decision should not be underestimated. Not only
has he risked his political inheritance by breaking with the LDP, but also
his future. As a sixth-term member of the parliament's lower house, he could
have expected a cabinet post after the next election if he had stayed on the
LDP merry-go-round.
He cites three reasons for joining the Hata breakaway:'Scandals are eroding
public trust in government, rotting the basis for a free society. Japan has
to play a larger world role and that requires a government with clear
policies and strong public backing. Yet the LDP is incapable of reforming
itself, so we have gridlock.'
Mr Aichi supports electoral reforms, including proportional representation
and the elimination of Japan's distinctively large, multi-member
constituencies in favour of smaller single-seat constituencies. A reformed
system would support two major parties, the LDP and probably the Social
Democratic party and perhaps three minor parties which would hold the
balance of power, he says.
The result would be a more open political system in which policies would
determine who was elected rather than the amount of public spending on local
bridges and sports facilities. However to get there Mr Aichi will first
engage in some very traditional Japanese politics. He needs about 150,000
votes to retain his seat. About 50,000 come from his support group, which
extends like the root system of a tree down from the top 200 members into
local neighbourhoods and companies.
Political advertising is banned, so Mr Aichi will have to spend millions of
yen on a time-consuming trawl to reach his voters. The money will be raised
by remortgaging his Tokyo basement office, which has served as a dissidents'
meeting place over the past few weeks, a bar at one end and a karaoke
machine at the other.
During the campaign, while Mr Aichi is out every day from 8am till late in
the evening making speeches, a few dozen people at his headquarters will be
at a phone bank cold-calling voters. In the evening the campaign
headquarters will become a restaurant which voters visit in groups to sit
and eat supper with Mr Aichi. In most industrial countries the politician's
main campaign weapon is a soundbite delivered on the evening television
news. For Mr Aichi it will be tea and noodles.
Mr Aichi remarked: 'I will lose about 10 per cent of my traditional support
but I hope to more than make that up by attracting new voters.'
His chances of success have been greatly enhanced by a local electoral deal
to minimise competition between rival reformist parties, which is testimony
to the enduring strength of personal networks in Japanese power politics. Mr
Aichi explained: 'The Japan New party was going to run a candidate. But I
know Mr Hosokawa the JNP's founder very well and so they decided not to run
a candidate.'
He will also need to project a clean, reformist image which marks a clean
break with the LDP. On the difference which political reform would make to
Japan's role in the world he explained that greater democracy was vital:
'Japan has to become more pro-active. That means politicians taking
decisions rather than bureaucrats who cannot take bold initiatives. At the
moment politicians are just mouthpieces for the bureaucrats. The bureaucrats
should serve the politicians.'
Yet on the vital details he is more circumspect. Mr Aichi represents both
urban and rural voters in Miyagi prefecture which is well known for its
pearl white rice. As a result even Mr Aichi, one of the most
internationalist of Japanese politicians, will not openly call for Japan to
lift its ban on imported rice, one of the obstacles preventing a successful
conclusion to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round.
'Rice is a very sensitive issue which is difficult to address in the
election campaign. I will not make it an issue. That is something which will
have to wait until afterwards,' he said.
Judging by the conflicting pressures upon Mr Aichi, even if the ruling LDP
is defeated, political reform will only lurch forward slowly because even
the modernisers have no choice but to carry so much traditional baggage with
them.

INDONESIAN interest rates have fallen to their lowest level for more than
seven years, raising hopes that consumer spending, which has been sluggish
since 1991, may begin to pick up, writes William Keeling in Jakarta.
Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the largest state bank, yesterday lowered its deposit
rates by half a percentage point to 11.5 per cent for one month money, a
move followed by 19 private banks which announced a full point drop in
deposit rates. A fall in lending rates across the board may follow with Bank
Niaga, a leading private bank, yesterday dropping its prime lending rate 1.5
percentage points to 19 per cent.
While interest rates vary widely between banks, deposit and lending rates on
average have now fallen by one-third in the last 12 months.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S cabinet yesterday approved a draft economic programme and a package
of measures to promote private investment in manufacturing and to stem the
flow of capital to China, writes Dennis Engbarth in Taipei.
The draft, prepared by the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), highlighted the sluggish state of manufacturing and emphasised the
need to promote private investment.
Superficially, Taiwan's economy seems strong. Average real economic growth
between 1988 and 1992 of 6.7 per cent compared to the average world rate of
2.4 per cent over the period. Government planners forecast a rise of 6.33
per cent for 1993.
However, the growth in fixed capital investment has been declining from
between 25 and 30 per cent of GDP in the early 1980s to 21.6 per cent of GDP
over the past five years. Private capital investment has been rising by an
annual average of only 8.5 per cent from 1988 to 1992.
Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of the CEPD, acknowledged that many manufacturers
'have set up factories in foreign countries or the (China) mainland.'
Estimates of the accumulated capital outflow from Taiwan to the mainland
range from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 20bn since mid-1987, when Taipei began to
lift restrictions on contacts with the mainland.

   LAGOS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday announced a freeze on new aid to Nigeria until a
democratically elected civilian government is installed and shown to be
working unhindered.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said in a parliamentary statement
that limited military sanctions imposed by the government last week in
response to the annulment of this month's presidential elections by
Nigeria's military rulers would remain in force 'until a democratic civilian
regime has been installed and is working unhindered. Meanwhile no new aid
commitments for Nigeria will be made.'
Britain's bilateral aid amounts to about Pounds 14.5m a year. The sanctions
do not affect delivery of the last batch of an order for 72 Mark 3 tanks
worth Pounds 150m. But British officials said the option of suspending
delivery would come under review if a handover to effective civilian rule
was delayed beyond August 27.
Nearly three weeks after the annulled poll, transition to democracy remains
confused. President Ibrahim Babangida has annulled the victory of Moshood
Abiola in the June 12 elections, banned both candidates and ordered fresh
polls with new candidates, but insisted the handover to elected civilian
rule is still 'on course'.
Many southerners see the government's action as a determination to stop a
Yoruba becoming head of state but there are no signs yet of the threatened
rift between north and south in Nigeria.
The military hierarchy has backed the annulment of Mr Abiola's victory at
last week's meeting with senior officers in Abuja, but they told him that
the regime must make way on August 27.

</HEADLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND is to pass legislation by September to ensure the public has
access to a regular flow of up-to-date budgetary and other fiscal
information, Ms Ruth Richardson, minister of finance, announced in last
night's budget.
The legislation will be similar to that which gives the Reserve Bank
independence from the government in setting monetary policy.
Ms Richardson said that the new law was prompted by the fact that the
previous Labour government failed to acknowledge a deteriorating economic
situation which had led to a much worse fiscal outlook.
Under the new legislation, future governments will be required to provide
six-monthly economic and fiscal outlooks and monthly 'outturns.' In addition
a comprehensive fiscal and economic update must be given at the start of
each general election campaign. Each budget must also contain medium term
fiscal outlooks with the reports based on generally accepted accounting
practice as well as improved budget documentation.
The budget confirmed predictions that, despite elections in four months, it
would contain few giveaways.
Ms Richardson announced a deficit of NZDollars 2.2bn (Pounds 791m) for the
new 1993-94 financial year in a budget she described as 'aiming for
consistency' in economic policy. She estimated that the deficit for the
1992-93 year, which ended on Wednesday, at NZDollars 2.3bn, a NZDollars 1bn
cut on the figure in last year's budget.
She said that the total government debt programme this financial year would
be NZDollars 4.45bn due to maturing debt, net lending and other influences.
Ms Richardson said that the projected financial deficit for next year was
for a deficit of NZDollars 2bn followed by one of NZDollars 1.1bn in
1995-96. The government hoped to balance its budget by 1996 - 97.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Mideast talks end amid criticism of US proposals

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TENTH round of Middle East peace negotiations ended in Washington
yesterday with little sign of progress and both Israelis and Palestinians
criticising a US document aimed at bridging their differences.
Some hours before the final session of talks began two Palestinian gunmen
opened fire on a bus in Jerusalem, wounding three people and then killing
the woman driver of a car they later hijacked. The two Palestinians were
later shot dead by Israeli troops at a road block near Bethlehem.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said the attack, the most serious
since the closure of the occupied territories in late March, was aimed at
destroying the peace negotiations. He believed that the shootings had been
ordered by Hamas or Islamic Jihad, two of the radical groups in the West
Bank and Gaza opposed to the peace process.
In Washington, Palestinian negotiators expressed 'extreme displeasure' at
the latest American proposal aimed a finding common ground on a declaration
of principles to guide negotiations over an interim self-governing authority
for the occupied territories.
Mr Rabin, who is visiting Paris, said he was disappointed at the changes the
US had made to the first document it submitted at the end of the ninth round
of talks. But there was still room for discussion, he said, and was
confident that negotiations and contacts would continue. 'Both the Israeli
and Arab side have passed the point of no return on the road to peace.'
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said the
latest US document offered no basis for negotiation. She added that it
violated the terms of reference for the peace process, but would be further
studied by the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis.
One of the key obstacles to have arisen again during the past three weeks in
Washington has been the status of Jerusalem. The Palestinians insist that
east Jerusalem, captured by Israel during the 1967 war, has to be within the
competence of the interim self-governing authority which will be established
before negotiations open on the final status of the occupied territories.
The Israeli government has said that the talks have no future if the
Palestinians continue to raise the issue of Jerusalem because the future of
the unified city is not negotiable.
No date has been set for the next round of talks but Mr Dennis Ross, the US
peace talks co-ordinator, will visit the Middle East with State Department
officials next week to continue contacts. Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, is also considering a visit to the region in the next
few weeks.
The negotiations between Israel, Syria and Lebanon, also ended yesterday
without any hint of a breakthrough.

MR Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, warned China yesterday that he
would go ahead with his scheme for greater democracy in the colony if the
two sides did not make progress in their negotiations within the next few
weeks.
Speaking after securing the full endorsement of Mr John Major and the
British government, Mr Patten refused to set a timetable. 'I am reluctant to
circle dates in the calendar,' he said, but later added: 'We cannot go on
forever. We would like to make more progress in the next few weeks in order
to get a satisfactory outcome.'
Mr Patten's proposals for a fairer, more open way of electing members of
Hong Kong's Legislative Council, have been bitterly attacked by China which
said they violated the agreement signed with Britain for the return of the
colony in four years time.
However Chinese hostility has subsequently softened slightly. Some of the
economic development plans that it was blocking in retaliation have been
allowed to proceed, and the resumption of talks in Beijing offered some
prospect of progress on the elections issue.
During the sixth round last week China for the first time laid out its
specific objections to the election proposals which had been first unveiled
last October.
Mr Patten said yesterday that he would go ahead and present the legislation
for his proposals if no progress was made in the seventh round of talks that
begin next week. 'The bill will be introduced in the Legislative Council
after we have concluded a satisfactory agreement with China, or if we do not
get a satisfactory agreement with China we will have to go ahead and
legislate on our own,' Mr Patten added.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, confirmed that Mr Major and his
cabinet colleagues fully supported the governor. 'We have decided that the
approach we have been taking, strategically and tactically, in these talks
is the right one,' said Mr Patten who returns to Hong Kong today.

<TEXT>
A Japanese regional mayor arrested for alleged bribe-taking, Mr Toru Ishii,
yesterday announced his resignation, as public prosecutors continued to
question him about links to four leading construction companies, writes
Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
Prosecutors arrested Mr Ishii on Tuesday after allegedly uncovering evidence
that he accepted Y100m (Pounds 627,000) from the companies in the
expectation that they would be awarded public works contracts. Executives
from the four companies have been arrested, but say the money was not
intended as a bribe.
In announcing the resignation, officials in Sendai, where the mayor has
ruled since 1984, said Mr Ishii had decided to resign to ensure stable
government and 'avoid political confusion'. He was sponsored by the ruling
Liberal Democratic party and some opposition parties. The case has cast a
shadow over a general election to be held on July 18, and made some
companies reluctant to donate funds to the LDP, though the Keidanren, the
federation of business associations, yesterday said that it would again back
the party.
Meanwhile, the Shinseito, or Japan Renewal Party, formed by a rebel LDP
faction, yesterday 'deeply' apologised for past links to that party and for
the role that its members played in 'maintaining a system of one-party
rule'.

<TEXT>
The world's leading consumer electronics makers yesterday announced plans to
discuss a common standard for the next generation of video tape recorders,
digital VCRs, and VCRs for high definition television, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The move comes as worldwide consumer demand for electronics goods is waning,
and the industry cannot afford to engage in costly wars in an area which
they believe will be important in stimulating demand for new electronics
products.
The 10 companies, including eight Japanese companies led by Matsushita and
Sony, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France, will form a
technical conference to develop a common set of specifications to prevent a
damaging standards war.
Digital VCRs record films from televisions or camcorders in computer
language and, unlike the current generation of analogue VCRs, offer
virtually perfect pictures no matter how many pictures are made.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesian interest rates have fallen to their lowest level for more than
seven years, raising hopes that consumer spending, which has been sluggish
since 1991, may begin to pick up, writes William Keeling in Jakarta.
Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the largest state bank, yesterday lowered its deposit
rates by half a percentage point to 11.5 per cent for one month money, a
move swiftly followed by 19 private banks which announced a full point drop
in deposit rates.
A fall in lending rates across the board may follow with Bank Niaga, a
leading private bank, yesterday dropping its prime lending rate 1.5
percentage points to 19 per cent.
While interest rates vary wildly between banks, deposit and lending rates on
average have now fallen by one-third in the last 12 months, mirroring the
central bank's steady reduction of the government bond rate from an average
16.5 per cent a year ago to a current 8.5 per cent.
The spread between deposit and lending rates, however, is expected to remain
high with many banks still battling with portfolios dogged by non-performing
loans.
Some bankers are also concerned a lowering of interest rates now is
unjustified and may cause the economy to overheat next year.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Taiwan approves draft economic package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN yesterday approved a draft economic programme and a package of
measures to promote private investment in manufacturing and to stem the flow
of capital to China.
The draft, prepared by the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), highlighted the sluggish state of manufacturing and emphasised the
need to promote private investment.
Superficially, Taiwan's economy seems strong. Average real economic growth
between 1988 and 1992 of 6.7 per cent compared to the average world rate of
2.4 per cent over the period. Government planners forecast a rise of 6.33
per cent for 1993.
However, the growth in fixed capital investment has been declining from
between 25 and 30 per cent of GDP in the early 1980s to 21.6 per cent of GDP
over the past five years. Private capital investment has been rising by an
annual average of only 8.5 per cent from 1988 to 1992.
Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of the CEPD, acknowledged that many manufacturers
'have set up factories in foreign countries or the (China) mainland.'
Estimates of the accumulated capital outflow from Taiwan to the mainland
range from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 20bn since mid-1987 when Taipei began to
lift restrictions on contacts with the mainland.
Data from the Central Bank of China show that the total net outflow on the
capital account of Taiwan's balance of payments amounted to Dollars 61.9bn
from 1987 to 1991, third only to Japan and Germany.
Mr Siew said the CEPD hoped that the measures 'could effectively solve a
wide range of problems faced by private investors such as access to land,
labour supply and higher technology.

<TEXT>
THE elevation of Germany and Japan to permanent membership in the UN
security council would require their 'active role in global peace and
security activities,' the US said yesterday.
In supporting their entry in an official response to a UN resolution on
council reform, the US also emphasised that the status of the existing five
permanent members should remain unaltered. Thus, there would be no direct
threat to Britain and France whose diminished status has been cited by third
world members as a reason for change.
But many members may not welcome the implication that Germany and Japan, the
enemy states whose defeat in second world war led to the creation of the UN,
should have a stronger military role half a century afterwards.
Britain, France, Russia and China, which with the US form the present
permanent membership, did not immediately release their responses to the
resolution. These were supposed to have been delivered by the end of June.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary general, will compile all the comments
in a comprehensive report to the general assembly, which will review the
question later this year.
He favours reform of UN bodies in 1995, when the 50th anniversary of the
adoption of the Charter will be celebrated. Japan, currently an elected
member of the council, hopes to make a smooth transition to a permanent seat
by then.
Nigeria, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Egypt and even a multi-racial South Africa
have all been mentioned as contenders for permanent membership.
The US evidently did not want to take sides in any such contest but declared
its willingness to consider 'a modest number of additional seats'.
Nor did the statement address the question whether new permanent members
should have the power of veto. However, it stressed that the current five
had 'global political and economic influence and a capacity as well as a
will to contribute to global peace and security through peacekeeping and
other activities.'
All of them happen also to be nuclear powers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese government, has promised to cash IOUs worth millions of dollars
in a move designed to quell the anger of the country's peasants who feel
they are being cheated of their share in China's growing prosperity.
The central bank, the Bank of China, has authorised post offices in areas
where dissatisfaction has erupted into rioting and violence against
government institutions to draw on local branches to cash remittances sent
from relatives working elsewhere.
Accounts will be settled directly with the central bank because the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China,
the specialised banks that would normally meet this demand, are short of
cash, the official China Daily reported yesterday
The paper said peasants in some areas, unable to get their money, have
attacked post offices, smashing windows and injuring postal workers. The
announcement follows rioting last month in Sichuan, China's most populous
province, in which furious farmers attacked government headquarters in
protest against tax increases.
The China Daily said the problem of tight money supply is worst in the
southern provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi, among the country's
main grain-growing areas, but also exists in central provinces, including
Anhui and Guizhou which are among China's poorest.
Official figures show that peasants' annual average per capita income is 770
yuan (Pounds 90), which is less than half the average city income.
The remittances, known as 'green IOUs' to distinguish them from 'white IOUs'
paid to farmers for their state quota of grain, are one of the few sources
of cash for China's peasants, who are having to rely more and more on money
from relatives in the relatively affluent cities.
With the approach of summer planting, farmers need money to buy increasingly
expensive equipment and fertilisers. Once they harvest, they face the
prospect of again being paid white IOUs for compulsory state purchases.
These IOUs were such a source of discontent last year that the government
opened its coffers to honour its commitment to pay up by Chinese New Year.
The depth of government alarm at the rural unrest was reflected in recent
calls by senior Chinese leaders, including President Mr Jiang Zemin and Vice
Premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua, for immediate settlement of the green
IOUs.
The problem has prompted postal officials to 'reconsider' setting up a
postal savings bank to take responsibility for cashing remittances, the
China Daily said yesterday.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US defence department yesterday announced the largest cuts in its
overseas bases for three years, including the closure or reduction of
operations at 92 installations, AP reports from Washington.
Thirteen big installations are affected, including Bitburg air base in
Germany, which will have reduced operations.
The announcement brings to 840 the number of US sites overseas where
operations have been trimmed since 1990, 773 of them in Europe.
The department said the cuts were the first to be guided by President Bill
Clinton's decision to reduce US forces in Europe to 100,000 by September
1996, rather than the 150,000 planned by the Bush administration. Some of
the closures have been reported in Europe.
Facilities to be shut down include the units in Germany that guarded the
Fulda gap, which military stategists consider the traditional invasion route
into southern Germany.
The department said the changes in the overseas bases would affect 24,000 US
military jobs, 6,600 US civilian jobs and 7,800 local employees. Some US
individuals may be transferred to the US or elsewhere but many are losing
their jobs because of the overall reduction in forces under way since the
Bush administration.
Most of the affected facilities are in Germany, but a few are in the
Netherlands, the UK and Korea.
The department said it was reviewing other sites worldwide for full or
partial return to host governments. Mr Clinton is preparing to send to
Congress a list of dozens of domestic US bases that will be closed or
reduced.

FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: E Europe growth predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR will see a resumption of growth in certain central and east
European countries, according to OECD projections.
Modest economic expansion is forecast for Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, but the situation is more precarious for Bulgaria and Romania
where basic structural reforms have not been completed.
Unemployment is expected to continue rising in all the region's countries
before beginning to fall in 1994.
The OECD points to three main barriers to more dynamic growth in the main
east European economies:
State enterprise sectors are burdened with many unprofitable companies with
deteriorating balance sheets. Social and political considerations, however,
make wholesale bankruptcy a difficult route. Recently restructured banking
systems require banks to undertake new lending with extreme prudence. They
are also under pressure to strengthen profitability through lower costs and
by maintaining large interest rate spreads. As a result access to bank
credit is expensive and restricted for all but the most preferred or best
borrowers. Narrow tax bases have emerged as a structural weakness as
productive activity shifts from the public sector to the private sector
which is more prone to tax avoidance. This has resulted in big budget
deficits in most countries, except the the Czech Republic.

FT  02 JUL 93 / US manufacturing outlook weakens
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE outlook for US manufacturing industry deteriorated significantly last
month, according to figures published yesterday.
The Purchasing Managers' Index - a closely watched barometer of the health
of manufacturing - fell sharply from 51.1 per cent in May to 48.3 per cent
last month, reflecting a sudden drop in new orders.
This was the lowest reading since December 1991 and sharply down from the 58
per cent reached in January, shortly after President Bill Clinton's election
victory.
A reading below 50 per cent is generally interpreted as a sign that the
manufacturing sector is contracting.
Separately, the Conference Board, a New York Business analysis group, said
its index of business confidence fell sharply from 66 in the first quarter
to 57 in the second quarter, the lowest level since late 1991.
'The desired improvement in new orders failed to materialise in June,
resulting in a decline in the manufacturing sector and a dismal end to the
second quarter,' said Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers.
A sub-index measuring new orders fell from 53.5 per cent to 49 per cent in
June. Indices measuring export orders, manufacturing production and
employment also weakened.
Mr Jason Bram, a Conference Board economist, said the euphoric mood among
many businessmen at the beginning of the year had evaporated. But confidence
varied significantly among sectors. Chief executives in finance and business
services were the most positive, while 'manufacturers of food, textiles and
apparel have become very negative.'
Yesterday's reports were the latest in a series of weak economic figures,
including recent falls in consumer confidence, home sales, factory orders
and leading indicators.
Many economists believe the pessimism partly reflects apprehension about the
impact of tax increases proposed in the Clinton economic plan. US
businessmen are also concerned about economic weakness in Europe and Japan.
Employment figures for June, published today, will be closely scrutinised
for signs of weakness in labour markets.

FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: UK recovery hit by downturn across
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recovery is under way in the UK, but its strength is open to
question, writes Emma Tucker.
The most positive scenario outlined in the Economic Outlook is that low
inflation and continued recovery in consumer confidence fosters stronger
than expected growth. But rapid deterioration of economic prospects in
Europe could check recovery as demand for exports stays subdued.
The scope for further interest rate reductions depends on government ability
to stay within its inflation target range of 1 to 4 per cent, says the OECD.
But long-term bond yields of over 8 per cent, reflecting inflation
expectations above the ceiling of the target range suggest that financial
markets have yet to be convinced by the government's medium-term strategy
for controlling inflation.
Overall, the OECD's forecasts are slightly more optimistic than the UK
government's own predictions, with gross domestic product forecast to grow
by 1.8 per cent this year and by 2.9 per cent next.
The rise in output will be led by a recovery in private consumption and
residential contruction, broadening to other areas in the second half of the
year as adjustment to corporate balance sheets tails off and de-stocking
ends.
After that, public investment and the 'continuing resilience' of investment
by the newly-privatised utilities should act as a support to growth,
according to the report.
The OECD believes the government deficit will stop rising next year. It
estimates, however, that the cyclical component of the deficit - the
shortfall that occurs purely as a result of recession - accounts for only
between one half and one quarter of the total deficit.
In a separate article, the OECD points out that high tax revenues during the
buoyant years of the 1980s were used by certain member countries to reduce
tax rates, rather than to ensure greater fiscal consolidation and reduce
public debt.
'The most that was achieved was a stabilisation of the debt ratio at the end
of the 1980s, meaning that the current increase in government debt, relative
to GDP, is taking place from a worse initial position than in the previous
cycle,' it says.
The UK's trade position is also a source of concern. The widening of the
current account deficit, possibly rising to about 3 per cent of GDP, could
constrain the scope for non-inflationary growth.
The OECD believes the short-run outlook for wages, unit labour costs and
retail prices to be benign. Its central projection, however, is that the
sharp rise in import prices after devaluation will be largely offset by
stable unit labour costs and considerable slack in the domestic economy.

FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: Economic activity to expand
'modestly' this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC activity in the industrialised world will expand only modestly this
year and unless German interest rates continue to fall rapidly, recovery in
Europe will be delayed until late next year.
In its half-yearly Economic Outlook published yesterday, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development projects growth of 1.2 per cent
for its 24 members this year and a moderate recovery in 1994, but warns that
the upturn could easily be upset, especially in continental Europe.
Unemployment will continue to rise in virtually all of the member countries
and could reach 36m - 8 3/4 per cent of the labour force - in the first half
of next year.
The good news is that inflation will slow, with many OECD countries
experiencing the lowest rates for decades. If the opportunity to lock into
low inflation is seized, the recovery, once it comes, could usher in a
prolonged period of sustained OECD growth, the outlook projects.
Several uncertainties surround the projections. In particular, continuing
debt reduction may damp demand by more than has been estimated. The OECD
says although progress has been made in cutting excessive debt accumulated
in the late 1980s, borrowers and lenders are still cautious. This is
apparent even in the US where the most significant progress has been made.
High European interest rates continue to act as a drag on recovery. The
outlook says it is not clear how far interest rates will have to fall from
current levels to spur recovery but lack of progress on tackling German
inflation means Germany's European exchange rate mechanism partners 'may
have to continue to maintain interest rates above levels warranted by their
domestic economic situations.'
Scope for stimulating growth is limited in virtually all OECD countries
because of the need to cut budget deficits. Plans by several member
countries to cut public spending could have a negative short-term effect on
demand that may not be offset by the favourable impact of lower long-term
interest rates.
External factors also continue to pose some risks, in particular exchange
rate pressures and widening external imbalances. The latter is putting
policy makers under pressure to extend protectionist measures, says the
Outlook.
Crucial to sustained recovery is a rebuilding of consumer and business
confidence. Governments could contribute to this by bringing the Uruguay
Round to a rapid conclusion.
Other OECD highlights:
Fiscal policy: The immediate task facing governments is to ensure their
macroeconomic policies underpin non-inflationary growth. But this is not
easy, particularly when rising unemployment puts pressure on governments to
loosen fiscal policy. Recently announced fiscal packages in Japan need to be
implemented as quickly as possible to boost demand while growth is still
weak.
The sharp deterioration of public sector finances in the UK and France are
described as 'disquieting' and not entirely due to sluggish activity. Both
cases underline the need to tighten fiscal policy in the medium-term and the
already announced tax rises in the UK may be essential to credibility, says
the Outlook.
In the US and Germany further measures are necessary to cut budget deficits.
The US deficit is projected to widen again after 1997 unless the
Administration takes action before the end of its term of office.
Unless Germany reigns in spending, it and other ERM countries may have to
live with high real interest rates in the future.
Monetary policy: With room for manoeuvre on the fiscal side restricted, most
of the burden for supporting a sustained recovery will fall on monetary
policy. Outside continental Europe, monetary conditions are consistent with
actual or incipient recoveries, says the outlook. If recovery falters a
further cut in interest rates would be in order but only if inflation
remains subdued.
For many continental European countries even modest recovery depends on
further interest rate cuts. Falling output and wage moderation should make
an easing of monetary conditions possible for Germany. Such a move would
have to be judged carefully, however, in order not to compromise price
stability.
International issues: Differences in cyclical positions between countries
could lead to widening of the absolute levels of current account imbalances.
The OECD says there is a danger that bilateral deals to cut trade imbalances
will undermine multilateral bargaining in the Gatt.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Government loses close election in Belize

<TEXT>
MR Manuel Esquivel, a 53-year-old businessman, is to be sworn in by the
weekend as prime minister of Belize, following a narrow victory by his
United Democratic party in the general election on Wednesday.
Preliminary results yesterday gave the UDP 15 of the 29 seats in the Central
American state's assembly, with 13 for the People's United party of Mr
George Price, the long-serving prime minister. A recount was under way in
one constituency.
The result suggests a miscalculation by Mr Price, who called the election 15
months before it was due. He had hoped to be returned to office on the basis
of steady economic growth in the former British colony. Also, the PUP had
done well in recent by-elections.
In the month-long campaign, however, Mr Esquivel's UDP closed the gap,
arguing that Mr Price's administration was corrupt. He charged the
government with having given Belizean citizenship and voting rights to
thousands of refugees from neighbouring Guatemala, Honduras and El
Salvador,in a bid to win the election.
Mr Esquivel also proposed free education, from primary school to university,
as well as income tax concessions.
The PUP's loss has raised questions over the political future of Mr Price,
who has dominated the politics of the country of 200,000 people for 40
years, and has been its political leader for all but five years since 1954.
If Mr Price steps down as PUP leader, he is likely to be succeeded by Mr
Said Musa, foreign minister, or Mr Florencio Marn, a former deputy prime
minister.
Mr Esquivel, who was prime minister in 1984-1989, is not expected to bring
any great political changes to Belizean domestic affairs.
During the campaign, however, he accused the Price administration of making
too many concessions to Guatemala in an effort by the government to bury for
good a 130-year-old Guatemalan territorial claim on Belize, which Guatemala
recently declared that it had relinquished.
The opposition leader suggested the suspension of legislation which grants
Guatemala access to the Atlantic Ocean through Belizean territory.

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S conservative-led government yesterday responded to the indignity of
falling to the bottom of the OECD's growth table by stressing the
improvement it expects in the recession-hit economy next year, including a
big downward revision of its inflation forecast, writes Hugh Carnegy in
Stockholm.
The predicted fall of 2 per cent in Swedish GNP this year is the worst
performance among the OECD's 24 members. A forecast budget deficit
equivalent to 13 per cent of GNP was no less painful. But the government
took some comfort in the OECD's forecasts for 1994, when export growth and
the effects of budget cuts are expected to start taking effect.
The OECD predicts GNP growth of 1.4 per cent next year, compared with the
government's forecast of 1.2 per cent.
The government's inflation forecast for 1993 is cut to 4.6 per cent from 5
per cent, and for 1994 to 2.8 per cent from 3.3 per cent.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Developing a more worldly bank: Plans at the World Bank for
improving its project management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank will next week hold three days of discussions on reforms that
could radically alter the way the Washington-based development institution
operates.
Executive directors representing the shareholder countries will discuss
working papers proposing steps to halt the decline in the quality of the
bank's loan portfolio, policies for disclosure of information, and the
establishment of an inspection panel to review complaints from the public
about bank-funded projects.
Some of the changes result from several months of argument and
soul-searching among managers and directors of the bank, provoked by a
report last year from Mr Willi Wapenhans, a former senior bank official, on
the deterioration in the quality of the bank's portfolio.
The Wapenhans report said that more than 75 per cent of World Bank projects
showed acceptable performance, but warned that the proportion of projects
with big problems had risen from 11 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent in 1991.
Bank managers and directors have also been acutely anxious to avoid any
repetition of their debacle over the Narmada dam project in India. Sustained
criticism of the project from local activists and environmental groups
around the world forced the bank to appoint an independent commission whose
damning findings eventually led India to withdraw its request for bank
funding.
'The summary point is simple: neither the board nor the president want more
surprises about problems with on-going projects,' says the draft paper on
the establishment of an inspection panel circulated within the bank.
But the internal debate has been sharpened and greatly accelerated by the
prodding of the US Congress, in the person of Mr Barney Frank, the
Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the House subcommittee which oversees
international development issues.
Mr Frank's lever is that he controls the legislation to authorise
Washington's Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.5bn) contribution to the International
Development Association, the World Bank affiliate which provides
concessional interest rate loans to the poorest countries.
In negotiations with the World Bank and the US Treasury, Mr Frank has
implicitly, although not publicly, made the IDA contribution conditional on
improvements in the bank's disclosure and appeals procedures.
The documents produced for next week's board discussions are still viewed as
inadequate by the environmental groups that have been at the forefront of
demands for greater transparency in World Bank operations.
They also fall short in some respects of the understanding US officials
thought they had reached in their negotiations with the bank. Nevertheless,
they go much further than before in meeting demands from environmentalists
and shareholder governments for greater transparency.
The draft papers propose two options for the setting up of an inspection
process.
One idea, raised by the Dutch and German executive directors, is for a
single inspector who would not only investigate outside complaints but also
review a random sample of bank projects.
A second proposal would involve three independent inspectors, reviewing only
projects about which complaints had been received.
While there are still questions about details such as budgets and the
publication of inspection reports, the second proposal seems likely to prove
broadly satisfactory to the US Congress.
The draft paper on disclosure, however, raises more problems. Although the
bank proposes publishing final staff appraisal reports on projects and final
country reports, early information on projects would be available only in
specially prepared Project Information Briefs. Critics led by the
Environmental Defence Fund have circulated comments insisting on the
publication of early project documents, 'not fairy-tale versions of them'.
The third paper, 'Next Steps', is designed to follow up the Wapenhans report
with measures to improve portfolio performance. An earlier version was
dismissed by shareholder countries as inadequate, and the new document
attempts to offer stronger measures to shift the bank's corporate culture
away from one in which employees are rewarded for approving ever greater
volumes of loans, towards one which focuses on implementation.
'Next Steps' introduces portfolio performance reviews for each borrower
country, but also promises changes in personnel practices to increase the
importance attached to portfolio management in staff reviews and promotions.
'It is hardly possible to over-emphasise the importance of these incentives
to reinforce the change in culture towards implementation,' says the
document.
It argues that reversing the decline in the quality of the portfolio must be
given the highest priority in the bank's agenda.

FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: Savings shortage feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE persistance of relatively high real interest rates in most
industrialised countries for the past decade suggests a savings shortage,
according to the Economic Outlook.
The report, which says that real interest rates are too high in many member
states for the current point in the business cycle, warns that the shortage
of savings could result in lower investment, slower growth and difficulties
in providing adequate finance for developing countries.
It points out that while real short-term rates in the US and Japan have
declined sharply, reflecting the need to boost demand, rates have moved
counter cyclically in Europe. Last year European rates generally firmed, in
spite of weakening activity.
The OECD also reports that France companies benefit greatly from lower
short-term interest rates while German corporations, which rely on
longer-term financing, benefit relatively little.
A study shows the impact of lower interest rates varies according to the
speed with which a country's debt-servicing obligations change as a result
of a market rate fall.
In the UK, for example, short-term interest rates are particularly important
and debt servicing obligations respond quickly to changes in market rates.
However, in Germany more than 80 per cent of bank lending to the private
sector is long-term.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFINDUSTRIA, the Italian industrialists' confederation, and the unions
have reacted coolly to last minute government proposals to break a deadlock
over wage and work conditions.
The government has staked its prestige on a quick deal which would signal
there was no danger of a return to wage inflation. An agreement is also seen
as an important pre-condition for providing a stable climate for the 1994
budget.
Talks between employers and the unions aim to produce a new framework for
industrial relations and wage guidelines after last August's abandonment of
the scala mobile system of indexed wages.
Since then, there have been desultory efforts to find a new formula with
some guarantee against wages being eroded by inflation and more flexibility
in Italy's labour laws.
One deadline has already passed this week and another has been set for
Saturday. In forcing the pace for an agreement, the government of Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi has dramatised the consequences of failure warning of harm to
all three sides.
Confindustria has taken advantage of a weakened union movement and the
recession to force through changes. The proposals include the principle of
productivity-linked pay, and limits on the continued high level of social
security contributions and the invisible labour costs born by employers.
The unions are fighting to save their waning influence - still based round
three confederations reflecting the Cold War division of the labour
movement. The CGIL, the most powerful federation traditionally controlled by
the communists, risks a split if the Confindustria ideas are even partially
accepted.
Confindustria wants to end the practice of dealing with unions at both
national and local level. The organisation is proposing a minimum national
wage with individual industries and companies free to make their own local
productivity deals.
They have also suggested companies make 'temporary' pay increases above the
minimum which are not calculated for social security contributions. These
increases can be removed if necessary the following year and do not raise
the overall level of social security contribution.
On Wednesday, the government announced that a five-man team headed by Prof
Mario Draghi, the director-general of the treasury, had been given a month
to finalise procedures for the privatisation of ENEL, the electricity
authority, INA, the insurance institute, Stet, the telecoms group, Agip, the
oil production arm of ENI and three financial institutions - IMI, Comit and
Credit.

FT  02 JUL 93 / West's Azeri oil deal faces indefinite delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OIL company executives in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku, said last night that
they feared the multi-billion dollar deal to develop offshore oil reserves
in the Caspian Sea would be indefinitely delayed by the new Azeri
government.
The executives were told last night - at a meeting with Mr Resul Guliyev,
the deputy prime minister for the oil sector - that the government needed
'two-and-a-half months' to review contracts which had been ready for signing
by the companies and the deposed president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey.
Mr Elchibey fled to his home village in the province of Nakhichevan, handing
over the government to the former first secretary of the Azeri Communist
party, Mr Gaidar Aliyev.
The contracts to develop three oilfields in the Caspian Sea, with estimated
deposits of about 4bn barrels, were said to be worth Dollars 9bn (Pounds
6bn) to Dollars 12bn and had been awarded to a group of companies including
BP, Staatoil, Amoco, Pennzoil and the Turkish Petroleum Company.
Mr Aliyev, the new head of state, was reported by local news agencies to
have said that the 'unified' option of developing the fields, agreed between
the previous government and the oil companies, could be scrapped in favour
of separate contracts.
However, senior oil executives who are closely monitoring the situation in
Baku still believe that any Azeri government will wish to sign a deal with
the companies in the near future.
The main fears of the oil companies, according to one executive on the spot,
is that the new regime will attempt to improve the price by inviting a wider
circle of companies to tender for new contracts.
Meanwhile, the new government has said that one of its main priorities now
is to organise a professional army, following large-scale reverses in the
war against the Armenians who dominate the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. It
has also promised to raise living standards.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Russia's reforms fail to tackle industrial decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA will continue to suffer from high inflation and economic decline
because its divided leadership is pursuing only partial economic reforms,
according to the head of the government's own forecasting centre.
Mr Yakov Urinson said that despite the efforts of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the
finance minister, to pursue financial stabilisation and encourage economic
restructuring, the latter had been frozen by money being poured into
inefficient enterprises.
Mr Urinson poured cold water on claims by some government ministers that
industrial production had finally stabilised.
He pointed to the fact that not one enterprise had gone bankrupt.
'It will be hard on both the country and the government as long as the
latter contains people with diametrically opposed views on reforms,' he
said, also blaming 'braking' action by the conservative-dominated
parliament.
But, if under the best circumstances the government maintains moderately
restrictive credit policies, begins to focus social welfare payments and
launches an industrial policy, the centre forecasts that annual inflation
will fall to 950-1,150 per cent this year, down from 2,500 per cent in 1992.
Only if those conditions are met will the government be able to achieve 5-7
per cent monthly inflation by the end of the year.
The centre's experts forecast that significant progress will be made in
eliminating price distortions in the economy if liberalising of energy
prices is completed by the end of this year.
The centre's forecasts suggest that industrial production will fall by 13-15
per cent this year compared with a 19 per cent drop last year.
In 1994, gross domestic product might decline by 3-7 per cent. Economic
growth could resume in 1995.
Exports are expected to shrink by just 5 per cent to Dollars 38bn (Pounds
25.3bn), if Russia can maintain oil exports at last year's level.
The latter's volume increased by 20.6 per cent in the first quarter of this
year.
Imports will fall sharply to 66 per cent of last year's level, partly
because of a shortage of government funds to subsidise imports.

THE Russian parliament yesterday called on the government to put pressure on
Estonia in retaliation for its adoption of a law on aliens which obliges
non-ethnic Estonians to apply for citizenship and pass a language exam
within a year.
The resolution, which said pressure should be applied 'politically,
economically and in other ways including the suspension of the withdrawal of
(Russian) troops', was a rare case of unity in the usually bitterly divided
Russian parliament. The unity reflects the depth of feeling among Russians
over what is seen as discrimination against their ethnic kin. Nearly 600,000
Russian-speakers live in Estonia in a population of 1.6m - most of whom went
afterthe war to work in the newly-established Soviet factories.
The resolution says the adoption of the aliens law and a further electoral
law, 'could not be regarded as a purely internal affair' of Estonia. The
wording shows that Russian law-makers believe they have the right to
intervene in their neighbours' internal politics when Russian rights are in
question.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has already warned the Estonian
government to change its mind on the issue - a threat which made Mr Lennart
Meri, the Estonian president, say that he would not ratify the law until he
had sought expert advice from the Council of Europe and the Conference for
Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Estonia's Russian population has been infuriated by the new law . The
citizens of Narva, the mainly-Russian city in the north-east, have said they
will hold a referendum on July 16 and 17 on forming an autonomous state, a
move which Mr Eerik Truuvyali, Estonia's highest judicial authority, said
breached the constitution. On Wednesday, 5,000 demonstrators gathered in the
town of Sillamyaz, near Narva, to protest against the aliens law and demand
that the referendum on autonomy goes ahead.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Spectre of strife stalks Ukraine:  Moves to prevent a schism
between west and 'Russified' east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE massive granite government buildings circling Kharkiv's out-sized
central square are a legacy of the 1920s when this gritty eastern Ukrainian
industrial city was the capital of Soviet Ukraine.
When Stalin's grip over the second-most powerful Soviet republic grew
firmer, he shifted its government west to Kiev, the nation's traditional
centre, but the factory bosses of the largely Russian-speaking eastern
regions remained the most powerful force in the country.
That changed when Ukraine became independent nearly two years ago. Since
then, the influence of eastern Ukraine has waned and many of its traditional
links with Russia have been severed. Instead, western Ukrainian politicians,
propounding a nationalist ideology foreign to the eastern regions, have come
to the fore with promises to pull Ukraine out of Russia's orbit and bring it
into Europe.
While western and central Ukrainian politicians see independence, in the
words of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, as 'the fulfilment of the
centuries-old dream of our fore-fathers', eastern Ukrainians are more
inclined to dwell on the costs of separation from Russia.
At a meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers in Kharkiv on
Monday one eastern Ukrainian regional government official described the
repercussions of breaking away from Russia, which ruled his area for more
than three centuries.
'This separation has cut our very hearts in two,' he said. 'Not only have
links between factories been severed, but families find themselves cut in
two by what used to be a symbolic border.'
Some Ukrainian leaders and western observers fear the growing disquiet in
the east could give rise to a separatist drive to re-unite eastern Ukraine
with Russia. That, in turn, could plunge Ukraine into a messy civil war.
Concerns about a civil war are not confined to marginal Cassandras.
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk himself hinted at this worst-case
scenario in a recent television address. Warning eastern Ukrainians against
provoking a regional schism, Mr Kravchuk said darkly: 'We cannot allow our
nation to step across the chasm into chaos, anarchy and then dictatorship.'
Mr Kravchuk's warning is particularly ominous because a civil war between
the nationalist west and the Russo-philic east could easily drag in Russia.
Mindful of the potentially explosive repercussions of a split between
eastern and western Ukraine, Kiev is bending over backwards to appease the
east. Earlier this month, the government broke the national budget and
agreed to hold a referendum in September to end a strike by eastern
Ukrainian coal miners.
These economic concessions, which are likely to push the Ukrainian economy
into hyper-inflation, point to the double- barrelled problem Kiev faces in
eastern Ukraine. Not only is the east the region most disenchanted with
Ukrainian independence, but it is also Ukraine's rust-belt, home to
loss-making coal mines and heavy industry, which must be closed if the
government is to pursue market reforms.
Another effort to mollify eastern Ukraine can be spotted in Kiev's new, more
conciliatory approach to its political, military and economic disputes with
Russia. Ukraine has bent to Russian claims over the Black Sea Fleet and at
their meeting in Kharkiv on Monday the Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers
agreed to liberalise customs controls along the 850-mile border between the
two Slav states.
But Ukrainian leaders at the Kharkiv meeting also made clear that there is a
limit as to how far they will go to appease eastern Ukraine.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, clearly buoyed by the
pro-Russian sentiments of Ukrainian regional government officials, suggested
light-heartedly that the border between Ukraine and Russia be moved to
Romania in the west and Vladivostok in the east.
That solicited a sharp rebuff from Mr Ivan Pliushch, the chairman of the
Ukrainian parliament and one of the most powerful figures in Kiev. After
speaking of the need for better economic ties with Russia, Mr Pliushch
warned: 'If anyone thinks that this is a path to the recreation of a new
union of republics, then he is sorely mistaken.'
The challenge for Mr Pliushch and his colleagues in Kiev is to appease
eastern Ukraine without jeopardising their country's independence.

The International Monetary Fund has reached preliminary agreements with

Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director said yesterday, writes George
Graham in Washington. The IMF board approved on Wednesday a Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1bn) loan for Russia under the facility, which was created earlier
this year as a way of speeding up the flow of aid to the former Soviet bloc.
But Mr Camdessus insisted he would not be rushed by pressure from the US and

concluding negotiations on the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche to which Russia
would be entitled under the facility.

<TEXT>
MR Giampaolo Zambeletti, the former owner and managing director of one of
Italy's leading independent pharmaceuticals companies, yesterday gave
himself up to Milan magistrates investigating political corruption.
The move follows the arrest earlier this week of Mr Ambrogio Secondi and Mr
Cristiano Steigler, respectively chairman and managing director of the
Italian subsidiary of SmithKline Beecham, the multinational pharmaceuticals
group. The group now also owns Zambeletti. Separately, magistrates have
issued a warrant against Mr Claudio Cavazza, chairman of Sigma Tau, another
leading independent pharmaceuticals group, and a former chairman of the
Italian pharmaceuticals association.
The arrests follow allegations that some leading pharmaceuticals companies
paid large kickbacks to Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, a former health minister
under investigation for corruption, in return for favours including faster
product approval and privileged treatment in state-administered pharmacies.
The allegations have been made by Mr Giovanni Marone, Mr De Lorenzo's former
secretary, who was arrested earlier this year and whose testimony has been
widely leaked.
The pharmaceuticals federation, chaired by Mr Secondi, said it had given its
lawyers authority to contact the magistrates and offer its 'fullest
co-operation' in the inquiries.

SERB forces yesterday pounded Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave
proclaimed a United Nations 'safe area', amid intense clashes in northern
and eastern Bosnia.
Bosnian radio said many people were killed and wounded in the Serb artillery
attack on the last remaining Moslem stronghold in the east. The report could
not be independently confirmed.
UN officials said at least 74 shells slammed into Gorazde, one of six Moslem
enclaves proclaimed as safe areas.
In the strategic south-western town of Mostar, fighting appeared to ease
after the Moslem-led Bosnian army reportedly seized control of a Croat
barracks and advanced to the north. Croat commanders in Bosnia yesterday
denied reports of Moslem gains. 'They cannot move. We have them surrounded
on three sides and the Serbs are on the fourth,' said Mr Drago Maric, an
official of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO).
'The Moslems want to connect up Mostar to Jablanica and Konjic, where the
bulk of their forces are,' he said in reference to Moslem-held towns in
central Bosnia.
The Moslem-led Bosnian army over the past week has tried to press forward to
link up its scattered enclaves. Moslems fear that their six isolated
enclaves will fall to the more powerful Serb and Croat armies. In an
apparent bid to isolate Zenica and Tuzla, also designated safe areas, Croat
and Serb forces launched a joint attack on Zepce amid continued shelling of
nearby Maglaj, in north-central Bosnia.

THE French government plans to propose Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of
the Bank of France, as a candidate to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as president
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr de Larosiere, who was managing director of the International Monetary
Fund before joining the Bank of France in 1987, is viewed as a strong
contender for the EBRD job.
His candidature follows days of lobbying by senior politicians who have been
pressing for France to retain the EBRD presidency following Mr Attali's
resignation last Friday. Mr Attali was appointed to the post as the protege
of France's Socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand. Mr Edouard
Balladur, the conservative prime minister, is thought to have championed the
choice of Mr de Larosiere as the French candidate.
However, he is expected to face stiff competition for the job, notably from
Mr Henning Christopherson, the popular European Community economics
commissioner, who has already been confirmed as a candidate.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Daimler-Benz to reclaimeast German property: Issue raises
doubts on treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial holding company, is seeking to
reclaim property in eastern Germany which was expropriated during the Soviet
occupation between 1945 and 1949.
The decision throws into question the interpretation of Germany's
unification treaty which states that 'the expropriations on the basis of the
Occupation Law (1945-1949) are irreversible.'
If Daimler-Benz can prove that the Soviet Union never asked for the
irreversibility of these expropriations, then thousands of former owners of
industry and land in eastern Germany could claim back their property.
Over 14,000 landowners, covering 13,000 square miles, had their property
expropriated during this period. Many include former aristocratic land
owners in Prussia.
Daimler-Benz is claiming over 1m square metres of industrial property.
If the claim by Daimler-Benz is successful, it would also mean that efforts
to speed outstanding claims on property in eastern Germany would be set back
for many more years.
Daimler-Benz said yesterday it was simply 'acting on behalf of its
shareholders. They regard it as our duty to do so. If there is any chance to
get the property back, we would try to get hold of it,' a spokesman added.
Daimler-Benz is also acting on behalf of Mercedes Benz, Dasa, and AEG, the
electronics company which before 1945 had 90 per cent of its manufacturing
base located in eastern Germany.
All three are part of the group's holding company.
The spokesman denied that by claiming back its industrial sites,
Daimler-Benz was challenging the unification treaty.
'We started putting in our claims in late 1990 in order to keep our rights
alive so that when there would be any change in the unification treaty, we
would be in a position to claim our rights,' said the spokeman.
Under the unification treaty, those whose property was confiscated between
1933 and 1945, and between 1949 and 1990, have the right to restitution, or
compensation.
Until recently, it had been claimed by the German government, that as a
precondition for the unification of the two Germanies, the Soviet Union had
insisted that no property which it expropriated during its occupation of
eastern Germany between 1945 to 1949 should be given back to their former
owners.
But Daimler Benz, and other claimants are now arguing, in the light of
documents available from Moscow, that the Soviet Union never insisted on
this clause.
Instead, they claim Moscow only asked that the 'lawfulness' of decisions
made by the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1949 should not be questioned by
courts in Germany.
They claim that the last east German government, which was led by Mr Lothar
de Maiziere, did not want aristocrats to claim back their property, and had
used the Soviet Union 'precondition' as a means of preventing their return.

<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, German finance minister, yesterday warned Germany would be
unable to join a European monetary union (Emu) in either 1997 or 1999,
referring to two deadlines set by the Maastricht treaty, unless it took
further radical action to curb its budget deficit. This was the first time a
senior cabinet minister had publicly questioned the possibility of Germany
participating in 1999.
He insisted there could be no suggestion of relaxing the economic
convergence criteria for Emu - including strict limits on budget deficits,
government debt, and inflation - and that Germany itself would be hard
pressed to comply.
Mr Waigel was giving evidence before the German constitutional court in
Karlsruhe, which yesterday began hearing complaints against the ratification
of the Maastricht treaty on European union. In response to questions over
the future stability of a single European currency, the finance minister
insisted that it would prevent turbulence in the European money markets, and
prove stronger in competition with the dollar and yen than the present
European Monetary System.
His colleague Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, also weighed in with a
staunch defence of Maastricht, reminding the court it was approved by the
German parliament with an overwhelming majority, only 16 votes against.
He warned that any decision by the court to declare the ratification of the
treaty invalid would cause a huge loss of international confidence.
The court is hearing a series of challenges to the treaty, on the grounds
that it infringes the individual rights of German citizens, by undermining
the country's sovereignty. Complainants include four Green members of the
European parliament, and Mr Manfred Brunner, a former chef de cabinet to Mr
Martin Bangemann, senior German commissioner in Brussels.
The Green MEPs have based their challenge on a lack of democratic control at
European level over the actions of the European Commission and EC council of
ministers. Mr Brunner maintains the treaty offends the constitutional
definition of Germany as a 'democratic and social, federal state'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM opened its EC Presidency yesterday with a pledge to 'play by the
rules' of the Community and a warning that the difficulty of enlargement
negotiations had been underestimated.
The two statements by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister,
underlined a shift in priorities after two nationalist-minded presidencies
under Denmark and the UK, both of which pushed for speedy enlargement with
Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria.
Mr Dehaene, who shares a passion for federalism and football, listed
Belgium's priorities as giving life to the Maastricht treaty and
strengthening EC institutions, particularly the European Commission.
He also said he was favourable to holding an early EC summit in October,
assuming ratification was wrapped up in the UK and Germany. But a summit
required concrete decisions such as an agreement on the location of new EC
institutions, notably the European Monetary Institute.
The EMI is the precursor of the European Central Bank which will supervise
the putative single EC currency. The UK is blocking a deal under which the
EMI would go to Germany and some ministers are arguing that London's status
as an international financial centre should give it control of some of its
operations.
Mr Dehaene warned that failure to reach a deal on the EMI could jeopardise
the second stage of European Monetary Union, due to begin on January 1,
1994. A delay could lead to a repeat of the monetary instability of the past
nine months which 'should be avoided at all costs,' he said.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President, said he was enthusiastic
about working with the Belgian Presidency. It was time to dispel the
Euro-gloom and recreate the successes of the mid-1980s, a period of dynamic
growth and job creation.
Mr Delors recalled that an acquaintance from Harvard University had recently
published an article suggesting that Europe was dead. But Americans had
written off Europe in the early 1980s, and had been proved wrong. The
Commission President, still hobbling from sciatica, said he intended to
finish his study on European competitiveness by the Brussels summit in
December.

The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, faces political embarrassment
if Ireland is not allocated the full 13.5 per cent of the IPounds 53bn
(Pounds 53bn) in EC structural funds it is expecting over the coming seven
years, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
Ireland has threatened to block any agreement on the funds' allocation if it
does not get its way. A spokesman for Mr Reynolds said yesterday: 'We cannot
accept a text of regulations on the disbursement of the fund without a clear
indication that our allocation will be in line with understandings reached
at Edinburgh.' Those understandings were that Ireland would maintain its
13.5 per cent share of the budget, he said.
After returning from the Edinburgh summit last December, Mr Reynolds told
the Dail (parliament): 'The agreement now reached ensures, and I say this
with complete confidence, that Ireland will obtain in excess of IPounds 8bn
over seven years.'
Attacking his critics who had accused him raising false expectations, he
described the summit as 'one of the greatest negotiating successes ever by
an Irish government.'

<TEXT>
THE EC Council of Ministers meets today to decide how to spend the
Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 109.4bn) structural aid programme agreed at last
December's Edinburgh summit, with clear signs of a row brewing over how to
divide up the pie among the 12.
The bulk of the money, available for 1994-99, is aimed at the four poorest
countries - Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece - which also get Ecu15.5bn
through the Cohesion Fund.
But the European Commission has sought to target as much as possible of the
so-called Structural Funds on declining and high unemployment industrial
areas, raising the stakes for the richer member states as well. Of the 12 as
a whole, only tiny, and very rich Luxembourg is happy with the way the
spending plans are shaping up.
The job of today's, probably lengthy meeting, attended by a mix of foreign,
industry, and regional affairs ministers, is to approve a framework
regulation for the spending, and the enabling rules for each division of the
Structural Funds. Already several countries are baulking at giving their
assent before knowing how much they are going to get.
Although approval is needed by the end of this month in order to start the
programme in 1994, there are already 53 declarations from member states
attached to the Commission's plans. The total Ecu157bn regional development
package replaces the Ecu63bn spending for 1989-93.
The four 'Cohesion' countries essentially won their battle last year,
getting a doubling of their funding for the six-year period, against the
previous five-year period. Apart from the Cohesion Fund, they get Ecu70bn of
the Ecu96.3bn devoted to so-called Objective 1, or backward areas.
But Ireland says it will block agreement unless it gets undertakings it will
preserve the share of Objective 1 funding it got in the previous round. This
gave the Irish two to two-and-a-half times more funds per head than the
other Cohesion countries.
Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, fought last year's Maastricht
referendum on a pledge to get IPounds 8bn (Pounds 8bn) from the package,
which he said he secured at Edinburgh. One senior Commission official says
'there is no way they are going to get what Reynolds said,' which officials
from other member states say was an irresponsible claim.
The Netherlands, a relatively small recipient, wants up to three times more
to reflect a relative decline in national wealth and growing unemployment.
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, told Commission president Jacques
Delors on Tuesday that Holland would only back an agreement if it got a
guarantee, Commission and Dutch officials say.
Though other countries have been less aggressive, they all have shopping
lists:
the UK wants, and will probably get, Merseyside and the Scottish Highlands
and Islands made Objective 1 areas. But it flatly opposes changes in the
Social Fund - hitherto for training the long-term and young unemployed - to
pay for retraining workers in companies facing restructuring, which one
British official described as 'a closet industrial policy.'
Belgium will probably get the declining southern industrial area of Hainaut
eligible for Objective 1 funding. France objects that neighbouring Nord-Pas
de Calais suffers identical problems. But Paris will probably desist, to
protect Corsica, whose rise in income above the eligibility level is what
lets Hainaut and Merseyside into Objective 1.
Germany is after at least DM13bn (Pounds 5.1bn) for its eastern Lander.
In addition, the Germans, British and French, want the right to designate
Objective 2, or industrially declining regions, a right Mr Delors refuses to
cede.
THE European Commission has broadly welcomed the application of Malta and
Cyprus to join the EC, but delayed a firm commitment on the timing of entry,
writes Lionel Barber.
The Commission's response may disappoint Malta, but it reflects concern that
further EC enlargement requires tackling the sensitive issue of how to
streamline the operations of the EC while safeguarding the position of
smaller states. The cause of Cyprus remains clouded by the failure to reach
a political settlement between the Greeks and Turks. But the Commission says
it may reconsider its views in January 1995 even if part of the island
remains under Turkish occupation. Until now, the EC has insisted that a full
political settlement in Cyprus, including reunification, is a pre-condition
for the start of accession negotiations.
This week's statement appears aimed at pressuring the parties to support a
UN-brokered settlement. Mr Hans van den Broek, EC commissioner responsible
for enlargement, said last Wednesday that the Commission was ready to help
preparations toward entry. But the timing would depend on decisions on
institutional reform to be considered at the inter-governmental conference
to review the Maastricht treaty in 1996.
Malta and Cyprus applied for EC membership in 1990. The Commission's opinion
on the application says their aspirations are justified and there no serious
obstacles. However, it calls on Malta to carry out an overhaul of economic
regulations as the best preparation for membership.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Bundesbank reward for fiscal chastity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LEIPZIG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIRTUE MAY BE its own reward but the Bonn government's vow of chastity in
matters fiscal yesterday won it a welcome bonus from the Bundesbank.
An unusually sunny Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German central
bank, noted first that it was the third anniversary of the introduction of
the D-Mark into eastern Germany. Then, passing over the widespread belief
that that event lies at the root of most of Germany's current problems, he
unveiled a cut of half a percentage point in the key discount lending rate.
The fifth since the bank started its tiptoe progression since last autumn,
it brought the bank's effective floor rate down to 6.75 per cent.
The move was backed up by a less expansive quarter-point snip off the
Lombard rate, now down to 8.25 per cent.
According to Mr Schlesinger, the cuts were prompted by comforting monetary,
political and economic indicators. But the closing link in the chain was
last weekend's coalition package of public spending cuts worth some DM25bn
(Pounds 9.8bn). Bonn, after considerable if subtle pressure from the
Bundesbank, had done as it was told. The coalition had come up with more
cuts rather than taxes to patch the gaps in its budget. Crucially, its
package was skilfully engineered to resist erosion by political opposition.
If the chain remains intact, the Bundesbank seem certain to offer more. They
are once more en route to chipping the discount rate to 6 per cent or even
lower by the end of the year. Longer term, said Mr Schlesinger, the rewards
may be more widely distributed if the economy turns up at the end of the
year, as he expects, as the taxation under the 'Solidarity Pact' may become
somewhat less of a burden.
The Bundesbank has made little apparent effort to conceal its scorn for
Bonn's attempt to tax its way out of the red with its springtime solidarity
pact. Just as its anger at having its advice ignored by government has been
reflected in the snail's pace progression of interest rate cuts (the last of
which was on April 23), so its pleasure at the weekend coalition deal was
reflected in yesterday's unexpectedly generous move.
Explaining the decision, Mr Schlesinger ran down his checklist, peppering
his routine script with optimistic asides. Inflation of 4.1 per cent last
month was still too high, but 'happily' the rate of growth was significantly
weaker.
Money supply growth in May eased to 6.7 per cent year-on-year, down from 7
per cent a month earlier, although it is still above the target ceiling of
6.4 per cent. A 'slight tendency' to weakness in the German currency had
stabilised in recent days. He noted that the economy was also stabilising.
He cited Hamburg economists' predictions that recovery would start at the
turn of the year.
Despite his apparent confidence, Mr Schlesinger well knows - and often says
 -that too much should not be read into short-term trends.
The Bundesbank prides itself on its medium- and long-term outlook, but its
decision yesterday seemed based mostly on recent developments which have yet
to become established trends.
Inflation is still expected to average 4 per cent this year - double the
bank's optimum level.
Optimism on the economy is based on an uncertain end to the decline in
output and a slight increase in foreign orders.
By the Bundesbank's own standards, such a delicate substructure demands
continuing caution.
But at the same time the delicate health of the international economy - and
particularly that in Germany - demands more than cheerful noises from Mr
Schlesinger and his colleagues.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Euro car price list seen as Brussels victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first mandatory pan-European new car price lists published yesterday at
the order of the European Commission show variations between countries of up
to 30 per cent. But most fall between the EC's own 12-18 per cent guidelines
and the Commission itself refrained from the harsh criciticism which parts
of the European industry had been fearing.
Under the terms of an agreement made with the Commission last year, Europe's
car makers and importers are required to publish price lists twice a year.
This followsfierce complaints from consumer organisations in Brussels and in
the UK claiming that price divergences are big enough and persistent enough
to breach EC regulations.
The lists released yesterday take the form of an index related to the prices
of 55 European and 17 Japanese top-selling models on May 1 this year, based
on recommended retail prices, adjusted for equipment differences and
converted to Ecus.
Among small cars, variations of up to 24 per cent were found - in the case
of Fiat's Cincequento - between the most expensive market, France, and the
cheapest, Spain.
In the large saloon category, Ford's new Mondeo 1.6LX saloon was found to be
23.9 per cent more expensive in Germany than in the cheapest markets, Italy
and Ireland. At the executive car level BMW's biggest variation was of 22
per cent, in the case of its 730i V8 model, in France, with the UK being the
cheapest.
The Commission, which hopes the information will help motorists to shop
around in the EC for best buys, acknowledged that exchange rate fluctuations
have played a large part in the variations. It added it would be wrong to
arrive at 'far-reaching conclusions' about manufacturers' commercial
policies from the price comparisons.
But it said the next report in November would enable the Commission to
assess the trend in price differentials, which it expects to diminish.
Last night the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, which has
persistently claimed the variations are largely outside the industry's
control, said the Commission's statement showed that exchange rate
fluctuations and widely varying taxation regimes were largely to blame for
the discrepancies and that these would have to continue until EC economies
themselves converged.
The issue is of profound importance to car makers and their dealers because
in 1995 the present 10-year 'block exemption' which allows them to operate a
selective distribution system - in contravention of EC competition rules -
is due to expire.
The EC competition directorate has warned that a renewal of the block
exemption will depend heavily on car prices staying broadly within the EC's
guidelines for price differentials.
These state that prices should not differ between EC member states by more
than 12 per cent in the long-term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of
less than a year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF German industry yesterday abandoned their recent harsh criticism
of the ruling coalition in Bonn, and praised a hard-fought compromise which
will cut corporation tax from 53 per cent to 47 per cent of earnings.
The deal, negotiated between the two houses of the German parliament, is
less generous in the headline tax rate than the German government originally
intended: the proposal approved by the Bundestag, the lower house, would
have cut the rate to just 44 per cent.
However the compromise negotiated after nine hours of talks late on
Wednesday will reinstate depreciation allowances for company investments of
up to 30 per cent, instead of cutting them to 25 per cent as planned.
That deal was welcomed yesterday by both the federation of German industry
(BDI) and the German chambers of industry and commerce (DIHT), both of which
have been highly critical of the government recently.
They had fought, supported by the opposition Social Democrats, to reinstate
the 30 per cent depreciation allowance.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Germany's partners to keep up pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's interest rate cuts will go some way to ease tension in the
European exchange rate mechanism and may limit criticism of German monetary
policy at next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Tokyo.
But, although the half-percentage point reduction in the discount rate to
6.75 per cent was more than the purely symbolic cut forecast by many
pundits, economists and commentators yesterday said Germany's trading
partners would expect further rate cuts from the Bundesbank in the future.
In recent weeks, foreign governments have been piling on the pressure for a
lowering of German borrowing costs in successive meetings of international
monetary officials. The tension increased sharply in the days ahead of
yesterday's Bundesbank council meeting in Leipzig.
Late last week, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, found
himself embroiled in a Franco-German row after demanding a German rate cut.
On Wednesday, President Bill Clinton joined the fray by saying the
Bundesbank should 'continue to lower interest rates' to boost the US and
global economies.
While economists in Germany yesterday emphasised that the Bundesbank had
limited room for manoeuvre in view of continuing high inflation, a high
public sector borrowing requirement, even after recent budget cuts, and the
relative weakness of the D-Mark on foreign exchange markets, many outside
Germany said the Bundesbank must do more.
'I don't think anyone will ease the pressure totally because of these cuts,'
predicted Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, in London.
'Given Germany's plans for tax increases and spending cuts, interest rates
should go down a lot further, to about 3 per cent,' he said.
However, Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF-Bank in
Frankfurt, said the bigger than expected cut in the discount rate showed
that Germany was more ready to assist the world economy than many people
anticipated. He said he expected the discount rate cut would be followed
quickly by reductions in bank lending rates which should be positive for its
own economy. Yesterday's rate cuts would enable the Bonn government to
appear at next week's G7 summit proclaiming that Germany had taken steps
both to reduce interest rates and limit its budget deficit, Mr Remsperger
said.
The Bundesbank's comment that it was 'continuing its policy of cautious rate
cuts' indicated that German interest rates had further to fall. However,
nobody should expect any promises at next week's G7 meeting because central
bankers would not be attending the talks.
In the ERM, the Bundesbank decision prompted rate cuts in Denmark, Ireland,
Belgium and the Netherlands, while Austria and Switzerland, which link their
currencies to the D-Mark, also cut rates. There was no early move to follow
the German rate cuts in France, although officials welcomed the Bundesbank
move.
In Britain, the Treasury also welcomed the German action but made clear that
UK base rates at 6 per cent would stay unchanged for the time being.
However, Mr Gordon Brown, the Labour party's economics spokesman, said the
government should announce a cut in rates as part of Europe-wide interest
rate reductions.
Mr Brown said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, must ensure that next
week's G7 summit 'addresses the need for co-ordinated worldwide action to
boost growth and employment'.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Foreigners restricted in French sell-off
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government will restrict investors outside the European Community
to a maximum of 20 per cent of the shares of the companies sold in its
forthcoming privatisation drive.
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, had originally hoped to abolish all
restrictions on foreign investment in the new privatisation legislation.
However, his government has agreed to accept a Senate amendment to
reintroduce the old 20 per cent limit imposed on the last state asset sales
during the mid-1980s.
The limit will apply to noyaux durs, the long-term investors who, the
government hopes, will take strategic stakes in privatised firms.
Partenariats, or companies involved in commercial joint ventures with state
firms due to be privatised, will be exempt. This means the limit would not
affect the long-mooted merger of Renault, the state-controlled motor group,
and Volvo, its Swedish partner.
The privatisation bill, which would enable the government to sell up to 21
public sector concerns from September, is expected to be passed on Monday.
France produced a record monthly trade surplus of FFr7.09bn (Pounds 826m) in
March, against FFr5.34bn in February, thereby ensuring that the trading
account stayed in the black throughout the first quarter, with a surplus of
FFr16.2bn.
However, the record surplus was due to a sharp fall in imports, to FFr84.4m
from FFr105bn in the equivalent month last year, reflecting the sluggishess
of the French economy. The level of exports fell to FFr91.5bn from FFr107bn
in March 1992.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Accountants fight ruling over Polly Peck work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO top accountants are fighting a temporary suspension ruling preventing
them undertaking new insolvency work, triggered by their appointment as
administrators to Polly Peck International.
Mr Michael Jordan and Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy
firm, are being scrutinised for breaches in ethical guidelines by accepting
the appointment when their firm had conducted work for PPI and Mr Asil
Nadir, its fugitive former chairman.
The work included offshore trust management and personal tax advice to Mr
Nadir, and advice to the company in the late 1980s on accounting methods for
its substantial foreign currency earnings which were quite legal but boosted
assets and profits.
The details emerged as Mr George Staple, head of the Serious Fraud Office,
backed its handling of the prosecution against Mr Nadir. In a BBC television
interview, he said defendants in large fraud trials 'are not short of
resources and use all means at their disposal for their defence'. At
Westminster there remained more general concern about the SFO. The
attorney-general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, was said to have raised with Mr Staple
the question of whether the SFO gave the media advance information about
arrests.
In further fall-out after the resignation speech of Mr Michael Mates, the
former Northern Ireland minister, on Tuesday, Labour called for a statement
from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on the alleged breach of
confidentiality by a senior Inland Revenue investigator in referring to the
SFO the affairs of Mr Nadir. The Revenue said last night that the allegation
was 'complete news to us'.
Mr Stone, head of corporate finance at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and Mr Jordan,
head of the insolvency arm, were last October each fined the then maximum
Pounds 1,000 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
for breaching guidelines stating insolvency practitioners should not be
appointed to a company with which their firm had 'a continuing professional
relationship'.
The matter was taken up by the insolvency licensing committee of the
institute, which met in secret but it is believed to have resolved to
recommend a temporary suspension on some new insolvency appointments by the
two men.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand appealed, and a review committee chaired by Mr Clive
Parritt, senior partner of accountants Baker Tilly, has now made a judgment
on the appeal, which is expected to be made public on Monday.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Taskforce calls for system to speed share settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TASKFORCE backed by the Bank of England yesterday urged the adoption of a
slimmed-down electronic system to speed up the settlement of equity share
trading in the London stock market.
At the heart of the plan is a move within the next year using existing stock
exchange technology to allow share transactions to be settled 10 days after
they are struck. Under the present system it takes two to three weeks to
complete a transaction.
By early 1995 the gap between bargains and settlement will narrow to five
days, leading, eventually, to same-day payments.
The system is intended to replace the London Stock Exchange's failed Taurus
project which was abandoned in March after costing the exchange and the City
of London up to Pounds 400m. The failure of Taurus led to the resignation of
Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive of the stock exchange. Under the plan,
announced by the Bank yesterday, proposed improvements to the present
Talisman system will be replaced by the new system, to be known as Crest, in
1996.
Under the plan, the exchange would no longer be the main provider of
settlement services in London. At the moment it is responsible for all share
dealings, which involves the physical movement of share certificates.
The Bank will form a new taskforce to set firm specifications for the Crest
system which will report in six to nine months.
The system will differ from Taurus in several respects:
Participation will be voluntary.
It will not require the complete abolition of paper share certificates, an
option likely to be used mostly by private investors.
It will have no central depository for record keeping.
Investors who want a longer settlement period will be able to negotiate that
with their broker.
Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England and taskforce
chairman, said the proposals would not be the first choice of all market
participants but they would satisfy most of them and avoid the conflicts of
interest which led to the end of Taurus.
The plans were cautiously welcomed by fund managers, brokers and custodians.
Mr Richard Weir, director general of the Institutional Fund Managers
Association, said: 'They seem to have met our greatest concerns: speed of
settlement and sponsorship by the Bank of England.'
Mr Kent said it had not been decided who would run the system. He did not
rule out a Bank of England-run system, but said: 'If we ran it, we would do

FT  02 JUL 93 / Bundesbank rate cuts offer boost to Europe's economies: US
welcomes 'positive' move / Four ERM countries follow suit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday officially blessed the German government's latest
budget cuts and offered the international economy a helping hand with a
reduction of half a percentage point in its discount rate.
The cut to 6.75 per cent in its official floor rate and a reduction of a
quarter point in the Lombard rate to 8.25 per cent was welcomed by Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, German economics minister, who said it would help the government
implement public spending cuts agreed by the ruling coalition earlier this
week.
'The cut will give an impulse to the German economy and at the same time
strengthen growth potential in other EMS countries,' he said. 'It secures
confidence in the D-Mark, without which economic recovery would be
impossible.'
The discount rate is the floor rate at which the Bundesbank finances the
banking system. The Lombard rate represents the Bundesbank's ceiling to
German money market rates.
In Washington, the White House described the Bundesbank's decision as
'positive'.
Mr Rexrodt said the Bundesbank was treading the delicate path between
support for the economy and 'the preservation of credibility in the D-Mark'.
The D-Mark rose against the dollar and most European currencies yesterday.
After some sharp swings in European trading, the D-Mark finished in London
at DM1.699 against the dollar,  1/2 a pfennig stronger than the previous
day, and in New York at DM1.693.
Sterling, however, continued to make inroads against the D-Mark, closing in
London at DM2.5625 - its highest position since devaluation last September.
In late New York trading it was at around DM2.5632.
Mr Ulrich Beckmann, senior economist at DB Research, the research arm of
Deutsche Bank, said the cut could 'only do good for the economy', adding:
'We are sure to see further cuts in interest rates, probably in September.'
Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, said the
cuts had been made first and foremost 'for domestic reasons'.
He added: 'It would have been undiplomatic to leave the cut until after the
G7 meeting next week. The move takes off the international heat.'
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank president, said in Leipzig that the
move - the first on internationally sensitive rates since April - meant no
one could now accuse Germany of being a high-rate country. The rate of
growth in both inflation and money supply had slackened, he said. The D-Mark
had stabilised after its recent weakness, and the government's new package
of DM25bn (Pounds 9.8bn) budget savings was a step in the right direction.
'It was especially important' that Bonn had made the main savings through
cuts in spending, Mr Schlesinger added. The government's proposals were the
only new or substantially changed factor in the criteria on which the bank
formulates interest rate policy.
In recent weeks, the bank has publicly identified runaway government
borrowing as the main force driving monetary growth, and therefore as the
main current source of future inflation.
The spending cuts proposals, agreed by the coalition government at the
weekend, were 'certainly suitable in the light of the state of public
finances', Mr Schlesinger said.
Within the ERM, the Bundesbank decision prompted rate cuts in Denmark,
Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, while Austria and Switzerland, which
link their currencies to the D-Mark, also cut rates, as did Sweden. Spain
was expected to cut rates today. Britain chose not to follow the German
move. The Treasury welcomed the Bundesbank rate cuts, but a spokesman said
UK base rates, which have been unchanged at 6 per cent since late January,
were consistent with ministers' policy objectives.
However, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, said that Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, should cut rates as part of European-wide interest
rate reductions.
Mr Brown said that Britain's economy was still sluggish in many areas in
spite of some promising signs. Retail sales had fallen for two consecutive
months, business failures were rising and the government was forecasting
falling investment, he said.
The announcement of a fixed rate volume tender for next week's auction of
securities repurchase agreements (repos) was taken by economists as a sign
that the Bundesbank is earnest in wanting to steer down money market rates.
The 28 basis point cut in next week's repo rate to 7.30 per cent comes after
a period of several months during which this core rate was trimmed via a
sequence of small cuts, more recently cuts of only 1 basis point.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Oil prices fall after US backs lifting of ban on Iraqi
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WORLD OIL PRICES tumbled yesterday after the US said it would allow Iraq to
export some oil if Baghdad agreed on conditions with the United Nations in
talks next week. Traders fear that the arrival of Iraqi oil could worsen the
glut on world markets.
World prices fell to six-month lows after Ms Madeleine Albright,
Washington's ambassador to the UN, said the US would raise no objections to
any accord reached on oil sales between Iraq and the UN. Negotiations are
due to begin next Wednesday.
The price of North Sea crude oil for August delivery dropped 50 cents in
busy trading to Dollars 17.20 per barrel. Prices had touched Dollars 18 a
barrel at the beginning of the week after the US air strike on Baghdad,
which many traders believed signalled a harder US line towards Saddam
Hussein's regime.
'The mood in the market is one of impending doom - the timing is terrible,
markets are not at all well balanced,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the
energy desk at commodity broker Smith Barney in London.
World markets are already awash with oil as members of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries continue to overproduce. Oil demand in the US
and Europe remains depressed by the recession.
'You could see the market go down several dollars if Iraqi oil returns and
it could get very nasty,' said Mr James Fiedler, energy trader at ED&amp;F Mann
in New York.
Iraq will be discussing a plan put forward by the UN Security Council two
years ago for exporting Dollars 1.6bn-worth (Pounds 1.06bn) of oil over six
months in order to pay for humanitarian aid such as food and medicines.
Baghdad has objected in the past to conditions attached to the sale, which
included the monitoring of the oil shipments by UN officials.
If this plan were to go ahead, it would mean Iraq exporting about 500,000
barrels a day of oil, adding to Opec's current overproduction which is
estimated to be about 700,000 b/d.
Large Opec producers such as Saudi Arabia are unlikely to cut their output
in order to make room for Iraq, although some members would push for an
emergency Opec meeting.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: German groups cut PVC capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST and Wacker, two leading German chemicals groups, are to close two
bulk PVC factories with a combined capacity of 90,000 tonnes a year.
The moves will follow the previously-announced merger of the companies' PVC
interests into a single company, Vinnolit Kunststoff, which takes effect
today.
Around 100 workers will be affected by the closures, which will leave the
new company with four German plants with a total of 580,000 tonnes annual
capacity and 1,200 employees.
The merger was announced last November as part of Hoechst's cost-cutting
programme, under which all the company's PVC interests apart from film would
be merged with those of Wacker, which is 50 per cent owned by Hoechst.
Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of the Frankfurt-based group, said then that
the new company would command 10 per cent of the western European market,
and offer savings of DM50m (Dollars 29.5m) a year.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Goldsmith to sell further slice
of Newmont holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JAMES Goldsmith, the semi-retired international financier, is for the
second time taking advantage of the recovery in the gold price he helped to
stimulate. He is selling another substantial part of his shareholding in
Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer.
The planned public offering of a 12.5 per cent Newmont stake would bring in
Dollars 440m at yesterday's price.
This follows his sale of 9.5 per cent of Newmont to a banking consortium for
about Dollars 290m on May 11, and the disposal on April 23 of a 10 per cent
Newmont stake to Mr George Soros, another high-profile financier, in the
deal which sparked the present gold price surge.
Sir James used some of the proceeds from Mr Soros's funds to buy call
options in the gold market. This helped push the gold price, which
languished at a seven-year low of Dollars 327 a troy ounce in January, to
Dollars 378.25 at the close in London yesterday, a rise of nearly 16 per
cent.
Gold share prices have also risen sharply as many other funds followed Mr
Soros's lead. Mr Soros paid Dollars 39.50 for each Newmont share; the
banking consortium re-sold its stake at Dollars 45.50 and yesterday the
price was above Dollars 52.
Sir James paid Dollars 1.1bn in cash, or Dollars 39 a share, when he and his
friend Lord (Jacob) Rothschild swapped timber assets for the Hanson
conglomerate's 49 per cent shareholding in Newmont in October, 1990.
When the public offering is completed, Sir James's investment vehicle,
General Oriental, will retain 5 per cent of Newmont and Lord Rothschild's
RIT Capital Partners, which is to contribute 1.16m Newmont shares to the
offering, will have 1.5 per cent.
Analysts suggest the Newmont purchase has not proved a particularly
wonderful investment. It returned about Dollars 50m in dividends during two
and a half years, an annual yield of 1.5 per cent. It is unlikely the
financiers will net much more than Dollars 1.2bn from share sales so far.
Sir James, who says gold will have its day again because the world's banking
system is in such a mess, said GO would invest most of the proceeds of the
public offering in physical gold and hold more gold than cash in its
treasury.
Analysts suggested that if Sir James used even half the proceeds to buy more
call options the gold price would probably be driven above Dollars 400 an
ounce.
Salomon Brothers, Lazard Freres and Smith Barney Harris Upham are managing
the underwriting of the public offering. Some 7.65m Newmont shares will be
sold in the US and 2m offered internationally.

THE TREASURY has set up a unit to co-ordinate policies to help industry in a
fresh sign that it is attempting a cultural change to make it more
sympathetic to wealth-creation, Peter Marsh writes.
The new unit will have a roving commission to explore ways that Treasury
policies could improve industrial competitiveness. The change is designed to
meet criticism from industry that the Treasury puts too many resources into
controlling public spending and not enough into understanding business.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'This change is exactly what the Treasury needs.' Mr Neil Johnson,
director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said it was 'a
step in the right direction'.
Credit insurance premiums on exports to Argentina and Lebanon are to be cut
from today by NCM, the leading credit insurer in the UK. Premiums for
Argentina are being cut from 6 per cent to 3.5 per cent and for the Lebanon
from 6.33 per cent to 4.5 per cent.

THE TREASURY has set up a unit to co-ordinate policies to help industry, in
a fresh sign that the department is attempting a cultural change to make it
more sympathetic to wealth-creation.
The new unit will have a roving commission to explore ways that Treasury
policies could improve industrial competitiveness, for example by releasing
funds for training, roads or railways.
The change is designed to meet criticism from industry that the Treasury
puts too many resources into control of public spending and not enough into
understanding business. It has come about as part of a review of Treasury
management by Sir Terence Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury.
The unit is headed by Mr Bill Guy, a senior Treasury official, and is part
of the department's industry division. The Treasury said: 'Mr Guy will be
taking an across-the-board look across all Treasury activities to make sure
all the industrial issues are picked up.'
The move comes after increasing recognition throughout Whitehall that
government departments may need to reformulate policies to help industrial
competitiveness, especially given the growing trade deficit.
Part of the unit's job will be to act as a link between the Treasury and big
companies, particularly manufacturers.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'This change is exactly what the Treasury needs.'
Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation,
said it was 'a step in the right direction'.
Punitive credit insurance premiums on exports to Argentina and Lebanon are
to be cut from today by NCM, the leading credit insurer in the UK. The
company says the cuts are the first ever, and are intended to aid Britain's
export effort.
Analysis pointing to lower risks of default means that premiums currently at
6 per cent for Argentina are being cut to 3.5 per cent. For the Lebanon, the
cut is from 6.33 per cent to 4.5 per cent.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Study reveals wide range of UK
farm earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOP 25 per cent of arable farms in East Anglia, the UK's main
grain-growing region, earn 176 per cent more per hectare than average farms
in the same area.
The latest government figures show that the average East Anglian combinable
cropping farm had a net income of Pounds 131 a hectare and a gross margin of
Pounds 592, according to a report to be launched at the Royal Agricultural
Show this weekend. The top farms earned Pounds 362 a hectare on a gross
margin Pounds 832.
The report - Competing in Changing Markets - has been put together by Adas,
the farming consultants and an executive agency of the Agriculture Ministry.
It describes the gap between the high and average earners in the arable
sector as 'startling'.
'We are seeing the introduction of more open market conditions in
agriculture,' says Mr David Hall, Adas marketing director. This was
beginning to highlight the difference between entrepeneurial and traditional
farmers.
'The entrepreneurs are constantly looking for ways of reducing costs and
opening up new opportunities for growth,' says Mr Hall. 'Some farmers appear
less willing to do so, either through complacency or simply because they are
happy with a lower return.
'But it is not certain how much longer they will be able to earn a living
from a lower return,' he warns.
On arable farms in the north of the country, average net income per hectare
was Pounds 92 while the top farms earned Pounds 256, or 178 per cent more.
In the south the average was Pounds 107, compared with Pounds 224 at the top
farms.
In the more controlled dairy sector, the difference between top and average
performers was much narrower - between 8 and 13 per cent.
Mr Hall argues that in order to survive, farmers will have to develop their
business acumen and adopt a more market-led approach. 'We are entering an
age of stiffening competition in which the safety net of EC support is
wearing thin and the market is becoming increasingly global for UK Farming
plc.'
UK producers should capitalise on their high standards of hygiene,
environmental friendliness and animal welfare, he suggests. They should also
start to add value by processing their production, and collaborate with
others in marketing.
He points out that consumers last year spent Pounds 70bn on food, while UK
agriculture's share was only Pounds 14bn. 'There is a massive opportunity
for our farmers and growers - in the UK market alone - to seize a bigger
share of consumer spend by moving up the food chain,' says Mr Hall.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: France Telecom bucks trend with
surge to FFr3.3bn

<TEXT>
FRANCE-TELECOM, the state-controlled telecommunications group, bucked the
gloomy trend in French industry by reporting a healthy increase in net
profits, from FFr2bn in 1991 to FFr3.3bn (Dollars 570m) last year.
The group, which claims to be the world's fourth largest telecommunications
concern, ahead of the UK's British Telecom, saw consolidated sales rise 5.9
per cent from FFr115.8bn in 1991 to FFr122.6bn in 1992.
Operating profits increased by 5.6 per cent over the same period, to
FFr30.2bn last year.
One of the main reasons for the improvement in France-Telecom's performance
was the progress of its debt reduction programme.
The group managed to reduce its net debt from FFr120.6bn at the end of 1991
to FFr111.6bn by the same stage in 1992. This reduction cut its financial
costs from 9.7 per cent of turnover to 8.4 per cent.
France-Telecom said it planned to reduce its debt further in 1993. Its hopes
to meet its target of trimming financial costs to 7 per cent of turnover
next year.
The increase in net profits also reflects France-Telecom's productivity
strategy.
The group reduced its workforce from 156,100 to 155,300 last year. It also
continued its policy of investing 4 per cent of turnover in research and
development.
Credit National, the French corporate banking group, is considering taking
minority stakes in some of the state-controlled companies due to be sold in
the government's privatisation drive.
Mr Yves Lyon-Caen, chairman, yesterday said his group would be particularly
interested in striking cross-shareholding agreements with suitable partners.

MR LEIF Ottosson, former head of the financial subsidiary of Skanska,
Scandinavia's biggest construction and property company, was jailed
yesterday for one year by a Stockholm court on charges arising from a SKr518
(Dollars 66.4m) loss incurred by Skanska last year on foreign currency
dealing.
Mr Ottosson, 37, was suspended as president of Skanska Kapitalforvaltning
last August when the loss came to light. His speculative spree helped
precipitate the resignation of Mr Lars-Ove Hakansson as chairman and chief
executive of Skanska.
Skanska accused Mr Ottosson of illegal currency speculation during the
summer when internal security measures were not fully enforced due to the
absence of other senior executives on holiday. It said he admitted
distorting reports to the board and changing figures in Skanska's computer.
The police were called in and Mr Ottosson was eventually convicted on
charges of breach of trust. The currency loss contributed to Skanska's
SKr3.53bn loss last year.

FINNAIR, the loss-making Finnish national airline, yesterday said it had
decided not to proceed with plans to replace its 10 McDonnell Douglas and
Airbus wide-bodied aircraft with Boeings because of the cost.
The airline announced in April that it had signed a letter of intent with
Boeing and International Lease Finance Corporation that envisaged the
replacement of Finnair's entire 44-strong fleet with a new fleet based on
the Boeing 676 and 737 families of aircraft by the end of the decade.
Since then Finnair has reported losses after financial items in the year to
the end of March 1993 of FM415m (Dollars 72.8m), more than double the loss
the previous year, and warned of a hard year ahead.

authority

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate's Democratic leaders were preparing yesterday to fight off an
attempt to amend the 'fast-track' negotiating authority the president has to
complete the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations by December
15.
Senator Fritz Hollings, a Democrat supporter of the textile industry, said
he would try to attach an aggressive provision - called Super 301  - to the
fast-track authorisation. Super 301 has loopholes which let the
administration avoid imposing sanctions but is disliked by US trading
partners, who see its listing of 'unfair traders' as US unilateralism.
The US administration, hoping to avoid a battle, has asked for a 'clean'
fast-track, free of measures which would offend US trading partners.
Lobbyists yesterday were asking senators not to 'embarrass' the president by
encumbering him when he discusses trade at the Tokyo summit next week.
In the hope of harmony at the summit, the administration yesterday delayed
announcing sanctions in its dispute with Japan over access to the
construction market.
But the administration's entire trade agenda looks fragile. A US federal
judge yesterday ruled that the North American Free Trade Agreement with
Mexico and Canada violates the National Environmental Policy Act.
Meanwhile, the 'quad' talks - the US, Japan, the EC and Canada, meeting in
Toronto - are stuck over a US retreat from the Bush administration's
position on reduction of textile tariffs. Ms Jennifer Hillman, chief textile
negotiator, has accepted US industry insistence that the quota phase-out be
tied to 'substantial market access commitments, especially from the
developing countries'.

<TEXT>
THE Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry (NHO) yesterday warned
the government that a dual-pricing system was emerging for domestic and
export electricity contracts, threatening to undermine the competitiveness
of Norwegian industry.
Norway is the most advanced of any European country in liberalising its
electricity market, allowing exports on a concession basis, but the NHO
yesterday said the government must also allow free access to electricity
imports, in order to stop dual pricing.
'What we are seeking to avoid is profits being made from expensive domestic
contracts, while cheap export contracts covering surplus power are agreed,'
said Mr Karl Glad, an NHO executive.
He warned in a letter to Mr Finn Kristensen, industry and energy minister,
of electricity price differentiation, price manipulation, dumping and
monopolistic tendencies by Norway's big electricity producers.
He said costs for new transmission cables between Norway and the rest of the
continent were being subsidised by high domestic electricity prices.
NHO is particularly sceptical of a recent supply contract agreed by
Statkraft, the domestic power company, and Germany's PreussenElektra. The
25-year deal covers the equivalent of twice the annual electricity
consumption by Oslo.

THE Australian government admitted yesterday it had little chance of cutting
deeply into record dole queues before the end of the decade.
Mr Kim Beazley, employment minister, said there was only a slight chance of
the jobless rate falling to pre-recession levels of 6 per cent by the turn
of the century. More than 1.6m jobs would have to be created in the next few
years.
A small rise in exports, however, has given the gloom-ridden Australian
economy a breather. The current account deficit in May fell to ADollars
1.5bn (USDollars 1bn), seasonally adjusted, from the previous month's
ADollars 1.7bn shortfall.
While the performance was not startling, the jittery market reacted
favourably to the near-target outcome. The Australian dollar closed half a
cent higher against the US dollar; during the previous two months there had
been massive selling of the Australian currency following higher than
expected deficits.
The current account deficit for the 11 months to May was ADollars 14.3bn,
and the outcome for the year is expected to be near the budget forecast of
ADollars 15bn.

THE US will continue to provide stability in South-east Asia, Mr Clifton
Wharton, US deputy secretary of state, has told regional leaders.
Mr Wharton, in Manila on the last leg of a South-east Asian tour which has
covered Cambodia and the six member-states of the Association of South-east
Asian Nations (Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and
the Philippines - said yesterday he perceived there was, prior to his visit,
'considerable concern' that the US was withdrawing from the region. But he
stressed this was not the case.
His message had been 'well received' in each country he had visited, Mr
Wharton said.
There had been 'strong appreciation' of his assurance that Washington
planned to remain involved in the region, particularly from the standpoint
of economic and security engagements.
The US withdrew from its military bases in the Philippines in November last
year following the non-renewal of a treaty covering the installations.
American forces still maintain facilities in Japan and South Korea.
Analysts have expressed fears that the US military's pullout could lead to
an arms race among the countries in the region, or that a large economic
power, such as China, could 'fill the vacuum' left by the Americans.

FT  01 JUL 93 / India awaits a signal from the heavens: Stefan Wagstyl
observes the vagaries of the monsoon and its immediate impact on the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the early summer, the plains of northern India become so hot that
even a dust storm comes as a welcome relief to the villagers of Sherpur, a
hamlet in southern Rajasthan.
The powdery clouds that cover everything in a grey-brown grit obscure the
sun and, briefly, the temperature drops. Occasionally, a few drops of rain
fall, a harbinger of the monsoon which usually comes at the end of the
month.
These are the worst days of the year for Sherpur. Not only must the
villagers endure the heat and the dust, but they fret about the monsoon.
When will it arrive this year? How big will it be? Will it come at all?
Despite the government's emergency food stockpiles, a good monsoon is still
a matter of life and death in remote villages. For tens of millions of rural
Indians, including the villagers of Sherpur, good rains represent the
difference between a year of plenty, when money can be set aside for a
wedding or for a bicycle, and a year of subsistence living.
For the economy as a whole, good rains add 1 percentage point to the growth
rate; widespread drought can remove at least as much and more.
The residents of India's cities are protected from the extremes of the
weather, but they too cannot escape the effects of the monsoon. Even Bombay,
the country's most modern metropolis, is subject to the vagaries of the
weather.
Last year, the rains came so late that the city authorities started
rationing water to prevent the reservoirs running dry. Newspapers ran
stories counting down to the day the water was expected to run out. Then on
August 12 - two months late - it rained.
In 1991 there were floods. Traffic was brought to a standstill in low-lying
parts of the city. The trains stopped running as water washed over the
rails. Mr Sharad Kale, the city's commissioner, or chief executive, says:
'Bombay is built on a string of seven islands. We have filled in the gaps
but many areas lie at sea-level or below sea-level. You can imagine what
happens.'
Each day of heavy flooding costs the city millions in lost production, not
to mention the damage done to buildings and property.
d3 The Bombay Municipal Corporation is preparing a Rs60bn flood control plan
which involves rebuilding drains and sewers, some of which date back to
Victorian times. 'The trouble is,' says Mr Kale, 'people want improvements
but don't want to pay for them'.
This year's monsoon has started well, bringing good rains to farmers in
south India. Keeping to its traditional course, it moved in from the Arabian
sea into the south western tip of India in the first few days of June.
From there, it has spread, as normal across peninsula India towards the east
coast. If the usual patterns prevail, it should make a U-turn over the Bay
of Bengal and spread across northern India from the east.
However, the usual patterns do not always prevail. The difficulty of
forecasting the monsoon has exercised Indians for centuries. Astrologers,
priests, and scientists have all tried and failed to find the perfect way of
predicting the monsoon.
The burden of forecasting falls heaviest on Mr N Sen Roy, the director
general of the country's meteorological office. Mr Roy sits in front of a
computer screen covered with black and white patches superimposed on a map
of India. With it he tracks the monsoon.
'I can tell you where it is raining now,' says Mr Roy, 'but I cannot tell
you for certain where it will rain in future.' For this year, Mr Roy has
forecast a 'normal' monsoon, meaning one which brings rains of within 10 per
cent of the long-term average. If he is right, it will mean the sixth year
in succession of adequate rains.
For Mr Roy, the monsoon's scientific interest lies in its unpredictability.
He tracks 16 variables, ranging from snowfall in the Himalayas to wind
patterns in the southern Pacific.
He points to a large wooden board where the names of his predecessors are
listed, going back to 1886. His hero is Sir Gilbert Walter, who held office
from 1904 to 1924 and devised formulae which are still used today.
Mr Roy warns against reading too much into monsoon forecasts. The monsoon is
not a front, blown in from the sea, like rains from the Atlantic are in the
UK.
Such weather patterns tend to sweep across whole regions uniformly. The
monsoon is created by a complex mix of changes in air temperatures and
winds, therefore it can bring rain to one village and none at all to another
only a few miles away.
So the villagers of Sherpur can do little to protect themselves against the
vagaries of the weather. 'Rich farmers can choose which crops to sell and
which to stockpile,' says Mr Roy, 'Poor farmers have few choices.'

Announcing the foundation of 'Political Spring', Mr Samaras called for a

earlier this week of Mr Yannis Averoff, a prominent backbencher in the
ruling New Democracy party, could presage the departure of other
personalities, making it increasingly difficult for Mr Mitsotakis to govern
effectively. His authority has been eroded recently by accusations that he
was involved in an illegal phone-tapping operation now being investigated by
judicial authorities.

FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Devro surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sausage casing manufacturer Devro International came to the market at 170p
and immediately went to a hefty premium on strong institutional business.
One salesman said: 'It's been nothing but buyers for most of the day. There
are still a lot of unsatisfied investors out there.'
With the initial placing over three times oversubscribed, the pent up demand
pushed the trading range to the 195-200p level, although profit-taking took
the shine off the rise towards the end of the session. The shares closed at
193p, a first-day premium of 23, with a hefty 30m traded.
However, food manufacturing analysts were optimistic that Devro would retain
its present levels, possibly with some upside to come. Mr Tim Potter at
Smith New Court said: 'Most investors have bought into Devro on a long-term
basis. This is a quality stock with good prospects.'
While the recovery at Ratners continued, with losses dropping sharply in its
results yesterday, stores specialists continued to be gloomy over the
prospects for investors. However, there was still plenty of small
speculative investors betting on a limited recovery for the jewellery group
to ensure the shares closed 3 1/2 up at 35 1/2 p with a hefty 19m traded.
While Ratners, which also announced it was changing its name, was insisting
privately yesterday that it would break even this year, few analysts were
confident enough to change their profit forecasts and most stayed around the
Pounds 10m deficit level.
A Japanese press report that Tokyo was poised to slash whisky duties sent
Guinness shares sharply forward. However, although government sources were
said to have partly confirmed the story, the cuts are likely to have
negligible bearing on Guinness' revenues. The realisation took the wind out
of the shares advance and they closed 6 ahead at 471p, after 475p.
The market was disappointed with the Pounds 86m Allied Lyons received for
the sale of its Chateau Latour wine subsidiary, a figure of Pounds 100m
having long been mooted. Allied shares slipped 3 to 537p.
Forte continued its strong recovery, adding 5 to 227p, amid talk of a
presentation at SG Warburg, the merchant bank. Ladbroke gained 5 1/2 to
185p.
After buying a near-15 per cent stake in LWT on Tuesday, Granada opened
weakly, dropping 10 at the outset. However, favourable press and broker
comment helped the shares to recover during the day and the they closed a
penny firmer at 418p.
Calm returned to the television stocks after the previous day's flurry of
buying. LWT convertible preference shares held on to their 466p level after
the company announced that Mercury Asset Management was one of the previous
day's sellers to Granada.
The sector's star performer was Scottish Television which enjoyed a rise of
21 to 545p.
A solid set of results from GEC left the market largely unmoved, although
prompted a round of modest upgrades. The shares edged forward a penny to 339
1/2 p.
Tuesday's announcement of the discount for individual subscribers to BT3
together with the start of the institutional round of presentations ensured
British Telecom stayed in positive territory. The shares rose 5 1/2 to 428
1/2 p.
British Steel continued to be weakened by concerns about overcapacity in
European steel. The shares gave up 2 1/2 to 94 1/2 p, in trade of 6m with
NatWest Securities reported to have been among the day's main seller of the
stock. Further hopes of an increased offer for bid target Securiguard saw
the shares harden 2 to 315p. Its predator Rentokil edged a penny forward to
204p.
Rumours of a downgrade in Boots left the shares 4 adrift at 442p.
Results from Eastern Electric sent the shares forward, although they later
faded to close unchanged at 472p. A stock overhang was said to have hindered
Scottish Hydro, off 5 at 336p.
Healthcare group Amersham International climbed 10 to 798p, with Credit
Lyonnais Laing issuing a strong buy recommendation on what it sees as
improved margins.
Starmin, the quarry products group, fell a penny to 2 3/4 p after the
company's annual report was deferred and the chief executive Mr Osman
Abdullah quit.
A negative stance by SG Warburg on Coats Viyella sent the price down 4 to
243p. Analyst Mr Laurence Rubin: 'We thought Coats had probably run a bit
too far although there is nothing fundamentally wrong.' The broker advised a
switch into Courtaulds, which closed a penny lighter at 538p.
Yield considerations strengthened some property companies with a buy
programme also boosting share prices.
Slough Estates moved ahead 10 to 215p and Land Securities rose 7 to 597p.
Ascot Holdings returned to trading after suspension finishing the day at 6
1/2 p after its pre-suspension level of 16 1/2 p.

<TEXT>
Financial stocks in both the banks and insurance sectors underpinned the
rise in the market yesterday.
In banks, whose reporting season kicks off later this month, it was a
bullish joint note from Robert Fleming and Dun &amp; Bradstreet that fuelled the
rise in Barclays. Both brokers pointed out that the bank had the biggest
exposure to the UK property sector and it was a likely beneficiary from its
expected recovery. The shares gained 11 to 483p, in thin trade of 2.1m.
Speculation that Lloyds was about to off-load its 4.68 per cent stake in
Standard Chartered helped the former harden 10 to 580p, and the latter to
relinquish 5 to 778p. Renewed talk that TSB had at last found a buyer for
Hill Samuel, its merchant banking arm, helped it gain 2 to 195p.
In insurance stocks, most of the day's main action centred around the
composite insurers. The biggest rise was in General Accident where the
shares jumped 19 to 623p, after two leading brokers visited the group's US
operations, coming away with a very positive picture.
The appointment of Mr John Carter as the new chief executive of Commercial
Union cheered the market and the shares advanced 14 to 615p, with a slight
squeeze having played a part in the rise. Also firm was Royal Insurance
Holdings where the shares closed 5 better at 315p, while Sun Alliance put on
6 to 357p.

FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: US deal boosts Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in Hanson jumped to 21m after the market was enlivened by the news
that the international conglomerate is to acquire Quantum Chemical, the US
Polyethylene and industrial chemicals group, in an agreed Dollars 3.2bn
deal.
Excited market watchers said the move may be the first signs of the return
of big corporate deals after a four year absence. Hanson shares, which had
eased to 222p just before the mid-afternoon announcement, closed 4 ahead at
226 1/2 p.
Hanson is paying Quantum share holders by issuing 42m American Depositary
Receipts(ADRs) and will also assume Dollars 2.5bn of debt, to be refinanced
at lower levels. It later indicated it would be making a saving of Dollars
125m in the first year.
Analysts said the issuing of ADR's will raise the level of US holdings in
Hanson to around 27 per cent. The company has indicated it would like to see
that level at around 50 per cent, as the US contributes around half of the
group's earnings.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said: 'This is a very good deal as Hanson
has managed to buy Quantum at the bottom of the cycle and there should be
big gains with the recovery in its markets. What is more, Hanson has the
balance sheet to deal with the huge debt that comes with the acquisition.'

FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS held the key to the fortunes of the stock index futures with a
lacklustre start to trading ahead of the gilt auction results, Christine
Buckley writes.
The announcement that the auction was only 1.1 times oversubscribed against
a market expectation of 1.5 times unnerved some investors and the September
contract fell to 2,900 its low of the day, its recent resistance level.
September followed the recovery in the gilts and was aided by technical
support.
There were few other pointers for a market which managed a volume of only
6,640 contracts. Some of its buoyancy was attributed to window dressing at
the end of the second quarter.
Faint hopes of interest rate cut hopes rose to the surface on the thinking
that if gilt auctions attract fewer buyers the government may have to
stimulate interest with a rate cut.
The index hit its high of 2,922 just after Wall Street opened with sellers
pushing it down slightly in late trading to a finish of 2,917. As in the
previous day's trade it mustered a close of 6 points ahead of its fair value
premium to cash of 11 points.
Hanson performed well in traded options on news of its acquisition of
Quantum Chemical with 6,589 lots traded - well ahead of the Euro-FT-SE which
saw 3,357 lots change hands. Total turnover was 32,381.

FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Late rise sees Footsie close at 2,900
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST trading session of the half-year saw UK equities stage a strong
late move to regain the 2,900-level on the FT-SE 100 index, shrugging off
the effects of what was initially seen as a disappointing outcome to the
latest gilt auction.
The catalyst for the recovery in equities was the announcement in the early
afternoon of Hanson's acquisition for Dollars 3.2bn of Quantum Chemical, the
US polyethylene manufacturer and the subsequent rally in gilt-edged stocks
after the market had time to rethink its views of the gilt auction.
In Germany the Bundesbank lowered its repurchase rate from 7.59 per cent to
7.58 per cent, a move which did nothing to dispel market hopes that a
reduction in Germany's key discount and Lombard interest rates could be on
the cards today when the Bundesbank's policy making council meets in
Leipzig.
Senior dealers in London said the faltering recovery in the US and the
French unemployment figures pointed to further reductions in international
interest rates. 'Even if the Germans don't cut tomorrow, they will before
July is out,' said one trader.
The FT-SE 100 opened around two points easier, unsettled by Wall Street's
overnight decline, but quickly moved into positive territory during the
first hour of trading following an upturn in the FT-SE future and the
appearance of some keen buying interest in the leaders, notably in the
financial sectors.
However, news that the record Pounds 3.25bn gilts auction was subscribed for
only 1.1 times, against expectations of 1.5 to 2 times, undermined
confidence in gilts which came under pressure before staging a good rally.
Only marginally higher over the lunchtime period, the FT-SE 100 moved into
overdrive when the Hanson acquisition news was announced. The index settled
14.0 up at exactly 2,900 at the close, easily outpacing the more sluggish
FT-SE Mid-250 index, although the latter kept up its good run, ending the
day 6.6 higher at a peak 3,235.7. Turnover in equities totalled 550.4m
shares, marginally down on Tuesday's level. After dipping below the Pounds
1bn on Monday, the value of customer business in the market increased to
Pounds 1.1bn on Tuesday, according to Stock Exchange figures.
The market's latest newcomer, Devro International, staged a sizzling debut,
at one point racing up to a 26p premium on the 170p flotation price before
easing back.
Bank shares raced higher, led by Barclays after a joint research document
prepared by Robert Flemings and Dun and Bradstreet focused on the 63 per
cent proportion of Barclays' property book in the South East.
TSB moved higher amid dubious stories that the bank's Hill Samuel merchant
bank was about to be sold for Pounds 780m. Standard Chartered stood out as a
lone poor performer in the banks, following rumours that Lloyds may be about
to unload its 4.68 per cent stake, acquired during its unsuccessful takeover
bid for standard in the 1980's.
Traders adopted a much more bullish view of UK equities following the Hanson
deal, which it was said transformed the mood of the market. 'Hanson set the
tone and moving into the third quarter we expect more support from the
institutions,' said a senior marketmaker at a leading UK house.

FT  01 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow flat as equities await
NAPM data
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US prices were flat-to-firmer yesterday as the financial markets prepared
for tomorrow's all-important employment figures, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.77 at 3,516.08.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.16 lower at 450.52, while
the Amex composite finished up 0.72 at 434.24, and the Nasdaq composite up
2.88 at 703.95. Trading volume on the NYSE was 282m shares.
After Tuesday's string of bad economic reports, investors and dealers were
reluctant yesterday to push prices higher. The day's economic news - a
slight rise in the Chicago purchasing managers' index of local economic
activity and a 1.4 per cent decline in May factory orders - was mixed, and
had little impact upon a market that remains deeply concerned about the
erratic progress of the economy.
Some participants chose to stay on the sidelines, awaiting today's National
Association of Purchasing Management's index, which should give a reading of
nationwide business activity, and, more importantly, tomorrow's June
employment report. Analysts are expecting the report to show a rise of
between 100,000 and 150,000 in non-farm payrolls, which would be consistent
with a below-par economic recovery.
American Express firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 as investors seemed
to welcome management changes instigated by the travel and financial
services group's recently appointed chief executive, Mr Harvey Golub.
Analysts said that the changes reinforced Mr Golub's hold on the company.
Quantum Chemical soared Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 19 on news that the UK
group Hanson is to buy the company for Dollars 3.2bn in a stock swap
involving Hanson's American Depositary Shares. The news left the price of
Hanson's ADS unchanged at Dollars 17 in volume of 2.7m shares.
Gillette rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 55 after it launched a new version of its
hugely successful 'Sensor' razor.
Telmex, the big Mexican telecommunications group, dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 46 3/4 on fears that the North American Free Trade Agreement between
the US, Canada and Mexico may have been dealt a serious blow by the ruling
of a US district judge that Nafta violates the National Environment Policy
Act.
Enron fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/8 afer the company agreed to
contribute Dollars 250m over three years to a joint energy investment
venture with the big Californian public pension fund Calpers.
CompUSA fell Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 29 1/2 following a warning from the
technology retailer that fourth-quarter net income would come in at the low
end of market expectations.
Canada
TORONTO prices closed little changed in busy trading, as a late-session
rally lifted the TSE-300 composite index out of negative territory.
According to preliminary figures, it rose 3.14 points to close at 3,966.7,
in turnover of 78.9m shares valued at CDollars 804.
Northern Telecom continued its decline in heavy trading, following last
Friday's forecast of disappointing results. It slipped to 31 3/4 on volume
of 2.3 m shares, bringing its total decline this week to 13 3/8.

FT  01 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets Petrobras climb drives Brazilian
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the world's emerging markets last week, Brazil and Malaysia featured
with a respective gain and loss in US dollar terms, according to data
supplied by the IFC.
Brazil remains one of the year's strongest performers, a fact mirrored by
the Bovespa index which has shown a year-on-year rise of some 70 per cent.
Mr Eduardo Faria of Latin American Securities in London notes that investors
have recently been taking positions on possible privatisation issues; while
Petrobras, the oil group, has been particularly strong on rumours of price
increases.
One of the market's most heavily traded companies, Petrobras has shown a
year-on-year rise of some 174 per cent in US dollar terms, with a
substantial percentage of that happening over the last month.
Mr Faria believes that the market is now due for a period of consolidation,
with a downside forecast of between 10-20 per cent.
'It will be healthy for the market to take a breather,' he says. 'The
question is whether foreign investors will see this as an opportunity to
come into Brazil.'
Malaysia fell back last week on technical trading on margin calls in second
line stocks. However, says Mr David Bates of Asia Equity, the underlying
blue chip market held up well. The release of good economic data yesterday,
showing a fall in inflation, should lift sentiment in the medium term,

FT  01 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt gives up ground on
position-squaring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was much discussion, and not a little optimism about German interest
rate prospects, although Frankfurt itself was not obviously bullish, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT squared its positions at the end of the second quarter and ahead
of today's Bundesbank meeting. The DAX index fell 10.70 to 1,697.63,
cyclicals leading the way down, as turnover fell from DM7bn to DM6.6bn.
Yesterday's trend was technical, and a note from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf
bore this out. The second quarter's individual leaders were all cyclicals,
Volkswagen coming top again with three and six-month gains of 18.5, and 49.7
per cent respectively. The losers were all banks, Bayernverein, Bayernhypo
and Dresdner shedding 7.8, 6.3 and 5.9 per cent.
Volkswagen managed its gains in spite of a DM7.70 fall to DM362.50 after its
Audi subsidiary announced a first-half loss and a 29 per cent decline in
sales. MAN and Daimler followed suit in the automotive sector with falls of
DM5 to DM281.80, and DM7.90 to DM613.80. The banking sector was only
slightly lower on the day.
PARIS eased slightly on the expiry of options and futures, the CAC-40 index
losing 5.63 to 1,971.87, as turnover rose to FFr4bn.
Kleinwort Benson, in its latest monthly research paper on France, forecast
that fresh interest rate cuts will both sustain and then buoy up the equity
market. 'Lower rates might add three points to the market's p/e ratio,' it
said; company profits are more resilient than they may appear; and a change
in the structure of domestic savings will release funds into the market'.
St Gobain, a cyclical used as an economic indicator, eased FFr5 to FFr508 as
James Capel sharply downgraded its profit forecasts for 1993 and 1994.
Eridania Beghin-Say, a component of the Italian debt-laded Ferruzzi group,
denied comment that it might be sold, but the shares nevertheless gained
FFr60 or 8.3 per cent to FFr779.
AMSTERDAM saw strength in Philips, which closed 90 cents higher at a
12-month high of Fl 30.10. Investors were encouraged by news that the group
expected a Fl 1.1bn extraordinary gain from the sale of its stake in
Matsushita Electronics.
The CBS Tendency index finished 0.3 ahead at 112.5.
ZURICH ended slightly firmer as dealers speculated about the outcome of
today's Bundesbank meeting.
The discussion seemed to ignore a television interview by Mr Markus Lusser,
president of the Swiss National Bank, which included the statement that high
Swiss money supply growth limits the immediate latitude for another interest
rate cut. In the banking sector, bearers in UBS, SFr5 higher at an all-time
high of SFr1,100, topped the active list.
MILAN was buffetted by some disappointing news from Fiat at its annual
meeting, continued nervousness over the outcome of talks on reaching a wage
accord, and the possibility of delay in the passage of the crucial electoral
reform bill through parliament.
The Comit index edged 0.74 higher at 536.15. Mr Michele Pacitti, an Italian
analyst at NatWest Securities in London, commented that the likelihood of
elections this autumn had been receding because of opposition to certain
aspects of the reform bill. However, after the close of trading yesterday
the bill was finally approved by the chamber of deputies.
Support for the market again came from the telecommunications sector with an
indication that the government aims to accelerate its reorganisation. Stet
rose L140 to L3,590 and Sip, likely to be merged with Italcable, gained L17
to L2,580.
The market had already discounted most of the Fiat data revealed at the
annual meeting, concentrating instead on Mr Giovanni Agnelli's statement
that losses would be offset by sales of 'non-strategic assets'. Most
analysts believe this to refer to Rinascente, Toro and Cogefar. Fiat shares,
which had advanced L158 to L6,490 at the fix, slipped back to L6,350 on the
kerb.
MADRID was convinced that the Bundesbank would cut rates said one trader, as
the general index closed 1.80 higher at 259.84. Banks were the most obvious
beneficiaries with Argentaria up Pta115 to Pta4,725, and Santander Pta140
better at Pta5,800.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index close at an all-time high, 10.48 higher at
1,279.53, pushed up by hopes of a German rate cut and a climb in Petrofina
after the oil company's shares breached resistance at BFr9,000.
Petrofina jumped by BFr340, or 3.8 per cent to BFr9,200, up by more than 8
per cent since last Friday. One trader linked the gains to a plan for the
upgrading of the Ekofisk North Sea field, due to be unveiled today.
VIENNA drifted lower late in the day, the ATX index falling 6.29 to 851.7
with dips in two recently strong stocks, OMV and Creditanstalt preferred.
OMV fell Sch16 to Sch711 after the nationalised industries minister, Mr
Viktor Klima, said that he would want the government to retain a veto on key
decisions even after the company is fully privatised. Creditanstalt
preferred lost Sch14 to Sch596.
ISTANBUL'S market index fell 330.9, or 2.9 per cent to 10,778.6 on heavy
selling amid reports of political rows over a confidence vote for the new
cabinet.

ebullient as Japan remains subdued

SHARE prices moved within a narrow range on continued fears that the bribery
scandal which shook the market on Tuesday could spread further, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average finally rose marginally on investment trust support,
closing 45.58 higher at 19,590.00 after a low of 19,433.99 and a high of
19,616.81. Trading was dominated by arbitrage-related selling, and buying by
investment trusts and some overseas investors.
Volume remained subdued at 230m shares against 229m. Losers led gainers by
594 to 395, with 166 issues remaining unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.01 to 1,580.25 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.31 to 1,195.10.
Most investors remained on the sidelines after Tuesday's 1.7 per cent fall,
which followed the arrests of general contractor executives and Mr Toru
Ishii, mayor of Sendai in northern Japan, on allegations of bribery.
Officials at Hazama, Shimizu, Nishimatsu Construction and Mitsui
Construction were charged with giving a combined Y100m in bribes to Mr
Ishii.
Shares of construction companies were sold heavily in the morning, but the
sector ended mixed on buying by overseas investors and investment trusts.
Nishimatsu fell Y20 to Y990 and Mitsui lost Y3 to Y502, but Shimizu ended up
Y6 to Y826.
Rohm, a leading maker of integrated circuits, drew heavy buy orders at the
start of the session on reports that the company had won a patent on flash
memory chips, a next generation technology, in the US. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange suspended trading to allow investors to confirm the news.
Large capital issues were slack on arbitrage selling. Nippon Steel, the most
active issue of the day, fell Y3 to Y366, while Mitsubishi Heavy lost Y20 to
Y710.
Brokers also lost ground on fears of lower profits due to the recent fall in
market turnover. Nomura Securities fell Y20 to Y1,950 and Daiwa Securities
lost Y20 to Y1,250.
Game makers were in favour among traders. Sega Enterprises gained Y240 to
Y10,000, recovering the level for the first time since April, and Nintendo
advanced Y100 to Y9,600. Konami, which also supplies liquid crystal displays
for pachinko games, Japanese pinball machines, rose Y220 to a new year's
high of Y5,320 on a rise in shipments.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 113.89 to 21,680.39 in volume of 13.1m
shares.
Roundup
EBULLIENCE in Australian golds conflicted with muted sentiment in Hong Kong
and Singapore. Pakistan was closed at the start of a four-day holiday.
AUSTRALIA closed its financial year with another lift from gold stocks.
Bullion traded at around USDollars 380 an ounce in Sydney with brokers
predicting that it would test the USDollars 400 level in the short term, and
the gold share index rose 54.2 to 1,928.3.
Most blue chips were also higher, led by strength in National Australia Bank
as book-balancing dominated trade. The All Ordinaries index rose 19.6 to
1,738.1, while turnover rose from ADollars 392m to ADollars 407m.
Among gold stocks, Kidston rose 28 cents to ADollars 2.40 and Placer 15
cents to ADollars 3.10. National Australia Bank rose 10 cents to ADollars
9.88 and Western Mining 16 cents to ADollars 5.80
NEW ZEALAND edged up to a new 1993 high, thanks mostly to a four-cent gain
in Fletcher Challenge to NZDollars 2.79. The NZSE-40 index rose 1.32 to
1,680.66 in healthy turnover of NZDollars 40m with Fletcher Challenge
attracting some NZDollars 11.15m. Brokers said that they expected little
tradeable news out of the budget, due tonight.
SEOUL saw institutional intervention in financial shares as the composite
index rose 3.18 to 748.87 in turnover up from Won451.3bn to Won526.9bn.
The financial sub-index added 8.24 to 1020.95 and Kepco gained Won300 to
Won17,600.
MANILA closed higher for the third straight day, fuelled by a technical
rally and efforts by companies to improve their second quarter performance
reports. The composite index ended another 8.63 higher at 1,577.41.
JAKARTA closed firmer in active trade, the JKSE index rising 1.51 to 360.35.
PT Pan Brothers Tex, a major textile and garment producer, recovered Rp25 to
Rp1,725 after falling Rp150 on Tuesday. The company said that rumours that
it had serious bad debts, and that an insurance claim had failed were
untrue.
TAIWAN dropped 1.8 per cent and breached the 4,000 support level, the
weighted index closing 72.32 lower at 3,995.51. Turnover shrank from
Tuesday's TDollars 16.7bn to TDollars 12.4bn ahead of today's holiday.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Bundesbank cuts rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK made a token gesture towards interest rate reductions when it
shaved 0.01 per cent off its minimum security repurchase agreements, taking
it down from 7.59 to 7.58 per cent, writes Gillian Tett.
But the small scale of the reduction left the markets deeply uncertain about
the likelihood of further interest rate cuts at today's meeting of the
central bank's policy-making council.
The deep recession in Germany, coupled with recent government spending cuts,
left some traders hoping that the Bundesbank might be prodded into further
action today, particularly in light of President Clinton's call for a cut in
German rates yesterday.
However, concern about German inflation left the majority sceptical that the
Bundesbank would relax its policy.
'Everybody knows that interest rates have got to come down within the next
month. But we would be surprised to see any real cut in the Lombard or
discount rate this week,' commented one dealer.
On the back of this speculation, the trading in D-Mark futures remained
stuck within a very narrow band. After a day of heavy dealing, the September
contract closed at 93.24, up 2 basis points on the day. At this level
dealers are pricing three month money at 6.76 per cent.
Trading in sterling futures in London markets was also lively. Speculation
that sterling's growing strength against the D-Mark might increase the
pressure for an interest rate cut later this year helped to push sterling
futures slightly higher across the board.
The September contract closed at 94.23, eight basis points up on the day.
The December contract rose five basis points, closing at 94.38.
Conditions in the London money markets were 'typical of the end of the
month', according to one dealer, with most movements dominated by technical
factors.
Temporarily tight money conditions pushed the overnight rate towards 8 per
cent during the morning. However, by the end of the day overnight rates had
fallen back to 6 1/4 per cent, with little change on three month rates.
After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.75bn, the Bank of England
successfully removed most of this in a round of late assistance.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar breaks DM1.70 barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNTING speculation about further cuts in European interest rates
strengthened the dollar yesterday, in spite of a figures showing a slight
fall in US factory orders, writes Gillian Tett.
After trading around a narrow band at the DM1.69 in the morning, the dollar
broke through the DM1.70 level in the afternoon, closing at DM1.7045, nearly
a  1/4 pfennig up on the previous day's close.
The dollar also gained against the French franc and sterling, closing at
FFr5.7450 and Dollars 1.4935.
The dollar's rise was partly prompted by the release of data showing that
unemployment in France rose by 29,000 or 0.9 per cent in May.
Coupled with a spate of gloomy economic indicators from Spain, showing a 7.6
per cent drop in industrial production in April and 1.1 per cent fall in GDP
during the first quarter of the year, the figures strengthened market
expectations of a new round of interest rate cuts - speculation that grew
after US President Bill Clinton called on the Bundesbank to reduce its
interest rates at its council meeting today.
On the back of the uncertainty about German rate cuts, sterling surged to
its highest point against the D-Mark since its devaluation last autumn.
During heavy trading it peaked around DM2.555 during the afternoon, before
finally falling back to close at DM2.545, unchanged on the previous day.
Although this leaves sterling around 1 1/2 pfennigs up on the beginning of
the month, the market yesterday remained dubious that sterling would be able
to rise further and break though the DM2.60 barrier.
Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London believes
that the bullish tone that accompanied sterling's rapid rise at the
beginning of the week is gradually receding, as the market begins to
recognise the uneven pace of the UK recovery.
'All this seems a bit premature. The sentiment is right, but the market
seems to be reacting too fast,' said Mr Hannah, who predicts that if
sterling does rise to the DM2.60 level, the pressure from British exporters
will be for further UK rate cuts.
Nevertheless, as Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank points out,
sterling is expected to continue to make modest gains for some time.
'Over time the short term interest rate gap will move in England's favour
and that will help underpin sterling,' Mr Martin said.
Meanwhile the yen continued to rally against the dollar, in spite of rumours
in Tokyo that the Bank of Japan was preparing for a rate cut next week.
After strengthening in the European markets to Y106.8 per dollar from a
previous day's close of Y107.0 it opened in New York at Y105.20, close to
the post war low of Y104.80.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reform brings fresh hope to
Ghana's cocoa farmers - Prospects for the industry following the demise of
the state buying monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GHANA'S long-suffering cocoa farmers are looking forward to better prices
and prompt payment as private traders begin competing for their crops this
month, ending the Ghana Cocoa Board's monopoly of the cocoa trade.
Although Cocobod, as the board is known, will remain in charge of cocoa
exports, three trading companies have been licensed to buy the crop at the
farm gate. Competition is expected to be fierce, as Cocobod will pay a
takeover fee of 54,000 cedis (Dollars 90) a tonne on cocoa delivered to
port.
The government last week set the new producer price for the 1993-94 season
at C308,000 a tonne, a 19.4 per cent increase over the previous season. This
is expected to function as a floor price, as competition between traders may
bid up the amount offered to farmers. Traders are also promising to
reimburse farmers quickly. Under the old regime, producers often waited for
months for Cocobod to pay up.
The reforms have revived the moribund co-operative movement in Ghana. More
than 200,000 farmers have combined to form the Ghana Co-operative Marketing
Association - one of the three companies to have won a trading licence from
the government.
Co-operative's members are both nervous and excited at the challenges that
lie ahead. They have been busy obtaining bank loans to finance their
start-up costs - fleets of trucks, weighing scales and tarpaulins to shelter
their purchases. They have also approached aid agencies for help.
'We will only know how good the business is after the first season,' says Mr
Kojo Danso-Mensah at the co-op's ramshackle offices above a chicken farming
outlet in the heart of Accra. 'But we are promising our members a bonus
depending on how much profit we make. Producers will get their money as fast
as we can deliver the cocoa to port.'
The traders insist that competition will not be at the expense of quality,
as Cocobod will still oversee quality control at buying points.
Mr Osae Annoh, the co-op's treasurer, says farmers have also benefitted from
the privatisation of Cocobod's unprofitable farms. He and three colleagues
bought a 200-hectare (495-acre) estate from the government last year. 'If
you can prove your knowledge and interest in cocoa farming, you can buy
these farms at one-tenth of their real value,' he says. With more state
farms up for sale, Mr Annoh predicts that 'the co-operative movement will
get a new lease of life with the government's privatisation programme'. He
planted 20,000 cocoa seedlings at the farm last year.
The new season, which began in mid-June, looks promising. The timely rains
that fell between March and May have led the government to forecast
production during 1993-94 at 285,000 tonnes, up from 275,000 tonnes in
1992-93. Nevertheless, export revenues in 1993 are projected to fall to
Dollars 280m from Dollars 303m last year and over Dollars 500m in 1986, when
cocoa prices were at their peak.
Mr KJ Adjei-Maafo, head of the cocoa policy unit at the 'Castle', the
government seat in Accra, says his main objective at a time of plummeting
cocoa prices is to maintain farmers' incomes, as 60 per cent of the rural
population depend on this cash crop.
It has not been an easy task. The Cocobod's bloated bureaucracy has been
slashed from 100,000 employees to 46,000 and another 20,000 jobs are to go
within the next five years.
'The lay-offs have not made me a popular man, but they were necessary to
stave off the collapse of the industry,' Mr Adjei-Maafo says. To trim costs
further, Cocobod's farms and chocolate factories have been privatised, and
internal marketing opened to private sector competition.
In spite of these measures, farmers are being paid only about half of the
international market price for their crop. Cocobod's marketing, processing
and agricultural extension services consume the remaining income. The
government's target is to put at least 60 per cent of cocoa's market value
into farmers' pockets. And he believes farmers are already responding to
higher prices with better crop management. The average yield last season
increased by 44 per cent to 405 kg a hectare. This, however, is still only
half the level achieved in the neighbouring Ivory Coast, the world's biggest
cocoa producer.
There are more worries for Mr Adjei-Maafo. Ghana's efforts to give its
farmers a better deal have led to a great deal of smuggling from the Ivory
Coast, where the government has slashed its cocoa purchasing prices to
remain competitive. The 'contamination' of Ghana's premium quality cocoa
with its neighbour's inferior stuff is viewed with understandable
apprehension. Smugglers who are caught are being charged with 'economic
sabotage', a crime punished by life imprisonment.
Mr Adjei-Maafo is also bitter about growing competition from Asian producers
such as Malaysia, which has overtaken Ghana as the third largest exporter
after the Ivory Coast and Brazil. 'Processing factories are learning to
blend Asian beans with our premium produce, driving down prices and
quality,' he explains.
The outlook, he says, is grim. He does not see any improvement in cocoa
prices over the next decade. And the government of Ghana, while not
discouraging cocoa farmers, is not encouraging them to expand their farms
either. The government hopes some farmers may be persuaded to switch to more
promising export crops, such as pineapples. But the overriding importance of
cocoa to the Ghanaian economy means that it will continue to depend on the
world's taste for chocolate.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese coal export surge
predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SUN CITY, SOUTH AFRICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINESE COAL exports will reach between 30m and 35m tonnes a year by the
year 2000, according to a senior official in China's coal industry, reports
Reuter from Sun City, South Africa.
Mr Hua Zugui, deputy managing director of China Coal Import and Export
Company, will give the figures in a speech prepared for delivery at an
international coal conference. He says exports reached 20.2m tonnes last
year - 80 per cent of it shipped to other Asian countries - compared with
6.44m tonnes in 1982.
'The fact that China has been able to more than double her exports in just
one decade reflects the competitiveness of the Chinese coal industry within
the world market,' Mr Hua says. 'The improvement of China's railway system
and port facilities remain the key tasks for increasing coal exports,' he
adds.
He forecasts that China's annual demand for coal will reach 1.23bn tonnes by
1995 and 1.4bn tonnes by the end of the century.
Japanese steam coal demand could more than double by the year 2002, a senior
Japanese power company official will tell the conference.
'It is estimated that demand for steam coal for the electrical industry will
rise from the present 31m tonnes, 25m tonnes imported, to some 75m tonnes in
2002 or a decade later,' says Mr Koichi Takewaka, fuel department director
at the Electric Power Development Company. He adds that the long-term,
stable procurement of imported coal has become very important.
South African coal exports could reach 77m tonnes annually by the year 2000,
says Mr David Kotze, director of energy studies at the Rand Afrikaans
University in Johannesburg, in his speech prepared for the conference. He
says exports through the Richards Bay terminal should grow to 53m tonnes a
year by 1995.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather havoc sends US soya
futures higher still
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELENTLESS RAINS in the maize and soyabean-growing regions of the US are
wreaking havoc on many grain farms and trimming US harvest prospects by the
day.
Some desperate farmers are attempting to seed soggy fields by air, but
others have abandoned the effort. Crops planted after the beginning of July,
they said, would shrivel in the late summer heat.
The heaviest rainfall in 18 years has also stalled barge traffic on 500
miles of the upper Mississippi river, the primary transport corridor for
grains export from the Texas and Lousiana coasts. Rising water has impeded
navigation and lock operation.
Planting delays have sparked the biggest soyabean rally in four years at the
Chicago Board of Trade. Soyabeans for harvest-time delivery rallied by 14
per cent from June 15 to a high of Dollars 6.60 1/2 a bushel yesterday.
Mr William Biedermann, vice president of Allendale, an agricultural research
company, expects soyabean prices to reach Dollars 7 before the rally ebbs.
'We're forecasting fewer planted acres and lower yields,' he said yesterday.
'There is no doubt the crop is in trouble.'
The US Department of Agriculture planned to release its latest survey of
farmer's planting intentions yesterday afternoon. But the survey, which was
conducted early in June, will not reflect subsequent planting delays and
private crop forecasters will trim 2m to 3m acres off the government's
estimate to take account of these. Last year the US harvested 55 million
tonnes of soyabeans, nearly three times the amount of the next biggest
producer, Brazil.
This year the US soya crop could be as small as 50m tonnes, Mr Biedermann
said. With rising exports and a smaller crop, the margin between supply and
demand could narrow to a dangerously thin 65m bushels (60 lb each), or less
than two week's supply, he added. Ending stocks in the US have averaged 324m
bushels over the last five years.
While maize planting is also lagging, maize prices have not exploded like
those for soyabeans. Healthy carryover stocks from last year's record crop
will cushion domestic and export buyers from a smaller crop, grain dealers
say.
Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, who yesterday surveyed the four
states most affected by the rains, may release federal disaster payments to
the hardest-hit farmers. Fifteen Iowa counties have already been declared
state disaster areas.

completed in August, Polish officials have said.
The concessions are to be granted under a tender opened early last year and
a new tender covering in eastern Poland is expected to be announced
following completion of the present talks. The areas under discussion are
east of Gdansk and west of Warsaw.
Last October Amoco signed a USDollars 20m oil exploration agreement for
areas south-west of Warsaw and south of Lublin in the east. This was
followed this week by an agreement to spend USDollars 10m over three years
drilling for methane in Silesia.

</HEADLINE>

The Australian selling season ended last week with the market indicator at
444c/kg, seven cents higher than at the end of the previous week, but
tending to soften a fraction at the close. The final weeks of the season saw
small and erractic fluctuations but no resumption of the strong rise which
led to improvement in buying activity throughout the industry at the end of
April. Holidays and the lack of auction test of wool prices are likely to
mean a dull and static market in the forthcoming weeks.

BASE METALS prices fell away from the highs yesterday afternoon on the
London Metal Exchange, although most were still higher on the day. Three
months ALUMINIUM retreated from a high of Dollars 1,260 a tonne in
after-hours trading, with talk circulating that other North American
producers did not intend to follow Alcoa's lead and cut production. But the
price still ended Dollars 17 to the good at Dollars 1,248 a tonne. Three
months COPPER consolidated above Dollars 1,900 a tonne but could not
overcome resistance around Dollars 1,915 a tonne, the top of the recent
technical range, dealers said. The market's strength has been helped by lost
production at Chuquicamata and expectations of heavy drawdowns in stocks.
But dealers warned that prices might head lower again if there was no
stoppage at Kennecott's Bingham Canyon mine, where the labour contract
expired yesterday. The July position on the London COCOA futures market rose
to a peak of Pounds 736 a tonne in what traders interpreted as a bout of
short-covering ahead of first notice day for deliveries against that
contract. The September contract closed at Pounds 714 a tonne, up Pounds 6.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME says goodbye to sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange today ends a tradition dating back 110 years.
Copper, its 'flagship' contract, which since 1883 has been quoted in
sterling during the twice-daily open outcry sessions in the 'ring' and in
kerb (after hours) trading, will instead be quoted in US dollars.
Lead, quoted in sterling since the contract was launched in 1903, is also
switched to dollars.
Mr David King, LME chief executive, said yesterday the changes 'reflect the
needs and wishes of our industrial clients and our members.'
All other long-running LME contracts - for primary aluminium, nickel, tin
and zinc - have been changed in recent years for the same reasons and the
latest, for aluminium alloy, was launched as a dollar contract.
However, LME members previously had resolutely stood out against changing
the copper and lead contracts even though most physical transactions as well
as pre-market and inter-office business was conducted in dollars. Some
traders claimed trading in sterling often provided opportunities to make
extra profit from arbitrage and foreign exchange transactions.
Minds were changed during last November's turmoil in currency markets, which
resulted in the UK's withdrawal from the European Community's exchange rate
mechanism. Dealers complained that trading virtually ground to a halt at
that time because it was impossible to convert sterling prices into dollars
on forward contracts. When the LME held a poll, 70 per cent voted in favour
of switching copper and lead to dollars.
Mr King said that the exchange had made arrangements to provide a daily
sterling quote for copper and lead contracts that still had some time to
run.
The London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) today changes its name back to
London Commodities Exchange (LCE).

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Broad range of borrowers tap wide
variety of currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BROAD range of borrowers flocked to the international bond market
yesterday, tapping a wide variety of currencies.
The World Bank, which launched its Y225bn global deal on Tuesday, yesterday
priced the seven-year bonds to yield 12 basis points over the No 129 JGB
(the indicated range had been 11 to 13 basis points over the Japanese
government bond).
Goldman Sachs, which is joint lead-manager with Daiwa Europe and IBJ
International, said the bonds traded up from the issue price of 99.983 to
100.07 - 100.10 by mid-afternoon, while the yield spread tightened to 11.5
basis points. 'The deal was distributed all over the major geographical
centres,' according to one of the lead managers.
Japan Airlines also tapped the yen sector yesterday for a total of Y50bn,
choosing to spread its borrowing burden across three separate bond issues,
lead-managed by three different Japanese houses.
The bond issues, which are for aircraft financing purposes, have quite
similar maturities, falling due in October 2002, July 2003 and October 2003.
'They (Japan Airlines) did it in three issues because they have a varied
maturity requirement which makes it easier this way - however, it also helps
relationships with the Japanese houses,' said one Japanese lead manager.
Another said: 'It's very political - by doing three issues through three
different houses, it gives everyone a slice of the pie.' The deals were
mainly aimed at Japanese investors.
In the lira sector of the market, Credit Local De France launched a L500bn
zero-coupon bond with a 10-year maturity. Mr Flavio Fabbrizi, head of new
issues at IMI Bank Luxembourg, which was the lead manager for the deal, said
there was good demand in the Benelux countries, Germany and Switzerland,
from both institutional and retail investors, given that with a zero-coupon
bond investors do not have to worry about reinvesting interest payments.
The bonds were priced at 39.72, giving 38.47 after fees and providing a
gross redemption yield of 10.027 per cent. The bonds later traded at 38.625
 -38.65.
The US dollar sector saw a wave of new issues, with a straight bond from the
Development Bank of the Philippines and a handful of floating-rate notes.
The Development Bank of the Philippines upped its five-year issue from
Dollars 100m to Dollars 175m, citing strong investor demand for the paper.
The deal is the first five-year issue by a Philippines borrower, and extends
the maturity benchmark set by the Republic of the Philippines Eurobond issue
launched earlier this year.
The bond issue does not carry a national government guarantee, but was
brought at a yield spread of 310 basis points over the US Treasury bond,
representing an improvement over the spread obtained by the republic.
Citicorp was lead-manager for the deal.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Disappointing response to record Pounds
3.25bn gilt auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BANK of England held one of its most disappointing gilts auctions
yesterday since they were first used in 1987. However, the fundamental
attractions of the UK gilt market enabled it readily to shrug off the supply
pressure of what was also the biggest ever auction.
The Pounds 3.25bn sale of 8 per cent stock due 2003 had been aimed at
international investors who have been heavy buyers of UK paper on the back
of low inflation, low growth and the prospect of sterling appreciation.
However, over the past week, gilt prices have risen sharply and the pound
has raced ahead against a number of European currencies. Yesterday's auction
was covered only 1.1 times, the lowest level since January 1988.
When the auction details were announced, long gilt futures for September
plunged  5/8 to 106 5/16 and both medium and long-dated bonds were sharply
lower. Nevertheless, prices began to creep higher very quickly and by the
close, the September gilt contract was almost half a point higher on the day
at 107 13/32 .
The fundamental attractions of the market enabled the Bank of England to
announce a further Pounds 800m of new stock late yesterday afternoon.
The tap of 9 per cent stock dated 2008 and priced at 108.75 per cent will be
more attractive to UK institutional investors, which prefer longer-dated
issues.
THE BURNING issue of whether Germany will or will not cut key interest rates
at its fortnightly council meeting today continued to exercise continental
European government bond markets.
However, the German bund market drew no inference from the inscrutable
Bundesbank and traded sideways for most of the day. Bund futures rose only 6
basis points to close at 95.86.
Dealers said the strength reflected investors switching out of the French
government bond market, which many feel has risen high enough in the short
term.
The rate cut pessimists pointed to the derisory reduction yesterday in the
repo rate, which was shaved by only one basis point to 7.58 per cent against
vague hopes earlier that it might have come down to around 7.55 per cent.
However, the enthusiasts believed that the fiscal package announced on
Tuesday and due to be approved by the Cabinet in two weeks' time would
provide the Bundesbank with the impetus it needs. The government wants to
make spending cuts totalling DM25.25bn.
FRENCH government bonds were flat as the market digested the most recent
unemployment data, which came in at 11.5 per cent for May against the
market's expectation of around 11 per cent.
French bonds started sluggishly, with today's auctions of franc-denominated
OATs and of Ecu-denominated OATs also weighing on futures as dealers set up
hedges for the tender.
The September contract was down at around 119.68 at one stage but recovered
later in the day to close unchanged at 119.82.
IN THE high yielding European government bond markets, Italian bond futures
hit a record high before profit-taking saw the contract edge slightly lower
on balance.
Foreign investors, who have been prepared to take the country's political
uncertainty on board for the attractive returns of government paper, were
encouraged by positive tax news.
The treasury has signed a decree introducing a new system for repayment of
withholding tax on coupons to eligible foreign investors.
The finance ministry said the time for repayment could be cut to 35 to 40
days with the new computer-based system. At present, the repayment of the
12.5 per cent tax can take up to a year.
BTP futures for September ended the day 0.61 point higher at 103.24.
US TREASURY prices were little changed in quiet trading as dealers and
investors prepared for tomorrow's jobs data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 105
25/32 , yielding 6.672 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
steady at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.993 per cent.
Trading was lacklustre throughout the day, primarily because most
participants chose to stay on the sidelines until tomorrow's June employment
report. Expectations centre on a rise of between 100,000 and 150,000 in
non-farm payrolls - an increase that would be regarded as indicative of a
still-struggling, but slowly expanding, economy.
Initially, losses were concentrated at the long end and were attributed to
end-of-quarter selling by institutions, and reports that a large number of
Congressional Democrats want President Bill Clinton to drop the energy tax
from his deficit-reduction package. The long end, however, bounced back from
its losses mid-afternoon.
News of a 1.4 per cent fall in May factory orders and a virtually flat
Chicago purchasing managers' index had no discernible affect on prices.

AMP SOCIETY, the Australian financial services group, is revamping its
Australian investment operations in a bid to improve investment performance.
The AMP, which controlled Australian investments valued at more than
ADollars 37bn at last balance date, has formed a separate company to manage
its investment operations called AMP Investment Australia
Mr Andrew Threadgold, managing director, said the changes would allow the
AMP more fully to focus on investment management while at the same time
reducing costs.
The move is aimed at breaking the company's equity investments into smaller,
separately-managed portfolios. Mr Threadgold said this should lead to a big
reduction in market execution costs.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Upstart airlines reach for the
US skyways - Cut-price carriers are mopping up redundant labour and lost
routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 11.30am at Newark Airport and Flight 7, to Atlanta, is filling up. The
passengers are a motley crowd but there is coffee by the boarding gate, plus
an effusive cabin attendant. And if the Boeing 727 looks a little elderly,
at least it departs on time.
This is Kiwi International Air Lines, one of a crop of new airlines which
have started up in the US in the past few years. Kiwi flies to just a
handful of cities - Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Orlando and San Juan in
Puerto Rico - and its appeal is equally simple - price.
The cost of a one-way ticket from Newark to Atlanta, with no advance
purchase or minimum-stay requirements, is Dollars 119. Make the same 'full
fare' journey on Delta Air Lines, which dominates Atlanta's Hartsfield
airport, and the price is Dollars 373, although the carrier has responded
with limited discount offers.
At first sight, the 1990s seem an unlikely time to start up an airline
business. Financial turbulence has caused two large carriers - Pan Am and
Eastern - to go out of business, while losses at the remaining seven
national airlines have topped Dollars 8bn over the past three years. Even
now, Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest carrier, is teetering on the
brink of bankruptcy.
Despite this gloomy industry backdrop, the US Department of Transportation
calculates that 15 new airlines came on stream in the year to April,
one-third of which were neither charter nor cargo operations. Another 20
applications are in the pipeline, half of which involve jet aircraft.
There are two compelling reasons why start-up carriers are reaching for the
skies. First, there is a surplus of trained labour and cheap aircraft.
Pan Am and Eastern alone employed between them almost 30,000 people
immediately before their respective collapses in 1991. More recently, many
of surviving US carriers - including American, Delta and United - have been
contracting, shedding thousands of jobs in the process.
The idea to create Kiwi came from a group of former Eastern pilots who
personally committed upwards of Dollars 50,000 apiece in start-up capital.
Today, Kiwi's 400-plus payroll includes former employees of Midway Airlines,
a smaller Chicago-based carrier which collapsed in 1992, and Pan Am.
It is not only people skills which are available. The recent airline demises
 -plus the shrinking of survivors - has led to a glut of aircraft, most of
which are parked in the Californian desert.
Many of the new carriers use Boeing 727s or 737s, restricting their fleets
to one type of aircraft to reduce maintenance costs. Lease rates are at low
ebb: depending on age and model, a 727-200 can be had for under Dollars
100,000 a month.
Equally important, there is a market waiting to be served. US consumers have
grown accustomed to the bargain-basement fares which resulted from savage
price wars in the early 1990s, and still shop fiercely for good buys.
The big carriers, by contrast, are desperate to restore some profitability
to their domestic operations, and have been trying to push up ticket prices.
This task is achieved more easily in markets where they face limited
competition.
When Eastern, which had been a heavy price-cutter, collapsed, Delta became
the only large operator at Atlanta and immediately raised fares. For new
carriers, with lower operating costs, such situations have potential.
In financial terms, the newcomers' track records are varied. Some have
quickly moved into profit.
Take Nevada-based Reno Air, which will celebrate its first birthday this
week. It flies a dozen aircraft, principally in the south-west, and has been
firmly in the black for the past two quarters - more than can be said for
many of its bigger rivals.
However, problems tend to surface when a successful niche operator takes the
next leap forward, in terms of size and route structure. MarkAir, based in
Anchorage, is good example.
This carrier, which began life flying oil-drilling equipment around the
Alaskan outback, became a passenger carrier in the mid-1980s. In 1991, it
expanded into the Pacific north-west, angering the larger Alaska Airlines. A
fierce fare war developed. MarkAir filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in June 1992.
The MarkAir story is also indicative of the relationship between upstart
carriers and established operators. New airlines tend to tread warily,
knowing they can be targets of retaliation if they encroach too far into
national carriers' territory.
Kiwi, for example, has only four flights a day during the week, between
Atlanta and Newark. The first one leaving Newark is not until 11.40am,
making the service of limited use to business travellers.
By contrast, when Reno tried to enter the Minneapolis market, Northwest  -
which is based in the Minnesota city and had abandoned a Minneapolis-Reno
route - responded by first re-entering this territory, at Reno-style prices.
Worse, it announced it would undercut the upstart carrier's price on other
west coast routes. The Department of Transportation weighed in on Reno's
side, and both carriers backed off.
Occasionally, however, the intricate world of aviation politics plays in the
new carriers' favour. The giant American Airlines, for example, is trying to
scale down its hub operation in San Jose, California, in the face of strong
competition from its low-cost Dallas-based rival, Southwest Airlines.
Two months ago, it agreed to sublease up to seven gates at San Jose to Reno,
and has also offered Reno passengers the chance to earn air miles in its
AAdvantage frequent flier scheme.
To economists, the ready entry of new low-cost operators is precisely what
competition theory prescribes. But even in the aggressive, deregulated US
airline industry, not everyone is universally welcome.
Plans by Mr Frank Lorenzo, former boss of both Eastern Airlines and
Continental, to start a discount-fare airline operating between Boston,
Washington and Orlando, have provoked a storm of protest from airline unions
and members of Congress.
Hearings on the issue are taking place this week. It is a delicate issue
which pits the principles of deregulation against one of the industry's most
controversial figures.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Murdoch TVB plans still on, say
analysts

<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch is unlikely to shelve plans for an alliance with Hong
Kong's Television Broadcasts (TVB), even though his bid to acquire 22 per
cent of the company has run into regulatory difficulties.
This is the view of local media analysts. They believe that to realise his
aims in Asian broadcasting, the head of News Corporation does not need to
own a significant share of TVB, given that his ambitions are regional and
not just confined to Hong Kong.
If all goes well, analysts say, Mr Murdoch should be able to strike a deal
giving him access to TVB's programming library and production capability,
and allowing him to participate in TVB's satellite broadcasting plans.
One possibility would be for TVB to separately incorporate its film library
and production facilities and sell an interest in them to Mr Murdoch. He
could also partner TVB in Asian satellite broadcasting without having to own
that part of TVB which has the terrestrial broadcasting licence for Hong
Kong.
On Tuesday, Mr Murdoch asked the Hong Kong government to defer consideration
of his HKDollars 1.85bn (USDollars 239m) offer to acquire a substantial
shareholding in TVB from the company's two main shareholders, Sir Run Run
Shaw and Malaysian financier Mr Robert Kuok.
It is understood the deferral was sought because Hong Kong's Broadcasting
Authority had recommended against approval of the purchase. At issue was the
waiver of a regulation which prohibits a foreigner voting more than 10 per
cent of the equity of a Hong Kong television licensee.
'I still believe that TVB wants to work with News Corporation,' said Mr
Charles Whitworth, media analyst at Wardley James Capel. 'They want access
to News Corp's programming and their expertise in satellite television.'

SEVEN Network, the Australian broadcasting company formerly controlled by Mr
Christopher Skase, has confirmed its planned public float will have News
Corporation and Australian telecommunications group Telecom as founding
shareholders.
Mr Ivan Deveson, Seven Network chairman, said yesterday News Corporation,
the international media group, would hold a 15 per cent interest in the
company and Telecom, the Australian Government-owned telephone group, 10 per
cent.
He said News and Telecom would be entitled to nominate one director each to
the Seven board, but no nominations had yet been received.
Seven, which had been in the hands of its bankers following the collapse of
Mr Skase's Qintex empire, has circulated a draft prospectus for the float,
likely to seek between Dollars A600m (USDollars 402.7m) and Dollars A725m.
The prospectus is believed to price Seven Network shares at just over eight
times forecast earnings for 1994. The offering is expected in August and
analysts said last night the presence of News and Telecom would make the
public marketing task easier.
The float marks a return to metropolitan television in Australia by News
Corporation, which sold its stake in the rival Ten Network in the 1980s to
Westfield, the Australian property investment group.
For Telecom, the investment would be its first in a large television
network.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Philips to show gain of Fl 1.1bn
on MEC sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, stands to make an extraordinary gain
of Fl 1.1bn (Dollars 579m) on the recent sale of its minority stake in a
semi-conductor joint venture to Matsushita of Japan.
The gain, which is in line with analysts' predictions, will be included in
second-quarter results due out on August 5.
In May, Philips announced it was selling its 35 per cent stake in Matsushita
Electronics Corp to its long-standing joint venture partner, Matsushita, for
Fl 3bn.
The company had declined to say how big the extraordinary gain would be.
However, Philips was required to disclose the figure when filing its annual
report with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US, where it
maintains a listing of ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Philips confirmed it would be using the proceeds of the MEC sale to redeem
debt and to begin the process of cutting short-term debt. Part of the
proceeds will be earmarked for early redemption of Fl 540m in outstanding
conversion certificates issued by its finance company.
It said the figure of Fl 1.1bn included foreign exchange gains as well as
the cost of provisions needed to end or divest other parts of the Philips
group. It declined to give details of the projected provisions.
The extraordinary gain will significantly boost second-quarter results. In
the first quarter, Philips' net profit fell by more than one-third to Fl
103m, due mainly to a drop in orders at its communications systems business
in Germany.
The divestment of MEC is expected, on balance, to be positive for Philips.
The Japanese-based joint venture was barely profitable in recent years, and
the reduction in debt will enable Philips to achieve savings on interest
charges.

DICKSON Concepts, the Hong Kong retailer and wholesaler which owns Harvey
Nichols, the London department store, reported a 7 per cent increase in
earnings for the year to March.
Net profit improved to HKDollars 300.5m (USDollars 38.5m) from HKDollars
281.9m a year earlier. The results were a marked contrast to chairman Mr
Dickson Poon's enthusiastic predictions a year earlier, and reflected weak
trading conditions in Japan and Europe.
Turnover rose 8 per cent to HKDollars 2.57bn, primarily as a result of
improved sales from its distribution operations in south-east Asia.
Harvey Nichols, purchased from the UK Burton Group in 1991, made its first
meaningful contribution to group earnings during the year. Analysts estimate
the store made an operating profit of around HKDollars 14m, thanks to
tighter financial controls and an expansion of its sales area.
The recent focus of the group has been on China. Four outlets have been
opened in Beijing, selling Charles Jourdan, Guy Laroche and S. T. Dupont
products. During the current fiscal year, an additional 30 boutiques are
expected to be established.
The group already distributes 11 brands of luxury watches in China. It will
start marketing a new Harvey Nichols range this year.

Mr Kirk Sweeney, media analyst at Lehman Brothers, said it would be a
disappointment for the strategic development of both News Corp and TVB if Mr
Murdoch was prohibited from acquiring a stake in the company. 'Both would
benefit from News Corp's participation in TVB; they could sell product in
both directions,' he said.
Mr Sweeney believes there were some aspects of the deal that could persuade
the colony's Executive Council, or quasi-cabinet, to grant waivers, 'if
properly presented'. One of these was the exportation of Chinese culture to
North America and Europe.

GILLETTE, the Boston-based consumer products company, yesterday unveiled a
new shaving system. It is hoping to follow up the success of its Sensor
razor with the new product which, it claims, offers further technological
advances.
Gillette said the new system - SensorExcel - should sell at a 15 per cent
premium to Sensor. It will be launched in European markets in September.
This is the first time it has launched a new 'wet shaving' product outside
the US.
When news of the launch surfaced last week, the company's shares moved
higher, although some analysts suggested it was too soon after Sensor's 1989
launch to bring a new 'wet-shaving' product to market.
Sensor has been hugely successful, helping to rebuild Gillette's image after
the tumultuous 1980s, when the company was subject to two takeover threats.

BAHLSEN, the German cakes, biscuits and snacks maker, is to restructure its
business with the aim of increasing European market share, according to Mr
Werner Michael Bahlsen, managing director.
Split into 'sweet' and 'snacks' divisions, the company intends to focus on
three brands - Bahlsen for sweet products, Leibniz in the semi-sweet
main-stream biscuit market, and Bahlsen Picanterie for savoury snacks.
The group, which saw pre-tax earnings drop by more than 50 per cent last
year to DM56m (Dollars 33m) on sales of DM1.8bn, compared with DM1.86bn in
1991, is also aiming to extend its eastern European business further.
Bolstered by the recent purchase of a Polish confectionery group, sales in
the region should reach DM80m this year, Mr Bahlsen said yesterday.

<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSIAL accoun-ting rule change proposed by the US Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which would force companies to disclose
the value of options granted to employees and subtract them from profits,
yesterday moved one step closer to becoming reality when FASB published its
exposure draft of the new rule.
FASB, a private sector body which sets standards for the accounting
industry, came under fire from business groups in April when it set out its
proposal to force companies to recognise stock options and other stock-based
compensation rewards as an expense.
Yesterday's draft was essentially unchanged from the board's earlier
proposal.
FASB has asked to receive comments on the proposal by December 31. It will
then hold public hearings on the issues.
A final ruling will be issued after the public hearings.
Although companies will not be required to take charges against earnings
until 1997, they will have to provide note disclosures starting in 1994,
including disclosure of the effect on net income and earnings per share as
if the new recognition requirements had been adopted.
Mr Dennis Beresford, FASB chairman, said the delay should help employers
become familiar with using option-pricing models and for financial statement
users to become accustomed to the new information.
'It will give employers time to consider whether to change their stock-based
compensation plans, the design of which may have been heavily influenced by
current accounting requirements.'

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ryder System to spin off its
aviation business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RYDER SYSTEM, the Miami-based transportation group, yesterday announced
plans to spin off its aviation business as a separately-quoted company and
take a net second-quarter restructuring charge of Dollars 169.4m. The plan
involves a large jet turbine overhaul shop in Prestwick, Scotland, bought
from British Caledonian in 1986.
Existing Ryder shareholders will be offered shares in the aviation company
by way of a tax-free distribution of stock. The new aviation group will take
in Ryder Airline Services, Ryder Aviall and Inventory Locator Service, and
will be based in Dallas. Included in its assets will be the Prestwick
facility, which employs about 800 and works on General Electric engines for
the likes of British Airways, Continental, USAir and British Midland.
Ryder's aviation business is sizeable. The company claims to be the world's
largest independent supplier of turbine aircraft engine repair services and
the biggest distributor of aviation parts and supplies.
Although it plans to shed some peripheral operations - Ryder Aviall's
business aviation and helicopter engine repair business, its aircraft and
terminal services operation at Dallas's Love Field, and a sales unit in
Miami - the new company would have had revenues of Dollars 1.2bn in 1992,
and assets, at end-1992, of Dollars 1.2bn.
Profits from the aviation interests, however, fell last year - a trend
blamed on lower demand, but which continued in the first quarter of 1993.
About Dollars 500m of debt - just over a quarter of the total at Ryder -
attaches to the aviation interests, and will transfer to the demerged
entity.
Demergers have become increasingly popular in the US recently, as companies
have attempted to generate investor interest by reshaping themselves.
Yesterday, Ryder claimed that the deal - due to be completed before the end
of 1993 - should allow both its 'highway' transportation interests and the
aviation units to 'focus more sharply' on their respective markets.
Ryder shares gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 yesterday.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: New president named in American
Express shuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express, the US travel and financial services group, has reshuffled
its senior management appointing Mr Jeffrey Stiefler president of the
company.
Mr Stiefler, who was chief executive of American Express's financial
services subsidiary IDS, takes over as president from chief executive Mr
Harvey Golub, who assumes the title of chairman from Mr Richard Furlaud.
American Express said Mr Furlaud, an outside director of the company since
1972, has been elected chairman of the executive committee of the board of
directors.
The changes represent a consolidation of the management installed in
February following the departure of Mr James Robinson, who had run American
Express  for 15 years.  After a protracted battle, Mr Robinson was forced
out because of the poor performance of the company's various divisions, and
of its share price.
The appointment of a new president, and the move of Mr Furlaud to chairman
of the executive committee, are designed to spread some of the management
load.
Previously, American Express was being run solely by Mr Golub, with Mr
Furlaud's support.
Mr Stiefler's promotion is seen as a reward for his work at IDS, which
during the group's recent troubles with its loss-making securities brokerage
operations and struggling credit card business, remained a reliable source
of profits.  In 1992, IDS contributed Dollars 243m to the group's overall
earnings of Dollars 436m.
This is the second time in a few years that IDS has proved a stepping stone
for management within American Express.  In 1991, Mr Golub, then head of
IDS, was promoted to president of the parent group.

The group, called the Multimedia Communications Community of Interest, said
it would promote the use of services that would allow people in different
locations to view documents, images, graphics and full-motion video on a
personal computers, while simultaneously discussing and updating what they
see on their PC screens.
It said the success of such international services would depend on
establishing standards so that users could collaborate regardless of the
computer equipment, software or telecommunications company being used.
The group also announced plans to begin a series of field trials in the
first quarter of 1994 to test multimedia communications services on a
co-ordinated, global basis. The group has invited other companies to join.

CLOROX, the California-based company best known as the largest bleach
producer in the US, is selling its frozen foods business to H. J. Heinz, the
US food company.
No price was disclosed, but the Clorox operations, which mainly supply the
food service industry, will be incorporated into Heinz's Ore-Ida division.
Clorox, which announced last April it was negotiating over the sale of the
food interests, added that it expected to show a net gain on the sale.
Clorox predicted that fourth-quarter earnings would be slightly ahead of
analysts' forecasts. It told analysts that fourth-quarter and full-year
earnings per share should be ahead of last year's figures by 25 per cent and
15 per cent respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 1991-92, Clorox earned 70 cents a share, before a
48 cents-a-share charge for asset writedowns. The full-year result for
1991-92 was Dollars 2.65, before one-off charges of 83 cents.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse elects Jordan chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the troubled US conglomerate, yesterday named Mr
Michael Jordan, a former head of international operations at drink and foods
group PepsiCo, as its new chairman and chief executive.
Westinghouse has been searching for a chief executive since January when Mr
Paul Lego stepped down under pressure from the board and shareholders,
dissatisfied at his progress in turning the company around.
Yesterday's announcement followed boardroom divisions as to whether in-bred
Westinghouse should appoint to the post Mr Howard Clark, a 36-year company
veteran and acting chief executive, or seek a leader from outside.
Mr Jordan indicated yesterday that he planned substantial changes, saying he
saw 'the new Westinghouse as smaller, but strategically sound, less affected
by business cycles and more competitive'.
Westinghouse, with interests ranging from nuclear power plant to radio
stations, has suffered particularly from severe losses on poor property
investment by its financial services unit in the 1980s.
He said it had made significant progress this year to resolve the financial
services problems and added that he would be examining all the group's core
businesses.
Mr Jordan is joining Westinghouse from the New York private investment firm
of Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, where he has been a partner since last year.
Before that, he had worked since 1974 for PepsiCo, rising to be head of its
international foods and beverages division. Between 1964 and 1974 he worked
for McKinsey &amp; Co, the management consultants.
His background in finance and consumer products contrasts with that of most
Westinghouse chairmen, who have been closely involved in engineering, but Mr
Jordan holds degrees in chemical engineering from Yale and Princeton
universities and was certified as a nuclear engineer early in his career.
Mr Clark will remain president of Westinghouse while the company's interim
chairman, Mr Richard Morrow, will stay on the board.

PETROLEOS de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's national oil company, has been
hurt by weak international oil prices and high income taxes.
Net earnings for 1992 fell 25 per cent, to to USDollars 331m from 1991's
Dollars 441m.
But the company was able to make significant progress in its domestic and
international investment programmes, make large cuts in operating expenses
and trim borrowing requirements.
One of the world's largest oil companies, PDVSA said consolidated gross
revenues in 1992 were Dollars 21.4bn, down 4 per cent from 1991's Dollars
22.3bn.
PDVSA's average export price per barrel  - covering crude oil and refined
products dispatched from Venezuelan ports  - was Dollars 14.91 last year,
6.3 per cent below the 1991 average.

BAHLSEN, the German cakes, biscuits and snacks maker, is to restructure its
business with the aim of increasing European market share, according to Mr
Werner Michael Bahlsen, managing director.
Split into 'sweet' and 'snacks' divisions, the company will focus on three
brands, Bahlsen for sweet products, Leibniz in the semi-sweet mainstream

The group, which saw pre-tax earnings drop by more than 50 per cent last
year to DM56m (Dollars 33m) on sales of DM1.8bn, compared with DM1.86bn in
1991, is also aiming to extend its eastern European business further.
Bolstered by the recent purchase of a Polish confectionery group, sales in
the region should reach DM80m this year, Mr Bahlsen said yesterday.
Last year's turnover had been reduced mainly by currency fluctuations, he
added. He pointed out that 1991 earnings had been boosted to DM127m partly
by the sale of the Gubor subsidiary.
Volume sales rose to 278,000 tonnes, from 271,000, while the value of
domestic deliveries fell from DM969m to DM929, Mr Bahlsen said.
He blamed the decline on consumers' switching to cheaper brands and the
impact of the hot summer on sales of chocolate products.
Profits were also affected by increased promotional spending.
Despite the setbacks, the group claims a 19 per cent share of the German
packaged cakes market, 37 per cent in biscuits and almost 27 per cent in
savoury snacks.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Agnelli maps out route for
disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's largest private group, plans to raise up to L3,000bn (Dollars
1.9bn) this year in asset sales to offset the cost of rising debt and the
prospect of a 1993 operating loss close to L1,000bn.
The Turin-based automotive group has used asset sales to shore up profits
over the past two years. The sale of Fiat's 25 per cent stake in Alcatel
Italia, the telecoms group formed largely from its Telettra subsidiary,
raised L700bn.
But the divestiture target revealed yesterday by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat
chairman, after the company's annual meeting, represents a far more
significant disposal of non-strategic assets.
Mr Agnelli declined to say whether discussions were under way for specific
disposals, but implied Toro, Fiat's insurance arm, was first in line, and
said the Rinascente stores group was being courted. He also indicated that
Fiat's indirect ownership of Corriere Della Sera, the Milan newspaper, held
through Gemina, was not a core investment.
Mr Agnelli is due to step down at the next annual meeting after 28 years as
chairman. He offered shareholders a bleak view of 1993 results against the
backdrop of declining demand in the core vehicle business. In 1992, the
automotive sector accounted for almost 80 per cent of the group's L59,100bn
turnover.
'The figures we have for April-May not only confirm the recessionary trend
but show it worsening, at least in Italy,' Mr Agnelli said.
He confirmed analysts' estimates of a 1993 operating loss of L1,000bn with
revenues 'roughly the same as 1992'.
Mr Agnelli said the group would invest L8,000bn this year which could not
all be met from the group's resources. Already this year Fiat's net
financial position had reached a deficit of nearly L7,000bn and could reach
L10,000bn by the year-end. This compares with L3,800bn at the end of 1992
but he insisted the higher borrowing would still be within sound debt-equity
ratio limits. His comments were seen as an attempt to allay fears that the
company was sitting on a pile of undisclosed debt.
The group agreed to set aside L244bn to cover a reduced dividend - L100 on
each ordinary and preference share and L130 on each savings share against
L230 and L260 last year.

recapitalisation

<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company saddled with
total borrowings of over L31,000bn (Dollars 20.16bn), is expected to launch
a big rights issue to recapitalise its shaky finances after a special
shareholders' meeting planned for August 31.
The assembly, announced at Ferfin's annual meeting yesterday, will formally
write down the debt-laden group's capital after last year's consolidated
losses of L1,667bn,
Mr Carlo Sama, Ferfin's outgoing managing director, told shareholders that
Ferfin's high debts and heavy interest charges had resulted in a L491.6bn
loss for the parent company in the first five months of this year. The news,
combined with fears of an impending rights issue, triggered a new record low
in Ferfin's share price with a 10.3 per cent fall to L447.1 in Milan.
Italian company law requires a write-down if a company's losses exceed
two-thirds of its shareholders' funds. Approval for the write-down will
almost certainly be followed by a capital increase.
The rights issue is likely to formalise the position of Ferfin's five main
creditor banks in effectively running the group.
Earlier this month, Ferfin and members of the controlling Ferruzzi family
called on the five leading creditor banks to prepare a rescue package, which
should be ready shortly before the special shareholders' meeting.
The banks, which could convert some of their debt into equity, yesterday
began to take a bigger role at Ferfin with the confirmation of Mr Guido
Rossi and Mr Enrico Bondi, two bank-appointed executives, as Ferfin's
chairman and managing director respectively.

AUDI, the Volkswagen group's luxury car division, slumped into a DM198m
(Dollars 117.1m) pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year as
turnover tumbled almost 30 per cent to DM6bn
'With a lot of hard work' the company hoped to return to the black by the
end of the year, but this would depend on the state of the market, Mr
Franz-Josef Kortum, chairman, told the annual meeting.
German sales are already down 20 per cent, and the motor traders'
association said earlier this week that it expected new domestic
registrations to fall 23 per cent for the full 12 months.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, president of Fiat, warned yesterday that total industry
car deliveries in Europe would fall 16 per cent.
Meanwhile, Audi's share of the home market has shrunk from 6 per cent a year
ago to 5.6 per cent.
Employing 3,000 fewer workers than in the first half of 1992, and after 32
days when production was stopped in its two main factories, the company
reduced output in the period under review by almost 32 per cent to 174,000
vehicles.
Global sales in the meantime fell 26 per cent to 198,000 cars. The
difference between output and deliveries was due to heavy inventory
reductions, Mr Kortum explained.
Commenting on the deficit after a DM315m profit in the comparable part of
1992, Mr Kortum said demand was especially strong a year earlier because of
the marque's new models.
The market was also still being driven by the post-unification boom which
stopped abruptly last summer to be followed by a sharp dive into recession.
The VW group earlier this year reported a first-quarter loss of DM1.25bn
following Germany's plunge into recession in the second half of last year.
Before the summer break, the German car market was still being strongly
driven by the effects of unification.
The fruits of a joint production venture between Audi and Porsche, the
sports car maker, will be shown at the international motor show in Frankfurt
in September, the two companies have announced.
Production of the new vehicle, based on the Audi Avant S2, will start early
next year in Porsche's Zuffenhausen factory and profits will be shared
equally between the partners.
The project demonstrated a new form of co-operation between two independent
vehicle makers, the companies said. Porsche is controlled by the family of
Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: UK group sells stake in Chateau
Latour

ALLIED-LYONS, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, has sold its 93.2 per
cent stake in Chateau Latour, one of the four leading Bordeaux vineyards,
for Pounds 80m (Dollars 120m) to Artemis, a private company controlled by Mr
Francois Pinault, the French industrialist.
Mr Pinault, head of the debt-burdened Pinault-Printemps retailing group,
regarded the purchase as 'a good, long-term investment,' an aide said
yesterday. she added.
The Medoc estate was put on the market late last year.
The decision reflected a change in management strategy after the group's
Pounds 147m foreign currency loss in 1991. The focus switched to
international growth brands and improving return on assets.
The deal values Latour at Pounds 86m - little more than half its estimated
value two years ago.
Allied, which has been associated with the vineyard for over 30 years,
emerges from the deal with a small profit. It became the majority
shareholder in 1988 when it paid Pounds 58m for the 53 per cent stake held
by Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times.
The sale completes the rationalisation of Allied's wine business. It sold
its Kendermann and Langenbach business in Germany last year and yesterday
sold its US importing company, Frederick Wildman, to management.
Its wine operations now comprise Callaway, Clos du Bois, and Williams Hill,
in California, Calvet in France, the UK shippers and whole-salers, Harveys
and Grants, and the Victoria Wine retail chain.
Mr Pinault, 56, one of the new breed of French entrepreneurs, expanded his
business activities rapidly during the 1980s from a Breton-based timber
company into one of the leading French retailers with a turnover of FFr70bn
last year.

FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Grandeur abandoned in favour of
competition - Shareholder interest was high at two Italian meetings
yesterday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN LESS than a month, the Ferruzzis, Ravenna's most famous family since the
Emperor Theodoric, have hit the headlines in a dynastic decline almost as
dramatic as that of their predecessors.
'There isn't a family in the world which is rich enough to feed the needs of
such an industrial heritage,' said Mr Carlo Sama, the outgoing managing
director of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's second-biggest private
company.
Speaking at the shareholders' meeting in Ravenna, the rich and staid former
capital of the western Roman empire, Mr Sama, husband of one of the three
daughters of Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, the group's founder, admitted mistakes
had been made in managing the group, which lost L1,667bn (Dollars 1.08bn)
last year.
However, indirectly shifting the blame for the troubles to his predecessor,
Mr Raul Gardini, he insisted Ferfin's spending in the past two years since
he took control had been 'not for grandeur, but to remain competitive on the
world scale'. The Ferruzzi family, which has been virtually excluded from
the group's management, 'will continue to give its support in a different
way,' he said.
However, yesterday's meeting was overshadowed by reports that Milan
magistrates, who are monitoring the Ferfin rescue on behalf of minority
shareholders, had discovered new irregularities in the group's accounts.
The magistrates' latest move follows Monday's surprise announcement by
Montedison, Ferfin's main industrial subsidiary, of additional losses of
L435bn following a write-down at a little-known Curacao unit.
Ferruzzi maintained that its officially-declared loss, adjusted in the light
of the revised Montedison figure, remained accurate.
Observers suggested the division between the company and the magistrates
stemmed partly from differences over L188bn of debts attributed to an
obscure Luxembourg-based Ferfin subsidiary. A company official said the
figure had been included in Ferfin's consolidated balance sheet, which
showed borrowings of L31,332bn, as a credit now deemed to be irrecoverable.
He said the magistrates were possibly investigating whether the money, which
Ferfin claims represents a credit to a foreign trading company, might have
been used for other purposes, such as payments to Italian politicians.
Mr Sama revealed that Ferfin's sales had risen by 29 per cent to L5,689bn in
the first quarter of 1993, while gross operating profits jumped 48 per cent
to L718bn. The sale earlier this year of the Erbamont pharmaceuticals
subsidiary would produce an extraordinary gain of about L80bn. Erbamont
would also contribute L43bn to group profits for the first months of this
year before the sale.
The disposal had helped to reduce Ferfin's net indebtedness by L1,008bn to
L14,115bn on March 31. The total effect on Ferfin's finances of the
two-stage disposal would be a L1,860bn boost through a mixture of additional
cash and reduced debts.

Explaura Holdings, the USM-quoted company which quarries limestone
aggregates in Newfoundland, showed an increased loss of Pounds 2.37m for
1992, compared with Pounds 2.11m.
From turnover of Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 1.92m) operating profit was Pounds
517,000 (Pounds 263,000). A reduction in costs and expenses was outweighed
by an exceptional Pounds 774,000 bad debt arising on the cessation of New
York distributorship. Losses per share were 1.61p (1.66p).
Inco, the principal shareholder, continued to give assistance. On the
financial side it had made available a facility of up to Dollars 450,000
(Pounds 300,000) to continue operations. Royal Bank of Canada agreed to
defer payments of principal and interest during the reorganisation.

Shares in Pittards tumbled from 71p to 60p yesterday after the leather
company warned that difficult trading conditions meant that profits for the
first half of 1993 would not be at the level that it had hoped.
In March, Pittards said higher sheepskin prices had meant a 16 per cent drop

per cent higher at Pounds 1.27m.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Midland &amp; Scottish Pounds 96m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND &amp; Scottish Res-ources, the offshore oil producer, yesterday revealed
an Pounds 80m provision against its Emerald Field development. This resulted
in pre-tax losses more than doubled from Pounds 46.4m to Pounds 96m for
1992.
However, Mr Jon Hawksley, managing director, said that MSR would be back in
the black in 1993, as he did not expect to have to make further provisions.
Both its 25p and its 10p shares fell 3p to 14p.
The provision was based, the company said, on current expectations of total
recoverable reserves from the field.
It added that the results of this drilling programme would need to be
assessed and taken into account before the audited accounts could be
published.
As a result they will not be appear until late this month. In 1991, the
provision had amounted to Pounds 38.9m.
In July 1992 Midland &amp; Scottish Energy, an MSR subsidiary, assumed, with the
agreement of the Emerald Field partners, the role of field operator from
Sovereign Oil &amp; Gas. In August, the field came into operation. MSR said that
after a satisfactory build-up, the performance of individual wells had
'varied considerably from that predicted' by Sovereign.
Turnover in 1992 grew to Pounds 28.1m (Pounds 5.97m), but after operating
costs including depreciation, amortisation of oil and gas expenditure, and
administrative expenses, operating losses almost doubled to Pounds 15.5m
(Pounds 9.03m). Exchange gains of Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 583,000) were more
than offset by finance costs of Pounds 7.65m (Pounds 423,000), though the
sale of vessels produced a surplus of Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 1.43m). Losses
per share were 47p (22p).

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hardy Oil calls for Pounds 29m via rights
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDY Oil and Gas has launched a rights issue which will raise Pounds 29.1m
net enabling it to acquire more producing oil and gas fields and improve its
cash flow. The directors said the issue was partly prompted by changes in
North Sea oil taxes.
Hardy is issuing 22m new shares on a 1-for-4 basis at 133p each. At
yesterday's close the shares fell 3p at 159p.
'We want to bulk up our cash flow and boost the profit and loss account and
the best way to do it is to buy current production in the UK and overseas',
said Mr Peter Elwes, chief executive.
Building up cash flow will put the company in better position to take on the
heavy costs of financing future field development in the UK.
Its share of development costs for the Elgin and Banff fields could be as
much as Pounds 120m, with work on Elgin expected to begin in 1995 and Banff
the following year.
The proposed changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes will have a short-term
effect on the profit and loss account - by removing a tax credit of nearly
Pounds 7m enjoyed last year.
The government's transitional relief will reduce the impact on cash flow.
Mr Elwes said the rights issue would help the company cope with the change
in taxes in the next two years, after which the reduced PRT rate will make
its stakes in producing fields, such as the Forties, more profitable.
Proceeds will be used to buy more interests in the North Sea and possibly
the Wytch Farm offshore development near Bournemouth.
Hardy is also looking to increase its position in Canada where oil
production costs are as low as Dollars 3 a barrel and buy some exposure to
the North American gas market.
These assets will generate cash flow immediately which will help finance
future growth. The debt to equity ratio was 44 per cent at the end of March
and the rights issue will bring it down to 38 per cent.
The rights has been underwritten by Lazard Brothers and brokers are Cazenove
and Kleinwort Benson Securities.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Speedy return on RTZ's move into US coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining group, has already sold the
three gold and silver mines it acquired in February when it made a Dollars
470m (Pounds 313m) move into the US coal business with the acquisition of
Nerco, the floundering natural resources company owned by PacifiCorp.
Ironically, the recent rise in the gold price started by the high-profile
activities of Mr George Soros and Sir James Goldsmith helped to speed RTZ's
disposals, which will bring in at least Dollars 40m.
Also Nerco had decided to dispose of its precious metals mines before being
acquired by RTZ. In 1992 Nerco recorded pre-tax provisions of Dollars 310.2m
to write down the assets to estimated net realisable value and to provide
for disposal costs and estimated operating losses to the date of disposal.
Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted overseas investment arm of the Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa, is paying Dollars 21m cash for Nerco's Pikes
Peak Mining Company, which owns 80 per cent of the Cripple Creek mine in
Colorado. This mine last year produced 42,000 troy ounces of gold and 12,000
ounces of silver and has 1.4m ounces of gold in its reserves.
Kinross Gold, a US company formed from the merger of Plexus Resources, CMP
Resources and 1021105 Ontario Corporation, is paying Dollars 16.8m cash for
Nerco's DeLamar gold-silver mine in south-west Idaho and the Candelaria
silver mine in western Nevada.
DeLamar produced 38,000 ounces of gold and 1.82m ounces of silver last year.
Reserves include 787,000 ounces of gold and 17.5m ounces of silver.
Mining operations at Candelaria were suspended in November 1990 because its
reserves were almost exhausted, but ore processing continued and the mine
produced 2,000 ounces of gold and 1m ounces of silver last year.
The sale to Kinross also includes the American Mine gold prospect in
California and the Dunka Road base metal mine in northern Minnesota.
Nerco has also agreed in principle to sell its Con mine in the Northwest
Territories of Canada to Red Lion Management, a Vancouver-based
conglomerate.
No price has been revealed so far for Con, a deep underground gold mine
which produced 120,000 ounces of the metal last year and has more than 1.1m
ounces in reserves. The sale includes 16,700 acres of mineral interests
around the mine in the city of Yellowknife of which only 12 per cent has
been explored.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Equitable Dutch deal approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEAL under which Aegon, the Dutch insurance group, will acquire control
of Scottish Equitable Life Assurance Society took an important step forward
yesterday when with-profits policyholders approved the transaction.
The deal means that the Edinburgh-based institution will cease to be a
mutual company.
At a special meeting the change was approved by 29,885 policyholders, with
1,491 against.
Only two policyholders voiced serious opposition to the deal, the largest
demutualisation by a British life company. Scottish Equitable said it needs
to make the change to bring in new capital to continue expanding its
unit-linked business.
Under the deal Scottish Equitable will transfer all its business to a new
company, Scottish Equitable Plc, which will be 100 per cent owned by Aegon.
Aegon will inject Pounds 40m into this company and also pay Pounds 200m for
an initial 40 per cent stake in Scottish Equitable Plc's unit-linked and
other non with-profit business.
The with-profits fund will remain for the sole benefit of with-profits
policy holders. A voting trust is to be established to give additional
safeguards for the rights of all policyholders.
At the meeting, Mr Colin Fisher, a with-profits policyholder, moved the
transaction be adjourned for three months.
'This is a takeover (by Aegon) from day one,' he said. He called for 'proper
scrutiny of the strategy that led to this position - only that can tell us
if the people sitting opposite are the right people to be running the
company.'
The motion to adjourn the meeting was defeated by 167 votes to eight.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Belgian side helps Wilshaw
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A full year's contribution from its Belgian subsidiary in the distribution
side helped Wilshaw lift pre-tax profits by 59 per cent.
For the year ended March 31 it produced Pounds 2.13m (Pounds 1.34m) from
turnover ahead 34 per cent at Pounds 31.7m (Pounds 23.8m).
Earnings per share came to 1.59p (1.07p) and the final dividend is 0.35p to
make 0.5p (0.4p).
The outlook for the current year was encouraging on all fronts, directors
said.
The distribution division markets components for agricultural equipment. It
lifted sales to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 10.3m) and operating profit to Pounds
1.91m (Pounds 993,000).
In specialist metals sales were Pounds 11m (Pounds 9.03m) and profits held
at Pounds 1.07m, while building products produced Pounds 4.46m (Pounds
4.42m) and Pounds 393,000 (Pounds 365,000) respectively.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Power systems is GEC's star performer -
Chinese show 'incredible' interest in fossil-fired turbine generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER SYSTEMS, GEC Alsthom's operations in power generating equipment and
transport systems, was the star performer among GEC's principal businesses
with an order book up 24 per cent at Pounds 6.1bn. Profits rose from Pounds
157m to Pounds 174m, on sales of Pounds 3.1bn compared with Pounds 2.8bn.
China, Taiwan and Germany were among the countries ordering fossil-fired
turbine generators. Lord Weinstock said there had been 'incredible' interest
from China which had yet to translate into orders.
Orders were won for combined cycle gas turbine power stations in Europe and
Asia including a 2,500MW power plant for Hong Kong and a 1,700MW station in
the Netherlands.
Lord Weinstock said that GEC Alsthom's order book for rolling stock was now
full for the next three years. Main contracts include 27 trains sets for the
planned Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam network, and 139 night
service coaches for the Channel tunnel.
The company managed to achieve negative net assets of Pounds 81m on its
power systems business because of pre-payments received for large capital
projects. Apparently low margins achieved on such contracts were misleading,
Lord Weinstock said, because of the interest which could be secured on the
pre-payments.
However, both revenues and profits fell in telecommunications as orders for
System X equipment from BT fell off rapidly. Sales of Pounds 1bn and
operating profits of Pounds 106m were achieved, GEC said: 'in trading
conditions characterised by falling volumes and prices.'
The price GEC is able to charge BT for an individual line has fallen to less
than a quarter of its value in the late 1980s because of the growth of
miniaturisation and integrated circuits.
A BT order valued at Pounds 579m, principally software for advanced
applications, is the key to GEC's prediction of modest growth in sales and
profits for the coming year. First half sales and profits, however, will be
well down on on 1992-93.
Operating net assets were reduced by Pounds 120m as greater efficiencies are
sought. Lord Weinstock warned that some parts of the company were beginning
to invest in developments which would not reach the market. A review would
be conducted soon to identify and cancel these developments: 'It is not a
big issue but 10 of these projects can end up costing you Pounds 100m a
year' he said.
Electronic systems, comprising principally the defence businesses, showed an
increase in sales despite declining defence expenditure in the US and UK.
Exports grew 38 per cent to Pounds 862m and the order book advanced 9 per
cent to a record Pounds 4.9bn.
Operating profits came to Pounds 264m after reorganisation costs and
development expenditure on programmes for the Eurofighter 2000, equipment
for the Merlin helicopter, the US F22 fighter and an in-flight entertainment
system for United Airlines.
Other parts of the business which performed well included office equipment
and printing, achieved principally through the re-equipping and
restructuring of AB Dick, the US-based office equipment supplier, and strong
growth at Videojet, a world leader in continuous ink jet printing.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Abdullah brothers resign Starmin executive
positions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABDULLAH brothers, who built up the Evered aggregates company through
acquisitions in the 1980s, yesterday resigned their executive positions at
Starmin, the quarry products company where they bought control in 1989.
Starmin also announced it had delayed publishing its accounts for last year
because the board was reviewing its accounting policies. As a result, the
previously recommended final dividend of 0.2p would not now be paid.
The company's shares fell 2p to 2 3/4 p.
Mr Osman Abdullah resigned as chief executive and has been replaced, on an
acting basis, by Mr Owen Rout, former chairman. Lord Parkinson, the former
Tory cabinet minister who joined the company in April last year, has been
appointed chairman immediately. Mr Raschid Abdullah will remain on the board
as a non-executive director.
Mr Rout refused to comment on the details of the review before it was
completed. But he said it covered technical matters. 'There is no indication
there is anything of a fraudulent, malpractise nature involved,' he said.
The review is understood to have been prompted by concern among some
directors and Samuel Montague, the company's financial advisers, about
Starmin's acquisition accounting policy.
In a statement yesterday, the company said its review would cover 'the
disclosure and accounting treatment of various acquisitions and disposals'
made in 1991 and 1992.
Previously announced results for these years, which showed a Pounds 1.9m
pre-tax profit in 1991 and a loss of Pounds 8.1m last year, may have to be
restated.
The Abdullahs bought into Starmin, then called SI Group, in 1989 following
their departure from Evered, now called Evered Bardon. The brothers launched
a string of acquisitions, including eight in 1991, largely financed by three
rights issues within two years.
But despite an initial rally, Starmin's shares performed poorly and were
overshadowed by concern about the company's acquisition strategy and
mounting worries about recession in the construction industry.

There was little change in half year results at Dwyer, the Irish-based
commercial property investor, as losses on sales masked a substantial
improvement in underlying performance.
In the six months to March 31 net rents fell to Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 2.59m)
and that was exacerbated by losses on disposals of Pounds 537,000. However,
there were substantial reductions in administration costs and interest

Losses per share came to 2.84p (2.85p).

<TEXT>
HALVED pre-tax losses of Pounds 11.1m, compared with Pounds 22.4m, were
announced by Seafield, the Dublin-based transport, warehousing and property
group, for 1992.
The loss was mainly attributable to a write-down in property values of
Pounds 6.6m and Pounds 1.9m of realised losses on the sale of properties.
Exceptional losses last time amounted to Pounds 19.5m.
Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said the property division had been slimmed down
and over the past three months the group had been involved in negotiations
for a restructuring.
Turnover improved to Pounds 45.2m (Pounds 22.8m). Interest charges fell to
Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 5.39m) as property disposals allowed the group to repay
Pounds 17.8m of borrowings.
Losses per share were cut to 15.4p (31.9p).

PILKINGTON, the glass company, gave Mr Roger Leverton, its new chief
executive, options to buy 1.08m shares at 107p under the senior executives
share option scheme.
Mr Leverton joined the group on July 1 last year when the share price was
123p. Yesterday the shares closed up 5 1/2 p at 127 1/2 p. He cannot
exercise the options for three years from the date of grant.
The accounts also show that Sir Antony Pilkington, executive chairman,
received Pounds 347,318 in 1992-93, up from Pounds 335,278. Mr Leverton
received between Pounds 230,000 and Pounds 235,000 for the nine months from
his appointment.
Directors' salaries are set in April each year, and this year no increases
were awarded, compared to a 4 per cent rise in 1992 and 7 per cent in 1991.
The directors have not received any performance bonuses for those three
years either.
A pension payment of Pounds 215,000 was made to Mr Derek Cook, who retired
last year, relating to his 8 year stint in India in the 1970s.

EASTERN Electricity yesterday produced the largest profits increase in the
regional electricity results season so far with a 28 per cent rise at the
pre-tax level.
It declined, however, to join the dividend race which has seen REC pay-outs
soar.
The dividend increase of 15 per cent, bringing the total to 19.2p, was less
than the 15.9 per cent set by Seeboard on Tuesday, but still at the upper
end of the range.
Mr James Smith, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our operating strength
has been reflected in benefits to both shareholders and customers.
'The value of our shareholders' investment has increased, while customers
are benefiting through competitive energy prices and continuing improvements
in services.'
Pre-tax profits at the Ipswich-based company amounted to Pounds 183.4m in
the year to March 31, up from Pounds 143.1m. Turnover was Pounds 1.92bn
(Pounds 1.88bn). Earnings per share jumped 30 per cent, from 38.6p to 50.1p.
The gain came partly as a result of an attack on costs; 1,100 jobs went
during the year, and 400 more are due to go this year, contributing to cost
savings of Pounds 20m a year.
There was also a sharp turnround in the electricity supply business: last
year's operating loss of Pounds 9.7m was transformed into a profit of Pounds
31.4m thanks to a Pounds 17m reduction in earlier under-recovery of costs
because of regulatory controls.
The electricity distribution business saw operating profit fall from Pounds
175.9m in 1992 - when it was boosted by Pounds 15m of over-recovery - to
Pounds 158.4m.
There was a net loss of Pounds 1m on retailing activities, and the loss on
contracting widened from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 4.9m because of a poor
market.
A strong cash flow enabled gearing to be reduced from 31 per cent to 17 per
cent.
Mr Smith said the dividend increase was 'warranted by the profit stream' and
was 'a statement of confidence in the future'. Dividend cover was raised
from 2.3 to 2.6 times.
Customers benefited from frozen prices and a Pounds 5 energy efficiency
rebate in the year.
COMMENT
Eastern used its strong results to improve its low dividend cover rather
than set a new pay-out record, which was prudent, if disappointing for
shareholders. Analysts will be looking for signs of fresh strategic
direction as Mr Smith hands over the chief executive reins to his chosen
successor John Devaney, who inherits a heavy agenda of cost-cutting and
structural work in loss-making areas like retailing and contracting.
Although the market pushed the shares up a few pence on the result, they
settled back to close the day unchanged at 472p on a prospective yield of
about 5.6 per cent, close to the sector average.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: AAH extends over-the-counter operations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AAH Holdings, the acquisitive pharmaceuticals distribution group, has
extended its over-the-counter operations with the acquisition of M&amp;S
Toiletries and the connected Beauty Concessions - collectively MSBC - for an
initial Pounds 15.6m in shares, cash and loan notes.
MSBC is a wholesale and retail distributor of toiletries, cosmetics and
other pharmacy OTC products.
Edinburgh-based, it has 'a strong position in the Scottish market and has
been building market share in the north of England', said AAH.
In the year to June 30 1992, MSBC's sales (adjusted for inter-company
transactions) were Pounds 25m and are forecast to be not less than Pounds
29m in the current year.
Pre-tax profits in 1992 were Pounds 900,000 and, on a pro forma basis, are
warranted to be at least Pounds 2.1m for the 12 months to completion.
Of the initial Pounds 15.6m, the 2.39m shares to be issued to the vendors
will be retained for at least six months.
Further consideration of no more than Pounds 1m in loan notes will depend on
the valuation of assets at completion.
Net assets at June 30 1993 were not less than Pounds 4m.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone falls Pounds 9.9m into loss -
Results worse than expected after exceptional costs totalling Pounds 31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARTSTONE, the hosiery and leather goods group which has issued three
profits warnings in recent months, yesterday stunned the City with Pounds
31m above the line costs, forcing it into pre-tax losses of Pounds 9.86m for
the year to March 31.
The results, which compared with a profit of Pounds 22m last year, were
depressed by Pounds 11.8m in rationalisation charges and write-downs, and a
further Pounds 18.7m in exceptional restructuring costs. Before exceptionals
there was a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.83m.
The shares fell 3p to 36p.
Analysts said yesterday it was too early to determine the long-term future
of Hartstone, built up by former Albert Fisher chief Mr Stephen Barker
through a rapid series of acquisitions. The group, which had breached
banking covenants, was in refinancing talks with bankers. Gearing stood at
120 per cent and was expected to rise further.
'The figures were a shambles,' said one London analyst. 'People were
expecting a pre-tax profit of almost Pounds 9m. To come in at a loss of that
figure . . . leaves one wondering where it all will stop.'
Most analysts said any attempts at forecasts for the current year would be
futile until talks with the banks became clearer. Meanwhile, the accounts
would be prepared on a going concern basis, which depended on the success of
the discussions.
Mr Shaun Dowling, the non-executive director who replaced Mr Barker as
executive chairman in May, was harsh on past management. They had purchased
businesses 'unwisely', he said, while some of the smaller acquisitions had
lost 'significant amounts of money', leaving large inter-company debts.
The board became aware of difficulties in November, Mr Dowling said, when
the group moved from quarterly to monthly accounts. However, trading
continued to worsen, and the group issued a profits warning in March. Two
months and two further warnings later, it was forecasting profits of not
less than Pounds 8.7m.
However, it had not become clear until the board meeting on Tuesday night
that the group would have to take Pounds 18.7m in exceptional charges for
further restructuring. Some Pounds 6m of this would be paid in fees to
renegotiate financial facilities. Closure costs were estimated at Pounds
10.8m, with Pounds 1.8m in goodwill being written off.
On the trading front, Mr Dowling was cautious, but confident. Hartstone, he
said, 'has profitable businesses capable of further development'. He
announced the appointment of a new finance director to improve reporting
procedures, Mr Stephen Oakley, formerly of Macarthy, the pharmacies group.
Group trading profits were 10 per cent down at Pounds 21.9m on sales ahead
56 per cent to Pounds 370.3m. A 67 per cent increase in hosiery profits to
Pounds 9.47m had not been enough to offset the 34 per cent decline in
leather goods to Pounds 12.4m.
Hartstone benefited from a Pounds 6.7m gain on currency transactions
following the devaluation of sterling.
There will not be a final dividend, leaving the 2.8p interim as payment for
the year (total 4.875p). Losses per share were 12.4p (earnings 21.1p).

Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, saw his pay increase from Pounds
419,749 to Pounds 702,759 last year, according to the music and rental
group's latest annual report.
The package was made up of basic salary of Pounds 460,000, up from Pounds
407,500, approximately Pounds 12,759 (Pounds 12,249) of benefits in kind and
Pounds 230,000 this time of performance related bonus.
Thorn EMI has now changed its performance related scheme to include a larger
element of shares, rather than cash, and to make it more closely tied to
long term continued improvement, the company said.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier buys French publisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED ELSEVIER, the international publishing group, has acquired more than 96
per cent of Editions Techniques, the largest general publisher in France, in
a deal worth Pounds 77m.
In May the company announced an agreement under which it would have at least
a controlling interest.
Editions Techniques publishes Juris Classeurs and La Semaine Juridique and
the acquisition is part of Reed Elsevier's strategy to extend its
professional publishing interests in continental Europe.
Apart from owning a leading medical publication, Encyclopedie Medico
Chirurgicale, Editions Techniques holds a controlling interest in Jurisdata,
the legal database company, and a 40 per cent stake in Litec, the legal book
publishing company.
Mr Herman Bruggink, director of legal and medical publishing worldwide for
Reed Elsevier, will become chairman of Editions Techniques from July 2.
Mr Bruggink said yesterday: 'We are creating a powerful European base for
our legal publishing businesses by acquiring Editions Techniques.'
Together with Butterworths, Reed Elsevier's UK legal publisher, further
European expansion is planned.
The merged Anglo-Dutch group, owned by Reed International and Elsevier, is
also pushing ahead with its planned Dollars 425m (Pounds 283m) purchase of
Official Airline Guides from Price Waterhouse, the joint administrator of
Maxwell Communication Corporation.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Scholl paying Pounds 14.5m for French
healthcare brand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOLL, the UK-based personal healthcare products group, is paying FFr125m
(Pounds 14.5m) cash to acquire the Septivon antiseptic wash brand from Elf
Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical group.
The purchase of Septivon fits Scholl's strategy of acquiring niche personal
health care brands with strong market positions which play to Scholl's
distribution strengths in the western European and Pacific basin markets.
Scholl, which reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.1m on turnover of Pounds
151.3m last year, has been pursuing growth through brand development,
acquisition and the licensing and distribution of other leading brands.
Last year the group acquired the Scholl retail operations in Canada from
Schering Plough and Gerard House, the UK-based herbal medicines business.
Septivon was introduced in 1972 and is one of France's leading antiseptic
washes with a 17 per cent market share and sales last year of FFr60.8m of
which FFr51.7m were in France and the remainder in Switzerland and a number
of former French territories. In France one third of sales were by
prescription with the remainder over-the-counter.
The healthcare group believes there is scope to enhance the marketing and
growth of the Septivon brand in France and to expand its penetration in
other markets through Scholl's international distribution network.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Mercedes contract for Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the UK motor components and aerospace group, has won its
first ever contract to supply diesel fuel injection systems to
Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury car maker.
The contract, described only as of 'substantial' value by Lucas executives
yesterday, marks a new stage in the UK group's relations with Mercedes.
Lucas has supplied other components to the German concern, but this is the
first time it has worked in a long-term partnership with Mercedes jointly to
develop new technology.
Engineers from Lucas' Diesel Systems subsidiary have been working with
Mercedes counterparts for five years to develop the
electronically-controlled system, called EPIC, which is being introduced on
Mercedes' advanced, multi-valve OM 604 diesel engine fitted to its new C220
car range.
Analysts estimate that the business initially should be worth about Pounds
15m a year to Lucas.
This is based on diesel versions being expected to account for some 20 per
cent of the new C class cars' hoped-for 250,000 annual sales, and a likely
value of approximately Pounds 300 for the Lucas units.
However, analysts also believe that the eventual value of the business
should be much larger, as the system is adopted for other Mercedes diesel
models and by other manufacturers.
Lucas acknowledged yesterday that it is talking to 'several other' car
makers about supplies of the new injection system.
Lucas claims currently to have 32 per cent of the existing European market
for diesel fuel systems.
It said the new system is the first to be designed specifically for
electronic control.

FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ICI seeks restructure of polyurethane
industry - Struggling European market hit by falling prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the chemicals group, is calling for a
restructuring of Europe's struggling polyurethanes industry.
The company, which views the sector as one of its core businesses, said it
was prepared to participate in any restructuring. The market is struggling
from a combination of over-capacity, falling demand and tumbling prices.
Mr Richard Stillwell, managing director of ICI polyurethanes, said: 'If
prices continue to fall, there will have to be rationalisation. If we were
approached by someone we might well be interested.'
The European market will have fallen between 5 per cent and 6 per cent this
year after static growth in 1992, according to ICI. That compares with
growth of up to 7 per cent during the late 1980s.
ICI said the polyurethane sector's plight has been aggravated by large slugs
of new capacity coming on stream. The European industry has a capacity of
about 12m tonnes a year, of which about 140,000 tonnes is excess.
Mr Stillwell said: 'We would like to build on our areas of strengths. If
anyone offered us a component part of the MDI market we might be
interested.' MDI (diisocyanato-diphenyl-methane) is a raw material for
polyurethanes.
ICI's areas of strength include supplying the automotive, consumer appliance
and footwear industry.
The industry must take some imaginative steps, said Mr Stillwell. ICI might
consider doing an asset swap, even though its polyurethanes operations were
not overburdened with non-core activities.
Bayer, the German group, has added a new production line at a plant in
Spain, whose 65,000 tonnes capacity was only partly offset by the closure of
a small production line.
Meanwhile, BASF of Germany has acquired an east German plant, adding about
35,000 tonnes a year to capacity, which it may have also increased thanks to
bottlenecking. Dow of the US has also bought a new plant with a 65,000
tonnes a year capacity.
Prices have fallen - depending on the particular grade - by about 33 per
cent over the last 18 months from DM3.80 a kilo to about DM2.60.
'I believe prices have reached rock-bottom,' said Mr Stillwell. 'Although we
are making money in Europe, break-even point has been passed for most other
producers if you include fixed costs. At these prices I do not think the
industry can cover reinvestment or spending on the environment.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clyde Blowers, the specialist engineer, is calling for Pounds 3.6m partly to
finance the acquisition of Boiler Products Engineering, based near Brussels,
Belgium, from Stein Industrie (France), a wholly owned subsidiary of GEC
Alsthom.
The total consideration, including payment of debt to its parent company, is
about Pounds 3m cash.
BPE designs, distributes and services boiler cleaning equipment. It made
pre-tax profits of BFr15.8m (Pounds 306,000) on turnover of BFr229m in the
12 months to March 31 1993.
At that date it had net assets of BFr57.9m.
The rights issue of 800,000 new ordinary shares is on the basis of 4-for-5
at 500p each. Yesterday the shares closed 37p down at 633p.
The issue is fully underwritten by Allied Provincial Securities.
In addition to funding the acquisition, proceeds from the rights will be
used to reduce short-term borrowings and to provide future working capital.
Clyde Blowers also forecast profits of not less than Pounds 182,000 pre-tax
for the year to August 31 and a final dividend of 8p.

FT  01 JUL 93 / GEC advances 4% on lower sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG growth in orders for turbines and trains coupled with careful cost
control helped GEC, the UK industrial group, push pre-tax profits to Pounds
863m last year, 4.1 per cent up on 1992.
Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director, expressed pessimism about the
immediate and medium-term prospects for the UK economy. 'Nothing much is
going to happen. Even when the recession ends, it will never get back to
where it was. Politicians are doing their best to damage confidence in
investment.'
Trading conditions both in the UK and overseas, where the company had 67 per
cent of sales, were poor. Turnover fell to Pounds 9.41bn from Pounds 9.43bn,
while operating profits slipped to Pounds 702m, against Pounds 695m, in the
year to March. Earnings per share rose nearly 6 per cent to 19.7p.
An increased final dividend of 7.62p will be paid, taking the total to
10.3p, up 7.3 per cent.
The company's efforts to contain costs and improve efficiency incurred
Pounds 90m in redundancy and restructuring charges, Pounds 25m more than the
year before. About 9,600 jobs were shed during the year, reducing staff
costs by 7 per cent and leaving the head count at 138,000.
The results were broadly in line with analysts' expectations. With the
market judging the performance to be sound but unexciting, the share price
gained 1p to close at 339p.
Lord Prior, GEC chairman, said the company was investing heavily in the Far
East and south east Asia, winning big contracts for power generation plant
and other equipment in China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia.
The UK government was showing more willingness to back its exporters through
export credits in the style to which the UK's principal competitors were
accustomed. 'This change is to be welcomed, although Britain's manufacturing
base is now unfortunately too small to bring about a rapid reversal of our
large adverse balance of payments. To do this, consistent and supportive
policies are required over a period of years,' he said.
The company closed the year with net cash of Pounds 1.2bn, a Pounds 415m
increase. In addition, the group's share of net cash in joint ventures and
main associated companies was Pounds 985m, giving total cash of Pounds
2.18bn. Interest income was Pounds 149m, up 42 per cent despite lower rates.
The year-end order book stood at Pounds 12.3bn, 16 per cent higher than
1992.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Hanson bets on rebound in plastics: The UK conglomerate's
bid for Quantum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, PAUL ABRAHAMS and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who thought Hanson was settling into sedate old age was swiftly
disabused yesterday. Lords Hanson and White may be getting on in years. But
as their Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.13bn) bid for Quantum Chemical shows, they
are still good for a gamble.
In bidding for Quantum, one of America's biggest bulk petrochemicals makers,
Hanson is taking on a hugely indebted company in a wickedly cyclical
industry. Bulk plastics prices have plunged in the recession. In the past
two years, Quantum has made net losses totalling Dollars 411m. Its net worth
is minus Dollars 471m. Hanson, with no previous experience of
petrochemicals, is betting the cycle is about to turn up.
If the gamble sounds heroic, Hanson is shortening the odds in three
respects. First, it is paying Hanson shares for Quantum's equity, valued at
Dollars 720m. Second, it will refinance Quantum's Dollars 2.5bn debt
mountain at much lower rates.
Hanson has worked this tactic before, in taking over the similarly
over-borrowed aggregates and housebuilding company Beazer for Pounds 351m
two years ago. Quantum, Hanson said yesterday, is paying rates of more than
10 per cent on its debt. 'We currently borrow at less than half that rate,'
Hanson said. The net effect, it claims, will be a saving of Dollars 125m in
the first year.
Third, Quantum has just invested Dollars 1.6bn in new plant. This gives
Hanson crucial breathing space. Highly capital intensive industries such as
petrochemicals can generate cash even while recording losses. This is
especially true if, as in Quantum's case, there is the prospect of an
investment holiday for the next few years.
But the real prize would come if the cycle turned up. Last year, Quantum
made operating profits of just Dollars 61m on sales of Dollars 1.2bn. In
1988, at the peak of the cycle, it made operating profits of Dollars 760m.
Hanson calculates that every cent per pound on the price of polyethylene
adds Dollars 35m-Dollars 40m to profits. 'We know that patience is
required,' Mr David Clarke, chief executive officer of Hanson Industries in
the US, said yesterday. 'But we would rather get in while we have a chance
to buy value.'
Though Hanson is new to the world of petrochemicals, it has plenty of
experience of the bulk chemicals cycle. In 1985 Hanson acquired the US
conglomerate SCM, the world's third biggest producer of the chemical pigment
titanium dioxide. Hanson bought SCM at the bottom of the cycle. It then sold
off the rest of the company, thus getting the titanium dioxide business
almost for nothing. Then the cycle turned up, and in the late 1980s Hanson
profited hugely.
What are the chances of pulling off the trick again?
All plastics are suffering from over-capacity, poor domestic demand,
rock-bottom prices and a collapse in export markets, in particular to Asia.
The low density polyethylene (LDPE) sector, of which Quantum is the US's
largest manufacturer, is probably the best placed of all plastics markets.
The company has an annual capacity of about 717,000 tonnes and about 20.5
per cent market share.
'LDPE is profitable at the moment, and there isn't much additional capacity
to come on stream,' says Mr Don Bari, a partner at Chem Systems, the
specialist consultants. Supply and demand is not too badly out of shape, he
says, with American LDPE capacity expected to be 3.7m tonnes next year and
domestic production requirements at 3.43m tonnes.
However, the outlook for linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and high
density polyethylene (HDPE) is far grimmer. The two markets are closely
linked because many US plants are capable of switching production from one
to the other.
Quantum is the second largest producer of HDPE, with capacity of about
776,000 tonnes a year, and about 14 per cent of the US market. It is also
the third largest US manufacturer of LLDPE with capacity of about 300,000
tonnes a year and about 16.5 per cent of the US market.
Analysts believe there is not a single manufacturer of HDPE in the US making
money at the moment. From a peak of about 45 cents per lb in 1990, prices
have plummeted to 28 cents. Recent attempts to raise them have been
unsuccessful.
The market is unlikely to recover until 1996 at the earliest. But it could
be further undermined by two new plants due to come on stream in the next 12
months, a 250,000 tonnes a year plant owned by Formosa, and a 225,000 tonnes
complex built by Himont. A further 650,000 tonnes of LLDPE is due to come on
stream when a Unipol plant is completed in about 1995.
New York analysts gave the deal their cautious approval yesterday. Mr Paul
Raman, of SG Warburg, said: 'Fundamentally, this appears to be a good deal
for both companies.' Hanson, he suggested, might float off the Suburban
Propane business for Dollars 400m, sell the Texas ethylene plant for Dollars
700m and shed the rest of the non-polyethylene business for Dollars 625m.
It would be surprising if Hanson has not done sums along these lines. But
the key point remains the timing of the chemicals cycle. In buying Beazer,
Hanson took a similar punt on the aggregates cycle in the US. So far, the
results have been meagre. Given the higher stakes in the Quantum deal, there
is less margin for error this time.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Gilt sentiment tested by disappointing auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government yesterday carried out its biggest ever borrowing exercise,
but the auction of Pounds 3.25bn of gilts was also one of its most
disappointing.
The cover - the ratio of offers to accepted bids - at the Bank of England's
auction was only 1.1, the worst level for five years and well down on the
market's forecast of at least 1.5.
Long gilt futures at first fell sharply. However, the market's faith in UK
economic trends, in particular low inflation, helped prices to more than
recover the lost ground. This enabled the Bank of England to announce
another Pounds 800m of 9 per cent gilts due 2008 in the late afternoon.
The low level of bidding initially raised concern that gilt yields might
have to rise to enable the government to meet its Pounds 50bn borrowing
requirement for 1993-94, pushing up costs.
The government is, however, well advanced with its fund raising. In the
first three months of the year it has borrowed Pounds 19.5bn, two thirds
through auctions and the rest through taps or gilt sales.
Yesterday's auction of 8 per cent gilts due 2003 was targeted at overseas
investors who prefer 10-year bonds. Overseas buyers, particularly from
Japan, have been piling into UK gilts recently, attracted by low inflation,
slow recovery and a strengthening pound. But sterling's recent rally against
a number of European currencies has diminished the opportunity for currency
gains.
Demand has also been checked by a rise in gilt prices, with remaining
appetite to some extent sated by three small taps at the end of last week,
totalling Pounds 850m, and some unofficial gilt selling.
Mr Andy Tweed, a gilts specialist with BZW, said: 'The market has been
pigging itself with sweets before the main meal.'
Most economists were surprised by the low cover and the unusually large
'tail' - the gap between the lowest accepted bid price and the average bid
price.
Mr George Magnus, economist with SG Warburg, said: 'It was very
disappointing, especially after the flurry of overseas buying that the
market has seen for the past couple of weeks.
'But the fundamental economic reasons why people have wanted to buy gilts
over the past two weeks have not changed.'

FT  01 JUL 93 / Ratners cuts losses and picks new name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS, the jewellery retailer, which last November lost Mr Gerald Ratner,
its one-time chairman and chief executive, yesterday reported reduced losses
and a two-year refinancing agreement with its banks.
It also announced it was changing the company name - but not the shops  - to
Signet Group. However, Mr James McAdam, chairman, said that trials of new
formats for some Ratners stores would include experiments with different
names.
The group blamed the weak economic environment for its failure to meet sales
and profit targets in the year to January. In the US, better second half
trading had caught Ratners short of stock and with some uncompetitive
pricing.
Mr McAdam said that another 54 shops would be closed in addition to the 330
already announced.
Cost savings of Pounds 51m had been made during the year and stock cut by
Pounds 84m. Gross margins had risen from 51.9 to 57.2 per cent, mainly
because of lower levels of discounting in the UK.
The figures were in line with forecasts made in January, after the
all-important Christmas period. Group sales fell 17.7 per cent from Pounds
1.1bn to Pounds 928.6m. Thanks to cost cutting and higher margins, operating
profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 6.2m. UK
losses fell from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 14.5m, while profits in the US
advanced from Pounds 18m to Pounds 20.7m.
Interest charges were Pounds 32.4m, up from Pounds 27.2m. Exceptional losses
were cut from Pounds 98m to Pounds 18m, which included a Pounds 14m
provision for additional shop closures. This left pre-tax losses at Pounds
40.1m, down from Pounds 122.3m.
With much of group borrowings denominated in dollars, sterling's weakness
helped push debt up from Pounds 223.2m to Pounds 287.9m. Operations
generated cash of Pounds 83.6m. Mr McAdam said this 'very positive
underlying cashflow' should allow Ratners to start paying down debt.
Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 302.6m to Pounds 256.6m. Arrears on
preference shares went up from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 30.3m. Mr McAdam said
that before the group could consider a capital restructuring, 'the first
thing to do is get the trading line right'.
Ratners shares rose 3p to 35 1/2 p and are up from a low of 11p this year.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Fiat admits it paid Pounds 19m bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>

   TURIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GIOVANNI Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat, yesterday admitted that Italy's
largest private group had paid L50bn (Pounds 19m) in bribes to politicians
and their intermediaries over the past 10 years.
Mr Agnelli also disclosed that Fiat planned to raise up to L3,000bn this
year in asset sales to offset rising debt and the prospect of a 1993
operating loss close to L1,000bn.
Details of the bribes are in the as yet unpublished accounts, but Mr Agnelli
assured shareholders at the five-hour annual meeting: 'The total amount paid
out in (illicit) contributions to political parties over a decade by the
managers of Fiat group companies have had no significant repercussions on
the profits of the group.'
He said there was no case of accounts having been falsified because the
amounts were minimal in relation to assets, although some accounting
adjustments had been made.
He insisted that 'at consolidated level, we feel that the amount of these
payments in no way affects reliability of our financial statements since the
total is no more than 0.024 per cent of consolidated stockholders' equity'.
In this respect, Mr Agnelli yesterday showed his full faith in Mr Francesco
Paolo Mattioli, the chief financial officer and one of the two most senior
executives to be jailed while being interrogated on charges of alleged
corruption.
Defending the behaviour of some 20 executives in six companies involved in
magistrates' inquiries into corruption, Mr Agnelli said: 'Our managers claim
they were obliged to make such payments to prevent their companies from
being forced out of the market or to avoid harassment in the course of the
public works or supply contracts'.
Mr Agnelli was vague about the extent of his suspicions of the level of
corruption in Italy, but conceded he had had some reservations about
Cogefar-Impresit, the group's construction arm.
Mr Caesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive officer, also defended his role in
the corruption affair.
He said that when the scale of Fiat's involvement became clear, a meeting of
the group's co-ordination committee was called and a new ethical code drawn
up.

FT  01 JUL 93 / US court ruling puts back Nafta approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPROVAL of the North American Free Trade Agreement appears unlikely this
year after a US federal judge blocked its consideration by Congress when he
ruled that the treaty's impact on the environment had not been assessed.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the court's decision was
not in the public interest and the administration would request an expedited
appeal to a higher court. Meanwhile, it would continue to negotiate side
agreements governing labour and the environment with Canada and Mexico, the
other countries in the pact.
The pact is bogged down in those negotiations and faces a battle in a
Congress worried about lost jobs.
Although the higher court might come to a decision within two months, there
is no guarantee it would find in the administration's favour.
Judge Charles Richey found that Mrs Carla Hills, the former trade
representative, and ex-President George Bush had violated the Administrative
Procedures Act by negotiating and signing Nafta - due to be implemented in
January - without assessing its impact on the environment.
The judge said they had violated the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA), which requires an environmental impact statement for 'every
recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major
federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment'.
Mr Kantor said that, besides interfering with the president's ability to
negotiate international agreements, the ruling raised serious doubts about
the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which might also require environmental
impact statements that could take months or years to compile.
If there is a delay in passing Nafta, Mexico's economy would suffer worst.
After the judge's decision, Mexico's stock market closed nearly 2 per cent
down. Investors had expected an early Nafta accord to boost growth.
The suit was brought by three environmental groups - Public Citizen, the
Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth. Mr Michael McCloskey, chairman of the
Sierra Club, said: 'This critical decision means trade agreements can never
be negotiated again without a conscious consideration of the environment.'

FT  01 JUL 93 / Date set to end passport controls in most of EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NINE MEMBERS of the European Community agreed yesterday to abolish formal
passport controls at all internal frontiers by December 1.
From that date, travellers between Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal,
Greece and the Benelux countries will be able to pass freely across internal
borders, including ports and airports.
Travellers from Britain, Ireland and Denmark will still be subject to the
same immigration checks as other international travellers arriving in the
free-travel zone.
The deal, if it can be put into effect, will put pressure on Britain - which
strongly opposes removing all passport checks - Ireland and Denmark to speed
up their efforts to reduce controls.
Meeting in Madrid, ministers from the nine signatories of the Schengen
free-travel accord agreed to give practical effect to the EC's aim of free
movement of people. Politically, it has proved the most sensitive aspect of
the single European market, which already allows free movement of most
goods, services and capital within the EC.
The Schengen group is named after the Luxembourg town where a regional
agreement to open frontiers was reached in 1985.
Mr Carlos Westendorp, the Spanish EC affairs minister, who chaired
yesterday's meeting, said the deal was 'good news for Europe at exactly the
moment when we need some good news'.
Yesterday's political declaration is subject, however, to conditions,
insisted on by the new centre-right French government, which is still
worried about the risks involved in allowing free movement of people.
In addition, certain large EC airports - including those serving Amsterdam
and Brussels - will be given time to adapt their infrastructure to the new
system, which will require splitting immigration and baggage-handling
facilities for passengers from Schengen and non-Schengen countries.
The delay means that some controls may be retained beyond December 1, even
for travellers within the Schengen zone.
A special Schengen committee will have to decide in October whether there
has been sufficient progress in three key areas to justify opening all
internal borders: improved checks on people coming from outside the free
travel zone; action against drug trafficking; and the establishment of a
Schengen information system, linking police and immigration authorities in
the nine member states.

FT  01 JUL 93 / News At Ten to stay put after wave of political protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS AT TEN, ITV's flagship television news programme, is to keep its
traditional slot for the foreseeable future after political protests at
suggestions that it might move to an earlier time.
The ITV companies that were suggesting the programme should be moved,
possibly to as early as 6.30pm, backed down yesterday in the face of firm
opposition from the Independent Television Commission and growing
parliamentary pressure which included a letter from Mr John Major, the prime
minister, expressing concern.
Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, wrote to the chairmen of all 15
regional ITV companies, warning them that they risked being in breach of
their broadcasting licences if they moved the main evening news without ITC
permission.
Eight of the companies had proposed in their bids for franchises running the
main evening news at 10pm, and the ITC legal advice is that those
commitments represent core obligations of their broadcasting licences.
Earlier, Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, had suggested
that hostile parliamentary opinion on the News At Ten issue might have
flowed over to ITV ownership issues.
A number of large ITV companies want a relaxation of the rules to allow the
nine largest companies to take over each other. Such a move, if the
government goes ahead with it, would require a resolution in both houses of
parliament.
Although the ITV companies could challenge the ITC interpretation of its
powers in the courts, that is now unlikely to happen.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV council, last night said ITV would take
into consideration 'the full range of programming, public-interest,
commercial and legal issues, and it will only consider changes which are
permissible within the law'.
Mr Dyke said the issue was now unlikely to be resolved as planned at a
meeting on Monday.
ITV executives conceded last night that the idea of moving ITN to the early
evening had been an 'own goal', and a detailed business assessment had never
been prepared.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last, British Rail has chugged into the modern world of accounts by
ascribing a balance sheet value to its track and signalling infrastructure
and depreciating it over its economic life. InterCity grumbles this rather
spoils its figures but the change only brings BR into line with standard
practice elsewhere. It is necessary to put a commercial valuation on BR's
assets even if the government's plan is for piecemeal privatisation. Only
then will would-be buyers be able to see what individual parts are really
worth.
BR clearly could not become a viable private sector business as it stands.
An operating margin of 0.4 per cent on a turnover of Pounds 3.1bn before
revenue grants is unlikely to attract any investors. In the government's
scheme, BR will be fragmented into some 50 pieces and the best bits pointed
towards the private sector.
Here, crude cash calculations will be the most critical factor. BR's
accounting changes give the appearance of fattening up profits.
Paradoxically, though, the less profitable that individual operating units
are, the greater their attractions may be. Providing the government concedes
large, continuing subsidies to such franchises, a higher level of fixed
income would accrue to their owners. By cutting costs, private sector
operators might then be able to generate a reasonable return.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The travails of technology companies around the world from IBM to Philips
and Olivetti go some way to justifying the caution of Lord Weinstock and
GEC. Consumer electronics and basic computing have become cut-throat
commodity businesses. GEC's refusal to expand into such markets earned it
many critics in the late 1980s; it now looks more sensible. Meanwhile the
traditional focus on cost reduction has cut working capital by a further
Pounds 176m in the year just ended, albeit helped by advance customer
payments.
Of the main operations GEC Alsthom, the power generation and transport joint
venture has exploited worldwide demand for combined cycle gas equipment.
Admittedly it is low margin business, but potential for expansion in Asia
compensates for that. Defence has increased its order book by 9 per cent
despite cuts in western defence budgets. Telecommunications has suffered
from the reduction in BT's capital programme, but even this division will
benefit in future from System X upgrading and more sophisticated software
development.
GEC has shifted away from its dependence on the UK government and is also
moving towards less capital intensive manufacturing areas. It stands a
better chance of earning good margins in such businesses as air traffic
control and medical systems. The market has markedly changed its view on the
company despite the predictable earnings track. Yet GEC's capacity to
capitalise on its current position will still depend on its political access
to governments worldwide. That can never be fully guaranteed.

FT  01 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cover at yesterday's gilts auction was the lowest since January 1988,
but the market was quick to overcome initial disappointment. For the time it
seems determined to look on the bright side. Including funding carried over
from 1992-93, the authorities have raised over Pounds 20bn so far this
financial year, of which nearly Pounds 6bn has come in June. The speed with
which demand revived as the market fell yesterday suggests an appetite for
more despite the recent fall in yields. The Bank is so far ahead that it can
afford to slow the pace of its borrowing substantially if it chooses.
With hindsight it could even be argued that low cover was a sign of how
confident the market actually is. It may have deterred bargain hunters from
making rogue bids. Such arguments advanced after the event, though, begin to
smack of complacency. With so many gilts to sell, the authorities need the
help of overseas buyers. They in turn must have some confidence in
sterling's exchange rate and a reasonable yield premium over alternative
paper.
The message from yesterday is that there are still enough international
investors who feel comfortable even with sterling at a rate around DM2.55.
But the yield differential between gilts and German bunds has shrunk to
little more than 100 basis points, which starts to look tight. The markets
have treated Mr Kenneth Clarke kindly so far, but he does not have much room
for error. Just Pounds 350m fewer bids out of yesterday's Pounds 3.56bn
would have left the auction uncovered. One wonders how quickly the market
would then have regained its poise.

FT  01 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson's Quantum theory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is perhaps an indication of Hanson's stolid mass that a Dollars 3.2bn
deal will have a modest impact on the company's prospects. It is also a mark
of the caution in takeovers that agreed deals with appropriate due diligence
are the model for the 1990s. Hanson's claim that Quantum will be mildly
earnings-enhancing in 1994 looks reasonable given reduced interest costs and
the improvement in operating profits which was expected prior to the deal.
That said, the petrochemicals market remains fiercely competitive and
further consolidation is required, as Quantum's hard-pressed position showed
all too well. Yet even if Quantum's earnings double in 1995, and Hanson's
rating remains unchanged, the acquisition will add less than 10 per cent to
the value of the group.
The constraint on Hanson's ability to complete a very large deal is shown by
the strain on its balance sheet. Gearing was 18 per cent at the last year
end, but if the current transaction is completed in time to be consolidated,
gearing will rise to over 80 per cent this year. In part that reflects the
rise in the dollar, and interest cover is more than adequate. Nonetheless, a
deal which would have had a substantial impact on Hanson's prospects would
in all probability have pushed gearing to unacceptable levels.
Disposals thus seem likely, and it may be that smaller businesses in the US
or even Quantum's propane retailing operation will be put on the block. For
the foreseeable future, however, Hanson is stuck with organic growth and
bolt-on acquisitions. A cyclical upturn would help, but it is all a far cry
from the gung-ho raiding of the 1980s.

Notice to mariners. If the bank balance is running low it might be worth
giving Salterns Marina in Poole a wide berth. It has been identified as the
country's most expensive yacht marina by the Royal Yachting Association. It
charges Pounds 3,889 a year, plus harbour dues, to moor a 30-foot yacht,
which is nearly 50 per cent more than it costs to reserve a space in one of
NCP's city car parks. Salterns' managing director John Smith is unrepentant
about his charges. 'Everything about this place is quality' he told Lloyd's
list. 'We have five gold anchors. . . .'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However much the sun may shine on Britain during the rest of the summer,
certain of the Church of England's more traditionally minded members must be
banking on a far sunnier one next year.
The reason lies in their belief about the Almighty's attitude to the
controversial Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins, who in his past days as a
professor of theology has waxed a touch sceptical about the virgin birth and
the resurrection.
Three days after he was consecrated as bishop in York Minister in 1984, the
building was stuck by lightning and badly damaged by fire. The
traditionalists decided it was a sign of God's disapproval of the
appointment.
If so, with the 68-year-old Jenkins under notice to retire in 12 months
time, heaven should surely turn on the heat benignly in celebration.

At risk of damning him with faint praise, Chris Green, managing director of
British Rail's InterCity subsidiary, enjoys a reputation as one of the
railway's brightest sparks. All the more bizarre, then, to find him going
out on a limb yesterday by publishing his own rather eccentric version of
InterCity's annual results.
His motives look simple enough. By defying the new (and entirely
commendable) accounting standards adopted by the British Railways Board, he
has created the illusion that his profits have gone up instead of down. But
what on earth can have been going through his mind to make him think people
would fall for such a ploy?
Unfortunately Observer was unable to ask him because he had gone on holiday
to Turkey, leaving Sir Bob Reid, BR's hapless chairman, to sort out the
mess. Let us hope it is a long and restful break, and that Green comes back
more like his old self. Heaven knows, privatisation poses enough problems
for BR without one of its most respected and influential managers going off
the rails.

'What's in a name?' If Shakespeare's Juliet asked her oft-quoted question at
the moment, the corporate world could supply some punny if not funny
replies.
Ratners, whose name was perhaps indelibly tarnished by association with
crap, has re-titled itself Signet Group.
The new name has 'a nice ring to it', explains chairman Jim McAdam. Besides,
in sound albeit not in spelling, it has transformed what had been an ugly
duckling into a young swan.
New feathers have also been taken on by Control Securities, just switched to
Ascot Holdings. Finance director John Kerslake says that although some old
geezers are still around there, that is not why the new name was chosen. Nor
has it anything to do with hot water.
Moreover, although it's purely a flight of fancy, Kingfisher's progress
since its translation from Woolworth suggests yet a further change.
Surely Heron would do well to rename itself Phoenix now it is rising anew
from the flames - lit by a Ronson, of course.

Slow-moving corteges could soon be a thing of the past if we're to put a
literal interpretation on the words of one Alan Edwards, president-elect of
the Funeral Standards Council. 'Some funeral directors are failing to keep
pace with consumer expectations . . .,' he says.
As part of its 'quest for excellence', the newly-formed undertaking is to
appoint a funeral ombudsman. Since there hasn't been one to deal with
matters of death before, the first incumbent will be advised by the body
concerned with perhaps the nearest equivalent: the Insurance Ombudsman
Bureau.
Given the nature of the job, however, the council might do well to arrange
for additional advice from the Society for Psychical Research. After all, to
keep proper watch over the quality of services, the funeral ombudsman will
need ways of hearing complaints from the principal consumers who, given
modern methods of disposal, will in most cases have themselves been
consumed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL MATES, the former Northern Ireland minister, is convinced that
something is wrong with the system whereby the controversial businessman Mr
Asil Nadir is, or is not, being brought to justice. Who could disagree? Mr
Nadir has inflicted losses on hundreds of innocent people. He has obstructed
the administrators of Polly Peck in their attempts to retrieve something
from the wreckage. He has jumped bail, despite retaining enough money to
hire the best lawyers in the land.
Yet Mr Mates worries about the plight of Mr Nadir, now sunning himself in
northern Cyprus. He accuses the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) of a campaign to
undermine Mr Nadir's defence. In his own campaign, however, Mr Mates has
failed to deliver persuasive evidence of any conspiracy. There is a debate
to be had about the SFO's powers and its style, but Mr Mates has not made
the case for basing that case on the Nadir affair. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, was right yesterday to reject an independent inquiry and
his decision to publish the relevant correspondence, albeit in edited form,
is welcome.
Mr Mates's priorities look quixotic. Mr Nadir, in contrast, is no Quixote,
but he must be congratulating himself on finding a Sancho Panza prepared to
defend his interests to the death. The government's priority should still be
to put Mr Nadir on trial. That may be a pious hope, but ministers have
little alternative but to apply further pressure on the Turkish authorities
to secure the return of a man who has made a fool of Britain's politicians
and its courts.

FT  01 JUL 93 / A steady hand at the helm: Eddie George, who takes over
today as Bank of England governor, discusses his aims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and RICHARD LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A posse of technicians will soon be at work in the Bank of England moving a
battery of computer terminals from the deputy governor's office into the
governor's next door.
The move of the screens carrying market news between the two 'parlours'
opening on to the Bank's Garden Court will be the first visible evidence
that from today a new hands-on manager, Mr Eddie George, has taken over
running the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.
The 54-year-old Mr George is a keen sailor and so sports the light tan that
is de rigueur among modern-day central bankers. But he comes from a very
different background from his patrician predecessor, Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton.
Mr George was the Bank's deputy governor until midnight last night. He is
only the third insider to take the top job since the Bank was nationalised
in 1946. The computer terminals and the cigarette that is usually in his
hand tell of a central banking career that has developed in a symbiotic
relationship with the world of financial markets.
Interviewed in his old office this week, Mr George chose his words with a
fluent caution born of 31 years working in the Bank.
Spelling out the priorities and concerns that will colour his five-year term
of office, he:
suggested Britain had the potential for recovery continuing 'through the
rest of this decade';
warned that there must be limits to the protection that bank depositors can
expect;
reaffirmed his belief in more central bank autonomy while dampening
expectations that he would campaign for it; and
made clear that, while the Bank would act as the 'interface' between the
City and industry, it was not the governor's job to be the chief spokesman
or champion of the Square Mile.
But the word that cropped up most - some 20 times in 50 minutes - was
'stability'.
Achieving stability is Mr George's prime policy goal. His determination to
put stability first bears witness to years of frustration trying to manage
monetary policy in a nation that has too often suffered inflation and
lurched from slump to boom.
A passionate belief in stability - generally expressed in terms of low
inflation - coloured his observations on many issues, ranging from the
purpose and morality of monetary policy, to central bank independence and
European economic and monetary union.
But first he was asked whether his elevation and the appointment of Mr
Rupert Pennant-Rea, formerly editor of the Economist, as his deputy would
lead to a change of style and management at the Bank after the 10-year
governorship of Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who was noted more for his skill in
delegation than day-to-day management.
'Yes. There will necessarily be a change of style. I was quite clearly
brought up in the Bank and have been totally involved in what you might call
the plumbing. So I shall continue to take an extremely close interest in the
plumbing.'
But being governor necessitated at least 30 days of foreign travel a year.
'So, inevitably, I shall be distanced from the day-to-day affairs to a
degree that I haven't been hitherto.' At those times, Mr Pennant-Rea would
'run the Bank in the way that I have done'.
But otherwise Mr George seemed determined to stay in control. The only
formal change in the management structure would be turning the existing
deputy governor's committee, which has functioned as a kind of executive
committee, into a more formal executive committee with Mr George, as
governor, staying in charge. 'I'll chair it when I'm here and Rupert will
chair it when I'm away . . . Rupert and I, I see as being like twin arms of
an armchair. I expect us to work extremely closely together.'
Unlike their predecessors, both men have a clear mandate from the government
to put the combat of inflation before other goals. This new framework and
the government's inflation target have been 'extremely helpful' and
'remarkably successful', says Mr George.
Low inflation is important because it is a necessary condition for economic
growth. 'I think by achieving stability, you are better able to achieve
sustainable growth, sustainable increases in employment, sustainable
improvement in national wealth and therefore better able to achieve your
social objectives, whatever they are.'
It also provides a reliable basis 'for taking all the major economic
decisions . . . And I think it is the way we can move towards a long-term
economy rather than a short-term economy.'
There is a moral aspect to stability, too. 'What you get if you get high and
variable inflation is a totally arbitrary distribution of wealth in real
terms. And I think on the whole with inflation it is the weaker sectors of
society that get disadvantaged compared with the financially more
sophisticated.'
Indeed propagating stability is more important than achieving greater
operational autonomy for the Bank, he says. Mr George's remarks suggest that
he will be happy to join Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, 'sitting on
the fence' in the debate about whether Britain should have a more
independent central bank.
'The thing that I shall lobby for is to broaden the constituency and support
for stability, because in a sense unless you actually have public, political
support for stability . . . then greater autonomy, statutory accountability,
call it what you like, wouldn't be terribly effective.'
Although Mr George believes that 'on balance and over time' more operational
autonomy for the Bank would help it achieve stability, he concedes that
'it's not, in this particular set of circumstances, a case that's made.' He
declines to predict that he will be running an independent Bank of England
at the end of his first five-year term.
Independence is no magic black box that brings stability in its wake. 'I
think there is no doubt that the constituency for stability is the horse.
The rest is the cart,' he said.
Unlike Mr Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's new governor is not too enthusiastic
about the example of New Zealand, which has given its central bank
operational independence while making it accountable to a Westminster-style
parliament.
'I don't pretend to be a constitutional expert,' he said, but 'I do think
it's quite dangerous to take any model and simply seek to transpose it
internationally. There are a lot of differences between the New Zealand
situation and ours. On the whole, it's a small economy, probably more
sensitive to monetary instruments than ours is.'
By contrast, conducting monetary policy in Britain is a complex business.
According to Mr George, '400 pieces of information' have to be taken into
account when changing interest rates. The Bank and government must look at
the exchange rate and 'all the movements of financial markets. All the
monetary indicators; not just broad money. What's happening in credit.
What's happening to the sectoral behaviour - the personal sector, the
industrial sector, the financial sector. All the real economic indicators.
The behaviour of the fall in unemployment and what that is telling us about
the economy.'
But are not UK interest rates changes political, rather than economic? Mr
George looked slightly pained. He admitted that the precise timing of two
recent base rate cuts - January 26 and last November - was influenced by
political pressures. But he insists: 'We took the initiative to cut interest
rates in January and we did in response to the 400 or 4,000 indicators.'
However, the perception that the government was behind the move was costly.
'It does have a corrosive effect over time, that it creates the impression -
I think the largely false impression - that actually monetary policy is
dictated by political considerations.'
'It's a pity and it's expensive in the sense that perception undoubtedly
increases the risk premium that is on UK rates. And you could see it created
for a time a weakening in the exchange market which wasn't justified by
fundamentals.'
Are there not other areas where the Bank's reputation is endangered? It has
had an unhappy record with bank supervision over the past decade, for
example.
Mr George believes that supervision 'probably can most effectively and
efficiently be done here', although he is 'not dogmatic or doctrinaire that
the consumer protection dimension of banking supervision must remain with
the Bank'.
What concerns him more is the growing perception among the public in the
wake of the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International that
bank depositors should be guaranteed against all risk.
'If you produce too much protection to depositors, you can actually
undermine systemic stability through moral hazard. I would be extremely
worried if people felt that simply because the name of a institution is on
the list of authorised institutions that this was in some sense a guarantee
against risk.
'There is risk in all financial transactions and I think it's pretty
dangerous if we lead people to thinking that that can be eliminated. They
need to take responsibility for what they do themselves with their money.'
But does this approach to consumers mean that Mr George sees himself as a
spokesman for the City? 'I don't think I would feel that the governor of the
Bank should be chief spokesman for the City. I think the governor should be
the chief spokesman for sound money.'
There are circumstances where 'the governor of the Bank of England needs to
represent the concerns of financial institutions if he feels they are not
being understood by government,' he says. But the governor is 'not a
champion for the financial institutions'. The Bank has a 'catalytic role'.
It tries to ensure that the conditions are right for the financial industry
to prosper. But Mr George wants to 'step back from the idea of being the
spokesman for the City almost in opposition to other parts of the economy. I
just see the City being part of my work,' he says.
The clock is ticking. 'Books', the morning meeting of the Bank's directors,
is less than 10 minutes away and questions still have to be put about the
European exchange rate mechanism and the European Community's plans for
economic and monetary union.
Stability first is the watchword for Europe as well as for the UK. 'I've
basically had the view that you really have to achieve internal stability
first. If you do that in convergence with the other major countries that
will actually deliver de facto as much exchange rate stability as
realistically is achievable,' he says. 'The hesitations I've always had in
connection with the ERM or even more in relation to Emu is trying to do the
thing the other way round, to fix the exchange rate in nominal terms and to
hope or expect that that will deliver internal stability within the area of
the exchange rate arrangement . . . I think the tensions we've seen in the
past year in the context of a hardening of the ERM essentially reflect the
fact that we got the cart too far ahead of the horse.'
On the other hand, the Maastricht convergence criteria 'are not a bad guide
to sensible national policy management'. It would be fine if Britain and the
other EC countries eventually meet the criteria and want to go ahead with
Emu, but Mr George suggests it will take longer than the final deadline of
1999 set out in the treaty.
If the rest of the UK's EC partners rush ahead with union and Britain stands
aside 'that wouldn't be necessarily the worst thing in the world'.
Looking ahead, Britain, for once, has a 'realistic chance of rather well
sustained expansion', he says. Relations between the Bank and the Treasury
are good. Although Mr George 'hesitates to predict' that such happy
circumstances will continue, he gives the appearance of a man starting his
term of office in a strong and contented position.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Police service
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S REPORT from an official committee chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy
advocates far-reaching changes to the pay and grading of police officers in
England and Wales. On Monday, the government published a white paper setting
out equally radical proposals to shake up police organisation and
management. The two documents together provide a blueprint for overhauling
Britain's police, the last public service to be subjected to the
government's reforming zeal.
The proposals follow a similar route to that already taken in the health
service, local government and education. At its heart is a clear distinction
between the purchaser of police services, the police authority, and the
provider, the police force. Police authorities will develop local policing
plans, set targets, determine budgets and monitor the performance of their
forces. The 43 police forces in England and Wales will provide the services,
with much greater freedom for their managers, the chief constables, to
manage their forces.
This approach requires that public services work to clearly-defined
objectives. It should provide much greater information about how well
different police forces perform in achieving their targets. And it allows
comparisons to be made between forces, so that league tables can be used to
identify best practice and raise the performance of under-achievers.
Inside each police force, responsibility will be delegated to line managers
in individual police stations, who will be encouraged to become more
responsive to their local communities. Three middle management ranks are to
be abolished, and a switch made to fixed-term employment contracts. As in
the rest of the public services, performance-related pay will replace the
existing pay scales with their myriad allowances and automatic annual
increments. In short, what is proposed is a performance culture within which
good policing is rewarded and bad police officers are shunted out of the
service.
All of this is welcome, and long overdue. However, setting performance
targets needs finesse if the work of an organisation is not to be distorted.
Targets for response times to emergency calls, for example, could be
achieved by putting more police officers in cars - leaving fewer of the
'bobbies on the beat' which most people say they want to see.
And in one respect, the government has failed to learn an important lesson
from its reforms of other public services. Better management and tighter
focus on clearly defined targets can do much to improve the efficiency of
service providers. But creating effective purchasing bodies which are
responsive to local needs is not achieved through unelected quangos. They
lack the local representation that is essential for creating a responsive
service reflecting local priorities. And absence of local accountability
deprives management of warning signals that can indicate serious problems,
as happened when the new computer system at the London Ambulance Service
collapsed.
To his credit, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has stepped back from
the proposal of his predecessor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, that Whitehall nominees
should dominate the reformed police authorities. But elected representatives
are likely to control less than half the votes if the chairman is one of the
home secretary's appointees. It is already apparent in the health service
that absence of local accountability has impaired effective purchasing on
behalf of communities. Ministers are heading for the same mistake in the
police service.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Stop the EC waste war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG ACCUSTOMED to complaints from its EC partners about high interest
rates, Germany now faces criticism for flooding its neighbours with another
form of unhelpful export. The cause of the concern is the excessive quantity
of waste packaging material generated by Germany's ambitious but ill-thought
out recycling scheme.
Having bowed to pressure from environmental lobbyists for hasty introduction
of a country-wide collection system, Germany now finds the results are
hurting its neighbours and itself. After several skirmishes on the subject
among Community environment ministers in recent months, France on Tuesday
threatened to ban German imports of packaging material. Other countries may
be ready to follow.
The episode highlights the need for sensible EC rules governing waste
disposal in member countries. Unfortunately, an EC directive setting down
common policies and objectives on packaging waste, under discussion for 2
1/2 years, is still a long way from agreement. The issue, which has
important repercussions for the functioning of the single market, has been
lamentably neglected during the past year. One of the more useful
contributions of the six-month Belgian EC presidency which starts today
would be to clear up what is rapidly becoming an EC-wide packaging mess.
The nub of the problem is Germany's DSD recycling network, established after
a 1991 law obliged manufacturers and retailers to re-absorb wrapping
materials. Refuse gathered under the scheme, subsidised by both consumers
and producers under a product labelling system, far outstrips the country's
capacity to recycle it. As a result, large amounts of waste are roaming
Europe, driving down prices for raw materials such as plastic, paper and
board, and damaging recycling industries elsewhere.
The system has other important drawbacks. Rules requiring companies to take
part in recycling schemes on a country-by-country basis can discriminate
against importers. The main beneficiaries have been German waste
contractors: risk-free intermediaries which arrange collection and
recycling, and pass on the bills to the central DSD company. Reflecting
rising recycling costs, the organisation itself has announced it is in
danger of financial collapse.
Outside Germany, Spanish, French and UK producers have been hit by large
quantities of subsidised German waste paper, while Belgium and the
Netherlands have complained about too much German glass. The DSD's most
counter-productive success has been in collecting plastic, which is
technologically difficult - and thus uneconomic - to recycle. This year,
400,000 tonnes will be collected, of which an estimated 160,000 tonnes will
be sold abroad. Indicating greater realism, Bonn now plans legislation to
ease constraints on plastic incineration, which may lower excess supply.
The EC's proposed directive, in its present draft form, offers only half a
solution to the free-for-all. The plan calls for countries to recover or
recycle a uniform 90 per cent of all packing waste over 10 years, compared
with about 20 per cent at present. What is required is a graduated set of
rules for different products, linking targets to ease of recycling in
different markets. In the meantime, Germany should accept self-restraint on
subsidised exports of surplus material. The last thing the EC needs is a war
over waste.

EDWARD HEATH, A BIOGRAPHY By John Campbell Jonathan Cape, Pounds 20, 876
pages
Sir Edward Heath will be 77 next week. In the last words of this 876-page
biography: 'He has outlasted all his contemporaries (in the House of
Commons); and his reputation is beginning to be restored.' In the end, it is
his staying power as a politician rather than his achievements in office
that continue to astound. He was prime minister for less than four years and
left Downing Street in near ignominy after the general election of February
1974.
While hesitating to recommend a book of such length to busy people, I would
say that it is at least as interesting as a tale of the difficulties of
governing Britain as it is an account of, by any standards, a very unusual
man. Practically all the problems that can ever afflict a British
administration came together during Heath's premiership in the early 1970s.
Unemployment passed the then politically unacceptable level of 1m. The
trades unions were rampant: there was not one miners' strike, but two, the
second coinciding with the threat to oil supplies from the Middle East war
of 1973. Northern Ireland was at its worst.
In the midst of it all, Heath was working at his ambition and lasting
achievement of taking Britain into the European Community. Even that was at
least as difficult in the House of Commons as passing the treaty of
Maastricht. It was secured only by the support of the Roy Jenkins wing of
the Labour party and the insistence of Francis Pym, the chief whip, against
all Heath's natural instincts, to allow the Tories a free vote.
It will be up to historians ultimately to judge whether the Heath government
floundered because of the prime minister's peculiar temperament or whether
it was precisely his single-minded determination that allowed it to achieve
as much as it did. John Campbell, previously a biographer of F E Smith,
Lloyd George and a short on Roy Jenkins, does not presume so far, but he
offers some significant reassessments.
The first is that it is quite untrue that Heath was the forerunner of
Margaret Thatcher but betrayed the new Tory faith in the market economy by a
series of U-turns starting with the rescue of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. As
Campbell convincingly demonstrates, Heath was never much of a free market
radical. He was a Tory paternalist who had been effectively, as chief whip,
chief of staff to Harold Macmillan. He believed in regional policy, in
interventionism and in keeping the closest eye on the employment figures as
almost the single key political indicator.
The section on Selsdon Man is brief, but telling. The conference of the Tory
shadow cabinet at the Selsdon Park Hotel in early 1970 was not especially
about economic policy; it was planned simply to bring all strands of policy
together ahead of a general election. Yet the media latched onto it. Iain
Macleod suggested telling them that it was all about law and order, which
the media fell for. It was Harold Wilson who then coined the phrase 'Selsdon
Man' - 'a lurch to the right, an atavistic desire to reverse the course of
25 years of social revolution . . . a wanton, calculated and deliberate
return to greater inequality'.
Initially, the conference may have helped the Tories because the almost
accidental publicity helped to show the country that there was an opposition
party in waiting for government. In the longer run, however, the phrase was
damaging to Heath since Selsdon Man was all that he wasn't. It represented
what he later thought about Margaret Thatcher.
Campbell's other useful reassessment is on Europe. Mythology has it that
Heath was a passionate European almost from his birth on the Kent coast.
Possibly he was, though not everyone knew it. Campbell suggests that he was
put in charge of the original, abortive negotiations with Brussels precisely
because, unlike such known Europeans as Christopher Soames, Peter
Thorneycroft and Duncan Sandys, he was thought to have an open mind.
(Incidentally, it was from that period when he was negotiating terms for
over 2,500 products that he became known as 'Grocer Heath' - nothing to do
with his relatively humble background.)
Campbell convincingly explains one more point. When Britain finally won
entry to Europe under President Pompidou, Heath believed that the country
must make a dash for growth in order to be able to keep up with its new
partners. That was the misleadingly called 'Barber boom'. It was really the
Heath boom. As Lord Barber remains reluctant to say in public, as chancellor
he was desperately worried about it, just as he was about the prices and
incomes policy espoused by Heath.
The lacuna, as it is in all books on the period, is on the detail of how and
why Heath came to call a general election on February 28 1974. If he had
held on or just possibly gone earlier, British history in the next few years
might have been very different - certainly the history of the Tory party.
For this we await Heath's own account, if it ever comes.
Luck has played a large part in his career, not always for ill. He was
fortunate to have been number two to Lord Home at the Foreign Office. Thus
he had no hesitation in supporting Home for the leadership when Macmillan
resigned. In the process his own rivals were largely eliminated, and Heath
became the natural successor. The strange unexplainable paradox is that in
1970 he won a general election he was expected to lose and in February 1974
lost when he was expected to win. Here surely is the case for fixed-term
parliaments.
There are lots of anecdotes along the way. As a boy, Heath called his dog
'Erg', after his names: Edward Richard George. Campbell forgets to tell us
what kind of dog. It is also possible that the author has a peculiar animus
against The Times. Lord Rees-Mogg, editor during the Heath years, will not
enjoy being exposed for being almost invariably wrong in his comments.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Letter: US labour market trend offers no solution for EC
unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD SEAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that, to deal with the EC unemployment problem, John Major
and others have argued for less regulation of EC labour markets ('Major
fires broadside at social policy', June 22). Within the news story and your
editorial ('EC plan from Mr Delors') the US is presented as an example of a
country where a 'flexible' labour market has allowed more job creation than
in the EC. The intentions of Mr Major's government further to deregulate
labour markets were made clear in the report on the upcoming Trade Union
Reform and Employment Bill ('A-Z of the new law for employers, workers',
June 22). The law, by allowing employers to pay more to workers who forego
collective bargaining rights and accept individual contracts, aims seriously
to undermine the influence of unions by allowing workers to be penalised for
choosing to be members of legal organisations.
The fact that anyone can present the US as an example of labour market
practice astounds me. Yes, the strength of unions has diminished over the
last 20 years. An importantcause has been the loss of unionised
manufacturing jobs and their replacement by low paying, insecure service
jobs lacking union protection.
Nearly everyone agrees the overwhelming majority of jobs created in the US
in the last decade have been of this type rather than of jobs allowing the
middle-class existence and prospects which an earlier generation took for
granted. The declining or stagnant real US wages of the last 15 years, and
growing inequality, are the direct results.
Is this the shining star that EC policy makers want to follow? This is not
to belittle what is a real problem. Unemployment is rife in all the
industrialised countries but its solution must be coupled with moves to
guarantee living standards, security and maintenance of workplace standards.
How to do this is a big task requiring innovative thinking by governments,
unions and employers. This is not made easier by focusing on ideological
solutions or ignoring the inequality and injustice 'flexible' labour markets
create.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S G GRANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In decision taking regarding political donations, some directors of
public companies may be unconsciously influenced by their personal political
views rather than by any perception of commercial benefit to their
companies.
A number of leading companies do not, however, make political donations and
it may be worth recalling the initiative taken by a highly regarded
multinational, Unilever. It consulted all its shareholders on a 'one
shareholder, one vote' basis, resulting in a narrow majority in favour of
political donations. But, as the result was finely balanced, the board of
Unilever decided not to go ahead.
The steps taken by Unilever, perhaps carried out periodically, could provide
the basis for reform to resolve this contentious issue of political
donations to public companies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK H J RADCLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (and Sir James Ball and Donald Robertson), far from
exposing 'that manufacturing fallacy again' (June 28), have highlighted an
economic fallacy. Most economic commentators are undoubtedly technically
correct but, in practical terms, are wrong to dismiss the importance of
manufacturing in our trade balance. Britain has to balance its books better
on international trade and manufactured goods if it wishes to achieve a
viable economy and standard of living.
Manufactured goods account for nearly half of UK consumer spending, and
three quarters of UK exports. These are produced mainly by world-class
companies. Without them, much of the income from invisibles, whether
royalties, dividends or profit repatriation, would not be achievable.
UK manufacturing industry provides employment for about 4.5m people, and an
equal number indirectly in related services. Without this employment, the
public sector borrowing requirement would escalate even further. In any
event, it is unrealistic to transfer all the skills to the service
industries overnight even if there was a market for them.
The high level of imports is a matter of great concern. That is why the CBI
National Manufacturing Council has launched an initiative to rebuild the
UK's supply base so as to meet both home and overseas demand more
effectively.
Overseas investors can finance the deficit by lending or investing in the
UK. Overseas countries currently own about a quarter of Britain's
manufacturing industry. But if we fail to develop our manufacturing base we
risk losing that as well. Manufacturing industry is the real key to wealth
creation. Let us encourage it to compete internationally rather than
undermine it with fallacious economic arguments.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Letter: Not convinced by gas competition argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms RUTH EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Abolishing the gas monopoly' (June 29), is right to
argue that social obligations imposed on public utilities are compatible
with competition. However, in arguing for greater competition in domestic
supply of gas you make one dubious point, ignore another and reach an
unproven conclusion.
The electricity industry in England and Wales is not a convincing model of
competition. Electricity privatisation did not result in a truly competitive
market. It produced a duopoly with knobs on - with two big generators,
regional supply monopolies, a subsidised nuclear sector financed by a levy
on consumers' bills, and imports of French electricity subsidised by the
French government. Moreover, the regulatory body, Offer, regulates prices
too far downstream from the generating sector, where two-thirds of costs
lie. This is not open competition.
You fail to address what benefits competition would deliver to consumers.
Neither you nor Ofgas, the gas regulator, has made clear what the costs and
benefits would be of the break up of British Gas's vertically integrated
business. Given the limits on consumer choice over an undifferentiated
product, coming from a single set of pipes, there is no guarantee that
consumers would gain from the abolition of price regulation. Therefore, we
are not convinced by your conclusion: 'The introduction of competition would
also bring nearer the day when regulation could be relaxed'.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Myth of European 'competitiveness'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most Western industrialised countries (in which we should nowadays include
Japan) are suffering from similar problems: recession or disappointing
growth; high and rising unemployment; and worries about the stability of
financial institutions.
Yet so strong is the human instinct to blame everything on an external enemy
or opponent that the only slogan under which statesmen can agree to discuss
the problem is 'lack of competitiveness'. This was the theme of both Jacques
Delors and John Major at the recent European Community summit in Copenhagen,
although their remedies differed.
By accident or good timing, a pamphlet has landed on my desk by John Horam,
a former Labour minister, who has persuaded himself that the Tories are the
lesser evil and now sits as Conservative member for Orpington. The pamphlet
is called Making Britain Competitive. Much of what he writes, like most of
what his leader said in Copenhagen, makes eminent sense. But in both cases
their arguments are spoiled by being put in the competitiveness framework.
The units that compete in world trade are - heaven be praised - individual
businesses and not whole nations. One can talk about competitiveness at the
national economic level only in a strictly limited sense. A country may have
cost levels, at prevailing exchange rates, which are so high as to undermine
solvency or to threaten jobs which would otherwise be safe. In this sense,
the UK was uncompetitive - as some of us saw only with hindsight - at the
old ERM exchange rate. Germany risks becoming so today.
The UK competitiveness problem was dealt with, at least for a time, by
devaluation. The D-Mark has risen against some European currencies, but has
fallen heavily against the yen and modestly against the dollar. It remains
to be seen whether these movements will be enough.
Of course, the benefits of devaluation may be eroded by inflation, as
regularly happened in the British case and could happen again. If it does -
and it need not - then the UK will be seen to have a real competitiveness
problem and one which cannot be tackled by monetary or exchange rate
manipulation.
But if most countries, not only the UK and/or Germany, are in a position
where labour costs are too high for full employment, then it ceases to make
sense to talk of competitiveness. For competitiveness is a relative concept;
and we cannot all be uncompetitive against each other.
The last international figure whom I remember making the point was Emile van
Lennep, the Dutch secretary general of the OECD between 1969 and 1984. But
Mr Van Lennep firmly rejected any diagnosis of the common problems of member
countries in terms of competitiveness. 'Against whom should the OECD as a
whole be more competitive? Against the developing world? Against the moon?'
The problem was, and is, performance, not competitiveness.
Since then, of course, many have asserted that there is, indeed, a threat
from the non-OECD world, in particular the Asian developing countries and
the former Communist countries of Europe.
The real reason why these countries are unlikely to impose an insupportable
threat to jobs in the West is that they do not export to line their bank
vaults with yen, dollar and D-Mark notes, but in order to import. Western
sales lost in home markets to these new competitors should be compensated by
the extra purchases by these countries of western products. Indeed, with
their urgent needs for imports from the West, it is inconceivable that the
developing or former Communist countries should try to undervalue their
currencies to maintain an export surplus. Their desire, for very good
reason, is for the largest imports they can finance.
These general thoughts may be cold comfort to western European steel,
textile or coal producers who feel themselves threatened; but the threat is
to staying in the same jobs at the same pay rates - not to overall job
levels.
John Major's exposition in Copenhagen was, in its statistical illustration,
mostly in terms of the EC, on the one hand, and the US and Japan, on the
other - in other words, the old rather than the new competitors. The
estimates he cited purported to show that the EC had become more
uncompetitive against both Japan and the US. This is shown in the top chart
by the steeper rise of EC labour costs.
Unfortunately, the figures contained a snag. For they were in terms of
national currencies, which ignores exchange rate changes. The bottom chart
takes them into account by expressing all costs in terms of a single
currency, namely dollars. This transforms the picture. The EC still looks as
if it has become more uncompetitive against the US. But both the US and the
Community seem to have become more competitive against Japan. The latter
country has obviously had some success in offsetting increased labour costs
by improvements in other aspects of competitiveness. Even so, Japanese
industry is clearly feeling the pinch, and American demands for yet further
yen appreciation verge on the ludicrous.
The charts should also show the futility of conducting international
economic policy in terms of competitiveness. The area against which the EC
has clearly lost competitiveness is the US. But the Clinton Administration
is vociferous that the US is not competitive enough. The competitiveness
approach soon deteriorates into a zero-sum game in which world output and
employment seem quite wrongly to be fixed and in which one group can gain
only at the expense of another.
John Horam concludes his pamphlet by saying that competitiveness 'usually
boils down in practice to mean higher standards, being better organised and
more efficient, usually also more thoughtful'. Perhaps someone will think of
a new slogan which will encapsulate these qualities - without suggesting
that we need an interplanetary war to achieve them all over the earth.
If the seemingly inexorable rise in European unemployment from one business
cycle to the next does not merely reflect uncompetitiveness against other
regions, then what does it represent? John Major gave basically the correct
explanation in terms of excessive pay rises (now much less true in the UK),
high social overheads, the Commission Working Time Directive and other
regulations which make labour too expensive. All these things, however,
would still be a threat to jobs if they were present in all countries and
blocs to the same extent.
What the exponents of the pricing-out-of-work hypothesis have still to
explain is why the phenomenon should have got worse decade by decade since
the 1970s. A first shot at an explanation is that the labour market has
become more differentiated. Market-clearing pay differentials have widened
out and are subject to more rapid change - a centralised pay norm would now
help much less, even if we could get it. Evidence for this is the widening
of pre-tax pay differentials among those who are in jobs.
The changes are much more complex than skilled workers gaining at the
expense of unskilled - the German apprentice system is itself looking dated.
If there is to be a return to full employment, much more effort will have to
be made by employers to find pay rates at which jobs can be offered and
there will need to be an end to macho-style management which measures
toughness in terms of staff cuts.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Arts: A student musical; and LIFT goes Chinese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any musical that contains the song 'Oh] You Beautiful Doll]' has a lot going
for it. You may have forgotten (I never knew) that it comes in Madame Sherry
by Otto Hauerbach and Karl Hoschna which appeared in Bloomington, Illinois,
in 1910.
Actually, the 'Beautiful Doll' song was added slightly later and the
original version of Madame Sherry was French, being first performed in
Berlin around the turn of the century. A new adaptation by Martin Connor
surfaced in Connecticut in 1989. Such a cosmopolitan history makes it
entirely appropriate for the summer musical at the Guildhall School of Music
and Drama, though the obvious question is whether it could stand a longer
run on a bigger stage.
The answer is just possibly 'yes'. The Guildhall performance opens
nervously, but gains confidence as it goes on. Here is a mixture of all the
cliches of the musical: corny plot, shaky dialogue, sentimentality, set
pieces and a happy ending. On the other hand, those are the ingredients that
can make a musical work. And if you like good bad jokes, Madame Sherry has
its stack of them: for example. 'My uncle's so rich, he keeps Swiss money in
American banks.' The bad puns are a lot worse than that, but still
appealing.
Of course, it is on the music and the lyrics that a musical stands or falls.
Madame Sherry stands. Not only 'Beautiful Doll', but also 'Put Your Arms
Around Me, Honey' and 'Every Little Movement', all of which have been taken
up by later stars. In the Guildhall production, where Martin Connor directs
his own adaptation, there is lovely chorus work, and some attractive
staging, notably in the yacht in New York Harbour. The costumes are elegant
throughout: it is a tribute to the cast that they know how to wear them.
There are good parts galore. I liked Alison Burrows's Yvonne, the girl who
arrives on the New York scene having been brought up in a French convent,
and her immensely tall father Theophilus, played by David Axel. Why Judy
Browne's Catherine has an Irish accent is beyond me, but it adds to the
teasing fun in a thoroughly enjoyable evening. The orchestra is excellent
with some fine violin playing by Sonya Fairbairn.
Meanwhile, the London International Festival of Theatre (LIFT/93) continues
across the capital until July 12. Catch it where you can. I am told by those
who have seen them that the itinerant Hanoi Water Puppets are sheer delight.
For myself, I enjoyed without understanding the Chengdu Theatre Company's
Ripples Across Stagnant Water at the Riverside Studio.
The play has elements of a Chinese Madame Bovary and is set, around 1900,
against a background of civil strife. I cannot comment on the dialogue, but
the acting, setting and musical interventions are of a very high order. One
point that struck me is how easily the Chinese move from great courtesy to
violence: almost in the same effortless physical movement.
Madame Sherry is at the Guildhall School Theatre until July 7. (071) 638

FT  01 JUL 93 / Arts: The 'kiss kiss bang bang' formula - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAD DOG AND GLORY (15) John McNaughton
THE ASSASSIN (18) John Badham
RED ROCK WEST (15) John Dahl
THE FENCING MASTER (12) Pedro Olea
'Kiss kiss bang bang' is the oldest formula in films. 'Kiss kiss' refers to
the bits where two people melt together, softened by the string section and
lured by the cosmic push towards Oneness. 'Bang bang' (leave aside more
risque meanings) refers to the bits where two or more people enact the
ultimate ritual of atomisation: split apart from each other, from the movie
or from life itself.
But 'Kiss kiss bang bang', however potent its potential, can never be the
whole story in a film: merely an underpinning to richer things. Two of this
week's American movies deploy the formula in all its schematic nakedness and
are then surprised when audiences who begin by whooping with excitement end
up sicklied o'er with the pale cast of deja vu.
In Mad Dog And Glory, screenwriter Richard Price, tangy chronicler of life
on the edge in films like Sea Of Love and The Colour Of Money, gets what he
may have thought a 'Eureka' idea for a KKBB plot. Shy police photographer
Robert De Niro accidentally saves the life of crime boss Bill Murray -
frightening off the thief who is standing on Murray's face during a
convenience store robbery - and then falls in love with the girl (Uma
Thurman) whom a grateful Murray 'loans' him. Will bullets fly when the
little man tells the big man that he cannot have the lady back?
Since director John McNaughton's last film was the grimly provocative Henry:
Portrait Of A Serial Killer, all bang and no kisses, we wonder how he will
cope with the two-tone mandates of commercial cinema. Answer: scarcely at
all. After a gruesome, Henry-ish first scene shot in black and white - a
roadside drug deal sealed with two bullets in two brains - we swing into the
wacky, all-colour world of Chicago crime and punishment.
De Niro is a timid, gentle, creasy-faced loner who hums 'That ol' black
magic' as he snapshots corpses. Murray has a mug that could crack a mirror
but he loves his friends and does stand-up comedy routines for his fellow
hoods. And Thurman is a little packet of fizzy sex appeal sent to De Niro as
a 'seven-day singing telegram' and outstaying her time limit.
These lovable goofballs never existed outside a film, nor did their
slap-happy schedule of love and violence. The romance-and-action
alternations might have been designed by a committee. A few minutes of rough
stuff out on police patrol; then a few of De Niro and Thurman going
kissy-kissy on his sofa (burbling saxophone and harp glissandoes on
soundtrack); then a few more of thudding corpses or crashing fists; then
some buddy-buddy cosiness between De Niro and Murray; then more mayhem; then
more amore . . .
Finally the film disappears up its own regimented schizophrenia: living, or
half-living, proof that when the kiss-kiss-bang-bang formula is mishandled
it no longer seems a pithy precis of human life, more the product of an
entertainment industry handing out love and violence like a pill doctor
dealing out uppers and downers.
Much the same perfunctory prescriptions are on offer in The Assassin,
America's remake of Nikita. Luc Besson's French original gave us Anne
Parillaud as a drug addict/murderess turned glamorous government hitwoman.
Spared the ultimate penalty by a state who forgave her criminal past in
return for a future of hired liquidation, she dashed around Europe popping
off VIPs while trying to achieve emotional normalcy with her boyfriend.
The cleverest, maddest scene in Nikita had the heroine fitting up her gun in
a hotel bathroom for an immediate 'hit' - she has received a phone call in
mid-love scene in the bedroom - while the boyfriend bangs on the locked door
suffering from a combination of curiosity and coitus interruptus. Hollywood
perkily re-runs this scene, with Bridget Fonda doing her nut over the
assembly-kit rifle while her frustrated Californian hippie (Dermot Mulroney)
quizzes through the door.
Elsewhere, The Assassin is less convincing than Nikita even on the French
film's absurdist, fabulist terms. As in Mad Dog And Glory, automatism takes
over the kiss-bang franchise. We begin with the explosive: robbery, murder,
arrest, violent training. Then like soothing sorbets between helpings of red
meat, we keep being served romantic entr'actes.
There is Gabriel Byrne, the secret service smoothie whose hard exterior
conceals a made-in-Hollywood heart; Mr Mulroney, our heroine's oceanside
Galahad; even Anne Bancroft, who runs the Assassin Training School's charm
school and teaches the young gels the finer things of life. Like how to
walk, talk and court; how to remove bones from the throat during posh
dinners (sic); and how to dress correctly for Mr Right.
The Bancroft scenes are totally barmy. But then as directed by John
(Saturday Night Fever, War Games) Badham, the whole film is barmy. As with
all bad kiss-bang cinema, plausibility is pushed aside by the fallacious
creed that all you need to ensnare an audience is a remorseless, nonstop
Yin-ing and Yang-ing between the romantic and the kinetic.
Red Rock West comes closer to getting the recipe right. Kiss-kiss is put on
a back burner - or allowed to lie around defrosting - until the ingredients
for bang-bang are properly heated. Job-hunting hobo Nicolas Cage, arriving
in Red Rock, Wyoming, is mistaken by bar-owner JT Walsh for the hired killer
he plans to set on his wife (Lara Flynn Boyle). Walsh gives him Dollars
5,000 for the job; Miss Boyle gives him Dollars 10,000 not to do the job -
or to do it on Walsh; and so the merry imbroglio begins.
Soon we have stalkings, ambushes, gunplay and Dennis Hopper, stark mad in a
Mexican jacket as the real late-arriving hit man. And before the bang-bang
climax in a studio-built graveyard, we have all we need in the way of
kiss-kiss: Mr Cage and Miss Boyle exchanging some moody, noirish moments of
passion in her darkened hacienda.
Director John Dahl's previous feature was another attempt at stylish pulp,
Kill Me Again. He and co-writer brother Rick must have had the complete
works of Jim Thompson or James M Cain dropped on their heads as children.
Red Rock West runs into a diminishing-returns zone before the close: too
many self-conscious 'surprises', too much strenuously hardboiled dialogue.
But before that, what a pleasure to see a kiss-bang thriller in which both
forms of consummation are dealt out slowly, teasingly, appetisingly, rather
than force-fed to us from frame one.
The Fencing Master is a similar but Spanish tale: more
kiss-kiss-swish-swish. A rapier maestro in 1860s Madrid (Omero Antonutti)
falls in love with his beautiful, mysterious lady pupil (Assumpta Serna).
Could she be a political agent, limbering up for an assassination programme
as Spain breathes the first heady scents of Republicanism?
Soon bodies are thudding to floors and corpses are being extracted from
rivers. The fencing scenes, as well as providing sublimated love play,
become teasing, inquisitorial pas de deux between the suspicious master and
the suspected mistress of deception. Director Pedro Olea, adapting a novel
by Arturo Perez Reverte, could have given his camera more rapier-like dash
and force. With each scene we seem to bog down in a new sub-Velasquez
tableau. But at least in Spain, unlike some parts of Hollywood, love and
violence are seen as subtle, seditiously symbiotic forces rather than mere
seesawing extremes for a variety-hungry audience.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Arts: Gardiner's 'Marriage of Figaro' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cycle of Mozart's operas that John Eliot Gardiner is recording for
Deutsche Grammophon is being derived from concerts which have become a
welcome feature of summer on the South Bank. Idomeneo, La clemenza di Tito
and Die Entfuhrung have appeared so far, Cos fan tutte is still to be
released, and this week in the Queen Elizabeth Hall Gardiner is conducting
two performances of Le nozze di Figaro.
'Concert performances' is a misnomer for these highly detailed
presentations. 'Three-quarters staged' would be more accurate: the singers
wear modern dress - white tie for the Count, a leather waistcoat for Figaro,
evening dresses for the women - and play in front of a painted backdrop
after Fragonard. There is a single chair, a wardrobe, but mercifully no
wigs. The London concerts follow a European tour that has included full
stagings in Lisbon and Paris and presumably all the business and the
productions points are derived from those, though no stage director is
credited in the programme.
Given the self-imposed constraints it is an energetic evening, full of
bustle and incident, with entrances spilling off the stage and into the
auditorium. It is carefully gauged so that action does not intrude into the
final recording, where the subtleties that sometimes seemed missing from the
acting (in the ambiguities of the the final-act reconciliations most
strikingly) would be able to emerge through the vocal lines. The spry,
translucent textures of the English Baroque Soloists allow the light young
voices of much of the cast to carry easily and expressively; the singers
have been chosen carefully for their vocal flexibility and wit.
With every appearance Bryn Terfel's Figaro seems to gain steadily in his
emotional range, sense of timing and vocal assurance; Alison Hagley's
Susanna, new to me, was a delight; one expected the graceful, idiomatic
singing, and winning stage manner, not necessarily the nicely judged wit.
There is a menacing, if slightly underplayed Count from Rodney Gilfry,
elegant, calm Countess from Hillevi Martinpelto. Pamela Helen Stephen makes
a gawky, nicely gauche Cherubino; Susan McCulloch (Marcellina), Carlos
Feller (Bartolo), Francis Egerton (Basilio and Don Curzio) and Julian
Clarkson (Antonio) flesh out the comedy without even descending into coarse
acting, and Constanze Backes makes a great deal of Barbarina's aria.
Most of all, though, it is Gardiner's evening; he invests every number with
dramatic pace and point, pays the closest attention to rhythmic detail and
watches and supports his singers like a ministering angel. It is always
involving, always moving and finally joyously uplifting.
The musical text is full, but Gardiner favours unconventional orderings of
the items in Acts III and IV, decisions lucidly justified in the programme.
The Countess's 'Dove sono' is brought forward in the third act, before the
sextet, and hence clarifies the progression from tension through comedy to
celebration; in the fourth the recitative that precedes Figaro's 'Aprite un
po'' is interrupted by Susanna's 'Deh vieni', to give his outburst much more
dramatic point. Traditionalists will be able to programme out the revisions
when the CDs appear; the recording, though, promises to be very special.
