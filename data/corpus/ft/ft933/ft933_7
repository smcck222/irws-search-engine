FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (6): An emphasis on
partnership - Facilities management used to be a relatively simple idea -
but not any more / Facilities management
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN the 1960s, 1970s and even early 1980s computers were so expensive that
companies could easily cut costs by 20 per cent or more by contracting out
the processing of their business systems.
In addition, the systems were well-suited to such arrangements. They were
fed with details of transactions, such as orders and payments, and printed
reams of reports, cheques and payslips.
But the dramatic fall in the cost of computing power and the development of
fast and reliable telecommunications services have cut the price of the
equipment, put business people on-line to information and inspired them to
new thinking about ways to exploit information technology. And these
developments have raised totally new approaches to facilities management.
Many traditional contracts lasting five years or more are still being
signed: UK market leader Hoskyns, for example, has won orders from the likes
of Prudential and Woolworths in the last year. The Inland Revenue is now
examining tenders for a contract put at Pounds 300m and covering 2,000 staff
working at 16 data centres.
In such contracts a service supplier takes over a company's central computer
and the computing staff. The service usually eventually moves away from the
customer's premises. The supplier makes much of its profit from its skills
in running the maximum of processing work on the minimum of equipment.
In this sort of arrangement the supplier usually takes on the maintenance of
the customer's programs. This is especially so now that companies are using
facilities management increasingly to keep their old systems running while
they introduce new systems, typically based on smaller, networked machines
installed in business departments.
Customers and suppliers generally agree on the benefits of traditional
facilities management arrangements. Studies by research firm Romtec and
service supplier CMG show that users see the biggest benefits as being a
guaranteed service at a fixed cost, known well in advance, and the fact that
they are freed to concentrate on their core business.
However, the falling costs of mainframe computers and the fact that
customers are looking at facilities management as a temporary measure while
they move to new systems mean suppliers are having to rethink their approach
to the business.
The 50 per cent annual market growth of the 1980s is now down to less than
20 per cent. Meanwhile more suppliers are going for facilities management
business: leading computer manufacturers such as IBM see much of their
future in services rather than equipment sales; and companies with big
computing set-ups are looking to the external market: Barclays Bank is a
recent example.
'It's a very competitive market now and some suppliers are taking a long
view,' says Mr Jon Whiteley, a consultant at Romtec. 'They are looking at
making a profit only after three or four years, for example from new
development work.'
A note of caution is sounded here by Mr Gary Shepherd of service supplier
AT&amp;T Istel and chairman of the Computing Services Association's facilities
management committee.
'There are thought to be 150 companies in this business now and there are
some very poor deals being made, with users just looking at cost cutting and
suppliers taking very low margins,' he says. 'This isn't doing the client,
the supplier or the industry any good.
'These days the main suppliers are talking to customers more about
partnerships, where we work together on long-term strategy and where there
might be a sharing of the risk and the rewards.'
Pioneering deals are certainly appearing. BP Exploration has signed
agreements with service specialist Sema and British Telecom under which the
suppliers win or lose depending on their performance.
'We only make a very small profit if we meet BP's targets for cost savings
but we share the rewards if we beat them,' says Sema director Mr Paul
Hopkins. 'We also stand to lose money if fail to meet the targets.'
All suppliers now talk of partnerships with customers rather than service
contracts. Indeed, contracts are being negotiated on new terms.
Computer Sciences Corporation has entered an 11-year agreement with BhS
under which it will take over the company's computing and 115 staff but also
work with it to sell the combined expertise of the two organisations to the
retail industry.
EDS is going even further. The company is now signing contracts under which
it will take on system development at no cost. But in return it takes a
percentage of the business gains made by the customer.
Its first contract of this type in Europe is in Sweden with retail group
Kooperativa Forbundet (KF), which EDS expects to be worth a massive Dollars
1bn over the next 10 years.
The contract involves a traditional facilities management arrangement, which
KF is paying for at normal market rates, under which EDS is taking over KF's
existing computing and 530 staff. But it also involves an agreement for the
two companies to work together on a new information technology strategy for
KF.
'We have a basic contract but the real incentive for us is to improve the
way information technology supports KF's business,' says Mr Tom Butler,
managing director of EDS-Scicon, the UK operation.
'People look at facilities management in terms of reducing computing costs.
Cutting those costs by 10 per cent looks good - but it's very little
compared with the savings from, say, cutting your stock turnover from eight
days to three. With this sort of contract we're saying we'll put our money
where our mouth is and do that for you in return for a percentage of your
savings.'
The terms of the agreement with KF are not revealed but the partners are
looking initially at the potentially lucrative areas of automated money
transfer and credit cards.
Tom Butler expects this type of contract to account for 70 per cent of EDS'
growth in the next three to five years.
So the company which invented facilities management in the 1960s looks set
to take it on to a new plane in the 1990s.
                         *      *      *
BENEFITS OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
Frees managers to focus on the company's core business: 77 per cent.
Provides greater financial control: 48 per cent.
Moves IT from capital to expense item: 33 per cent.
Reduces the operational risk: 24 per cent.
Provides a strategic partner: 22 per cent.
Provides a competitive advantage: 12 per cent.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (5): The pickaxe and
the PC - Disturbing statistics indicate a high level of inefficiency through
lost information in the average office / Workgroup computing and groupware
</HEADLINE>

FOR future reference, file this FT survey somewhere safe, somewhere obvious.
People waste a total of six weeks a year trying to find mislabeled, misfiled
or misplaced documents, according to a recent survey of 200 executives by
Xerox Corporation.
According to Xerox 'collaboration is an instinctive foundation of our
natural work processes', but currently, it doesn't seem to work that well.
There are more disturbing statistics. They say that 50 per cent of projects
are behind schedule, 60 per cent of an office worker's time is spent working
with documents, and the average worker has 36 hours worth of work stacked up
on his or her desk, and only 90 minutes in which to handle it.
Even worse, anything up to 80 per sent of time is spent looking for the
information needed to complete a task. This usually means going outside
one's own personal domain, referring a problem or a document to someone
else, and waiting for an answer. It is this problem that the computer
industry is now addressing with such concepts as workgroup computing (also
known as groupware), and workflow.
A chain-gang is a good place to start when looking for a definition of a
workgroup. It is a group of people brought together from various places and
disciplines, who have in common a task on which their efforts are jointly
focused. The key to the modern workgroup is the PC, not the pickaxe, but the
same principle applies. Working in unison is more effective than each person
pecking away at their small corner.
The PC has been focused closely on 'personal' productivity, with such
products as word processors and spreadsheets aimed at creating a cosy
environment for the individual. However productive on a personal level,
these do not seem to have helped mass productivity.
Michael Skok, chief executive of Maidenhead-based ESP, distributor of the
Forests and Trees groupware, sums it up bluntly: 'In the past decade, US
service companies had spent more than Dollars 800bn on information
technology and bought more than 60m PCs. The power of the PCs has increased
but white-collar productivity has only increased by less than one per cent
per annum. Personal computing isn't the answer: there has to be workgroup
information sharing.'
Groupware is software that seeks to create that productivity by linking
people who are focused on a task which can be anything from a one-off
project to an everyday process.
One person can work simultaneously on different projects, and belong to
several workgroups. This is an extension of the 'message groups' long used
in electronic mail (email). In fact, electronic mail is the basic ingredient
of much workgroup software. Instead of dealing simply with messages
originated by one person to another or to a group, the email principle is
extended to embrace documents, spreadsheets, and any other form of
information people need to pass to one another.
'Groupware' is a general term which brings under one umbrella a number of
functions that may well have been managed in separate software tools, such
as diary management, decision support, project management, conferencing,
scheduling, and database access.
Groupware's role is not only in the dissemination of information throughout
one building, but in crossing other barriers - the more physical and
geographic ones of distance and 'time windows.'
This is becoming more important as organisations look for harmony across
different countries in their IT strategies.
One of the problems of an email system is that it too can become a 'closed
shop,' a cosy environment which builds its own walls, excluding anyone that
doesn't have the right sort of terminal or PC.
It follows that a true 'workgroup' solution must be able to embrace any sort
of technology already in use, and allow users to link in different sorts of
hardware.
The advantage of this is that the links can be extended outside the
organisation itself. A good example of how barriers can be transcended comes
from within the software industry itself.
Software 2000, the supplier of accounting packages for the AS400 IBM
computer, is supplying software updates to its users for the latest version
via the Lotus Notes package for Lotus Development.
Lotus claims to have swept the board with its Lotus Notes groupware, for
which it has sold around 750,000 licences in the last two and a half years.
The product is used in around 3,000 companies worldwide, and Lotus has done
extensive analysis on its customer-base, interviewing around 40 companies
with more than 200 Notes nodes each.
According to its 1992 paper, The Impact of Lotus Notes on Organisational
Productivity, the return on investment is, on average, well over 100 per
cent, with payback taking place within three months or less.
One of Lotus' underlying principles has always been that Notes must provide
open access to existing technologies. This means that it can be implemented
without enormous cost, and without transgressing the 'Not Invented Here'
rule. This might explain why it has found such ready acceptance within other
technology companies.
Intel, manufacturer of the microprocessors which provide the guts of many a
PC, is an enthusiastic user of Notes. The re-organisation of its salesforce,
(scattered in 80 worldwide locations linked by a private wide area network,
or WAN) made it essential to have a clear route for the communication of
bookings, billings and backlogs.
Mail, fax, and other feedback methods imposed a four-week lag in the
production of a marketing plan. Now feedback is immediate, and daily.
According to Louis Burns, director of corporate marketing, Lotus Notes has
made a big difference - 'we have 1,000 people around the world working in
islands. If we can work together, the group intelligence is much higher,' he
says. Concerns about integration with other software tools, and flexibility
are noticeable in recent groupware launches. Xerox identifies integration,
ease of 'workflow mapping' and, thirdly, flexibility as the main concerns in
the industry. Xerox uses uses an underlying software methodology (known as
'object oriented technology') to create a client/server solution in its
InConcert System, recently launched by the Xerox division Xsoft.
The client/server approach is more 'open' in allowing several sorts of
different hosts or terminals to be attached to one central server, and Xerox
claims that its software can be used with other third-party software tools
such as word processors, spreadsheets and calendars.
Another new product, claiming to leapfrog all existing developments, comes
from Uniplex, a UK-owned company which managed to become the world market
leader in office automation for Unix computers, by virtue of being the
first, a decade or so ago, with a robust product. Now it is launching OnGo,
which it claims as the first distributed client/server groupware solutions
to run on all significant hardware platforms.
With OnGo it has launched another buzzword: 'Enterpriseware,' to describe
the way that OnGo can convert files from other software applications for
'mission critical' operations.
It is easy to assume that overcoming the technology is the only problem in
introducing groupware and workflow systems. In fact, one of the most
outstanding obstacles can be the people themselves.
Training is vital, plus a campaign of awareness to help staff think about
what their jobs really are, and where better communications can help.
The evidence is, that once people discover the potential of collaboration
via computer, they become creative, even imaginative, about the
possibilities that open up.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (4): New name for an
old idea - Although the client/server concept has emerged only recently, it
is based on well- established ideas of how computer power can be distributed
effectively for better business systems / Client/server systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   THERE are few new ideas in information technology
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
only variations on well-known themes. Despite outward appearances, the
advance of information technology is usually gradual and evolutionary. There
are, of course, occasional 'great leaps forward' like microprocessor chip
fabrication technology or the relational database. But mostly, progress is
slow. Users cannot afford to throw out technology and systems in which they
have invested much effort and large amounts of money. So they stick to what
they know until the pressure to change is irresistible.
The arrival of low-cost personal computers and networks has created enormous
pressure for change - with the result that increasing numbers of companies
are turning to these technologies to save money and build more flexible IT
systems. Networks of cheap computers are now able to match traditional
mainframes in performance at a much lower cost.
The client/server model - a design approach for building IT systems using
networked computers - is central to the shift away from central
mainframe-based computing to distributed systems. The client/server model
separates the functions of an IT system and distributes them across several
computers. Client computers - typically PCs or workstations - provide a
'friendly' front end and some local processing features. Server computers,
located elsewhere in the network, provide services such as database storage,
electronic mail and transaction processing.
The main advantage of the client/server model is that each component
computer can be built to suit the specific tasks it is expected to handle.
Front-end workstations and PCs can be equipped with graphics-based
'windowing' software to make them easier to use. Server computers can be
optimized to access large databases or handle many transactions
simultaneously.
Although the client/server model has emerged only a recently, it is based on
well-established ideas of how computer power can be distributed effectively.
The UK's Girobank has used this approach to its systems design since the
early 1980s and evolved gradually to a client/server system. It has always
been a large user of computer power since it was founded in 1968 as the
first 'telephone bank.' But in the late 1970s, Girobank needed a fundamental
re-appraisal of its IT systems: 'We needed to re-think the systems
infrastructure and knew we would have to replace all of our core systems,'
explains Mr Paul Podesta, facilities and logistics manager at Girobank.
The demands of telephone banking meant that Girobank needed a system which
was 100 per cent reliable, 24 hours a day. It had relied on ICL mainframes
through the 1970s but decided to move away from a single, central computer
to a distributed network.
It chose IBM mainframes, to handle batch processes such as statement
production, and several Tandem Nonstop computers for online transaction
processing. Girobank has several regional centres where the Tandem computers
process the front-end transaction load and then pass data to the IBM
mainframe. These systems are linked by a wide-area network which also has
2300 terminals and about 300 PCs connected to it. There are a further 1,000
PCs which are not connected to the network. The network must process over
one and half million transactions each day in addition to supporting the
'back-room' tasks such as statement production and accounting. The Tandem
computers act as clients to the mainframe system. The PCs, running
Microsoft's Windows, are being used as the front end - or client - for some
applications.
'We have invested in the PCs for their productivity benefits. It gives our
users access to the 'warehouse' of data on the larger systems,' says Mr
Podesta.
The choice of Tandem systems has helped to ease the move to client/server
computing. The Tandem software uses a technique called requester/server
which is very similar to client/server. Both the requester and the server
can be on the same computer - although they are separate software
components.
'We have a consistent user interface across all of our applications and it
has helped us to re-use software. A piece of server software can be called
by many different client processes. The Tandem design enforces a structure
which lends itself to re-usability.
'This makes the journey to client/server much easier.' Girobank is
well-positioned to move to the next stage and distribute more of its
business logic to the network.
To make this move, Girobank needs the right tools and Mr Podesta currently
sees this as a barrier - 'the complexity is daunting in a large system.
Small organisations can do it with a few PCs and a local area network. But
it is much more difficult with a large organisation and the tools always lag
behind the operating software and the hardware.'
He adds that it is still early in the development of large-scale
client/server systems and design techniques have still to evolve: 'We don't
know what questions you need to ask when you design a client/server system.
There is no body of knowledge to turn to so it will be a while before the
tools are mature enough.'
This in no way lessens Mr Podesta's enthusiasm for the client/server
approach, however: 'The real driving force is that client/server lets us
re-design how people work. In the past we have built computer systems which
implement sequential processes, changed the work to fit in with that and
fragmented people's jobs.
'An accounts clerk used to work with pieces of paper - ledgers and so forth.
Then the comptometer came along and took part of that job elsewhere.
Computers have taken it even further.
'With client/server we can bring it all back together.'
He is, however, realistic about the cost of the transition to client/server
and notes that the real benefits are in the user area not within the IT
department.
'The labour costs associated with distributed systems are higher - even
though the capital cost of the hardware is lower. The users have to do more
for themselves and they need support and training.'
The long-term benefits which will come from client/server systems are
related to their ability to produce better-designed and more useful business
systems. Pioneers have begun to realise some of these benefits and Girobank,
at least, is confident that there will be more to come.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (2): New ways to
become lean and mean - Suddenly the phrase 'business process re-engineering'
is on the lips of every computer industry pundit / Business process
re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SOUNDS innocuous, abstract even, but the term 'business processing
re-engineering' (or BPR, for short) can mean losing your job. Unless, of
course, you are a BPR consultant.
Definition of the phrase varies, but many of the people who have been
through the process seem to agree about two things. One is that they only
discover the buzzword 'BPR' only after they have been through the process,
and then recognise that business process re-engineering is a description of
what they have done.
The other definition - much more grim - is that business efficiency usually
means making people redundant. 'Lean and mean' is a phrase that echoes from
another decade, but it sums up the essence of BPR.
Business process re-engineering really means re-examining an organisation
and its operations. It is a matter of establishing what is at the core of
the business, what makes a profit, what can be sacrificed.
First, why do it? The conditions in which most businesses operate have
changed, and the rate of change seems ever faster. Product cycles are
shorter, margins are being cut, once faithful customers are offered with a
wider range of choices. Once a business is up and running, people rarely
think about how to change it because they are simply too busy running it.
Doing more of the same is easier than accepting the need for change.
So far, not a word about information technology - that is as it should be,
because the process starts with the business, not the technology. But
running a business more efficiently and with fewer resources inevitably
involves technology. For all the organisations who volunteered their stories
for this survey, getting the IT right was a large part of the equation.
The role of IT can be in the actual organisation and administration of a
company, where such tools as electronic mail, workflow systems and document
image processing can make a difference. More often, the process is an
intense self-examination which turns the spotlight outside the organisation
itself to the needs of the customer.
Several building societies are among organisations which have used BPR to
effect. They are exemplary because of the changing pressures upon their
particular market sector: competition with banks, the property recession,
fierce competition, and a foray into estate agencies which has been a
disastrous experiment for some.
For them, as for insurance and banking companies, the computer system has
become the essence of what they do. Flexibility, the need to adapt and keep
adapting, is vital.
The TSB recently carried out research which is having a fundamental effect
on it business. It discovered that customers cared very little about the
locality of branches, and were quite happy to have a wider range of services
delivered by an 'impersonal' automatic telling machine (ATM).
Pilot projects in Watford and Tyneside are already proving the point.
Another project arising from the self-examination is a centralised customer
database that will keep and relate all customer details. TSB wants contact
with the customer at one point, so that customers do not get different
communications from various sections of TSB concerning mortgage, insurance,
savings, and so on. This will save form-filling, and enable TSB to offer
services such as the single centralised 'financial health' statement.
By relating products and people, it is already able to offer a Family
Savings bonus, a unique offering according to TSB's marketing director Mike
Sommers. Keeping costs down is one of the drivers of the project - 'it's a
critical issue for all service companies to find a lower cost method of
delivering a similar or better level of customer service,' says Mr Sommers.
'In fact,we can offer a better personal relationship at a lower cost by
using technology, from its simplest applications - the telephone - right up
to the sophisticated applications of expert systems.'
Behind the message of efficiency and centralisation is another (less
explicit) saving on manpower.
At Bradford and Bingley, there has been an equal concern to respond quickly
to changing opportunities in the marketplace. Bradford and Bingley has been
through an re-engineering exercise with the help of Computer Sciences, whose
management consultancy division CSC Index claims to have evolved the
doctrine.
The chairman of CSC Index is James Champy, joint author (with MIT professor
Michael Hammer) of the book Re-engineering the Corporation. Champy is
credited with having invented the phrase 'business re-engineering,' and has
registered the term in the US.
In a very similar exercise to TSB's, the project at Bradford and Bingley has
been to provide a customer-based administration system, CBAS. The process of
re-engineering started with the identification and analysis of 220 discrete
business entities. These are brought together in a single database, with
associated marketing and business applications, which now supports the core
business of retail financial services with over 33 business processes and
390 separate functions.
Index is sensitive to the 'human resource element' of re-engineering, known
bluntly elsewhere as unemployment. Aware of the potentially disastrous
effects on staff morale, it offers a special computer-lab for modelling the
effects of the exercise on personnel, with the idea of avoiding trauma by
redeployment wherever possible.
Yet another term, 'enterprise engineering,' comes from the long-established
industry pundit, Dr James Martin, chairman of James Martin and Co.
'Business re-engineering will only deliver its promises if it radically
changes the organisation and all those who interact with it,' says Mr
Martin.
'To do this, managers need to take a holistic view of an organisation -
looking at strategy, process, technology and people - to create new ways to
add value, improve quality, and ultimately gain customer satisfaction.'
Software companies and consultancies have been quick to react by producing
appropriate tools and methodologies. One system, now in use at insurance
company Sun Alliance, is SES Workbench, a graphical tool for modelling
business processes, from Scientific Engineering Software UK in Abingdon. It
is used to model business projects and products in detail, including the
software and hardw are underlying them, and they way they behave under
different workloads.
Even more specialised, software supplier JBA, a specialist in applications
for the IBM AS400, has evolved a methodology called 'co-existent
manufacturing.' This has evolved from customer-based systems in the food and
drink industry, striving for more streamlined, same-day delivery.
According to Susan Lock, international business development manager at JBS
International, 'every layer of an organisation can really contribute to the
notion of customer service and to the needs of the market.'
One sad example of a company that has failed to attune itself to new
conditions comes from the computer business itself. The world's largest
computer manufacturer, IBM, is now faced with gross overmanning, and an
overhaul of its fundamental thinking.
Other computer manufacturers, such as Unisys, Olivetti, and Siemens-Nixdorf,
have accepted that selling 'boxes' is no longer profitable enough. They have
diversified into such areas as service and facilities management,
applications consultancy, and are even keen to be seen as independent
consultants.
In the case of Unisys, this means not only competing with the
better-established consultants such as AA (Arthur Andersen), but accepting
that it might be obliged to recommend equipment other than its own where
that is the best solution in the circumstances.
Business process re-engineering seems to be a direct descendant of
'Organisation and Management' - studies of activity and costs, done for the
health and continued development of the organisation. But it has two extra
tools hidden behind the clipboard. One is a computer - the other is an axe.

AT the dawn of the microprocessor age, Professor Edsger Dijkstra, one of the
great pioneers of computing, said that he could not understand the euphoria
about the new technology. He was especially confused by the financial
justification for its appeal. In a controversial speech to the 1977 IFIPS
meeting, Professor Dijkstra said: 'A quarter of a century ago we were told
that computers were so expensive because they were so great. Now we are told
that microcomputers are great because they are so cheap]'
This argument is still used today to persuade computer users to throw out
their big, old, expensive computers and replace them with small, new, cheap
ones. Known as 'downsizing,' it promises, once again, to produce better
information technology systems cheaper and quicker than before.
The catch is, as Professor Dijkstra suspected, that replacing a large,
central computer resource with many smaller, distributed computers is not a
simple task. Downsizing may well bring benefits in the form of better user
interfaces and exciting new applications like multimedia and workgroup
computing.
The essence of these applications, of course, is the distribution of
computer power to where it is needed to support business functions.
Downsizing has been caught up in this because of the dramatic difference in
hardware costs between mainframe and PCs. The real issue is to find the
right sized system to support the function.
Increasingly, therefore, the industry talks about 'rightsizing' as the
solution to the conflict between mainframe and PC technology. Either way it
costs money. The savings which come from using PC hardware technology can
easily be consumed by software integration, communications and training
costs. This often means that a 'downsized' system might not save as much the
low hardware costs would indicate. This is a strong argument for mainframe
users to carry on as before.
Mainframe manufacturers argue that users can gain the benefits of modern
technology by replacing their text-based terminals with PCs and keep the
mainframe as a central database server.
Indeed, this is the route that most medium to large corporations have chosen
and is a good example of 'rightsizing.' They can satisfy their users demand
for better front-end interfaces, while keeping control over their central
data resources. The front end of the system is 'downsized' but the back end
remains on the big mainframe.
There is a strong argument, however, that the mainframe's role as a central
server will also disappear to be replaced by banks of high-performance,
'super-servers' based on multiple PCs.
'The way things are going, you can see a finite life for the mainframe. PC
or 'bottom-end' computing power is increasing at a phenomenal rate,' says
Steve Crawley, product manager with PC builder AST Europe.
While he acknowledges that mainframe still possesses an important edge, Mr
Crawley sees it as only a matter of time before PC technology catches up and
overtakes current mainframe technology.
Currently the mainframe's edge comes from an important difference in design.
Mainframes have a mechanism called a channel which lets them move data
around inside the computer much more quickly than current PCs. This is
especially important in large systems like those used for flight
reservations or banking, but it applies to any business system where many
users need access to the same database.
PCs are designed differently. In place of a channel they have a 'bus' for
moving data around inside. This means that, while a PC processor may be as
powerful as a mainframe, it is not well-suited to traditional data
processing.
This can be solved by re-designing the PC, of course. But the need for
compatibility between successive generations of PC has meant that progress
towards a faster bus has been held back.
New standards for faster bus speeds promise to break down this barrier,
however. This will let the PC compete with the mainframe on equal terms.
'The need for compatibility has held back the technology in some ways. But
we are approaching a time with the new standards where this is going to
change. Intel's PCI and VL bus standard open up the potential for much
faster PCs,' says Mr Crawley.
AST, in common with other PC manufacturers, is working towards multiple
processor systems which can harness the power of several microprocessors.
Mr Crawley says that such systems make it possible to offer equivalent
performance, storage capacity and reliability as a mainframe: 'Our Manhattan
'super server' brings multiple processors together with new storage
technologies to create a viable competitor to a mainframe system,' he says.
He goes on to add that such systems can be made as reliable as a mainframe
by duplicating components and functions. The processors are relatively
cheap, so such systems can be engineered with 'redundant' components to
ensure reliability.
Mr Crawley also dismisses criticisms that the problems of co-ordinating
software in multiple processor systems: 'All sorts of people are working on
this problem with some success. Compaq and ourselves are doing a lot of
work. And so is Microsoft with its NT operating system and Novell with its
Netware product. Both of these are dripping with network management
features,' he asserts.
There is no doubt that, in the short term, the mainframe will continue to
occupy an important role in business systems. There are certain processes -
like the administration of large numerical databases - which it performs
adequately and, sometimes, well.
More important, most businesses have enormous investment in their mainframe
systems and cannot afford to replace them.
PC superservers pose a real threat, however, and over the next few years as
bus bandwidth and processor speeds both increase, they will be able to match
and overtake mainframe systems.
Ironically, the PC superserver will not look much different to what we now
call a mainframe. Perhaps, the distinction will disappear altogether and it
won't matter what they are called - as long as they are cheap.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (1): Big change in
users' expectations - New developments have made business systems easier to
use. Some tasks may have been de-skilled, but users are expected to become
ever more versatile in return
</HEADLINE>

THE COMPUTER used to be a special machine, tended by special people, in a
special place. Not any more. It is comparatively rare to come across a
business, however small, whose participants do not use computers in some
way, or cannot see the benefit of doing so.
A much-quoted estimate, attributed to the US Environmental Protection
Agency, suggests that by the year 2000, computers will account for the
consumption of nearly 10 per cent of all electricity.
For many companies, the computer has moved to the centre of the business, an
assertion that software suppliers (particularly of database and
decision-support products) are fond of making. At the core of organisations
such as banks, insurance and building societies is the information they hold
on customers. Such businesses simply cannot function without computers.
Yet despite moving to the centre of activity, computerisation has become
less centralised. Not so long ago, computers were distant, and personal
contact with them rare. A vista of terminals, glimpsed though a basement
window in the city centre was as close as most people came to computer.
Now, in every high street, ordinary people can be seen perched at their PCs.
Call into a tiny back-street insurance broker, and the assistant can bring
up a choice of policies up on a PC screen within minutes.
Anyone who uses a high-street cash dispenser interacts with a computer, but
it is increasingly likely that using the computer also forms a part of the
working day, as with the broker's clerk. For the people with whom he or she
deals by telephone, in the insurance company itself, the computer may define
the entire job.
Systems, like people, have a natural life cycle, and the advances in
technology are making it possible for systems to live longer. In the last
few years, such developments as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have made
computers easier to use. That has implications of its own. You, the user,
have to fulfil the other side of the bargain, which is that using a computer
must become just one of a battery of quotidian skills, as mundane as using
the telephone.
This 'democratisation' of computing, as it has been called, brings a new set
of pressures to both end-users and the organisations employing them. These
are very different from the traditional information technology (IT) concerns
such as speed of response and control of users. They include portability of
software and skills, the rapid falling of hardware prices, and, with the
spread of the user-base, ergonomics and health and safety.
Companies are also waking up to cost issues such as electricity consumption.
Analysts have estimated that unused systems, left on across Europe
overnight, consume the output of two power stations.
In reaction, Siemens-Nixdorf has produced the PCD-4L, 'the Green PC,' which
can switch itself off if necessary. Thoroughly environmentally friendly, it
needs a special monitor to maximise the benefit from all the power savings,
which can be as high as Pounds 50,000 for 2,000 users.
While environmental concern is a 'must' in the US, it may take 10-15 years
to percolate through to the UK, according to Jennifer Parry, industry
marketing manager for Siemens Nixdorf PC business unit - 'I don't think UK
corporate decisions take into account environmental issues as much as in
other European countries,' she says. 'Senior managers are not really aware
yet: it's a whole cultural phenomenon because computers have not - until now
 -been prolific.'
Users' expectations of systems have changed, raised by the apparent
accessibility of the PC and its ease-of-use. Boardrooms, used to spending
millions annually on preserving their computer power, are asking for more in
return. Some of the technical issues appear to be approaching resolution in
a shake-down that has affected the entire industry.
Open systems have already forced down the price of hardware. Software is
becoming more portable and easier to use with object-oriented computing, and
everything - hardware, software, systems software - has to be integrated.
'Computer shall talk unto computer, and the PC shall lie down with the
mainframe,' says an industry analyst - and this puts pressure on software
and hardware suppliers.
With margins cut and competition fierce, suppliers are looking for new
sources of revenue and dependency from user organisations. Suppliers who
were once easily tagged as hardware manufacturers, software houses or
consultancies are now scrambling for new areas of business, including
systems integration and support, and business process re-engineering.
In recognition of the new order, older mainframe systems have become known
as 'legacy' systems. Such systems are still at the heart of most large
organisations and they have a life cycle of their own. Now included in that
life are developments such as the 'disaster recovery' centre, a development
forced upon occupants of larger cities following recent terrorist attacks.
Another significant trend is towards facilities management, (FM) or
outsourcing. In some cases this can be likened to putting ancient systems
'into a home.' In FM, the legacy systems get handed over to experts, while
the user company is freed to concentrate on its core business, often
developing new, more flexible client-server systems, based on smaller,less
expensive computers.
In recent US contracts, one leading supplier, EDS, has approached IT
facilities as potential profit centres, taking a proportion of
savings/profit as its payment.
A number of hardware manufacturers have diversified. Many have entered into
'partnerships' with software suppliers. Unisys, once wholly a hardware
manufacturer, now frankly claims to be an impartial advisor to its users, in
competition with traditional consultancies.
All service providers may profit from the distributed support needed by the
heterogenous networked systems brought about by 'downsizing.' Support-costs
have not disappeared, but they have been dispersed. The responsibility for
support and control appear to be devolving too, and the user is expected to
do some of the tuning, the maintenance, and the backup that was once managed
by specialists.
In effect, we all have to become more skilled, to cope with systems that can
themselves do more. Technology is producing systems which 'de-skill'
specific tasks, but demand more diverse skills from users. Desktop
publishing (DTP) provides one good example of this: one small system in the
corner, acquired for presentations or the newsletter gradually expands its
use, but only a few in the office really understand it. Even they only use a
fraction of the software.
Another example comes from Rank Xerox's recently launched colour
photocopier, which brings astonishingly faithful colour reproduction
in-house. Its mastery actually takes some time, but before long, people will
take it for granted as they do the mono photocopier, which once needed a
one-day training course.
Anyone, anywhere, is now a potential computer user. Portable and remote
computing has become part of the daily pattern of business. The executive
who once got information from subordinates is now as likely to get daily
facts from a laptop.
For example, VAG, part of the Volkswagen group, has implemented an entire
sales information system based on Pilot's LightShip, which has re-structured
the entire business around home-working sales managers. But business process
re-engineering, as many a redundant British Telecom manager will affirm, is
often a matter of shedding middle managers and improving the workflow
between those who remain.
Around a quarter of the UK workforce, 5.5m people, now use IT in their work,
according to a recent report by West London Training Enterprise Council, The
report, IT skills in the 90s: Overcoming Obstacles to Growth, suggests that
a national shortage of IT skills in the UK is threatening economic recovery.
Although the number of IT users are expected to double in the next few
years, there is little, if any central IT strategy.
'There is no consensus on who needs what skills - and why,' says Marco Capp,
a one-time partner in the Coopers &amp; Lybrand consultancy who now advises the
IT Skills Forum set up by the West London TEC. Training cannot help until
there is some clear definition of the key skills needed, although Marco Capp
points out that new developments such as multimedia might help.
He tells a story of a leading pharmaceutical company whose ancient stock
system often got out of step with the shop floor. A rewrite of something so
fundamental was out of the question, but a concentrated training effort,
centred on a Pounds 200,000 multimedia programme, gave it a new lease of
life - 'a normal training course could cost hundreds of pounds per person,
but that cost a mere Pounds 70 per head in getting 3,000 people up to speed
in one system.'
The basic problem, he says, is that companies are frustrated - 'they feel
they are not getting a lot out what they have spent.'

FT  21 SEP 93 / Bank governor calls in clearers: Big four are told their
support is vital to the survival of recession-hit small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE, governor of the Bank of England, has privately called in
top executives of the big four clearing banks to discuss his worries that
the economic upturn could be stifled unless they do more to support small
businesses.
The governor's initiative follows complaints from businesses that banks had
been too quick to withdraw support to companies in trouble during the
recession.
The talks focused, among other issues, on whether strict head office lending
guidelines to bank branches may have choked off access to capital for
businesses with potential to emerge from the recession in a fitter state.
Better training for lending officers was also discussed.
Ideas are likely to be forwarded to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as he
prepares his November 30 Budget.
Top officials called to the bank included Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive
of National Westminster; Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive; and Mr
Bill Gordon, managing director of Barclays' banking division. A senior
manager from Lloyds has also attended.
Mr George has also had discussions with small-business lobby groups to
broaden the debate about how government can create the most favourable
economic conditions for businesses which employ fewer than 200 people.
The governor has made a personal commitment to improve the climate for small
businesses in the 1990s by helping to nurture the relationship between small
businesses and the banks.
The exercise has also included meetings with representatives of the
58,000-member Federation of Small Businesses and the 21,000-member Forum of
Private Businesses. The bank has told people involved in the talks not to
discuss them with outsiders on the grounds that publicity might damage the
success of the initiative.
One person close to the discussions said: 'Eddie has decided to get on top
of the mass of complex issues which relate to whether small businesses get
enough support from both the government and the banks. He believes the area
could be crucial to affecting the shape of the recovery.'
The big four banks are crucial to the health of the 2m or so businesses
employing fewer than 200 people - which between them account for about three
quarters of the workforce - because they act as their main sources of
finance through loans and overdrafts.
Mr George launched his initiative soon after taking over as governor on July
1, and before a separate Treasury inquiry into small business finances,
announced earlier this month but yet to get under way.
Subjects covered during the discussions have included:
Whether banks have done enough to form close contacts with managers of
specific small businesses to assess the industries in which they operate.
How the government might change tax policies to make it easier for small
companies to gain finance.
Calls by small-business lobby groups for better training for bank-lending
officers so that they have more broad experience of industry issues.
How the fortunes of small businesses are tied in with fluctuations in the UK
economy, in particular decisions over the level of the pound and interest
rates.
Possible extensions to government training schemes to give more support to
would-be entrepreneurs.
The initiative comes after two inquiries launched by Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, into whether efforts by commercial banks to increase
lending margins were preventing small businesses gaining the full benefits
of cuts in UK interest rates. Both were conducted relatively openly.
Mr George appears to have decided that by conducting his exercise privately
he may be able to take a more considered view of the issues involved.

FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Yield attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional electricity companies (Recs) presented a lively front yesterday
as Hoare Govett highlighted dividend opportunities in its weekly strategic
overview.
The house argues that the race for cyclical recovery stocks and the impact
of enhanced scrip dividends has meant that a lot of the blue-chip high
yielders have been left behind.
Hoare says the Recs, as well as the health and household stocks and some of
the prestige food manufacturers, will become sought after as income funds
scramble for stocks which offer strong dividend growth. It adds that the
inherent value in the National Grid has not been fully discounted. Among the
risers were Eastern, up 9 at 553p, Norweb, 8 better at 595p, and Midlands,
which rose 5 to 577p.
Wellcome advanced 14 to 710p, helped by a reiterated recommendation at the
morning meeting of Paribas's London arm. The house believes the group
represents the best value quality play in the sector and is best placed to
cope with changes that will result from President Clinton's health care
reforms. There was also support from an alliance announced between Wellcome
and Centocor, a cancer drug company.
An improvement in first-half profits at Morgan Crucible brought a turnround
in the fortunes of the stock. Having declined in nervous trading over the
last few sessions, the shares improved 22 to 323p, one of the day's bigger
gains.
A slim recovery for condom maker London International Group after last
week's profits warning and subsequent market savaging was restrained as
Gartmore Investment Trust announced that it had reduced its holding to 2.48
per cent from 4 per cent. Prudential raised its stake to just above 5 per
cent and LIG shares moved up 3 to 1254p.
Community Hospitals rose 9 to 206p after announcing slightly lower full-year
profits but a raised dividend.
New issue VHE, a specialist contractor in land reclamation, made an
impressive debut. Having been placed at 115p, the shares finished 4 ahead at
119p as volume reached 2.3m.
Last week's advance in Tomkins, prompted by a positive annual meeting, came
to a halt as profit-takers moved in. The stock closed 5 easier at 232p.
General Accident was squeezed 10 higher to 686p in very thin volume.
Magazine printer Hunterprint gained 4 before settling a net 2 up at 45p
after announcing that it had won the contract to print a new weekly
supplement for London's Evening Standard newspaper.
Printer De La Rue put a brave face on its first day out of the FT-SE 100
Index. Having taken the pain on Friday, the shares recovered to close 15 1/2
dearer at 668p. Meanwhile, Schroders, the merchant bank, celebrated its
first day in the index with a retreat of 9 to 1320p as a securities house
argued that the shares were overvalued.
Banks were firmer, with both Lloyds and HSBC attracting interest. Optimism
for a cut in Japanese interest rates helped sentiment.
Food manufacturing company Devro International, which came to the market
earlier this year, continued to bask in the glow of last week's favourable
interim figures. The shares gained 7 at 240p.
Northern Foods closed 3 firmer at 266p ahead of a two-day visit by analysts
to the company, beginning today.
NatWest Securities reiterated its buy recommendation on J. Sainsbury
yesterday following talks with the company. The shares rose 6 to 456p. Tesco
put on 2 at 215p awaiting today's interim figures. Analysts expect profits
to be up 7 per cent at Pounds 270m.
Grand Metropolitan softened 2 to 425p after Smith New Court trimmed its
profits forecast for the year to September 1993. It reduced its figure by
Pounds 10m to Pounds 950m to reflect 'disappointing progress in the US
spirits market'.
Speculation continued that GrandMet is to sell its Chef &amp; Brewer public
houses chain. Scottish &amp; Newcastle was mentioned by many dealers as the
possible purchaser and shares in the brewer gave up 9 to 470p.
A two-way pull was seen in Guinness, which reports interim figures on
Thursday. Having declined to 458p at one stage, the shares rallied to end a
penny ahead at 466p. Kleinwort Benson was said to be negative on the stock.
British Aerospace shares put on a robust performance as talk that the
company was in merger talks with defence electronics group GEC resurfaced.
The stock gained 11 1/2 at 416p xd, and GEC rose 4 to 343p in trade of 2.3m.
Japanese car manufacturer Honda, which has a 20 per cent stake in Rover,
BAe's car manufacturing subsidiary, yesterday denied strong weekend press
reports that it was to ask BAe to assemble cars with a Honda badge.
Aerospace and medical equipment group Smiths Industries firmed 5 to 368p
after confirming that it had won a contract to develop the electrical power
distribution centres on the F-22, the next generation fighter for the US Air
Force.
Sentiment was further boosted by a recommendation from Strauss Turnbull for
Smiths and the defence sector as a whole. Strauss's Mr Nick Cunningham said:
'Defence earnings are in the process of being rerated as defence cuts are
now at the bottom. Smiths is an example of a company that has exercised cost
controls. It anticipated and accommodated the downturn well.'
Engineering group Meggitt disappointed the market when it reported a 7.8 per
cent decline in interim profits, leading analysts to downgrade full-year
figures. The shares lost 8 to 100p. Researchers reduced full-year estimates
by about Pounds 4m, to Pounds 23m, and one warned: 'The market will continue
to be placed on a negative rating because of suspicion brought about by the
company's lack of full disclosure.'

Telecom issues held up, with BT adding 4 1/2 at 425 1/2 p as a UK analyst
pointed out the yield attractions, and Vodafone gaining 8 1/2 at 503p on US
support.
In BT, Hoare Govett's telecoms specialist noted the benefits of the
company's yield, arguing that it was attractive to income funds as it would
be paid in cash rather than as an increased scrip. Also, against the current
low interest rate climate the company offers a yield of 9.4 per cent on the
partly paid shares and 5 per cent on the fully paid. BT shares were further
helped by reports in the weekend press of a huge relocation from central
London which would lead to massive salary savings.
Meanwhile, Vodafone was recommended by New York trading house Cowen &amp; Co,
which raised its near-term rating on the group to outperform from neutral
ahead of an important presentation tomorrow. Analysts said there was a
possibility that the group could announce changes to its peak-time urban
charge to hit back at Mercury's new One-2-One service. Finally, Shaw &amp; Co,
the private client broker, recommended switching funds into Vodafone from
Cable and Wireless, which suffered initial weakness before ending a net 5 up
at 838p.

FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo up on patent ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN pharmaceuticals group Glaxo fought off the weakness of the stock
market and the effect of going ex-dividend after investors responded to news
that the company had won an important patent case in the US. The stock was
the most actively traded in London yesterday and closed 13 higher at 642p xd
after 13m share volume.
Late on Friday night, UK time, it was announced that Glaxo had won a crucial
lawsuit against Novopharm, of Canada, over US patents for Zantac, the
world's best-selling medicine which, in the last financial year, generated
sales of Pounds 2.17bn, equivalent to 44 per cent of group turnover.
The legal victory increases Glaxo's chances of winning a second patent case
against Genpharm, a Canadian generics company smaller than Novopharm, which
is scheduled to challenge Glaxo's patents next May.
Shares were marked sharply higher before dealing began in London yesterday,
and at one stage the stock was more than 40p up. However, arbitraging
between the UK shares and the American Depositary Receipts traded in New
York whittled away some of London's gain.

FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Steady opening to the new account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK EQUITIES rallied well from a poor start in a thinly traded session
yesterday, but weak trading volumes gave little cause for celebration as the
FT-SE 100 Index struggled to hold on to the 3,000 mark on the first day of
the new trading account. Technical factors, including the effects of
ex-dividend adjustments to a large number of blue chip share prices, worth
the equivalent of about 10 points on the Footsie, played a role in erratic
movements in both the Footsie and the December contract on the index which
took over the lead on the stock index futures sector yesterday.
Uncertainty in government bond prices ahead of the announcement today of
details of an impending auction of gilt-edged securities was no help to
share prices, which have benefited strongly from falling yields in the bond
market. The August M4 money supply data for the UK, showing slightly less
annualised growth than predicted, had little effect on stock prices.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed only a point down at 3,004.5, but had slipped to
2,987.5 early in the session as an initial burst of selling of stock index
futures helped to upset a stock market already struggling with ex-dividend
adjustments to share prices taking an estimated 10.3 off the Footsie.
Index compilation was additionally complicated by activity in Glaxo after
news, too late for the UK stock market on Friday night, of its legal victory
over US patents for Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug responsible for nearly half
the group's annual turnover.
Equity prices rallied at midsession together with the December future on the
Footsie, but trading volume, never on any great scale, died away as London
waited to see if Wall Street would extend Friday's losses. In the event, New
York made a somewhat uneventful start to the new session and the UK stock
market managed an unconvincing rally. Nervousness in London over prospects
for equities in New York has become a depressing factor for share prices.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, at 3,423,6, closed 2.1 down, following the blue
chip market to end above the day's low. Non-Footsie business made up around
59 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 443.3m shares.
On Friday, with share turnover boosted by the close of the equity trading
account, Seaq volume was worth Pounds 1.68bn in genuine customer business, a
return to the best daily levels recorded over the past year.
Waning hopes for a cut in UK base rates following disappointing news last
week on domestic inflation left the store and retail sector lacking
strength. But banks and utilities, both traditionally beneficiaries from
interest rate optimism, were firmer towards the end of the session.
Predictions of a rate reduction to record lows today by the Bank of Japan
appeared to help sentiment in London. But among the blue chips, the
pharmaceuticals continued to show uncertainty, while oil issues remained
depressed by bearish views on world crude prices.
Investment opinions appeared to have moved towards caution over the weekend
as UK analysts surveyed the progress of the company reporting season and the
interest rate outlook. Mr Robin Aspinall of Panmure Gordon summed up the
less confident view by urging that this 'is the time to sell UK equities'.

FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets had an erratic session in London as traders dealt on the
back of an equally uncertain stock market, writes Terry Byland.
Trading in the futures was divided between the locals, or independent
traders, and the big trading houses, as they came to grips with the first
full day led by the December dated contract on the FT-SE 100 Index; volume
was on the low side at 7,404 contracts.
Trading at its Fair Value premium of around 24 points, the December contract
moved between an early low of 3,006 and the day's high of 3,34 before
closing at 3025, an effective one point premium to the cash market. Traders
professed themselves satisfied with the first day of trading in the December
contract but agreed that the next three months could prove very difficult.
Only one London trading house managed to arbitrage between cash and futures
yesterday. For the rest of the UK based houses, it was a trading day rather
than a day of excitements.
Volume in traded options fell sharply to 19,504 contracts from Friday's
36,413. The FT-SE Index traded 7,803 against 16,548. Glaxo headed the list
of individual stock contracts, trading 1,733 contracts as the underlying
stock market resoponded to the group's legal victory in the US. The Euro
FT-SE contract also attracted buyers, recording business of 12,442
contracts.

FT  21 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drops as oil prices rise
and bonds fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
HIGHER crude oil prices and a falling bond market undermined sentiment in US
equities yesterday, leaving blue chip stocks sharply lower, with declines
exacerbated by a late rush of computerised sell programs, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 37.45 off at 3,575.80. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 shed 3.78 to 455.05. Only the Nasdaq composite, which was sold
heavily last week, bucked the trend, closing 0.10 up at 740.21. New York SE
volume amounted to 231m shares.
After last Friday's session, when a frenzy of trading related to the
'triple-witching' expiry of futures and options contracts sent volume
soaring and prices plummeting, investors were glad to return to more normal
trading patterns yesterday morning.
Although prices eased at the opening in what may have been a hangover from
Friday, there was little selling pressure and, within a few minutes, the Dow
had clawed back most of its initial loss. Analysts said the lack of activity
was partly a reflection of investors' caution ahead of several important
events due later this week, including the meeting of the Federal Reserve's
policy-making Open Market Committee and the official unveiling of President
Clinton's healthcare reform package.
It was not until mid-afternoon that prices turned decisively lower as rising
oil prices and a sharp sell-off in the bond market prompted heavy selling of
stocks, much of it in the form of programs.
Paramount Communications climbed a further Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 69 5/8
in volume of 3.47m shares as speculation mounted that a rival bid to
Viacom's Dollars 8.2bn offer for the entertainment group may soon emerge.
Over the weekend, there were reports claiming that Turner Broadcasting and
QVC, the home-shopping network, were considering bidding for Paramount,
possibly in a joint deal, while rumours also suggested that Blockbuster
Entertainment or the German media group Berteslmann might enter the fray.
QVC shares were hit hardest by the speculation, falling Dollars 3 1/2 to
Dollars 56.
Nike dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 46, a 52-week low, in heavy trading after
the sports shoemaker announced a fall in fiscal first-quarter earnings and
warned that because of the sluggish US and international economies it did
not expect full-year 1994 earnings to match the record results of 1993.
National Health Laboratories lost Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 15 1/8 in volume
of 3.7m shares after the company admitted that it had received a subpoena
from the government, which is again investigating its billing practices.
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 45 1/2 after brokerage
house Smith Barney Shearson upgraded its rating on the stock from 'neutral'
to 'buy'.
On the Nasdaq market, Centocor rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 10 1/4 in busy
trading as investors reacted to news that the company is forming an oncology
alliance with UK group Wellcome to market anti-cancer agents.
Canada
TORONTO closed lower in moderate trade, dragged down by steep declines in
transportation and mining stocks. The TSE 300 index shed 25.5 to 3,952.8.
Falls led rises by 435 to 285 after 52.4m share volume.

FT  21 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei in fourth
consecutive decline on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING ahead of the September book closing overwhelmed expectations
of an imminent cut in the official discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell for the fourth consecutive day, losing 125.01 to
20,266.03. The index was supported by public fund buying but faced
profit-taking from financial institutions and fluctuated between 20,211.52
and 20,407.54.
Volume came to 220m shares, against 293m, remaining below 300m for the third
trading day in a row. Declines led advances by 696 to 288, with 186 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 12.44 to
1,638.90 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.00 to 1,253.19.
Speculation that the Bank of Japan would lower interest rates today failed
to stimulate demand; a cut of 50 basis points had been discounted into share
prices by the end of last week.
Institutions, looking to realise profits ahead of the end of September, are
expected to remain leading sellers for the remainder of this week. Foreign
investors were also seen liquidating arbitrage-linked positions.
Stocks which were bought on margin during the rally in April were sold as
some individuals faced margin calls. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell
Y19,000 to Y867,000, posting its fifth consecutive decline.
Other issues related to telecom infrastructure investments were also lower,
with cable and wiremakers prominent. Fujikura weakened Y16 to Y876 and
Mitsubishi Cable Industries Y15 to Y835.
Steels and shipbuilders were also hit by profit-taking: Nippon Steel lost Y1
to Y330, Kawasaki Steel Y3 to Y323 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y9 to
Y676.
Meanwhile, biotechnology issues were higher ahead of a spate of medical and
academic meetings. Takeda Chemical rose Y30 to Y1,330 and Yamanouchi
Pharmaceutical gained Y10 at Y2,450.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 116.04 to 22,383.49 in volume of 46.3m
shares.
Roundup
WITH South Korea as a speculative exception, gentle declines seemed to be
the order of the day around a relatively subdued Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG lost ground but recovered from a fall of 100 points seen in early
trading. The Hang Seng index was finally 27.51 off at 7,390.60 in turnover
of HKDollars 3bn. The market was closed on Friday because of a severe
tropical storm.
Hang Seng Bank fell HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 51.50 while Hutchison shed 20
cents to HKDollars 22.90 in active trading. Allied Group made a strong
recovery to HKDollars 1.02, up 6 cents, following the release on Saturday of
the results of a 13-month investigation into alleged corporate fraud. Allied
Properties improved 3 cents to HKDollars 1.32.
SINGAPORE closed lower on profit-taking, although brokers said they expected
prices to stay mixed in the near term, supported by the prospect of enhanced
market liquidity.
The Straits Times Industrial index receded 10.01 to 1,998.37. Volume
totalled 367.4m shares, down from 457.3m.
SEOUL finished higher on expectations of a government announcement
cushioning the side-effects of last month's ban on false-name financial
trading. The composite index added 9.18 at 695.12 in turnover of Won280.9bn,
against Won134.2bn registered in Saturday's half-day trade.
Ssangyong Motor and Poongsan ended the day's limit up, both gaining Won600
at Won14,900 and Won15,200 respectively.
TAIWAN was lower on profit-taking after two days of gains, following the
central bank's easing of credit limits last week. The weighted index slipped
a net 25.59 to 3,927.81, after an intraday high of 3,971. Turnover was
TDollars 19.3bn.
Construction shares were relatively strong, with Ever Fortune limit up at
TDollars 67.50.
AUSTRALIA was easier in quiet trading, with BHP shedding 20 cents to
ADollars 15.76 following last Friday's first-quarter results. The All
Ordinaries index lost 1.4 to 1,924.1.
BANGKOK's SET index pierced the 1,000 level on buying of second-liners and
new issues in the morning, but profit-taking pared the gains and the index
finished 1.21 down on the day at 997.01.
Analysts talked of a period of consolidation before a further sustained
climb; investors were worried because Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai had still
not announced his new cabinet line-up after dropping the Social Action party
from the ruling coalition last week.
NEW ZEALAND was easier but off the day's lows in thin erratic trade. The
NZSE-40 capital index lost 7.30 at 1,937.93.
MANILA ended lower, with a retreat by PLDT on Wall Street triggering a
long-awaited consolidation that broke last Friday's strong rally. The
composite index receded 28.4, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,967.97.
PLDT shed 15 pesos to 1,360 pesos after a Dollars 1 fall to Dollars 48 3/8
on Wall Street.

FT  21 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: World Index remains on a downtrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the five days to last Friday, the FT-Actuaries World Index registered
precisely the same decline - 0.91 per cent - as it did in the week before.
The way it got there changed marginally, with the US going into decline
after a miniscule rise in the week before.
Japan had an eventful time. Tokyo's Nikkei average opened the week with a
1.6 per cent gain and a new 1993 high on hopes of a discount rate cut and
additional fiscal measures to support the economy. But then the market had
second thoughts, and ran into pessimism in the back half of the week about
the effects of the new government's economic package.
'Not only did the government's fiscal package fail to live up to
expectations, depressing the outlook for the domestic economy,' said James
Capel, the London stockbrokers, 'but the second quarter GNP data revealed
the extent to which exporters are suffering from the massive overvaluation
of the yen and weakness in key export markets.'
Nomura's global strategy team, headed by Mr Nicholas Knight, agreed with
Capel on the Tokyo package and said that Japan and continental Europe were
the most vulnerable equity markets.
The remarkable performance in Europe was the gain in Germany, all of it last
Friday as Daimler showed that getting a US quote had its disadvantages - to
wit, the lifting of the corporate curtain which German companies, by the
release of previous years' provisions, can draw over a bad year's losses.
Mr James Cornish, a strategist at NatWest Securities, said that analysts
were beginning to take the view that most of the bad news about Germany had
appeared already. Additionally, he said, there was a view that west German
inflation and M3 figures, due this week, will allow the Bundesbank to make a
more acceptable reduction in repo rates.

FT  21 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Traders take initiative as
Frankfurt rises 1.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff

<TEXT>
THERE WAS some talk that a firm dollar early in the day gave bourses a good
start, but most centres had their own story to tell, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT extended Friday's rally, the DAX index rising 30.85, or 1.6 per
cent, to 1,912.84 on the session and by another 10 points in the post
bourse.
Following the relaxed line taken last week by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
retiring Bundesbank president, there were hopes of lower repo rates this
week after the upcoming M3 and inflation indications. However, Mr Jens
Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that this was a traders' market.
'Investor interest was rather weak,' he said.
Turnover fell from DM12.5bn to DM7.8bn. Daimler, which disclosed big losses
last Friday, once again led the rally, putting on DM24.50 to DM746 in the
official session and climbing further in the London afternoon. Having been
told that the September quarter is going to be no better for Daimler,
traders were saying that all the bad news was now in the price - which has
risen from DM610 in the past three months.
PARIS closed moderately higher, erasing midsession losses. The CAC-40 index
ended up 7.86 at 2,107.36 in turnover of some FFr2.9bn.
With the publication yesterday of the preliminary prospectus for the
privatisation of BNP, the bank's investment certificates shed FFr18 to
FFr544. The government has said that the privatisation process will be
completed by December 20 at the latest.
Michelin lost FFr2.2 to FFr177.3 ahead of today's interim results. The
consensus is that the tyre manufacturer will release a substantial first
half loss. Mr Christopher de Mattos at Hoare Govett said: 'excluding
restructuring provisions we are forecasting a loss of FFr600m for the
period. The size of restructuring provisions is far from clear, but the
company is laying off at least 10,000 workers over the 1993 and 1994
financial years, possibly leading to provisions of FFr2bn to FFr3bn this
year. In spite of this poor short term outlook, we remain positive on the
share for the longer term'.
Elsewhere in the automotive sector Valeo rose FFr29 to FFr1,056, but off the
day's high of FFr1,080, believed to have been the result of a buy
recommendation.
AMSTERDAM was driven mainly by options trading which lifted the CBS Tendency
index by 1.4 to 125.4.
With the major companies now having released interim results the main news
this week will come from the release of the budget, expected today. 'With a
general election scheduled for May 1994,' said UBS in London, 'the
government is more likely to accept some modest overshooting of budget
targets, rather than proposing more spending cuts'.
ZURICH took advantage of a firm local currency to advance 1.4 per cent, with
banks and insurance in the van. The SMI index rose 33.2 to 2,418.4, Zurich
Insurance adding SFr26 to SFr1,202 in continued response to last Friday's
half-year figures and UBS, in strong demand, rising SFr22 to SFr1,180.
Georg Fischer, the engineering group, fell 2.9 per cent in immediate
response to its forecast of a worse than expected loss of up to SFr50m for
the full year. However, the shares ended just SFr11 easier at SFr885 after
the group said it expected to break even in 1994.
Bearer shares in SMH, the watchmaker, which were under pressure last week,
picked up to finish SFr40 higher at SFr1,085. Jelmoli, the retail group,
surged SFr60 or 8.2 per cent to SFr790. Hoare Govett, which has recommended
the share, has forecast doubled earnings in 1994.
MADRID rose on both technical and fundamental grounds, said FG, the brokers,
derivatives traders buying baskets of equities as they sold futures at a
premium, and banks gaining as the Bank of Spain lowered their reserve
requirements.
The general index closed 3.85 higher at 288.85 in turnover estimated at
Pta17.8bn. Bankinter and BBV led the banking sector with gains of Pta350 to
Pta10,500, and Pta80 to Pta3,500 respectively.
MILAN edged lower, the Comit index losing 5.30 at 590.85. Insurers were an
exception following the start of Allebanza's rights issue last Thursday.
Allianza rose L364 to L16,996, while Generali added L280 to L39,800.
Ferruzzi remained volatile, opening limit down before bouncing back to close
L26.50 higher at L291.50 in highly speculative trade as investors decided
that the 10 per cent declines seen in each of the six previous trading
sessions had been overdone.
BRUSSELS fell back, with the Bel-20 index dropping below the 1,300 level for
the first time since early July. The index ended off 10.82 at 1,290.84 in
turnover of BFr1.25bn on the last day of the account.
ISTANBUL lost 2.4 per cent on profit-taking after an early rally had carried
the market to an all-time high at midsession. The composite index closed
down 333.3 at 14,126.5 in turnover of TL1,600bn.
WARSAW plunged after a strong showing by left-wing parties in Sunday's
elections, the WIG index falling 443, or 6.3 per cent to 6,611.7.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Money Markets: European futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN interest rate futures markets yesterday lost some of the enthusiasm
for monetary policy easing that they had displayed at the end of last week,
with prices falling across the board in Europe, writes James Blitz.
There were no official interest rate moves yesterday, and the Bank of France
failed to ease either its five to 10-day lending rate or its intervention
rate in its regular Thursday operation.
Moreover, there appeared to be some uncertainty about what the Bundesbank
would do in its regular money market operations this week.
At the end of last week, there had been some thought that the Bundesbank
could return to a variable rate repo in its money market oper-ations. But a
London-based dealer said the market appeared to be getting back to the view
that the repo could be fixed today at 6.70 per cent.
There have also been some fairly wild guesses about the German M3 money
supply figure, due this week. Some forecasters were talking about 5.5 per
cent at the end of last week. But more conservative estimates, around the
7.5 per cent mark, were gaining ground yesterday.
Euromark futures therefore lost ground yesterday. The December contract
finished at 93.98, down 2 basis points on the day. The March contract
declined 4 basis points to 94.46. In the French market, the December Pibor
contract closed 2 basis points off at 93.76.
In UK markets, dealers continued to be swayed by last week's figures for the
retail prices index which showed a larger than expected rise in the
inflation figure in the year to August.
The December short sterling contract fell back 6 basis points on the day to
close at 94.27.
In the sterling cash market, the overnight rate of lending rose as high as 7
1/2 per cent, amid difficulties removing a shortage that was forecast at the
start of the day at Pounds 900m.
The Bank of England invited offers to tender for funds in an early round of
trading. But it was not until the afternoon that some Pounds 355m worth of
bills were offered. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 670m, which
may contribute to a higher shortage today. Three-month money ended a little
higher at 5 31/32 per cent, with a spread of 5 15/16 per cent on the bid
side and 5 7/8 per cent on the offered.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen weakens on agency report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN enjoyed a modest advance against the dollar at the start of European
trading yesterday, but later fell back on reports that the Bank of Japan
would cut its discount rate today by 75 basis points, writes James Blitz.
The Japanese currency has appreciated against the dollar in recent days amid
suspicions that the US administration has been disappointed by the Japanese
fiscal stimulus announced last week.
Although the headline figure for the package of more than 6 trillion yen was
a little larger than had been expected, dealers have been concerned by the
lack of tax-cutting measures in the proposals. That sentiment would partly
explain why the yen appreciated against the dollar at the start of European
trading yesterday, rising from an opening of Y104.50 to a high of Y103.80.
Today's move on the official discount rate (ODR) will be critical for
determining the near-term course of the dollar/yen exchange rate.
A cut in the ODR by 50 basis points, to 2 per cent, has been fully priced in
by the market, and is unlikely to have much impact on the yen.
But Japanese news agency Jiji press excited dealers in currency and fixed
interest markets yesterday by saying that the ODR could be reduced by 75
basis points at today's meeting of the Bank of Japan, to a post-war low of
1.75 per cent. The press report triggered an immediate rise in the value of
the dollar, which closed at Y104.25. It finished in New York at Y104.65.
'A 75 basis-point cut could be the thing that stops the US criticising the
economic package at this week's meetings with the Japanese,' said Mr Mike
Gallagher of IDEA, the financial market consultants. 'Anything less would
force the US to make it clear that the overall package has been
insufficient.'
The dollar was a little firmer against the D-Mark. Some dealers sold the
German currency in the wake of the local election results in Hamburg, which
saw all three of Germany's main political parties suffering heavy losses.
The D-Mark may also have come under pressure from expectations that the
latest figure for German M3 money supply growth, due this week, will be a
great deal lower than expected.
At the end of last week, there were strong expectations that the figure
could fall into the Bundesbank's target range for annualised M3, of 4.5 to
6.5 per cent.
Those expectations have faded a little. But some dealers were still
wondering yesterday whether the Bundesbank would introduce a variable rate
repo in this week's money market operations for the first time since the
latest crisis in the exchange rate mechanism.
The dollar peaked at DM1.6215 from a previous DM1.6095. It later fell back
on fears that central banks would sell dollars for D-Marks and closed at
DM1.6125. Sterling held at DM2.4700. In New York the dollar ended at
DM1.6100.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MG sees big future as
integrated copper producer - Metallgesellschaft's plans to rejoin the ranks
of the world's metal-producing giants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft of Germany is about to take a big leap towards its goal
of becoming an integrated, global copper producer. By 1998 it should be
producing about 800,000 tonnes of the metal from mines and smelters on three
continents. That represents about 9 per cent of present western world annual
output.
This is the message Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch has been sending to the rest of
the metals industry. As chairman of MG's executive board he set the strategy
in motion. It will not be long, he says, before MG will be back among the
world's metal-producing giants. Yet only eight years ago its presence in the
business had shrunk to the point where it was producing mainly zinc and only
in Germany.
MG has chosen to expand mainly in copper because, Mr Schimmelbusch suggests,
there should be no shortage of demand as developing countries in Asia, South
America and eastern Europe put electric lighting into homes and make
improvements to their infrastructure and communications facilities.
But copper companies need their own smelting operations, he says. Shortages
of smelting capacity will continue even though a good proportion of new
copper mines will produce the metal by solvent extraction-electrowinning
technology, which does away with the need for smelting.
The present world recession has only temporarily eased the copper smelting
'bottleneck', he insists, and many of the smelters in the Commonwealth of
Independent States, which also helped the easing process, will soon shut
permanently when the mines that supply them run out of ore.
In these circumstances, any banker asked to put money into a copper mine
first wants to know what arrangements are being made to treat the
concentrate, the intermediate material which goes to the smelters. The banks
are comforted if the mining company has its own smelting capacity, Mr
Schimmelbusch points out.
MG reconsidered its corporate strategy in 1985 and decided to stay in mining
and metals production but to build those operations into a global business.
The first overt indication of this new approach came two years later when MG
put its remaining foreign mining interests into a new company, Metall Mining
(MM), based in Toronto, which was quickly floated on the local stock
exchange. 'It was not really a company, ' recalls Mr Schimmelbusch, who is
also chairman of MM. 'It just had a few assets and a plan. We were selling a
concept.'
MM moved into copper production early in 1989 when it paid about Dollars 85m
for the Copper Range mining company in White Pine, Michigan, which had an
underground mine, smelter and an up-to-date refinery.
More recently MM opportunistically snapped up Minnova, a Canadian mining
company, in two bites totalling about USDollars 200m. Minnova's juiciest
asset is the Izok Lake project, which has a geological ore reserve of 13.6m
tonnes with an average of 14.6 per cent zinc and 2.5 per cent copper. The
big drawback is that Izok Lake is in the far north of Canada, 300km north of
Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories.
Now MG is proposing that MM should buy its European copper smelting and
refining operations, the most important of which is 35 per cent of
Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg, one of Europe's largest, operated by MG
and described by Mr Schimmelbusch as the most efficient and cleanest in the
world. There is also 40 per cent of the Brixlegg secondary (scrap) copper
smelter in Austria.
If this deal goes through - it is being carefully vetted by UK merchant bank
NM Rothschild on MM's behalf - all MG's copper eggs will be in one basket.
Mr Schimmelbusch says the decision to switch the European assets to MM was
linked with events at the Copper Range mine. MM has been struggling hard to
bring down production costs there - the cash costs were reduced last year
from 94 US cents a lb in 1991 to 82 cents. It also needs to spend about
Dollars 6.5m to bring Copper Range's smelter into compliance with new US air
quality standards.
This stimulated some innovative thinking that resulted in a scheme to leach
copper out of the pillars left behind to hold up the roof during underground
mining. MM reckons there are 200m tonnes of ore containing 4bn lb of copper
in the pillars and this summer it was finally concluded that the metal could
be removed by in situ leaching at very low cost. Various permits have still
to be obtained but leach production might start at 40m to 50m lb a year and
rise to 90m lb eventually, which would dramatically reduce Copper Range's
average production costs.
Leaching consumes large quantities of sulphuric acid, a by-product of copper
smelting. The quantities of acid needed would make it worthwhile to enlarge
the present smelter at Copper Range or build a new one - the preferred
choice, because it would be more efficient and less-polluting. However, it
would also necessitate an expansion of the refinery.
Nevertheless, the case for a new larger, cleaner smelter at Copper Range is
a strong one, particularly as there are already permits for the site.
Norddeutsche in Germany would be able to supply essential operating know-how
if it was part of the MM 'family' - it would not want to pass on the
information to a rival, however.
A formal link between MM and Norddeutsche would also benefit the Hamburg
refinery by providing another source of concentrates and an outlet for the
sulphuric acid it generates. Finding customers for sulphuric acid is
becoming one of the smelting industry's biggest headaches.
Last year MM's copper production, from Copper Range and its minority
investments in other companies, was about 109,000 tonnes. In order to reach
the 800,000 level quickly it will need more mine capacity. Mr Schimmelbusch
says MM does indeed plan to buy a large copper mining project.
He gives no clue as to the location, however, and is equally evasive about
another important topic - whether MG's 55 per cent share of a proposed
copper smelter in Indonesia will also go to MM - as would seem logical.
Mr Schimmelbusch is convinced a go-ahead will soon be given for the
Indonesian smelter, in which Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold, owner of the
huge Ertsberg/Grasberg mine in the highlands of Irian Jaya, would have a 20
per cent shareholding. He is also convinced that MG would not have won
permission for the smelter without being able to show what had been achieved
at Norddeutsche in Germany. 'Developing countries don't want to compromise,
they want the best technology available.'
What will be the cost of all this - new smelter, enlarged refinery, new mine
and purchase of the European assets - to MM? Mr Schimmelbusch will give no
hint. However, Mr Michael Brown, analyst at Toronto stockbroker McLean
McCarthy, part of the Deutsche Bank group, says the total could range
between CDollars 1.1bn and CDollars 1.3bn. MM might have to find CDollars
600m of new equity towards this.
But MM is well-financed and in a position to finance its expansion, says Mr
Brown, particularly if it is willing to sell its 14 per cent stake in MIM,
the Australian resources group, which has a present market value of about
CDollars 385m.
He also suggests that the issue of MM shares to MG might take the German
group's stake from the present 60 per cent to 69 per cent and that MG might
sell down some of that holding.
But MG will want to keep control, as Mr Schimmelbusch makes clear. He says:
'Metall Mining will continue to be one of our core businesses.'

FT  21 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Output cuts seen as nickel
price hits crunch point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NICKEL PRICES have dropped below Dollars 2 a lb for the first time in six
years and traders suggest it will not be long before producers make more
cuts in output.
Further selling yesterday drove the three-month nickel price down another
Dollars 81.50 on the London Metal Exchange where the price closed at Dollars
4,265 a tonne or Dollars 1.94 a lb.
LME stocks are at a record 112,000 tonnes and equivalent to about 18 weeks
of consumption, compared with the seven weeks which is the maximum level for
comfort. Much of the metal originated in the Commonwealth of Independent
States, from where exports increased sharply after a slump in domestic
demand and an urgent need for hard currency since the collapse of the former
Soviet Union.
According to Mr Jim Lennon, analyst at the Commodities Research Unit
consultancy group, the nickel industry is going through a structural change
associated with the CIS imports, which totalled an estimated 160,000 to
170,000 tonnes last year in a western market that consumed 620,000 tonnes.
He said CIS producers had cut output by about 20 per cent in 1993 so exports
were likely to drop to 130,000 tonnes. At present western producers planned
to cut back by 10,000 to 15,000 but this would still leave a supply surplus.
Mr Lennon suggested big western producers such as Inco and Falconbridge in
Canada were reluctant to cut output because they had pared costs to the bone
by stopping maintenance and investment to get cash operating costs below
Dollars 2 a lb. The strength of the US dollar against the Canadian and
Australian dollars had also helped the producers.
If they cut production they would lose cash flow, market share (because they
have very low stocks) and unit costs would go up again. Also, some producers
had signed contracts to collect prices above Dollars 3 a lb and some smaller
producers had hedged most of their 1993 production. The obvious candidates
for cuts were the high-cost ferro-nickel producers in Japan (50,000 tonnes a
year collectively) and Larco in Greece (16,000 tonnes).

FT  21 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UNCTAD says third world should
look to the futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRATEGY to promote commodity futures trading by developing countries to
hedge against price fluctuations is being elaborated by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development.
The aim is to maximise the use of commodity exchanges by buyers and sellers
in third world nations to manage risk.
According to Unctad, developing country governments and companies are
generally unfamiliar with the real advantages and disadvantages of risk
management and with ways of limiting abuse. Moreover, commodity exporters in
developing countries often do not have the necessary expertise or internal
accounting and monitoring systems to operate effectively in commodity
futures markets.
An expert group that met in Geneva last week has come up with a series of
proposals for tackling these and other obstacles.
They include easier access to credit for users of risk management
instruments, help for companies to develop suitable internal control systems
and measures to minimise the impact of exchange controls on the legitimate
use of commodity futures markets.
This interest in commodity exchanges is something of a departure for Unctad,
which in the past has been the principal sponsor of price-stabilising
commodity pacts. However, over the past few years virtually all these
accords have collapsed or abandoned market-intervention mechanisms in the
wake of steadily sliding prices.
Meanwhile, the pattern of commodities trading has been changing. The group
of experts notes that liberalisation and privatisation in developing and
former communist countries has increased the role of trading houses,
especially for hedging soft commodities.
Hedging against price changes on commodity futures markets cannot influence
long-term trends but can help protect commodity-dependent developing
countries from unexpected price fluctuations.
Among the specific recommendations of the experts, which they want Unctad to
take up, are:
Action by commodity exchanges and their members to encourage the involvement
of buyers and sellers in developing countries;
Government help to develop local warehouses that can issue warehouse
receipts and so provide security for credit lines to finance margin calls on
domestic exchanges;
Other government action to improve the supply of credit for risk management,
such as creating suitable institutions or liberalising access to foreign
exchange;
Direct assistance for companies to develop proper internal control systems,
in co-operation with commodity exchanges;
Guidelines to minimise the impact of capital controls on the ability of
domestic state and private companies to participate in overseas risk
management markets.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technical trading pushes cocoa
still higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON COCOA prices yesterday built on last week's strong rise, as buyers
pushed the December futures contract to a peak of Pounds 922 a tonne.
The spur came from last week's push through the psychological barrier of
Pounds 900 and the market yesterday was dominated by investment fund buying
and technical trading, with no fresh news and cross trades accounting for
more than 7,000 lots out of a total of just over 16,000. The second position
eased back on profit-taking to close at Pounds 917, still up Pounds 14 on
the day.
The market's recent sharp rise to levels last seen in the summer of 1990
began in mid-August, fuelled by expectations that the next harvest, which
starts in October, will bring a shortfall in world supply compared with
demand for the third year running.
The rally is attracting buying from financial institutions not usually
interested in commodities, according to traders. With interest rates low and
profits from traditional areas of activity being squeezed, more fund
managers are turning to commodities that still appear relatively cheap, they
say.
The weekend agreement by producers and consumers on an orderly disposal of
the International Cocoa Organisation's 230,000-tonne buffer stock has also
removed a source of uncertainty hanging over the market, analysts said.
The meeting, which ended late on Saturday, agreed the stock would be
released on to the market over a maximum of four and a half years, starting
in 1993-94. The disposal will take place at a rate of 51,000 tonnes a year,
in equal monthly instalments, unless the ICCO council revises that amount at
the end of the first year.
The buffer stock was built up under the 1980 and 1986 International Cocoa
Agreements as a way to stabilise the market. But its future has been unclear
since it was frozen after market support operations collapsed in 1988.
The gradual rundown of the stock will enable producer countries in arrears
to pay off their debts.
The start of the new cocoa pact, due at the end of this month when the 1986
agreement expires, has meanwhile been postponed until the end of February
because most countries have not yet passed legislation enabling them to sign
and ratify it, said an ICCO official.
'We still hope to bring the new agreement into force before that, if we get
sufficient signatures,' she said.
The last agreement covered 18 producing and 22 consuming countries. The new
pact must have membership of at least five exporting countries, representing
80 per cent of exports, and consuming countries accounting for 60 per cent
of imports.
So far only the Ivory Coast, which produces just under 35 per cent of the
world's cocoa, and Ecuador, producing 4.5 per cent, have signed.

'London Metal Exchange COPPER trading was less active than on Friday, with
the market looking to settle into a new range following the sudden ending of
the technical squeeze on supplies that had been propping up nearby values.
Prices ended slightly lower. The newly-established cash/three months
contango (forward premium) was also fairly stable, fluctuating between
Dollars 11 and Dollars 13 a tonne.  The ZINC market built on last week's
trade-influenced rally and broke above the Dollars 900-a-tonne level for
three months delivery.  Commission house selling and profit-taking was
generally absorbed, and final business was at Dollars 905 a tonne, up
Dollars 12. ALUMINIUM prices fell back in late trading after running into
selling as the three months position approached Dollars 1,140 a tonne. The
price closed at Dollars 1,129.50, down Dollars 8.50 from Friday. At the
London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE prices bowed to pressure from the
US in the afternoon, with the November contract dropping back to Dollars
1,275 at the close, down 19 on the day. Earlier it had peaked at Dollars
1,306 a tonne, at which point at least one trader thought the market was 'a
little overbought'.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Portugal finds firm demand for Dollars
1bn global offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Portugal launched its widely-expected Dollars 1bn offering
of 10-year global bonds to strong demand yesterday, kicking off what is
likely to be an active week in the international bond market.
The market expects the Japanese Development Bank to raise between Pounds
150m and Pounds 200m today through an issue of seven-year Eurobonds. J. P.
Morgan and S. G. Warburg are thought to be arranging the much-rumoured deal,
which represents JDB's first foray in the Eurosterling sector since 1988.
JDB's issue is expected to be priced to yield 18-20 basis points above the
yield on the underlying UK government bonds. The borrower is believed to
want to swap the proceeds into fixed-rate yen.
The Republic of Argentina is expected to tap the D-Mark sector later this
week to raise between DM750m and DM1bn through an issue of five-year
Eurobonds.
Meanwhile, Corporacion Andina De Fomento, the Latin American supranational
agency which finances trade and infrastructure, has had a positive response
from investors for its planned Dollars 100m five-year Eurobond offering. The
issue should launched by the end of the week.
Portugal's perception among investors as a rapidly-improving credit enabled
it to achieve a yield spread for its global bonds of 45 basis points over
the 5 3/4 per cent US Treasury due August 2003.
Joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said this represented the lowest coupon a
sovereign borrower has ever paid for 10-year dollar-denominated paper.
At launch, Portugal's bonds yielded around 18 basis points less than Italy's
recent issue of dollar global bonds, and some syndicate managers believed
that the yield spread between the two issues could narrow in Italy's favour
over time.
However, Merrill Lynch pointed out that Portugal's bonds were also yielding
less than comparable bonds issued by Sweden and Ireland. This indicated that
investors were also willing to pay a premium for Portugal's rarity value.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was unchanged. One-third of
the bonds were placed in North America, 10 per cent in Japan, 20 per cent in
the rest of the Far East and the remaining 40 per cent in Europe.
Yesterday's global bond issue is the third and final leg of Portugal's drive
to re-establish a presence in the international bond market after a
five-year absence. Earlier this year, Portugal tapped the D-Mark and yen
sectors of the Euromarket.
Commenting on the bond issue, Mr Jose Braz, Portugal's secretary of state
for the treasury said, 'This loan affirms our return to the market after
several years and helps to publicise the new reality of Portugal where
growth is higher than in the rest of the European Community and where we are
not troubled by problems of unemployment.'
Mr Braz added it was the first time Portugal had made a fixed-rate, re-offer
bond placement, which he saw as giving the loan the greatest transparency.
Mr Manuel Pinho, director-general of the treasury, said that Portugal would
continue to tap the Euromarket in the future, but with smaller amounts.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Late rally in French sector spurred by
futures trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE absence of significant market-moving news or investor flows, most
bond markets continued their sideways drift yesterday.
FRENCH government bonds put on the strongest performance, surprising many
market participants with a  1/2 -point rally in the afternoon. While some
traders reported buying by futures funds and Far-Eastern investors, most of
the rally was attributed to technical trading in the futures pits.
Ironically, some dealers say prices were supported by the Bank of France's
decision to leave its repo rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent, keeping hopes
alive for an easing at the next repo operation on Thursday. But Mr Steven
Major, senior European bond analyst with Credit Lyonnais, said he does not
expect an easing before next week at the earliest, with the central bank
intent on rebuilding its foreign currency reserves before cutting rates.
Spanish bonds were the other strong performer, gaining nearly  1/2 point in
largely technical trading. Spanish bonds' high yields also attracted some
retail buying, traders said.
UK gilts slipped about  1/2 point in slow trade before today's bond auction
announcement. Traders expect the Bank of England to announce some Pounds 3bn
of new benchmark stock for 2004 with a coupon of between 7 per cent and 7
1/4 per cent.
Since last week's gilts sell-off, overseas investors have been keeping their
distance from the gilts market, unnerved by the prospect of rising inflation
as well as political jitters which threaten to pressure the currency.
CONTRARY to expectations, the Bundesbank didn't release its keenly-awaited
August M3 money supply numbers, leaving German bonds to drift in a narrow
range. Uncertainty over the likely M3 rate, with growth forecasts ranging
between less than 6 per cent to more than 8 per cent, subdued activity and
held volume in check. The numbers are likely to be published today.
Keeping bunds underpinned are expectations of lower inflation numbers for
September. Germany's four largest western states are expected to publish
their consumer price data late this week or early next week. The preliminary
rate is widely expected to be unchanged on the month and down slightly on
the year after 4.2 per cent in August.
BELGIAN bonds shrugged off the  1/4 -point cuts in the Belgian central
bank's end-of-day rate to 11 1/4 per cent and its central rate to 9 3/4 per
cent, and ended little changed.
AFTER a quiet morning session, longer-dated US Treasury prices fell sharply
yesterday afternoon in the wake of higher oil and gold prices.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  23/32 at 102
3/32 , yielding 6.063 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 99 29/32 , to yield 3.908 per cent.
The absence of economic news or a lead from trading overseas meant the bond
market opened in a subdued mood. Dealers said investors were staying out of
the market, and were waiting to see how this week's developments - the
Federal Reserve's Market Open Committee meeting, the official release of
President Clinton's healthcare reform plan, and the auctions of Dollars 27bn
in two-year and five-year notes - affect prices.
In the afternoon, however, selling pressure began to take its toll at the
long end of the market as dealers reacted badly to news of higher oil
prices.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Paper glut to hit Ecu bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a year of famine, the Ecu bond market is now threatened by a glut of
paper.
Sweden yesterday launched an Ecu500m issue of five-year bonds, bringing the
supply of new paper to more than Ecu1bn in the last week. In addition, the
French government announced details of a Ecu1bn-Ecu1.2bn auction of 10-year
OATs next week, while the Italian government is holding a domestic Ecu bond
auction this week.
The fragile recovery of the Ecu bond market could be in jeopardy, according
to some analysts. Yesterday, Barclays de Zoete Wedd's European bond
strategists downgraded Ecu to an 'underweight' recommendation, saying that
the market has outperformed most other European markets but is now looking
expensive.
Ecu bonds are currently yielding around 20 basis points less than their
theoretical, basket-currency value, having recovered substantial ground
following the widening of exchange rate mechanism bands in August.
'At this level, we think the market is beginning to look expensive . . .
There is no reason to hold (Ecu) at all as better value can be had through
its constituent parts,' said Mr Mark Capleton, a BZW strategist. The sudden
burst of new issue activity was prompted by the short supply of current
coupon paper - bonds which are priced around their par value. As a result of
the recent bond market rally, older bonds with higher coupons are now
trading at a substantial premium to their par value, which deters some
investors.
Demand for par-priced paper has been used as a justification for pricing
weaker credits to yield less than benchmark French government bonds.
While the first in the series of deals, the Council of Europe's Ecu150m
eight-year deal via Goldman and UBS, caught the swell of demand perfectly,
subsequent deals have proved harder to sell.
Some analysts said that Sweden's Ecu500m five-year deal via Paribas Capital
Markets, priced yesterday at eight basis points through the comparable BTAN
issue, was too aggressive.
However, other dealers said that the pricing was fair, although current
coupon levels, below 6 per cent for five-year bonds, are unattractive for
some investors.
'It is a positive sign for the market that there is new issuance, without
any sign of moving closer to monetary union,' said Mr Jonathan Davies, an
analyst at UBS.
Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how the market will hold up under the
weight of further supply, which includes a potential European Community
offering.

CENTRAL Bank of China, Taiwan's central bank, has been accused of leaking
information to five government-owned banks, allowing them to profit from
insider bond trading, AP-DJ reports from Taipei.
Hsu Tien-tsai, a legislator of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party,
said the Central Bank should be held responsible. Mr Samuel Shieh, Central
Bank governor, admitted the five banks were informed of cuts in reserve
requirements hours before changes were announced on September 16.
But Mr Shieh argued that the officials were advised in advance because he
wanted them to cut prime lending rates following the Central Bank move.
The Central Bank's reductions in reserve requirements, ranging from 0.75
percentage point to one full percentage point, applied to current accounts
and other main deposits. The cuts sent the bond market into high gear on
Friday, with 42 institutions offering bids totalling TDollars 623.4bn for
government bonds worth TDollars 30bn.

118m share issue

<TEXT>
BANK of Melbourne, the regional bank, has become the latest Australian
company to take advantage of a buoyant share market to top up its capital
base.
The bank yesterday announced a ADollars 118m (USDollars 77.1m) issue of
convertible preference shares, which will qualify as Tier 1 capital under
central bank prudential guidelines.
The shares, with renounce-able rights, will be issued on a one-for-12 basis
at ADollars 13 each. They will qualify for a 6 per cent annual dividend
entitlement and a conversion date no later than November, 1998.
The launch follows a preference issue earlier this year from Australian
banking rival, Westpac. Mr Christopher Stewart, Bank of Melbourne chief
executive, said proceeds of the issue would be used for general purposes.
Normandy Poseidon, the mining group, is to acquire the Larvik Pigmentfabrikk
business from Norzink, the Norwegian zinc producer, for about ADollars 30m.
The acquisition, through Normandy Poseidon's CML division, includes
worldwide rights to the Larvik-process, a leading zinc dust production
technology.
It also includes royalties arising from the Larvik technology, a zinc dust
production facility at Larvik in Norway, and a licence to construct further
facilities in Malaysia, close to CML's existing industrial minerals plant.
Norzink is controlled by RTZ Corp and Trelleborg of Sweden. Larvik produces
12,000 tonnes of zinc dust and zinc oxide annually. With existing production
and the planned plant in Malaysia, CML's annual zinc vapour output would be
about 25,000 tonnes.
Broken Hill Proprietary is to buy an Australian subsidiary of Conoco of the
US for an undisclosed price. BHP expects the transaction to be settled
within two months.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Toshiba to merge two loss-making
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOSHIBA, the Japanese electrical group, is merging two members of its
keiretsu, or industrial operations, amid deteriorating economic conditions
and an appreciating yen.
Tokyo Electric and TEC Electronics, a sales affiliate, are to be merged in
October next year. Toshiba owns 51.3 per cent of Tokyo Electric, which in
turns owns 51.2 per cent of TEC.
The move reflects the increasing pressure on companies that supply Japan's
big exporters of consumer durables, notably high-technology groups and the
carmakers.
It is a further step by Toshiba to improve profits following a string of
recent disposals. The company sold Toshiba Steel Tube in March, and Onkyo,
an unlisted audio visual production subsidiary, in May.
The two companies, both listed on the first section of the Tokyo stock
exchange, aim to improve earnings by integrating production and marketing
operations. One TEC share will be converted into one Tokyo Electric share.
The enlarged company will have a staff of some 7,300. Both companies posted
losses for the year to last March, and yesterday projected heavier loss
estimates for the half year to September.
Tokyo Electric, which made a pre-tax loss of Y4.1bn (Dollars 39.3m) last
year, is projecting a mid-term pre-tax loss of Y5.4bn. TEC, which suffered a
pre-tax loss of Y5.4bn last year, is expecting a six-month deficit of
Y3.5bn.
The new company is expected to post sales of Y185bn in the year ending March
1995, and Y210bn in the following year.
Toshiba also plans to reorganise its operations into four main business
groups. The revamp is the most far-reaching by the company since 1988, when
Toshiba's computer and control systems divisions were merged.
Toshiba said the decision, which puts multi-media operations at the core of
its operations, will enable the company to react to the rapid changes in the
business environment.

TURKEY'S new banking law, which officials describe as the biggest change in
the financial landscape since the mid 1980s, entered the statute book last
week.
The long awaited decree accelerates Turkey's economic convergence with the
European Community, and underpins the growing internationalism of what is
already the country's most up-to-date business sector.
The new law has a number of broad objectives:
To force banks to strengthen balance sheets through improvements to assets
quality and through the provision of extra capital as a cushion against bad
debt;
To help restructure the sector, notably in creating a more formidable buffer
between banks and their industrial affiliates;
To reduce the role of the state by forcing loss-making public banks to run
down loan portfolios in order to meet the more stringent capital
requirements.
Taken with the plans for the privatisation of state banks, the government
reforms represent the most thoroughgoing shake-up of the banking system
since the mid-1980s.
The legislation establishes international standards of banking prudence,
bringing Turkey into line with the EC's second banking directive on a number
of key issues - legal lending limits, property exposure, and a bank's equity
participations.
For the first time, banks will have to publish externally audited accounts,
something a number of state banks have not done in the past.
The moves have been well received by the industry. Mr Ibrahim Betil, of Bank
Ekspres, is particularly encouraged by the changes to the bankruptcy
provisions for banks.
Until now, the government was left to bail out insolvent private banks,
which were either merged with or transferred to a state bank.
Under the new law, a bank can choose liquidation. Such a threat, Mr Betil
believes, will encourage greater efficiency. It will also make depositors
take the overall health of a bank into account.
Turkey has 69 banks, of which 57 are commercial banks. Total assets at the
end of 1992 stood at Dollars 67.2bn. The state dominates the sector, with
the nine state banks accounting for half of the assets, a ratio which,
despite liberalisation and the arrival of new banks, has changed little over
the past decade.
The challenge for Turkey is to balance liberalisation with the need for a
better regulatory framework.
Considerable strides have been made. Changes in the debt provisioning rules
were introduced in 1988, together with a communique on capital adequacy the
following year.
Treasury officials concede that the provisioning policy is 'not 100 per cent
in line with EC practice'. Turkish banks also have some way to go to meet
the capital adequacy requirements of Bank for International Settlements.
Banks have six years to meet the new capital ratios but the property
provisions have to be in place by 1995. The choice for many banks is either
to raise new equity or sell property assets.
Dr Ekrem Kesin, senior economist at Turk Economi Bankasi, says there should
be little difficulty in accommodating the changes. Many private banks are
currently reporting peak profits, although the day when some family-owned
banks are forced to float shares on the stock market may not be far off.
The new regulations go some way towards addressing the need for more arm's
length dealings between banks and related third parties, such as subsidiary
companies, directors and partners. In parallel with this, there are now
additional curbs on the equity investment a bank can make.
Mr Aclan Acar of Garanti believes that from now on, group companies will be
encouraged to be more independent of the group banks.
In the state sector, with profits squeezed and the government unlikely to
pump more funds into the sector, most state banks will be forced to run down
investment holdings.
On a modest scale, this is already happening. The state owned Development
Bank TKB is selling its participations in rural industries. Vakiflar Bankasi
is following a similar course. But bank analysts say for the bigger state
banks - like Halk, Emlak and Ziraat - the capital targets are a considerable
challenge.
Isbank, the largest commercial bank, is 40 per cent state-owned and has been
more successful in divesting shares. But Mr Unal Korukcu, general manager,
points out that even here, the nominal share portfolio has actually
increased as non-performing loans have been converted to equity.
Mr Korukcu also suggests that with fewer good borrowers at current high real
interest rates, the high level of liquidity of many banks is hampering
efforts at meeting capital standards.
Yet whatever the difficulties, the way ahead seems unmistakeable. The state
is in retreat. As the state banks put their houses in order, they will also
be preparing for their eventual privatisation. This is the central pillar of
the government's reform programme.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hongkong Land ahead by 9%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Land, the Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm,
yesterday reported net profit before extraordinary items of USDollars 165.9m
for the six months ended June 1993, representing a 9 per cent increase over
the 1992 figure.
The interim dividend is being increased to 3.15 US cents from 3 cents last
time.
The company also booked a USDollars 213.2m extraordinary profit from the
USDollars 490m sale of its Number Nine Queens Road commercial development.
The deal was announced in May 1992, but was only completed in June 1993.
Hongkong Land remains the colony's largest commercial landlord, and with
average leases of three years on its property portfolio, it is still feeling
the affect of a sharp downturn in office rentals in 1989 and 1990. However,
commercial property prices have appreciated substantially in the past 12
months, and the longer-term outlook is more positive.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'While property earnings for the full year
are expected to remain flat, in part due to the loss of rental income from
Nine Queen's Road Central in the second half, the medium-term outlook is for
renewed growth as reversions come through to profits.'
The company has diversified from its exclusive role as core Central
landlord, by taking the largest single stake in a consortium to build
Container Terminal 9. However, the project continues to face political
opposition from China. It has also purchased a 25.3 per cent shareholding in
UK-listed Trafalgar House.
Jardine International Motor Holdings (JIMH), the motor trading arm of Hong
Kong's Jardine Matheson group, yesterday announced a 21 per cent rise in
first-half net profit to USDollars 35.8m, up from USDollars 29.7m a year
earlier.
Profits growth was struck on marginally higher turnover of USDollars 462.4m.
The Hong Kong operations, which hold the exclusive right to sell Mercedes
Benz cars, registered lower earnings, but a stronger second half is
expected.
There was a surge in sales of Mercedes into southern China in the first half
of the year, through associate company Southern Star, which contributed
USDollars 6m, up from USDollars 2.1m in 1992.
'Sales in the first half remained at last year's high level and the company
continues to expand its distribution network. Performance in the second half
could be affected by the austerity measures recently introduced in China,'
the company said.
An interim dividend of 1.2 US cents a share is recommended, up from 1.06
cents a year ago.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Auditors to settle NZ case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTNERS in Ernst and Young, the international auditors, have agreed to pay
NZDollars 37.5m (USDollars 20.7m) to settle a long standing case brought by
investors in Registered Securities which went bankrupt in 1988, writes Terry
Hall in Wellington.
The settlement means that more than 6,000 investors will receive an extra 30
cents in the dollar payment. This will give them around 80 cents for each
dollar they had invested.
Registered Securities went out of business owing NZDollars 97.8m. The
auditors reported in April 1988, only three months before the collapse, that
the company's accounts had been properly maintained and were in order.
A case against the auditing firm was due to begin next week, seeking
NZDollars 140m in damages. Mr Richard Waddel, spokesman for Ernst and Young,
said his firm did not accept liability.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: QVC takes the stage in battle
for Paramount - Last night's increased offer looks set to spark a hostile
exchange with Viacom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A takeover battle royal broke out last night as QVC Network launched a
Dollars 9.5bn stock and cash bid for Paramount Communications, the film and
publishing company which agreed nine days ago to be acquired by cable
company Viacom for Dollars 8.2bn.
The offer from QVC, which is headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading film
industry figure, will be keenly contested by Viacom and Paramount, which
issued a statement earlier in the day as rumours of a rival offer mounted,
declaring that 'no hostile takeover bid' would be allowed to stop their
merger.
Nevertheless, shares in Paramount rose sharply again on the New York Stock
Exchange, to close at Dollars 69 5/8 , up Dollars 1 1/4 , before QVC's late
afternoon announcement. QVC's offer was last night worth Dollars 80 a share.
Meanwhile, Mr Ted Turner, head of Turner Broadcasting System, has also been
looking at ways of getting involved in a bid for Paramount.
Other large media companies, both US and European, are believed to be eyeing
up Paramount to see whether they can launch a full bid or at least profit
from any post-takeover break-up of the business.
Wall Street merger and acquisition specialists are salivating over the first
big US hostile takeover bid since American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Dollars
7bn acquisition of computer company NCR in 1991.
It is not difficult to see why there is so much interest. Paramount owns
Paramount Pictures, one of few leading Hollywood film studios not yet taken
over by a large conglomerate. This makes it an extremely attractive property
in a world where media businesses are keen to integrate vertically
television and film production, packaging and distribution over cable
networks.
QVC might at first sight seem an improbable contender. It is relatively
small, with 1992-93 turnover of Dollars 1bn, compared with Paramount's
Dollars 4bn.
However, Wall Street has been expecting great things from QVC since Mr
Diller took a large equity stake in it last December and became chief
executive. Mr Diller, who played a key role in building Mr Rupert Murdoch's
Fox group into America's fourth television network, sees a great future in
home shopping as the US enters the age of interactive home entertainment.
Yesterday's bid shows he is also intent on using the company as a vehicle to
build a more broadly-based media empire.
He has some very powerful allies. The other leading shareholders in QVC are
Comcast, a large cable television service company, and Liberty Media, a
cable programme supplier.
Liberty was spun off in 1991 from Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable
service company in the US, although it retains strong links with TCI. Mr
John Malone, the chief executive of TCI is also chairman of Liberty.
TCI, unlike chief rival Time Warner, the second largest cable service
company in America, does not own a movie studio.
Comcast and Liberty yesterday backed the QVC bid by agreeing to inject
Dollars 1bn into the company, buying Dollars 500m each of convertible
preferred stock. This should give much greater market credibility to the bid
by Mr Diller.
It has helped him offer Dollars 30 a share in cash as part of his cash and
shares offer to Paramount stakeholders, compared with the Dollars 9.10 a
share currently on the table in Viacom's bid, which consists mainly of
stock.
However, a bid by QVC could run into political and anti-trust difficulties,
given its links with Mr Malone. TCI accounts for some 20 per cent of an
industry whose monopolistic structure makes it far from popular in
Washington - particularly since a package of regulatory reforms intended to
cut cable rates seems in many cases to have increased them.
The Clinton administration has yet to show just where it stands on
anti-trust policy, but it has threatened to be tougher than the laisser
faire Bush administration. And Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, seems to be
no fan of Mr Malone. He is reported to have once called him the 'leader of
the cable Cosa Nostra'.
If Turner Broadcasting tried to enter the bid battle, that would create even
greater complications and potential conflicts of interest. That company's
leading shareholders include TCI, as well as Time Warner, whose ownership of
Hollywood's Warner Brothers studios would prompt anti-trust questions.
These issues apart, a rival bid could face problems over takeover tactics.
First, Paramount has put in place a poison pill which allows Viacom to buy
20 per cent of its stock at Dollars 69.14 a share (the initial value of
Viacom offer) under 'certain circumstances' - which presumably means a rival
offer higher than that. Paramount would also have to pay Viacom Dollars 100m
for non-consummation of the deal.
However, dissident shareholders are already challenging the stock sale 'lock
up' in the courts of Delaware, where Paramount is incorporated. Such poison
pills rarely prevent bids going through.
Another problem, though a long way down the road, could come from the courts
of Delaware. In an important test case in 1989, the courts there allowed the
board of Time to accept an offer from Warner Communications, even though it
was lower than a rival offer from Paramount, on the grounds that the board
deemed it to be in the group's best long-term strategic interests.
How ironic, then, that Paramount should attack the idea of a hostile bid by
declaring the Viacom deal would create for shareholders 'a global media
entity unparallelled in the entertainment world'.

<TEXT>
NAVISTAR International, the Chicago-based manufacturer of heavy trucks and
diesel engines, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for
an offering of 22m shares of common stock. The issue is to fund a retiree
healthcare programme.
The benefit fund, and the stock offering, are part of an unusual contract
settlement reached earlier this year with current and former Navistar
employees. The restructuring is expected to save Navistar Dollars 200m
annually.
The stock will have a par value of 10 cents per share and should raise about
Dollars 500m. An additional 3m shares will be issued if the offering is
oversubscribed.
Navistar plans to place Dollars 300m of the proceeds immediately into the
healthcare benefits programme and use the balance as working capital.
However, all of the funds from the offering must be contributed into the
healthcare fund within five years.
The new stock issue will increase Navistar's outstanding shares by about a
half. Upon completion of the offering, the company will have about 73m
common shares outstanding.
Navistar shares were down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 20 1/8 at the close in New
York yesterday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has sold 51 per cent of the state-owned insurance
company Aseguradora Mexicana (Asemex) to Grupo Mexival-Banpas for 1.807bn
pesos (Dollars 582m).
Asemex is Mexico's fourth-largest insurer, with assets of 4.219bn pesos. It
is the country's leading casualty company, and insures federal government
entities, such as Petroleos Mexicanos, against damages. It also insures some
of the country's leading companies. In the eight months to August, it
reported profits of 82.8m pesos.
The purchase turns Mexival-Banpas into Mexico's fourth-largest financial
group by assets. Banpas, a medium-sized Mexican bank, was itself bought from
the government by the brokerage Mexival for 544.9m pesos in June 1991.
The finance ministry said Mexival-Banpas would incorporate Asemex into its
financial group, and aim to penetrate the life assurance market. It would
also seek to sell an equity stake to one or two foreign insurance companies.
With inflation in Mexico now under control, several foreign insurance groups
have formed alliances with Mexican insurers. Commercial Union of the UK,
Aetna and New York Life Insurance Company of the US, and Italy's Asicurazoni
Generali have acquired large minority stakes in Mexican insurers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Nike fell sharply yesterday after the US athletic shoe and apparel
manufacturer warned that earnings in the current fiscal year would fail to
match 1992-93 levels.
In response to the announcement, Wall Street marked down Nike's shares by
Dollars 2 to a 52-week low of Dollars 46 in heavy trading. The stock, which
was hit hard in June after the company scaled back its growth projections,
has lost nearly half its value since November.
At the company's annual meeting in Beaverton, Oregon, Mr Philip Knight,
chairman, also announced that Nike would cut its worldwide workforce by 3 to
4 per cent as part of an effort to reduce costs by Dollars 50m this year.
The company said it was basing its earnings projections on a downturn in
'futures' orders, placed by retail outlets six months ahead of delivery.
These were lagging, it said, because retailers remained cautious in the face
of continued economic sluggishness.
In the first quarter of the year ended August 31, net income was Dollars
114m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, down 7 per cent from the comparable period
last year, when Nike posted earnings of Dollars 122m, or Dollars 1.60.
Nike said unfavourable currency exchange rates and higher US taxation were
largely responsible for the decline. If these factors had remained at 1992
levels, earnings would have been Dollars 1.61 a share, about the level
analysts had anticipated. The setback came on a 1 per cent increase in
revenues, to Dollars 1.107bn, against Dollars 1.099bn in the first quarter
last time.
In the US, footwear and apparel sales out-paced last year's levels by 5 per
cent. Sales of basketball shoes, Nike's mainstay line, slid 16 per cent to
Dollars 159m.

Wang's rehabilitation was completed after it received court approval for a
financial restructuring agreed with its creditors. Unsecured creditors owed
Dollars 450m have exchanged their claims for ownership of the company, with
the issuance of 30m new shares.
Holders of the company's ordinary B and C shares have been left with
warrants, exerciseable into 20 per cent of Wang's shares in seven years and
nine months. The company said these were 'not expected to be worth more than
a few cents'. Both the shares and warrants will be traded on Nasdaq.
Wang sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code in August 1992, when it had debt of around Dollars 500m.

THE accounting profession yesterday fired the opening shots in what it
likely to become a contentious battle to force US companies to disclose more
information about their operations.
Its proposals were immediately attacked by financial executives, who said
they could leave another layer of costly regulation, and force companies to
give away sensitive information.
After two years of study into what investors, creditors and others want from
financial reports, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
says there should be greater segmental reporting by companies. They want
them to break their figures down along product and geographical lines.
In the past this has proved one of the most contentious areas of debate
between accountants and companies, many of which fear greater disclosure
would give valuable information to competitors.
The US's leading professional accounting body also suggested companies
should give readers of financial statements more information to assess a
company's prospects, such as the market share of its main products and its
strategy. Auditors would have to produce reports assessing the quality of
earnings.
'We were concerned that financial reports are becoming a smaller and smaller
part of the information used to assess companies,' said Mr Edmund Jenkins,
chairman of the AICPA special committee on financial reporting.
The Financial Executives Institute, however, said the requirements could
force companies to release sensitive information. Mr Norman Roy, president,
said he was concerned the accounting profession had gone public with its
plans without talking to company representatives.
As part of the move to force directors and auditors to give broader
information and assessments of earnings, the committee will recommend a
reform of liability law, said Mr Jenkins, a partner in the accounting firm
Arthur Andersen. This would produce a 'safe harbour', or immunity from legal
action, for directors and auditors who conformed with certain standards.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINMECCANICA, the principal industrial arm of IRI, the Italian state holding
company, has decided to float 40 per cent of two of its leading engineering
subsidiaries in the New York stock market.
The flotations of Elsag Bailey Process Automation and Union Switch and
Signal, which await Security and Exchange Commission approval, are due to be
completed by the end of the year. s
Elsag Bailey Process Automation is a recently created Dutch company that
encompasses the international automation process equipment and numerical
control activities of Genoa-based Elsag Bailey. These international
activities generate an annual turnover of Dollars 600m, equivalent to some
60 percent of the total.
Elsa Bailey, the parent, is already quoted in Italy with some 20 per cent in
third party hands. Finmeccanica has been concentrating on this group as one
of the main sectors generating future earnings, and needs the funds from
flotation to finance costly restructuring elsewhere - especially in the
defence and aerospace sector.
The same considerations lie behind the quotation of 40 percent of Union
Switch and Signal, a US-based company controlled by Finmeccanica's
engineering and rolling stock group headed by Ansaldo.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: BZ earns SFr132m from trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BZ TRUST, the fund management arm of Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank group in
Zurich, has earned SFr132.7m (Dollars 94.4m) in fees for managing BK Vision,
an investment company it formed two years ago, in the first eight months of
1993.
BK Vision specialises in investing in Swiss financial shares and in the past
few months Swiss banking shares have performed very well.
The BZ Trust fee schedule provides for sharply increasing fees as the
performance of the funds it manages improves. BK Vision bearer shares rose
in the first eight months of 1993 by 43.1 per cent to SFr1,431. Its net
asset value at the end of August was SFr1.4bn or SFr1,425 per bearer share.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BZ Trust, said there had been no
criticism of the fees from shareholders. 'They are looking at the
performance of the share,' he said.
The BZ commission formula provides that fees are paid quarterly based on the
rise in the BK Vision share price. If the price rises by less than 6 per
cent (on an annualised basis), no commission is paid. If the rise is between
6 and 10 per cent, the fee is 20 per cent of the increase. Between 10 and 15
per cent, it is 25 per cent and thereafter it is 30 per cent.
Critics say that it is no great achievement for a specialised fund to
achieve large gains when its sector as a whole is doing well. It would be
more appropriate, they argue, to relate the fees to the extent to which BK
Vision shares outperformed the banking sector.
Mr Schiltknecht rejected this criticism. 'Other people follow the same
approach as we do,' he said. 'We informed investors in advance, and everyone
who buys the shares knows what the structure is,' he said.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Securum starts life with
SKr12.9bn first-half loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENT of the problems jettisoned by the Swedish commercial bank
Nordbanken was made clear yesterday when Securum, which took on most of its
bad debts, announced a SKr12.9bn (Dollars 1.61bn) loss in its first six
months of operation.
Securum, which owns 61 per cent of Nobel Industries, was set up by the
Swedish government in January to speed up the reconstruction of Nordbanken,
allowing it to be returned to the private sector by the end of next year.
Some SKr67bn in bad debts were taken on by Securum, a separate state-owned
entity which received a SKr24bn equity injection from the government.
Nordbanken's subsequent return to profit has prompted criticism that it has
gained an unfair competitive advantage over rivals who have not received any
state assistance. In the first half of 1993, Nordbanken bounced back to a
SKr1.7bn profit from a SKr5.2bn loss in the same period of 1992.
Securum's six-month deficit stemmed almost entirely from SKr12bn in credit
losses, mainly linked to the collapse of the Swedish real estate market.
The process of selling off assets has already begun, although the focus of
Securum's efforts has been to sort out its bad loan portfolio with a view to
enhancing future sales values. The agency has been deliberately constructed
to avoid the need for distressed sales, with the sell-off phase expected to
last up to 15 years.
'We are only two miles into a marathon,' said Mr Lars Thunell, the head of
Securum.
The reorganisation of the credit portfolio is nearly complete and future
losses are expected to be much smaller. Around SKr15bn of Securum's SKr24bn
capital has already been wiped out, and the balance is expected to disappear
during the disposal phase.
Securum has 15 subsidiary companies, with activities in Sweden, the US and a
range of European countries including the UK and Germany.
Sweden's Bank Support Authority, the state body set up to tackle Sweden's
banking crisis, said yesterday it had written down the value of Securum by a
further SKr13.15bn to SKr1bn.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Georg Fischer foreshadows net
loss for full year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORG FISCHER, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, expects to report
a group net loss of between SFr30m (Dollars 21.1m) and SFr5m this year,
following a depressed SFr11m profit last year.
Mr Martin Huber, chief executive, also forecast at a press conference in
southern Germany that sales would fall by about 15 per cent from last year's
SFr2.45bn.
The group, which is heavily dependent on the German motor industry, said it
had made a loss in the first half, but gave no figure.
Sales in the first eight months fell 23 per cent to SFr1.3bn, 18 per cent
excluding divested businesses. New orders during the same period fell 18 per
cent to SFr1.3bn.
The group said its process of concentrating on key businesses was largely
completed and it aimed to return to break-even next year in spite of
recessed markets.
Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the Austrian engineering group 71 per cent owned by
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, plunged to a first-half loss of Sch161m (Dollars
14.2m) after a Sch22m profit in the same period last year. Sales tumbled to
Sch5.59bn from Sch8.13bn.
The group saw no improvement in the short term.

FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Metal group suitor under wraps -
The mystery surrounding Union Miniere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO IS courting Union Miniere? That is one of the best kept secrets in the
mining and metals business.
Some time has gone by since UM's owner, Societe Generale de Belgique,
started discussions with a 'potential industrial partner' for UM and when
the half-year results were announced last week La Generale mentioned them
again. But even those analysts closest to the companies have no idea of the
potential partner's identity.
Perhaps this is because UM has given them so much else to think about.
It has thrown itself enthusiastically into a cost-cutting exercise designed
to improve margins by BFr4bn (Dollars 116m) a year by the end of 1994 and to
have full impact in 1995.
At the same time a change of strategy will see UM reduce its exposure to the
highly-cyclical zinc market while investing in copper, precious and special
metals and recycling.
This startled the metals industry because UM is the western world's biggest
producer of refined zinc. Now it wants to quit zinc mining by selling its US
and Swedish operations within five years. The remaining European refining
business will be used to fund expansion elsewhere.
The reorganisation is going smoothly so far: 1,312 people have been made
redundant, about 10 per cent of the workforce, and BFr2.35bn of savings were
achieved by the end of 1992. Although net group operating profits fell by 46
per cent to BFr478m in the first half, UM believes the rationalisation
helped keep it in the black in 'an extremely unfavourable economic
environment'.
What of the partnership talks?
The original idea was for the partner to buy about 30 per cent of UM for
between BFr14bn and BFr17bn and thus reduce La Generale's stake to just
above 50 per cent. Analysts suggest a deal was very close earlier this year
but the relationship has cooled and it is now unlikely SGB will cut its UM
shareholding this way.
Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, UM's chief executive, who is leading the discussions,
certainly gives the impression there is no urgency. He meets executives of
UM's potential partner every now and then 'to discuss strategic issues'. He
says: 'It might make sense for the companies to meet every two or three
months and one day we might have a deal. It might take three months, it
might take two years.'
A sale to an industrial partner would 'be an exciting way of reducing the La
Generale shareholding - but we could always use the stock market instead'.
In fact, La Generale made a start recently when London stockbrokers Smith
New Court bought 5.2 per cent of UM from SGB and sold it to a number of
institutions for about Pounds 50m.
These corporate manoeuvres will continue. Compagnie Financiere de Suez, the
French investment bank, in 1987 won a bruising battle with Italian financier
Mr Carlo De Benedetti for control of SGB, Belgium's biggest holding company.
Now Suez wants to sell its industrial interests within five years and
concentrate on financial services. Therefore many analysts assume that La
Generale eventually might sell all its UM shareholding.
Mr Rodier hopes that none of this will interfere with the initiatives he is
taking at UM.
The group took shape after the Suez takeover when all the metals-related
activities of La Generale - including Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt and
Vieille Montagne - were put into one company, but one that lacked strategic
direction.
Mr Rodier was recruited from Metaleurope, another European zinc group where
he was chief executive, early in 1991 to provide that direction.
He split the group into 12 divisions to make it more responsive and gave
much more responsibility to the management of each division. And, as a first
step towards restoring UM to profitability, at the end of 1991 he brought
forward by a year closure of the zinc operations at Overpelt in Belgium,
which lost BFr300m in 1991, and shelved indefinitely a plan to double annual
capacity to 400,000 tonnes at the Balen refinery, also in Belgium.
Mr Rodier says UM previously was making only an 8 per cent return on capital
over the business cycle whereas La Generale sets a target of 14 per cent. To
achieve that target UM must improve its operating margin by BFr4bn a year by
1994-95 compared with 1991.
The initial plan estimated that 51 per cent of the BFr4bn savings required
would come from cuts in industrial and administrative costs, 28 per cent
from increasing commercial margins, 15 per cent by increasing production
volumes and 6 per cent from carefully screening investments.
Some BFr1.5bn of savings were realised by the closures at Overpelt and
cutting headquarters staff. Another BFr1.5bn will come from a large number
of small projects, such as opening up manufacturing bottlenecks,
restructuring, dropping products and so on, most of which are to be realised
at the Hoboken plant in Belgium which recycles lead and waste materials to
produce precious metals.
The final BFr1bn is to come from a 'basket of ideas' from divisional
managers.
UM is the biggest producer of refined copper in Europe and sixth largest in
the world but has no mines or smelters of its own. Much of its output goes
to produce downstream products such as its own Contirod wire. The copper
refinery at Olen in Belgium needs to be modernised - a decision will be
taken early in 1994 - but to make that worthwhile UM must secure more raw
material supply.
At present, it gets about one third from its stake in the Cananea
mining-smelting operations in Mexico and it is in the final process of
signing a 10-year supply deal with another big smelting company. This would
involve expansion of an existing smelter by an annual 50,000 tonnes for
between USDollars 50m and Dollars 100m.
UM also intends to invest BFr1bn in waste refining activities, lead/copper
smelting and recycling activities at Hoboken.
Recycling of cars will grow dramatically in the next 10 years and UM is
considering investing between BFr500m and BFr1bn to become one of the key
players.
Analysts expect Mr Rodier to sell off non-core assets such as investments in
Asturienne, a mica products company, the OVP Plascobel plastics operation
and Sibeka, a diamond company. But they are still guessing about the
potential partner which is supposed to reduced UM's exposure to the metals
price cycle.

SOCIETE Generale, one of France's largest banks, plans to raise its minority
stakes in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, and Assurances Generales de
France (AGF), the insurance group, as part of the French government's
privatisation drive.
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said in an interview with Les Echos, the French
financial newspaper, that his bank was 'definitely interested in
strengthening our investment position' in Rhone-Poulenc. He also envisaged
increasing Societe Generale's holding in AGF, which he regarded as a
'well-run business'.
Since it first unveiled its privatisation plans, the new centre-right French
government has made it clear that it hopes to enlist noyaux durs, or 'hard
core' shareholders, to take long-term stakes in former state-controlled
companies.
The noyaux durs are part of corporate tradition in France, where the state
has historically played a prominent part in industrial ownership and
strategy.
Societe Generale, privatised in the mid-1980s by the last conservative
French government, was one of the first companies to declare an interest in
acting as a noyau dur.
It already holds stakes of under 5 per cent in both Rhone-Poulenc and AGF.
Mr Vienot said those holdings would be increased. However, he stressed that
Societe Generale planned to stick to its present policy, of spending between
FFr2bn and FFr3bn (Dollars 534m) a year on investments.
A number of other prospective noyaux durs have already emerged in the run-up
to the French privatisations. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the first
candidate for sale, will continue its cross-shareholding agreements with
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurer, and Dresdner Bank
of Germany. Matra-Hachette, the electronics and media group, has indicated
its interest in Renault, the car company due to merge with Sweden's Volvo.

W CANNING, the speciality chemicals and electronic components distributor,
reported a fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds
1.83m, after an exceptional charge of Pounds 942,000 relating to the sale of
an offshoot.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 fell to Pounds 56.2m (Pounds 59.1m).
The Birmingham-based company said that there had been a modest increase in
demand in the UK but continental Europe, where a high proportion of sales
are generated, continued to be weak.
As a result of further cost cutting and action to increase market share,
profits in the period were higher than in the second half of the previous
year. The performance of the electronics division was particularly
encouraging.
Gearing fell over the period from 63 per cent to 38 per cent. However, this
was expected to rise in the rest of the year due to seasonal factors.
On prospects Mr David Probert, chairman, said he could see few signs of
improvement in the group's markets. The cost cutting carried out, however,
should help profits in the second half.
Earnings per share came out at 2.1p (5.9p). The interim dividend is held at
2.94p.

EDINBURGH Fund Managers produced a 20 per cent increase in its interim
dividend yesterday, after a first half in which pre-tax profits more than
doubled from Pounds 1.64m to Pounds 3.72m.
Fund management income was Pounds 7.17m (Pounds 4.47m) and net profit from
unit trust trading came to Pounds 667,000 (Pounds 168,000).
After administrative expenses of Pounds 4.66m (Pounds 3.31m), operating
profits were Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 1.32m).
Earnings per share under FRS 3 were 13.8p, against 5.6p - earnings were
originally stated at 6.9p.
The interim dividend is being increased from 5p to 6p.
Funds under management increased from Pounds 2.4bn to Pounds 3bn between
January 31 and July 31, with more than half the increase representing new
business.
EFM acquired Target Trust Managers during the period, and one of its
investment trusts, EFM Dragon, took over the Drayton Asia Trust.
Investment trusts make up 42 per cent of the group's funds under management,
with an equal proportion coming from discretionary funds. The remaining 16
per cent is made up of unit trusts.
The company said 'the outlook for the full year looks satisfactory if the
present stock market levels are maintained.'

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Flagstone leisure move with IoW buy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A FIRST step towards concentrating on the leisure sector, Flagstone
Holdings proposes to buy The Needles Hotel Company from Wembley for Pounds
2.6m cash. It also intends to raise Pounds 5.48m net through a placing and
rights issue which will lead to a Jersey-based investment company holding
nearly 30 per cent of the capital.
Needles Hotel owns the pleasure park at Alum Bay and a restaurant complex at
Wootton Creek, both on the Isle of Wight.
Flagstone will also procure payment to the vendor of an amount representing
half the pre-tax profits earned by the Needles between July 1 and September
30 1993.
To repay bank indebtedness, improve working capital and meet the
acquisition, Flagstone is placing 500m shares of 1p with institutional and
other investors and offering shareholders a further 92.9m shares at par on
the basis of 2-for-3.
Of the placing shares, 219m will be taken by Channel Hotels and Properties,
which is controlled by Mr David Kirch. The holding will represent 29.9 per
cent of the enlarged capital.
Mr Kirch wishes to participate in leisure-related investments indirectly
through his holding in Flagstone, but does not wish to join the board.
The proposals are subject to shareholder approval on October 11. Share
dealings have been suspended until then.

DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company, has succeeded in
its aim to raise its stake in Flogas, the quoted Irish supplier of liquefied
petroleum gas, from 29.9 per cent to 60.1 per cent.
At Friday's close of the 325p-a-share offer acceptances had been received in
respect of 14.6m shares against the 7.37m shares sought. The excess was
eliminated by scaling down the excess acceptances from each shareholder.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Currency movements help lift Vivat to
Pounds 1.84m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIVAT Holdings, the Lee Cooper jeans and casual wear manufacturer, has
lifted interim profits by 55 per cent with help from favourable currency
fluctuations.
The company yesterday reported a pre-tax surplus of Pounds 1.84m (Pounds
1.2m) for the six months to June 30 on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds
38.33m. At constant exchange rates, however, turnover fell by 7 per cent,
while pre-tax profit rose by about 10 per cent.
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said the increase was made against a
background of difficult trading, particularly in key western European
markets, and was after the inclusion of an above-the-line cost of Pounds
500,000, 'principally to cover the cost of reorganisation within our French
subsidiary.'
Earnings per share increased to 2.4p (1.6p). There is no interim dividend
but Mr Burnett said he was confident of a final at least equal to last
year's 1p per ordinary share.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Elswick moves ahead 18% as margins improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY RIMMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARGINS improved at Elswick, the packaging, paper and printing concern, as
pre-tax profits expanded by 18 per cent from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 2.04m
for the six months ended July 31. Turnover rose by 11 per cent to Pounds
31.6m, compared with Pounds 28.5m.
The directors considered this a satisfactory outcome against the background
of 'continued difficult trading conditions prevailing on most of our
markets.'
They added that because of the seasonal nature of some of these markets,
profits would continue to be weighted towards the first half of the year.
And that progress would be maintained.
Pre-tax surplus for the period was after lower interest of Pounds 366,000
(Pounds 511,000) and subject to Pounds 510,000 (Pounds 431,000) tax.
Undiluted earnings per share were 0.74p (0.63p) while the interim dividend
is held at 0.15p. The directors stated, however, that they intended the
final to represent a larger proportion of the total.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Interest charge hits Community Hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECESSION-hit first half and a Pounds 1.89m rise in annual interest
charges cut pre-tax profits at Community Hospitals Group, the private
medical care company, to Pounds 6.06m for the year ended June 30, compared
with Pounds 6.75m.
With profit growth resuming in the second half, the board proposed an
increased final dividend of 4.5p (4.1p) giving a total for the year of 6.9p
(6.5p).
Earnings per share fell to 14.3p (16p).
'We in the last two years have spent Pounds 40m . . . those assets now are
beginning to punch their weight. We have started this year ahead of
expectations in both divisions and we believe we are now in a period of
sustained growth,' said Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive.
Turnover rose to Pounds 49.5m (Pounds 42.1m) and operating profits were up
to Pounds 7.96m (Pounds 6.84m). 'It was a year of two halves,' Mr Dexter
said. 'In the second half turnover rose 17 per cent and operating profits
were up 24 per cent compared with the same period last year.'
He said the company's 10 hospitals with 450 beds had suffered from recession
in the first half as private health insurance, which covers 85 per cent of
the company's customers, felt the increase in liquidations and bankruptcies.
The cost of two 'major hospital developments' had lifted interest charges
while slower-than-expected start-up phases held back revenue.
The hospital division contributed Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 5.65m) to operating
profits on turnover of Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 36.1m).
The company's continuing care division, mainly its 11 private nursing homes
with 554 beds, contributed 22 per cent (17 per cent) to operating profits,
or Pounds 1.76m, on turnover of Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 6m).
The implementation of the Community Care Act in April had caused a 'brief
hiatus' but the company had not seen any 'material impact' on its occupancy.
The division benefited from the Pounds 4.8m acquisition of three nursing
homes in January.
The company plans to operate 727 beds by the end of next June and hopes
eventually to balance the profits contribution of the two divisions.
Interest charges rose to Pounds 1.9m compared with just Pounds 4,000 in the
previous year after a rights issue.
The higher charge also reflected a fall in capitalised interest to Pounds
700,000 (Pounds 1.6m).
Net borrowings rose to Pounds 37m (Pounds 32m) and gearing is 53 per cent
(33 per cent).

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: 42% expansion puts Close Bros on Pounds 18m
 -Winterflood makes significant contribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSE BROTHERS, the merchant bank, recorded a 42 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 17.8m, against Pounds 12.6m, following its acquisition of
Winterflood Securities, which makes markets in the shares of small and
medium-sized companies.
Close Brothers' share price rose 17p to 430p yesterday.
The acquisition was the largest contributor to a 38 per cent rise in assets
to Pounds 575m (Pounds 417m). But the bank said that other operations had
grown, including a 16 per cent rise in asset finance receivables.
The final dividend is 7.8p (6.5p), making a total of 11p (9.5p). Earnings
per share rose by 22 per cent to 27.5p (22.5p).
Mr Rod Kent, managing director, said the purchase of Winterflood, largely
financed by a Pounds 17.3m vendor placing of 5.5m shares, had been
successful because there had been strong demand for market-making in small
companies.
He said that Winterflood, which contributed Pounds 4.2m to profits, had
performed 'jolly well'. However, the bank had also benefitted from the
uniformly good performance of its other operations including investment
management.
Profitability of the commercial lending division had been rebuilt through
both margin and fee income, while Treasury deposits had also risen.
Development capital had been aided by recent rises in valuations.
Century, the bank's debt factoring business, was said to have had a
'satisfactory' year and its consumer finance arm had done well.
The bank's buildings in the City were severely damaged in the Bishopsgate
bombing last April. It said this had caused 'no measurable financial loss'
but had 'made life frustrating for City staff'.
Mr Kent said the company remained committed to growth both organically and
through acquisition. 'We are permanently acquisitive, and we always have
been,' he said.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Bemrose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEMROSE Corporation, the Derby-based security and promotional printer,
reported a 38 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits yesterday boosted
by its recent acquisitions in both the UK and US.
The group, which used the proceeds of a rights issue in March to fund the
acquisition of the outstanding 50 per cent of its US joint venture company
and the purchase of Barnard and Jackson, UK-based diary publishers, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.55m in the six months to July 3, up from Pounds
1.85m in the year ago period.
Turnover, including Pounds 10.3m attributed to acquisitions, increased to
Pounds 32.6m (Pounds 22.7m) while operating profits, including Pounds
810,000 from acquisitions, grew to Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 1.96m). The group's
share of profits from Bemrose Yattendon, the US joint venture before its
full acquisition in April, added a further Pounds 163,000 to profits,
compared with Pounds 380,000 for the full six months in 1992.
Interest costs increased to Pounds 581,000 (Pounds 491,000).
Earnings per share rose to 7.86p (6.52p) out of which the group is paying an
unchanged interim dividend of 4.3p.
Commenting on the results Mr Rodger Booth, chief executive, said: 'The
encouraging performance for the first period is continuing into the second
half of the year.'
The group's core business of security printing at Derby continued to trade
well in a difficult market. Although volumes and revenues from bank cheques
are down, costs have been reduced and sales of other security products have
been increased.
Barnard and Jackson, the new UK purchase, 'broadly broke even' although
profits from diary sales are predominantly earned in the second half. In the
US the expanded group, now the largest supplier to the advertising specialty
market, is achieving substantial real growth.

<TEXT>
Lord Hollick, the youthful-looking head of media and financial services
group MAI, is wryly amused when reminded about the chequered past of the
independent television franchise which his 61 per cent owned Meridian group
has recently begun to serve. 'It has been the Bermuda triangle of
independent television,' he laughs. He is adamant, however, that Meridian -
which paid Pounds 36m for the south of England license  - will not
disappear. It is developing a strong regional emphasis within the franchise,
encouraging local advertising and programmes, which the Labour peer believes
will offset any decline in independent television advertising.
'We are selling some slots three times over,' he says.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: N Atlantic trust reforms capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH Atlantic Smaller Companies Investment Trust is reconstructing its
capital in an attempt to cut the discount to assets at which the trust's
shares have been trading.
Shareholders will be offered four new ordinary shares and six new units of
convertible loan stock (all with a par value of 5p) for every five existing
ordinary shares of 10p.
The idea behind the scheme is that the trust will be able to purchase the
convertible loan stock whenever it stands at a discount to asset value.
These purchases will not only put a 'floor' on the discount but will enhance
the net asset value of the ordinary shares. Discount on the shares has
ranged from 32 per cent in September 1992 to below 17 per cent this month.
In January management of the trust moved from Invesco MIM to JO Hambro.
Interim results for the six months to July 31 were also announced. The net
asset value per share rose by 16 per cent, from 412p to 479.8p, despite the
exercise of warrants, which reduced the value by nearly 2 per cent.
Quoted portfolio benefited from the performance of Danka Business Systems
and the unquoted from the flotation of Mississippi Valley Bank and the sale
of Tracker Network.
After tax there was a net loss of Pounds 203,000 (Pounds 8,000) or 1.88p
(0.075p) per share. The shares rose 6p to 411p yesterday.

Boosted by an increase in export sales, pre-tax profits of Dinkie Heel, the
manufacturer of components for the shoe trade, showed a marked increase from
Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 309,000 in the six months to end-June.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 3.49m
and was helped by improved margins and reductions in fixed overheads. Lower
interest rates led to a fall in interest payable to Pounds 33,000 (Pounds
44,000).
An interim dividend of 0.5p (0.35p) is declared, payable from earnings per
share of 1.76p (0.67p). The shares closed up 2p to 26p.

Turnover however, fell from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 10.2m mainly through the

Within that, rentals rose to Pounds 8.72m (Pounds 8.51m) despite the
increase in vacant available letting space.
A number of development opportunities were being pursued, principally using

Earnings per share worked through at 4.34p (3.8p).

The benefits of an early and buoyant tourist season, with an added
improvement in home market share enabled Jenners Princes Street, the
Edinburgh department store, to more than double pre-tax profits from Pounds
437,000 to Pounds 928,000 in the half year to July 31.
Jenners said the second half had started satisfactorily and a good autumn
was expected but with 'our usual caution at this important time'.
However, the company said it would be 'unreasonable to expect the full year
to match the improvement in the first half'. Turnover grew from Pounds 15m
to Pounds 16.1m. The interim dividend has been raised to 32p (25p).

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sentry Farming interim losses grow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sentry Farming Group reported pre-tax losses up from Pounds 286,000 to
Pounds 309,000 in its seasonally unfavourable first half to June 30.
The company pointed out, however, that interim losses were not indicative of
the full year result.
Sentry said that indications from crops harvested were that yields were
larger than anticipated and that average prices should be greater than
expected, as a result of some forward sales earlier in the year, when prices
were higher than at present.
In addition, exchange gains relating to arable aid payments will result in
payments being received in the second half, significantly in excess of those
provided for in Sentry's 1993 business plans.
Turnover of the USM-quoted company grew from Pounds 1.86m to Pounds 2.29m.
Losses per share were 7.65p (7.14p).

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Asda Property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSTANTIAL cut in interest charges from Pounds 6.24m to Pounds 2.88m
helped Asda Property Holdings to raise pre-tax profits by 61 per cent to
Pounds 2.47m in the first half of 1993, against Pounds 1.53m last time.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 2.6p (1.1p), while the interim
dividend has been stepped up from 0.65p to 0.7p on capital increased by
July's Pounds 16.3m rights issue.
Mr Manny Davidson, chairman, said that acquisitions of high-yielding
commercial property over the past two years had to date only partially
utilised the proceeds from the sale of residential and other low-yielding
assets.
Turnover fell from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 11.2m; rental income came to
Pounds 5.82m (Pounds 7.12m) and should improve in the second half as the
full contribution from the recent acquisition to the company's investment
portfolio began to flow through, Mr Davidson said.
The company said it has bought 30 predominantly freehold, retail properties
for Pounds 7.8m, the shops being located in various town centres including
Aberdeen, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Salisbury and Shrewsbury. The portfolio
currently produces an income of about Pounds 1m per annum.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Control Techniques contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSAULT by Control Techniques on the highly competitive market for the
computer controls used on machine tools has received a boost through an
important contract from Cincinnati Milacron.
The Wales-based controls and drives concern is to supply a complete control
package for a new low-cost machining centre launched last week by Milacron
at the EMO machine tool show in Hanover.
The package includes CT's FNC Flexible Numerical Controller, launched last
year in an attempt to give the UK a presence in the computer numerical
control (CNC) market - which is dominated by GE Fanuc and Siemens.
Control Techniques has supplied the FNC to specialist machine tool builders
in the UK, and to overseas suppliers such as the Shanghai Machine Tool
Company.
But Milacron is the first 'household name' in machine tool terms, to use FNC
as the standard control package on its machines. Mr Philip Sewell, managing
director of CT's automation side, said the company was in talks with other
big machine tool builders.
Milacron's new Arrow machine is aimed at the high-volume, low-cost end of
the vertical machining centre market.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Higher interest leaves Meggitt down at
Pounds 10.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in interest payments has hit pre-tax profits for the first half
at Meggitt, the Dorset-based engineering company.
Interest payable rose from Pounds 17,000 to Pounds 1.27m following the
company's decision to adopt the proposals in FRED 3 and treat its Euro
convertible preference shares as debt rather than equity. This left pre-tax
profits at Pounds 10.8m, down from a previous Pounds 11.7m.
However, operating profits edged ahead from Pounds 11.45m to Pounds 11.81m.
Turnover rose from Pounds 152.9m to Pounds 179.3m.
Mr Ken Coates, executive chairman, said that the group had experienced an
excellent first quarter, but the second quarter had slowed down. The
recession continued to affect margins in all areas, but acquisitions made
last year helped the group to raise its market penetration.
The electronics division, which was the first to be hit by the recession,
had experienced 11 months of steady but gentle improvement. He did not
believe it was clutching at straws to hope for further gains in the sector.
While the group had bucked the trend in the aerospace sector, it was
improving its performance through increasing market penetration, not because
there was more business around.
The energy division had had a tough time, with new business failing to
materialise as quickly as expected. In addition a difficult contract in
South America and restructuring costs had cost Pounds 1m.
The controls division was doing similar business to last year.
Mr Coates said that by a quirk the second half would see the maturity of
several contracts, which should lead to an improved performance.
Earnings per share fell to 3.3p (3.7p). The interim dividend is 1.3p
(1.25p). In April, the 17.2 per cent stake of Meggitt held by BTR, the
industrial holding company, was placed with investment institutions. Mr
Coates said the group welcomed the change to a wider shareholder base.
On July 8, Pounds 14.06m of the Pounds 17m Euro Convertible Preference
Shares were redeemed at the shareholders' request.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Long-term business up for Refuge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
REFUGE ASSURANCE, the life insurance group, yesterday reported a 4.9 per
cent rise in regular premium long-term business in the first six months of
1993 to Pounds 18.8m.
However, the group's annual premium business in life and pensions fell
slightly by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 24.7m.
Refuge said yesterday it was raising its interim dividend to 10.35p per
share, up from 9.60p. Also, it will seek shareholder approval for a
two-for-one scrip issue at an extraordinary general meeting to be called on
November 18.
Unit trust sales for the first six months of 1992 rose sharply to Pounds
4.6m from Pounds 2.7m a year earlier.
In general insurance, premiums were marginally lower at Pounds 6.4m against
Pounds 6.6m. Refuge said theft claims continued to cause concern, although
there had been a slight reduction in the past few weeks.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Two Signet directors get share options at
32.5p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNET GROUP, the jewellery retailing group formerly known as Ratners,
yesterday granted two of its directors options on 2.45m shares in the
company at 32.5p.
Mr James McAdam, executive chairman, was granted 1.48m options, while Mr
Lawrence Cooklin, chief executive of the UK jewellery operations, received
970,000.
The options can be taken up in 3-10 years, only under certain conditions.
The group, which earlier this month reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26.9m
for the first half, must have returned to profit.
In addition the share price, which yesterday closed up 1 3/4 p at 30 3/4 p,
must have averaged 60p for a minimum period of three months. At no time
during the three months must the price drop below 50p.
However, since preference share dividends are not currently being paid, many
analysts believe Signet will need a capital reconstruction.
The terms of the options would allow the exercise price of the options and
the performance targets to be changed in that eventuality, if the auditors
and non-executive directors agreed. The managers might then profit from the
share options, even though ordinary shareholders had seen their investment
heavily diluted.
Signet undertook to grant no further options to existing shareholders for 12
months.

SPRING RAM, the bathrooms and kitchens group, has appointed Barclays de
Zoete Wedd as its brokers, replacing Panmure Gordon.
Tomorrow, when the interim results are announced, Price Waterhouse is
expected to take over the audit from Arthur Andersen. Price Waterhouse will
also be presenting the full financial review of Spring Ram arranged by Mr
Roger Regan, the new chairman.
In addition Mr Regan will give an operational review of the group. Some
unofficial market estimates put the first-half loss as high as Pounds 40m.
Tomorrow's results are also expected to spark the departure of Mr Bill
Rooney, one of the group's founders and its biggest shareholder with a 16
per cent stake. Mr Rooney lost his job as executive chairman to Mr Regan,
who was approached by investment institutions after Spring Ram issued three
profit warnings in eight months.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher to spin off Charles Sidney
through flotation next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBERT FISHER, the food processing and distribution group, is to spin off
Charles Sidney, its Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle and
passenger car dealer, through a full stock market flotation next month.
The move is the latest step taken by Mr Stephen Walls, Albert Fisher's new
chairman, to refocus the group on its core activities - the processing and
distribution of fruit, vegetables and seafood.
It also represents an opportune time to launch a publicly quoted vehicle
group since the luxury car market is now showing signs of recovery, and the
motor dealers' share prices have been buoyant over the past year.
Charles Sidney was one of the first postwar dealerships established in
Britain by Mercedes-Benz in 1953. Since then the group has become one of the
largest distributors of Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Britain and had estimated
sales in the year to August 31 of about Pounds 55m (Pounds 41m).
The group holds the Mercedes-Benz franchises in Bradford and South Yorkshire
(Sheffield and Doncaster). It operates Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle
dealerships in Bradford and Sheffield - trading under the name Northside
Trucks - passenger car dealerships in Bradford and Doncaster, together with
after sales servicing, parts and repair facilities.
Northside Trucks also includes a rentals division with a fleet of 400
commercial vehicles.
In 1992, 40 per cent of turnover came from new and used commercial vehicle
sales, 40 per cent from new and used car sales and 20 per cent from
servicing, spare parts and commercial vehicle body building. Vehicle sales
in the latest year were split evenly between commercial vehicles and
passenger cars.
Mr Raymond Edwards, Albert Fisher's director responsible for the European
food processing division including Charles Sidney, will leave the group to
become Charles Sidney's executive chairman.
Mr Edwards joined Albert Fisher when it acquired Northside Trucks in 1983.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bryant falls slightly to Pounds 18m -
Housing side feels effects of limited recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRYANT GROUP, the West Midlands-based housebuilding, property and
construction company, yesterday reported a small decline in full-year
pre-tax profits reflecting higher interest costs and the losses of
associated companies.
Pre-tax profits in the 12 months to May 31 fell to Pounds 18.3m (Pounds
20.3m) on turnover that slipped by 4 per cent to Pounds 309.7m (Pounds
322.9m).
Profits were held back by a Pounds 1.6m loss (Pounds 400,000 profit) by
associated undertakings after property provisions of nearly Pounds 2m.
Interest costs increased to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 1.5m) reflecting the then
high interest rates associated with the group's Pounds 13.5m of borrowings
in Ireland.
Earnings per share fell to 4.9p (5.5p), just sufficient to cover the
unchanged total dividend of 4.8p per share including a final payment of
3.4p.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman, said the group had faced difficult trading
conditions during most of the financial year and that all divisions had
experienced pressure on prices.
He said: 'The limited recovery in the economy has had a positive impact on
the group's housing operations, but so far has not significantly benefited
our construction or property activities.' Turnover, but not operating
margins, increased by more than 20 per cent in the second half, he added.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 21.4m) and margins, helped by
an improved contribution from the construction division, widened from 6.6
per cent to 7.3 per cent.
The core housebuilding operations, which are being expanded, lifted
operating profits to Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 15.6m) on increased turnover of
Pounds 224.3m (Pounds 196.6m).
House completions rose by 21 per cent to a record 2,815 at a reduced average
price of Pounds 83,000 (Pounds 86,000), but Mr Andrew MacKenzie, chief
executive, said prices 'bottomed out' in the spring.
At the year end, Bryant and associates had a land bank of just under 10,000
plots. Last year, the group spent Pounds 70m on land purchases and it plans
to spend more this year, but Mr MacKenzie warned that there were already
signs of 'some pressure' on land prices, particularly in the south.
Meanwhile the construction division reported sharply lower turnover of
Pounds 65.4m (Pounds 100.5m) reflecting a determination to avoid negative
margin tendering. However, profits rose to Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 4.6m) and the
forward orders stand at Pounds 60m (Pounds 40m).
COMMENT
Bryant builds quality houses, and volumes should continue to rise as the
recovery takes hold. Of more concern, however, are the reports of land price
pressures. These could limit margin gains as Bryant attempts to broaden its
regional housebuilding activities and expand its relatively short land bank
outside the Midlands.
Nevertheless Bryant has an ungeared balance sheet and is a well-managed
group heading in the right direction. Pre-tax profits should reach Pounds
29m this year producing earnings of 7.3p and a prospective p/e just above
20. But the stock looks much less expensive against projected pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 47m and earnings of 11.4p in 1995.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Two Aitken Hume directors under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO DIRECTORS of Aitken Hume International, the banking group, may face
removal from the board following criticism over the weekend by Hong Kong
regulators of Allied Group, one of its largest shareholders.
Mr Lee Ming Tee, Allied's chairman and a major shareholder, and Mr Brian
O'Connor, a director, will face scrutiny following a critical report into
the operations of Allied.
Mr Bill Brown, a director of Aitken Hume and non-executive chairman of
Aitken Hume Bank, a subsidiary, said yesterday: 'As a member of the board I
am interested to see the affairs of the company are conducted in a fit and
proper manner. If they are censured it is a matter of great concern to us.'
Mr Lee and Mr O'Connor are mentioned in a report from an inspector appointed
to examine Allied's affairs by the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong
published on Saturday. Allied was also raided by 300 police last week.
Both men sit on the board of Aitken Hume, reflecting Allied's substantial
stake, which is reported in the Aitken accounts for the 12 months to March
31 last year as 30.3 per cent. The shares are held through Menston
Investments, a subsidiary.
The Bank of England refused to comment yesterday.
But it has regulatory powers to debar directors of banks on grounds
including competence, integrity and skills as well as criminality.
Mr Brown said that there were no financial links between Aitken Hume and
Allied, and that Aitken Hume had not had any contact with the investigations
in Hong Kong.
Mr Lee is a Malaysian-born Chinese entrepreneur who owns a string of
companies through the Allied Group.
Mr O'Connor is mentioned in the Hong Kong report as chairman of Crestacare,
which had a share placing in 1992 underwritten by Asia Securities, owned by
Allied.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Geevor revival plan gets boost after rights
oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLAN to revive Geevor, the tin mining company, as a coal mining concern
received a boost yesterday when a Pounds 1.75m rights issue was 50 per cent
oversubscribed. The new company is being led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the
former commercial director of British Coal, to run pits no longer wanted by
the state-owned company.
The placing and rights issue, underwritten by Guinness Mahon, paves the way
for a reconstruction of Geevor and a settlement with its creditors who will
convert debt into shares.
The new group will include UK Consolidated Mining, which owns a lease on
Cwmgwili, an anthracite mine in South Wales. The company is being acquired
through an issue of Pounds 2m of shares. Mr Edwards will also reverse his
own company, Coal Investments, into Geevor, and take over as group executive
chairman. Coal Investments has the tender rights for five British Coal
mines.
Geevor, whose shares have been suspended for 18 months, will now regain its
listing and be renamed Coal Investments plc. Details are to be approved at
an EGM around October 20.
The proceeds of the rights issue will be used mainly to redevelop Cwmgwili.
If Coal Investments succeeds in its bid for British Coal pits it will
probably return to the shareholders for more money, Mr Edwards said
yesterday. British Coal is expected to announce the results of the tender in
the coming weeks.
Mr Edwards said he was confident that it would be possible to create a
successful coal business in the UK despite the recent upheavals.

FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Smiths wins contract for F-22 power
controllers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS INDUSTRIES has won a contract to develop the power controllers on the
F-22, the next generation fighter aircraft for the US Air Force.
The deal, understood to be worth about Dollars 10m, could lead to a
production contract worth Dollars 150m, several times that amount.
It is the latest in a series of avionics development contracts that could
bring in more than Pounds 50m a year by the end of the decade if they result
in production deals, said Mr Norman Barber, chairman of Smiths' aerospace
division, yesterday.
The shares rose 5p to 368p.
The company beat two US rivals to the contract, Rocketdyne, part of Rockwell
International, and Sunstrand of Illinois.
The contract follows deals to design similar controllers for the
McDonnell-Douglas Apache attack helicopter, Boeing's new 777 airliner and
the European Fighter Aircraft, being developed by a consortium of European
aerospace companies.
The first two could move into production in the next year or two.
The programme for the Boeing 777 has been particularly successful. A
controller, originally designed to run four sub-systems, will be installed
to run 54. Each 777 will contain Smith's equipment worth more than Dollars
400,000.
Mr Barber said that the F-22 contract was unlikely to lead to new jobs but
would help preserve existing skills.
The Dollars 87bn F-22 fighter programme is a survivor of the Clinton
administration's defence review last month. The aircraft is designed to
replace the F-15 and is two-thirds owned by Lockheed with Boeing holding the
remainder.
The equipment for the F-22 is a computerised controller for various
mechanical, hydraulic and electronic systems on the aircraft. It will be
worth about Dollars 250m an aircraft, but this could rise if its size is
increased as with the 777 version.
Lockheed plans to produce more than 600 F-22s.
Mr Barber said: 'With this bridgehead into the F-22, we can bid for other
power management systems.'
The power distribution centres are the first use in tactical fighters of
270-volt direct current distribution through programmable switching
technology.
The contract is the first Smiths will meet through its US operations based
in New Jersey and Florida. Previous contracts have been met out of UK sites.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Bond issues push MAI up 13% to Pounds 80m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD bond issues by governments and companies fuelled a 13 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits at MAI, the financial services, information and
media group headed by Lord Hollick.
The group, which yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 80.2m for the
year to June 30, also revealed that its 61 per cent-owned broadcasting
company, Meridian, was ahead of budget. Meridian won the ITV south of
England franchise with a Pounds 36m bid.
MAI's results, struck on turnover 36 per cent up at Pounds 528m including an
Pounds 86.6m contribution from Meridian, were slightly ahead of analysts'
expectations. Forecasts were upgraded by as much as Pounds 7m to Pounds 96m
for the current year.
Lord Hollick, managing director, said profits had been driven by currency
gains and the group's securities business in the US and UK. Governments had
increasingly sought funding from bond markets. The decline in interest rates
had also boosted activity in securities investments.
Foreign exchange dealing had been less satisfying, with the poorest
performance out of Asia. Business in Japan had been held back by turmoil in
the Japanese banking sector, and the collapse of the Tokyo stock market.
Overall, money broking and securities increased trading profits by 27 per
cent to Pounds 55.9m.
The information division saw a 70 per cent rise at the trading level to
Pounds 8m, due to cost savings from the merger of the market research groups
NOP and MRI and a maiden contribution from financial information.
Retail financial services enjoyed a strong contribution from Wagon, the car
finance operation. MAI's decision in 1990 'not to write any more business at
suicidal margins' had stood Wagon in good stead, said Lord Hollick. On the
downside, the insurance arm, Safeguard, had been hit by intense competition
from direct telephone sales.
The group's move into broadcasting appeared set to pay early dividends, with
Meridian on course to break even in the year to December, six months before
budget. The division, included for six months, incurred a loss of Pounds
3.5m.
MAI ended the year with net cash of Pounds 55m. Earnings per share rose from
13.7p to 15.8p. The dividend was increased by 6 per cent to 4.9p, for a
total of 6.9p (6p).

FT  21 SEP 93 / Morgan Crucible reassures as profits rise 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN Crucible, the UK- based materials technology group, yesterday went
some way towards dispelling concerns about its balance sheet and
profitability by demonstrating strong cash generation and a larger than
expected profit increase.
Reporting a 5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.5m, Mr
Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the group generated Pounds 5.3m of net
cash after maintaining capital expenditure, compared with a Pounds 26m
outflow in the same period last year.
Analysts were equally encouraged that Mr Farmer had reconfirmed a commitment
to resist the acquisition trail.
Six months ago investors were concerned about the group's high gearing, the
use of acquisition provisioning that appeared to bolster profits and the
volume of corporate deals. Mr Farmer would not comment on progress towards
selling the Holt Lloyd car care business, which is considered non-core and
depresses group operating margins. The subsidiary made a Pounds 3m
first-half operating profit in a 'sparkling performance' and was likely to
make Pounds 7m for the full year, he said.
The pre-tax profit increase was struck on sales up 19 per cent at Pounds
401.6m, or an increase of 6.4 per cent excluding the effect of currency
adjustments and acquisitions. Earnings per share rose 2 per cent to 9.6p and
the group is paying a maintained 5.75p interim dividend.
Morgan Crucible squeezed Pounds 23.7m cash out of working capital - equally
from stock and debtors.
Net debt at the end of the period, however, remained less than Pounds 1m
lower than the year-end figure at Pounds 157.7m after adverse currency
movements. Gearing was almost unchanged at 66 per cent but the interest bill
was covered more than five times by operating profits.
Mr Farmer gave a bleak assessment of world markets. While group order intake
was up by at least 7 per cent, with Australasia, the UK and North America
showing gradual improvement, continental Europe and Japan were causing
concern. 'I do not think 1994 will be the take-off year,' Mr Farmer said.
At the operating level profits rose 16 per cent to Pounds 40.8m or 1 per
cent excluding the effects of currency and acquisitions.
The speciality materials, technical ceramics and thermal ceramics divisions
all advanced, while the carbon division was held back by the US.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Murray Johnstone agrees to US ownership for Pounds 49m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MURRAY Johnstone, Scotland's second largest independent fund manager, is
being sold for Pounds 49m to United Asset Management, a quoted US company
which owns 35 other fund managers.
Murray Johnstone, which manages funds totalling Pounds 4.3bn, will retain
its name and independence of operations, investment policies and personnel.
Four Murray Johnstone investment trusts - Murray International, Murray
Income, Murray Smaller Markets and Murray Ventures - own 75 per cent of
Murray Johnstone Holdings. They and the current and past employees, who own
18 per cent, have agreed to UAM's offer of new shares in the US company with
a cash alternative. The remaining 8 per cent is owned by Kemper Financial
Services of Chicago.
UAM is a holding company based in Boston which owns 35 fund management
companies managing a total of Dollars 86bn. It has a market capitalisation
of Dollars 1.1bn.
UAM does not manage securities itself and does not dictate investment
strategies to its subsidiaries, but it encourages them to compete against
each other. UAM will receive a percentage of Murray Johnstone's revenue.
Murray Johnstone said the deal would enable it to expand and to reward
staff. 'We're delighted to have found a solution which enables us to retain
our managerial independence and stay in Glasgow,' said Mr Giles Weaver,
managing director.
The Glasgow-based fund manager's expansion has been limited by its ownership
structure because the investment trusts did not want to increase their stake
in what is an unquoted company, already accounting on average for 4 per cent
of their portfolios.
A further complication is that The Cadbury committee on corporate governance
has expressed unease about Murray Johnstone's ownership structure, in which
Murray Johnstone manages the assets of its main shareholders, a structure
typical of a number of smaller fund managers.
In 1991 Murray Johnstone offered itself for sale to other fund managers in
the UK and Europe, but was unable to find a purchaser on acceptable terms.
The acquisition is UAM's biggest outside the US. It already owns Alpha
Global Fixed Income Managers and Ki Pacific Asset Management in London.

FT  21 SEP 93 / BNP and Dresdner may extend alliance: Michel Pebereau tells
Peter Martin and Alice Rawsthorn of French bank's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP), the leading French bank which is the first
candidate for privatisation by France's centre-right government, may extend
its alliance with Dresdner, the German bank with which it has a
cross-shareholding agreement, to include links with other European banks.
Mr Michel Pebereau, BNP chairman, yesterday said before the launch of the
bank's privatisation marketing campaign, that BNP and Dresdner might
consider forging commercial links with other European banks to expand their
retail banking activities into other areas of the European Community.
'The agreement with Dresdner means that BNP's French clients can use the
Dresdner network in Germany and their German clients can use our branches in
France,' said Mr Pebereau. 'Eventually we will need to offer a similar
facility in other countries. It is possible that together we might link up
with banks in Italy or the UK.'
The agreement between BNP and Dresdner, one of a number of cross-border
ventures recently concluded in European financial services, enables both
banks to take up to 10 per cent of the other's equity. The share swap will
not be implemented until after BNP's privatisation, which is scheduled for
completion by December 20.
The BNP chairman described the Dresdner alliance as central to his group's
strategy in retail banking and international banking for corporate clients,
its second main area of activity.
Mr Pebereau and the BNP board are this week beginning a series of marketing
presentations in preparation for the bank's sale to the private sector. The
share issue comes at a time when BNP is under considerable financial
pressure. It recently reported a 61 per cent fall in interim net profits
from FFr1.33bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in the first half of 1992 to FFr522m in the
same period this year. Mr Pebereau said that 1993 would be 'a difficult
year' and that 1994 would be 'difficult too' with 'the real recovery' coming
in 1995.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Wooing starts in great share sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The task facing Mr Michel Pebereau, recently appointed head of Banque
Nationale de Paris, is to make business as usual sound exciting and
glamorous, as he sets about persuading investors to buy the shares.
Mr Pebereau admitted the bank had a problem with profitability - net profits
in the six months to June 30 fell 61 per cent to FFr 522m - but that was
because of the economic climate. An improvement was already on the horizon.
'Our small corporate clients are less pessimistic and there has been a
slight improvement in the residential property market,' he said yesterday in
an interview with the Financial Times.
For the bank, this year was proving difficult and 1994 would not be easy; a
sustained recovery in profits would probably start in 1995. Such short-term
worries aside, the bank merely needed 'classic management strategy',
building on its strengths as both a banque de proximite - or neighbourhood
bank - and as an international bank for big clients.
Mr Pebereau drew a clear distinction between his former role as boss of
Credit Commercial de France, which he repositioned as specialist banker to
the entrepreneurial classes, and the job he faces at BNP. 'CCF is a
medium-sized bank which can move quickly into market niches. BNP is a far
larger bank which is preoccupied by market share.'
BNP pins a good part of its future on the continued role of the
neighbourhood bank in France. The fact that each of its 2,000 branches
caters for a wide range of customers - from a company president to the
worst-paid of his employees - was a marketing challenge, not a strategic
problem, said Mr Pebereau.
The branch network could be made more profitable by pushing through more
insurance products. Some of these would come from Union des Assurances de
Paris, the state-owned insurer, itself a candidate for privatisation, which
has cross-shareholdings with BNP.
But better returns would also come from keeping a close eye on the
profitability of individual branches. Though the scale of the network would
remain the same, 'we will only develop in places where we are profitable,
and will close branches where we are not making money.'
Why were French banks on the whole less profitable than those in other
European countries? 'We're not over-manned,' said Mr Pebereau. Measurements
of individual productivity showed BNP comparing well with its foreign rivals
and it was ahead of many of them on information technology.
Costs were relatively high in relation to revenues by international
standards largely because French banks' prices for their services were low.
That might change as the attitude of non-profit-making institutions, such as
Credit Agricole and other mutual banks, became more commercial.
The needs of local clients were an important factor in BNP's alliance with
Germany's Dresdner Bank. The other aim of the relationship with Dresdner was
to ensure that the two emerged as members of what Mr Pebereau believes will
be a small group of leading international banks, perhaps eight in all. Mr
Pebereau reeled off a list of the four types of international clients the
two banks would target and the six types of service he hoped to sell them.
Just as significant, however, are the things he is not proposing to do on
the international scene. His neighbourhood banking ambitions are confined to
France, so such interesting oddities as Bank of the West, a retail bank BNP
owns in northern California, will remain just that: an interesting oddity,
to be developed internally but not expanded even as far as southern
California.
He has no desire to set up a big trading operation, implying that revenues
will continue to be heavily dependent on interest income. And he does not
expect to break into the international mergers and acquisitions business,
despite handling a large number of small and medium-sized deals in France.
French retail investors are being offered a simpler message. Though a price
for the offering will not be announced until October, the television
commercials are already running using the slogan: 'Let's grow together'. The
trick is to keep the togetherness and still achieve the growth.

FT  21 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: MAI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From the outside, MAI looks like an enigma wrapped in a money broker. In an
industry notorious for its volatility, MAI has a very consistent record.
Diversification is frequently the death knell for a focused business. Yet
the cash thrown off by MAI's money broking machine has been invested in
industries from television to debt collection, and the company continues to
do well. MAI even has a property division, whose concentration on prime
locations and top-quality covenants was well-timed, making the investment a
quasi-financial asset and home for part of the company's cash pile. The
management has skilfully kept this collection of disparate plates spinning,
as the market has recognised in its rerating of the stock over the past
year.
Perhaps the unifying characteristic of the businesses is no more than that
MAI's management feels it understands them well. If so, then at least the
board is playing to its strengths. There are problems - the insurance
company Safeguard, for example, is being mauled by direct insurance sales,
and will find it hard to become competitive. But then, Meridian, which has
the southern ITV franchise, will move into profit soon. The company has
ambitions in media and value-added information services which pitch it
against stiff competition. Yet it still pursues opportunistic value
investments like Intrum Justitia. At some point, a limit to management
resources may force it to choose which path it wishes to tread. Fortunately,
that moment has yet to arrive.

<TEXT>
After more than Pounds 200m of rights issues since 1989, it comes as a
relief to discover that Morgan Crucible can finally generate some cash.
Since the Holt Lloyd car-care business is also suddenly making much larger
profits, it should turn out to be worth more than the Pounds 50m or so of
disposal proceeds previously pencilled in. Once it is sold, the rights issue
fears which have held the shares back should be a thing of the past.
That, at least, was yesterday's market reading. The danger is that, having
been down on the company for so long, sentiment will swing too far in the
other direction. That Morgan managed a Pounds 24m reduction in working
capital during a period when sales rose nearly 20 per cent suggests that
management tolerated a lax approach in the past. Other features of its
interim results suggest the business is being run with an eye to cash. The
more limited use of provisions, though, may simply reflect a dearth of new
acquisitions. Morgan's bad old habits could quickly re-assert themelves once
gearing pressures are lifted.
From this perspective, any sale of Holt Lloyd could turn out a mixed
blessing. Not only is it likely to be dilutive; without Holt Lloyd
underlying operating profits would not even have risen by 1 per cent. Since
trading conditions look set to remain lacklustre in Morgan's main markets,
the temptation may be to go for something flashy - and risky - in a new
activity or location. Once it has sold Holt Lloyd, Morgan Crucible must show
it can use its new freedom wisely.

FT  21 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK mortgage market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's building societies cannot be enjoying the recovery very much. Not
only are the clearing banks - and ironically Abbey National in particular -
taking an increasing share of new mortgage lending. They are also suffering
a remorseless deposit outflow as customers are lured away by unit trusts and
National Savings. After the ravages from the weak housing market, it is
tempting to conclude that the societies face an intensifying structural
decline.
Such a conclusion would be premature. The latest pressures reflect, above
all, the interest rate cycle. With the mortgage rate 2 percentage points
above base rates, banks, which can borrow freely in the wholesale markets,
can earn a handsome margin. That they devoted little effort to retaining
retail deposits as interest rates came down suggests their current behaviour
is more opportunistic than a systematic attempt to increase market share.
Presumably the banks would lose interest in mortgage lending if base rates
went up and their margins were eroded. That would also see a flow of savings
deposits return to the building societies. They can afford to wait: their
mutual status means they are not obliged to deliver constant growth. The
slight improvement in the housing market even seems to have slowed the
consolidation process down. Only three mergers have been completed this year
compared with five in 1992 and seven in 1991.

<TEXT>
On first reading, the omens for France's privatisation programme are
encouraging. The Paris equity market stands a shade below the new high
reached last month. Money markets are anticipating steady interest rate
cuts, albeit at a pace dictated by the Bundesbank. French companies appear
enthusiastic participants in alliances engineered by government, such as
Saint-Gobain and UAP in the case of BNP, the first on the block. Such
cross-holdings will ease the burden on the stock market.
But without a system of big funded pension schemes to support privatisation,
France must persuade its retail investors to switch savings out of money
market instruments into equities. Recently traffic has been in the opposite
direction. An appeal to patriotic sentiment helped make a success of the
Balladur bond, but that instrument was blessed with a healthy yield. It is
difficult to envisage large scale transfers into equities while money market
rates remain high. International investors might equally lose faith in
French equities if lower interest rates are not seen to be the main
ingredient of the policy mix.
True, the government has good reasons for not cutting rates while its
reserves are depleted, for fear of leaving the franc exposed. The natural
assumption is that recession and rising unemployment leave no alternative
but to cut rates as fast as the currency allows. The danger is that such an
assumption reflects a peculiarly Anglo-Saxon reading of the available
options. Yesterday's edict against public sector job cuts, like the revolt
against Blair House, underlines that there is more than one way to skin un
chat.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Japanese discount rate cut to low of 1.75%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S central bank cut its official discount rate early today by a
larger-than-expected 0.75 percentage points to a new low of 1.75 per cent in
an effort to stimulate the depressed economy.
Most analysts had expected the rate to be cut by 0.5 percentage points to 2
per cent.
The Tokyo stock market rallied after news of the rate cut, with the Nikkei
average climbing 250 points to 20,521 in early trading.
A central bank official said the cut 'should be appropriate to deal with the
current (depressed) state of the economy. It is a big cut, and we see this
as a decisive measure.'
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, said the cut would 'contribute
significantly to sustainable growth' in Japan in combination with other
government measures.
Domestic and international pressure for a cut in rates has been rising in
line with a stream of gloomy economic indicators.
Gross national product fell an annualised 2 per cent in the three months to
June and is probably still declining in the current quarter, putting Japan
into a 'double dip' recession.
The Bank of Japan last cut the discount rate - its key lending rate to
commercial banks - on February 4 from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
The latest cut, the seventh since July 1991, should relieve much of the
disappointment that met a government pump-priming package of deregulation,
measures to pass on the benefits of the high yen to consumers and Y6,150bn
(Pounds 38bn) of public spending announced last week.
It included neither a rate cut nor reductions in income tax, as demanded by
Japanese industry. Possible tax cuts, a politically divisive issue, are
being studied by a government panel.
The latest cut will have a psychological impact and help restrain the yen's
rise, but seems unlikely to bring a marked cut in companies' borrowing
costs.
Some businessmen and politicians had urged the central bank to take bold
action and cut the rate by as much as one percentage point to help ensure a
recovery.
Commercial banks are expected to drop their prime rates on October 1, in
line with previous practice.
However, a decreasing number of banks maintain a tight link between prime
and actual lending rates because of the pressure on margins from the need
for heavy bad debt provisions.

FT  21 SEP 93 / 'Nerve gas' chemical export allowed in spite of warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government approved the export of potentially lethal chemical products
to Egypt in 1986 in spite of intelligence information from the prime
minister's office that that country was being used as a diversionary route
for Iraq, a former foreign office minister said yesterday.
Mr Timothy Renton, foreign office minister from October 1985 to June 1987,
told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that three government departments - the
Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and
Industry - approved a 26-ton shipment of hydrogen fluoride in September
1986.
The chemical can be used in the military application of a type of nerve gas
being used at the time by the Iraqis within the country and against Iran.
Documents made available to the inquiry show that in January 1986 an
intelligence warning was circulated among ministers by Sir Charles Powell,
then foreign policy adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, warning that Egypt had
bought substantial quantities of the chemical on behalf of Iraq and was
planning to export more in the following months.
Mr Renton told the inquiry that he had dropped his initial opposition to the
export of the chemical because there had been no 'collateral' confirmation
of the intelligence information provided by the Israeli secret service.
He had given his final agreement on the understanding that the Egyptian
government would be told of the UK's concern that the chemicals might be
rerouted to Iraq and put to military use. Even then, the Foreign Office
delayed conveying its concerns so as not to upset Egypt as Mr Renton was
preparing an official visit to Cairo, the inquiry heard.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Renton had answered an initial list of
questions from the Scott inquiry in early June, saying he had no memory of
countries having been used as a diversionary route to Iraq.
He referred to the hydrogen fluoride licence after examining government
documents supplied to him by Lord Justice Scott.
Mr Renton yesterday confirmed that in February 1986 he had sided with Mr
Norman Lamont, then minister for defence procurement, in approving a
contract linking the government-owned company International Military
Services to an Iraqi complex subsequently used for testing missiles,
including French-made Exocets. Mr Lamont had written to Mr Renton stating
that the IMS 'cannot be interpreted as a real enhancement of the Iraqi war
effort'.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Building societies lose lending share to banks: Depositors
move funds to equity products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER EVIDENCE that building societies are facing their most severe
competition since the mid-1980s emerged yesterday in figures that showed a
squeeze on both mortgage lending and deposit-taking by the 88 societies.
Statistics released by the Building Societies Association and the British
Bankers' Association showed banks raising their share of mortgage lending -
largely through offering fixed-rate mortgages - at the expense of societies.
Societies are also suffering an outflow of retail funds, as depositors have
withdrawn money to invest in equity products such as personal equity plans,
as well as the sale of the third tranche of the government's British Telecom
stake.
The Building Societies Association said it expected investors to reinvest
with societies following the fall in the FT-SE 100 index from its recent
peak. It said bank competition for mortgages lending was also cyclical.
'There is a touch of concern, but no more than that,' said Mr Adrian Coles,
director-general of the association. Mr Coles said societies were facing the
strongest competition for mortgage lending from banks for at least three
years.
The continuing poor climate for retail deposit-taking could lead to renewed
pressure from societies to be allowed to raise more than 40 per cent of
funds from wholesale markets, the limit currently set by the 1986 Building
Societies Act.
New commitments from borrowers to taking mortgage loans from societies fell
to Pounds 2.4bn in August from Pounds 2.9bn in July. Banks showed a
continuing rise in mortgage lending in the same period, lending Pounds 902m
more following a Pounds 1bn rise in July.
Although lending by societies has recovered this year, with net new
commitments at Pounds 9.1bn in the second quarter compared with Pounds 5.9bn
in the last quarter of 1992, banks have competed strongly amid a lack of
other forms of loan demand.
Banks have been keen to lend because they can borrow money at close to 6 per
cent base rates, and lend it at a variable mortgage rate of 8 per cent.
Societies would have to cut their savings' rates in order to undercut this
mortgage rate.
There was a net outflow of Pounds 132m from society savings accounts in
August, following a Pounds 61m outflow in July and a Pounds 56m outflow in
June. Such outflows put more pressure on societies to fund lending from
capped wholesale funds.
Mr Coles said the outflow was 'not as large as might have been expected'
given the BT3 offer and competition from equity-based products.

FT  21 SEP 93 / German coalition seeks show of unity after protest vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday chaired a crisis meeting of leaders of
Germany's three coalition parties in an effort to paper over cracks in his
ruling alliance. The parties suffered a decisive vote of no confidence in
local elections in Hamburg on Sunday.
Both Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and the opposition Social
Democratic party, admitted that a big protest vote in Hamburg, in favour of
the Greens, two extreme rightwing parties and an anti-party alliance, was a
severe warning for the traditional political establishment.
The result was worse for Mr Kohl's CDU, with a slump in support from 35 per
cent in 1991 to 25 per cent on Sunday, in spite of a swing against the
ruling SPD government which saw it lose its overall majority in the city.
SPD support fell from 48 per cent to 40.4 per cent.
Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, warned that the splintering
of support for the main parties would undermine future coalition government,
making it increasingly difficult to form 'majorities capable of action'.
The main parties must tackle the fundamental causes of protest, he said,
including rising crime, unemployment, and the lack of cheap housing.
The meeting yesterday did produce agreement on a new social insurance plan
to pay for nursing care for the elderly. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister
and leader of the liberal Free Democratic party, which lost all its seats in
the Hamburg city parliament, promised that he would not allow the coalition
to collapse over the issue.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the SPD, said the continuing rise of the
extreme rightwing parties - although they failed to win any seats, they
gained a combined 7.6 per cent of the vote in Hamburg - was 'alarming'.
The Greens were the big winners in the city election, almost doubling their
vote from 7.1 to 13.5 per cent, followed by the Statt Partei - literally the
'Instead of a Party' - which won eight seats in the city parliament with 5.6
per cent of the vote, although it has no political platform.
The extreme rightwing parties, the Republicans and German People's Union
(DVU) split the far right vote, leaving neither with enough support to win
seats - to the universal relief of the main parties. The Republicans gained
4.8 per cent, just 1,430 votes short of the 5 per cent level required. All
the protest parties won a disproportionate amount of support from younger
voters, and again Mr Kohl's CDU performed particularly badly. In every age
group up to 45, the Greens polled better than the CDU, according to the
opinion research group Infas.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS GERMANY weathers the difficult aftermath of unity, the electorate's
behaviour is, hardly surprisingly, showing marked variations from the old
Federal Republic's general pattern of remarkably stable consensus politics.
Only around 75 per cent of west Germans would vote for either of the two
main parties, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and the
opposition Social Democrats, according to latest opinion polls. The approval
rating is even smaller among disgruntled east Germans, roughly 14 per cent
of whom, on the basis of latest surveys, support a return of the former
Communists.
The weekend election in the northern city of Hamburg provides further
evidence of the trend towards political fragmentation. Voters are unsettled
by the recession and the need for further cuts in living standards to
correct post-unification economic imbalances. Yet, after several years in
which the reputation both of Mr Kohl and of SPD leaders has been eroded,
large portions of the electorate believe neither large party can adequately
address Germany's problems.
The larger-than-expected collapse of Christian Democrat support to only 25
per cent of the Hamburg vote was accompanied by the loss of the SPD's
absolute majority. The result, profiting a collection of left- and
right-wing fringe parties, may set the tone for a further 19 regional and
national polls during the next 13 months, leading to the general election in
October 1994. A minor consolation for the political establishment was that
the far-right Republican party, which has sought to gain ground from concern
over immigration, narrowly failed to win the 5 per cent of votes in Hamburg
necessary for parliamentary representation.
The fission of the popular vote is likely to feed uncertainties in Bonn. Mr
Kohl's coalition with the liberal Free Democrats - who failed to pass the 5
per cent hurdle in Hamburg - is strained by differences on both economic and
foreign policy. The FDP's demands that German industry be spared extra
financing burdens from plans for nursing the elderly has led to a new
coalition rift. This has prompted fresh rumours that Mr Kohl is preparing
for a Grand Coalition next year with the SPD.
In crucial economic and industrial areas - concerning the budget,
privatisation, transport, nuclear energy and social security - Germany
requires bold initiatives to restructure an over-generous welfare system and
restore its competitive edge. As the parties gear up for a year of
electioneering, a strife-ridden political climate seems unlikely, however,
to deliver the more radical policies Germany needs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITY cordon thrown round a small area of London's financial district
to deter terrorist attacks appears to have achieved a degree of success. It
has been breached only once since the traffic restrictions were introduced
in July - and then by a small device which was safely defused. The predicted
traffic jams have not materialised. Walking through the less congested City
streets has become more pleasant. Crime has fallen and there has been no
armed robbery within the secure area.
The measures have been popular with businesses inside the cordon. The City
Corporation, the local authority for the area, has found overwhelming
support for making the traffic restrictions permanent. The Corporation
believes it has reassured many international businesses which might find
terrorist attacks sufficient reason to relocate to other European cities.
Yet the government is rightly unwilling to commit itself to making the
restrictions a permanent feature. Most businesses in London - including many
from overseas - remain outside the security cordon. Welcome though the
environmental benefits are, they are poor justification for a scheme that
may in the end simply displace the bombers' attention to other parts of the
capital.
More durable may be the approach adopted in other parts of London,
particularly around the government buildings in Whitehall. There, security
has been improved by heightened surveillance and parking restrictions.
Similar measures have also been introduced in the City at the same time as
the traffic restrictions, and would continue were the traffic restrictions
to be discontinued.
More, too, could be done to use the security systems of London's businesses
to reinforce the efforts of the police and security services. Video cameras
on business premises can deter terrorist attacks and help in finding those
who perpetrate them. Yet senior police officers say that they are often not
adequately maintained. Businesses could also do more to coordinate their
security measures with their neighbours to ensure comprehensive coverage.
Adjustments to the arrangements for providing insurance cover for terrorist
damage could play a part in heightening business awareness. Since the
commercial insurers withdrew from the market, the government has helped
create an insurance pool to which it acts as insurer of last resort.
However, the premium structure offers no incentives for businesses that take
precautions against terrorist attacks. Premium discounts for businesses that
adopt approved security measures would be a further step in the fight
against terrorism.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Tips from an old boy: A Treasury economist turned
industrialist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the UK government keen to step up discussions on policy issues with
industrialists, it is likely that before long a senior Treasury mandarin
will descend on a nondescript factory in rural Hampshire for a meeting with
an unusual Whitehall old boy.
Mr Tim Parker is chief executive of Kenwood, a maker of kitchen appliances
with a Pounds 120m-a-year turnover. A curly-haired and outgoing 38-year-old,
he is one of the few Treasury economists in the past 30 years to have gone
on to run a big manufacturing group.
In charge of Kenwood for the past seven years, Mr Parker has, during the
recession, kept his UK workforce stable at about 1,200, opened a factory in
China, revamped the product range and increased the company's pre-tax
profits to Pounds 9.6m in the year to March 31, up 4 per cent on the
previous year.
His career suggests he would have useful tips for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, and Treasury officials as they elicit more ideas from
manufacturers about economic policy. The department has launched Treasury
'away days' to factories and has set up a committee of industrialists to
discuss the economic outlook. The Treasury has also brought in Ms Wendy
Pritchard, a consultant who specialises in developing the management
cultures of big companies, to make senior officials more responsive to
outside views.
Frustration at the Treasury's inward-looking style was partly behind Mr
Parker's decision to leave Whitehall in 1979, after two years as a junior
economist. He sought a job in industry 'leading from the front' - a move
that has paid off financially. As well as owning some Pounds 2.5m worth of
Kenwood shares, Mr Parker's Pounds 160,000 salary is roughly 50 per cent
more than that of Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary.
After studying for an MSc at the London Business School - where he was
taught both by Sir Terry and the Treasury's current chief economic adviser
Mr Alan Budd, both former LBS academics - Mr Parker joined the electricals
group Thorn EMI as a trainee manager. In 1986 he took over the top job at
Kenwood, then a Thorn subsidiary. Three years later Mr Parker was among nine
managers who bought the company from Thorn for Pounds 57m in a management
buyout largely financed by banks. Last year the company was floated on the
stock market, valued at Pounds 97m.
Based on his experience in the real economy, Mr Parker thinks the government
should concentrate on boosting manufacturing, if necessary by letting
sterling's exchange rate continue the downward path it has followed since
Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago. With
manufacturers benefiting from a large boost to competitiveness resulting
from the lower pound, he reckons the sector has a 'golden opportunity' to
expand. Also helping manufacturers, he says, are low labour costs and a
'battle-hardened' cadre of executives who have fought their way through the
recession.
Mr Parker says this view does not amount to special pleading from a
manufacturer. 'We have to play this game with deadly seriousness,' he says.
'If we don't expand manufacturing industry we won't be doing enough to help
create wealth in the future and cut the government deficit.'
He also downplays inflation as a problem for the UK. Policymakers should not
ignore inflationary pressures, he says, but underlying price pressures are
much lower than in the 1980s because of changes in labour markets linked to
lower union membership and decentralised pay bargaining. Labour costs are
under control at Kenwood, Mr Parker says; the last pay agreement, for the
year starting in April, imposed a wage rise for all employees of 2.5 per
cent, well under the 5 per cent average rise in manufacturing earnings
across the UK in the year to July.
In spite of his practical knowledge, Mr Parker has had few contacts with his
old department since he left. But one Treasury official says that with its
more outgoing approach it might fix a meeting soon. As a long shot, Mr
Parker could even be appointed industrial adviser to Mr Clarke - a post the
Treasury has been trying to fill for several months.
Though Mr Parker says he has his hands full at Kenwood and the Treasury job
has a salary only about a quarter of his current pay, he says the job would
be 'attractive'.
One way around the earnings problem, he says, would be for the department to
increase the salary, finding the money by sacking other employees: 'It's the
kind of approach the private sector would take, and possibly an example of
how the Treasury has something to learn from the outside world.'

FT  21 SEP 93 / Radical surgery to restore health: Capacity cuts are needed
to rescue the EC steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER, ANDREW HILL and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European steelmakers, politicians and bureaucrats are closer than ever to
casting a gleaming rescue plan for the EC industry out of the pleas and
promises submitted by producers over the past year.
But September 30, the date set by the European Commission for receiving
offers of capacity cuts totalling some 30m tonnes of annual output, will
pass without a final decision on the overall package.
It is almost a year since the crisis in the European steel market - a result
of low prices, overcapacity, and recession in customer industries - forced
producers to seek financial and political help from the Commission.
The result, early this year, was a series of planned measures, including
capacity cuts, designed to help raise prices, return the industry to
financial health, and prevent further bankruptcies among private producers.
But the Commission's sensitive negotiations with the Spanish, Italian and
German authorities, aimed at limiting subsidies to the main state-owned
steel producers, are at least two months behind schedule.
The question is: can the Commission's original ambitious plan to support the
EC industry survive such a delay, or will it collapse in recriminations?
In spite of the delay, Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, and
Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, will go into today's meeting of
EC industry ministers in Brussels more optimistic than at any time since the
crisis arose.
Most of their delicate plan is already in place. Steps have already been
taken, or proposed, to help protect the EC industry from cheap non-EC
imports; to monitor the steel market and forecast demand; and to set up a
fund through which producers in certain sectors of the market will finance
the closure costs of those in the same sector which cut capacity.
EC officials believe producers are now moving in the right direction, and
most will be ready with a package of voluntary capacity cuts by a week
tomorrow.
But the commissioners know that the producers' paper commitments will not be
implemented if ministers do not act to limit state aid. Without restrictions
on subsidies, private-sector steelmakers, many of which underwent painful
restructuring in the late 1980s, will refuse to carry out the reductions in
capacity on which the success of the plan depends.
The main reason why some ministers have been slow to tackle state subsidies
is that the gains for the whole industry are outweighed by the domestic
political pain of job losses, often in regions already hit hard by
recession.
So reluctance by the Commission to push the ministers to a decision by
tabling formal proposals is understandable. Decisions on state aid require
unanimous approval by member states, and a veto by any single minister could
accelerate the crisis. That is why there will be no vote at today's meeting
on the three biggest state aid cases.
Instead, the Commission is likely to wait until the next scheduled meeting
of industry ministers in November to propose a formal solution to the state
aid dilemma, giving itself a further two months to cajole Bonn, Madrid and
Rome into an acceptable deal.
But the Commission still hopes ministers will make progress at today's
meeting, by beginning to suggest a balanced compromise between state aid and
capacity cuts.
'The key question is: can the whole thing be finalised at the November
council? That's only possible if this council isn't just a talking shop, but
a critical session about how to settle the three aid cases,' says one senior
Commission official.
The Commission is taking a risk, but it knows that while postponement will
create difficulties for many private-sector producers, outright failure
would be a disaster.
The Community's steel industry is estimated to have lost more than Pounds
3bn last year, and could be facing similar losses this year - prices may
have recouped some of the falls since 1990 but remain depressed. Continental
European markets have worsened this year, with demand in Germany, which
accounts for about a third of European consumption, still falling.
Private-sector producers warn that the present trend will result in further
bankruptcies, following the collapse of Saarstahl in Germany this summer.
They worry that state-subsidised steelmakers are simply hanging on and
waiting for market conditions to pick up.
According to British Steel, a further strengthening of prices generally is
urgently required by even the most efficient producers. In Germany, Thyssen
warns that failure to reach agreement on subsidies means continued heavy
losses for the industry. 'Finally, this might lead to a situation where
private companies will no longer survive in the steel market,' it says.
Under the restructuring plan, the industry's effective capacity, excluding
mothballed plant, will drop to 130m-140m tonnes annually, leaving enough
slack to encompass any potential upturn. With a slimmer production base, the
need to sell steel at suicidal prices simply to cover heavy fixed costs is
reduced.
The longer the industry has to wait for restructuring to be implemented, the
longer the market remains distorted by allegedly unfair competition. For
example, the Commission estimates that debt at Ilva, Italy's state-owned
producer, will rise from L10,250bn (Pounds 4.2bn) at June 30 to L10,720bn by
the end of the year. This amount would be unsustainable without state
support, according to Brussels.
While the Commission is still wrestling with Italy, after a summer of hard
negotiation it has published the outline of a deal with the Spanish
authorities, which should receive the unofficial backing of ministers today.
The Spanish intend to find private funding for the building of a mini-mill
in the sensitive Basque region, and will bring forward by 18 months the
closure of some 2.3m tonnes of capacity at Anzio, also in the Basque
country.
Privatisation is emerging as a crucial element in the attempt by national
governments to win the Commission's support for restructuring state
industries. Ilva is submitting a new restructuring plan - the latest of
several - which is based on privatisation, while Brussels is insisting that
any new capacity to be built at Ekostahl, east Germany, should be financed
mainly with private cash.
There are still many hurdles to overcome, however. Most important, the
Commission knows that if private investment is used as a cover for public
funding, the Community's hard-liners - British Steel and the private German
producers - will queue up to denounce Brussels for going soft on subsidies.
The British government, for one, is openly suspicious about the possibility
of public support 'through the back door', and private steelmakers are
already sharpening their invective. Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the
German steel federation, last week warned the Commission against
'window-dressing' solutions to the problem.
And Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, has said
that, if the subsidies issue is 'fudged', the UK producer might not pay its
share of the proposed EC-backed levy scheme to pay for the capacity cuts.
Some even see the subsidies issue as having implications that go beyond the
steel industry. 'If the Community cannot sort out the subsidy issue, then
you would have to question what it is for,' says Mr David Rea, director of
the British Iron and Steel Producers Association.
The alternative to agreement is certainly unpalatable. If the steel industry
goes into 1994 without any deal on subsidies, there is a risk that
state-controlled producers, which still account for about half Europe's
production, could sit tight and wait for private companies to collapse.
That explains why the private-sector German producers, with their high
labour costs and depressed domestic market, are nervous about the slow
progress of the restructuring plan. They are hoping for a clear sign today
that a solution will soon be cast in iron.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Social market, Polish style
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST sight, the result of Poland's election on Sunday looks like a step
back to the future. In reality, by endorsing the two parties that ruled
Poland for four decades of communism - one of them working under a new name,
both with new policies - the electorate is not seeking the return of the old
command economy. It is registering its desire to see market reforms tempered
with greater attention to the problems they have inflicted on disadvantaged
members of society, from public sector workers to old age pensioners. The
consequence may be some slowing of the pace of change, but no real change in
direction. With luck, Poland may even enjoy something it has not seen
despite the momentous and largely positive developments since the demise of
communism: a period of political stability in which the government can take
a medium- to long-term view of the economy rather than having to indulge in
crisis management.
In one sense, these may seem foolishly bold pronouncements. The totalitarian
past is so recent and Poland's position in the vanguard of economic and
political reform so pivotal that any hint of a resurgence by the old
nomenklatura might be expected to send shivers of apprehension through
western and eastern Europe. The fact that such shivers were noticeably
absent yesterday speaks eloquently about the scale of change that has
already taken place. For one thing, the economy is in unrecognisably better
shape than four years ago, with industrial production rising, the private
sector now accounting for well over half of economic activity, and foreign
investment making important inroads. For another, Polish politics appears to
be maturing. Under the new electoral law that governed Sunday's poll, the
number of parties represented in the Sejm (parliament) has been slashed from
29 to six. Most took care to explain their distinctive policy platforms, and
although Polish voters have arguably endured too many elections in recent
years, more of them than on some previous occasions turned out to exercise
their choice. The result seems likely to be peaceful alternance in
government of just the kind that parliamentary democracy was designed to
achieve.
Much now depends on the negotiations between parties to form a new coalition
but here, too, the signs are not discouraging. The man at the centre of
these talks - Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the ex-communist
Democratic Left Alliance - has repeatedly stressed his desire to press ahead
with market reforms. Assuming he can keep hardline colleagues in check, he
seems bent on establishing a broad-based coalition with a solid
parliamentary majority, preferably including the centrist Democratic Union
that led the outgoing government. Such a coalition would have a strong
chance of surviving for a full four-year term and of governing without the
interventions from President Lech Walesa that destabilised its predecessors.
A government of this stripe will want to modify economic policy as the
voters have asked. In boosting social spending and public sector wages, it
may push up the budget deficit, fuel inflation and dampen economic growth.
Poland's relationship with the IMF and World Bank could suffer turbulence as
a result. But a new government will also be aware that its members' desire
for reform and economic integration with western Europe imposes strict
limits on their room for manoeuvre. It will be for Poles to decide how
strict those limits should be.

Nice to see Britain's armed forces boosting their clientele bases. For,
having honed their own expertise in shedding personnel over the past two
years, they are now being retained to help the Russians deal with the
effects of doing the very same.
Under an agreement signed yesterday in Moscow by defence secretary Malcolm
Rifkind, Russians will receive lessons in how to set up redundant officers
happily in Civvy Street.
So, after many years teaching citizens of developing countries how to fight
communism, Britain will now be training post-Soviet Russians how to be
civilians.

Gone are the days of shyness and embarrassed silences in diplomatic company
whenever Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, takes the
microphone.
Honouring Michael Perry, Unilever's chairman, for his services to trade,
Hosokawa pointed out that it was another Perry, Commodore Matthew Perry, who
had arrived from the US with four black warships to 'force us' to open
markets in 1853.
But times and personalities have changed, Hosokawa implied; Unilever's Perry
had come to Japan armed only with a 'mild shampoo'.
Later on, Hosokawa played host at a press conference in the back garden of
the prime ministerial residence; he smiled sympathetically as John Major,
the British prime minister, was asked to comment on a famous Hosokawa saying
that a party becomes easily corrupted if it is in government for more than
10 years.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Observer: Soros, the hero
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just to mark the anniversary of White or Black Wednesday, George Soros is
once again putting the boot into the British government.
Writing on Bosnia and Beyond in the latest New York Review of Books, the
terminator of Britain's ERM membership lashes the west as a whole but
singles out Britain in particular.
'The British government has played a particularly insidious role,' he says.
'Having a peace-keeping force on the ground, it used the safety of its
troops as an argument for dissuading the United States from using air power
on the rare occasions when it was ready to do so. The fact is that British
troops are nowhere stationed in locations where they could be directly
threatened by the Serbs. They are exposed to the Croats and Moslems. Only
when they are escorting convoys do they come into contact with the Serbs and
they have done very little of that lately. Therefore the British argument
has been merely an excuse for inaction.'
In Soros' account only one person appears to emerge with any credit:
himself. 'My foundation provided fuel to Sarajevo during the winter,
repaired and extended the gas lines, helped restore the bakery, and provided
seeds for planting,' he writes. 'The only clean water available in Sarajevo
today has been installed and maintained by my foundation.'

Former chief government whip Timothy Renton mucks around in boats in his
spare time, according to his Who's Who entry, so it is perhaps no surprise
that he should appear at ease yesterday fielding questions about sundry
vessels in front of the Scott inquiry.
When at the foreign office in the mid-1980s, Renton fought a spirited battle
with the DTI and the Ministry of Defence to prevent export licences being
granted for inflatable dinghies bound for Iran, when similar craft were
already being sent to Iraq. According to Renton yesterday, what took up a
great deal of Whitehall time was arguments over whether a boat of
approximately 20 ft in length could be construed as having military
applications.
Whatever the judge thought of Renton's performance, the loyalty of one
member of the public was assured.
The souvenir-hunting Mrs Renton was heard to ask assembled TV artists
whether they might make available to her their drawings of the event.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Observer: Ofgas kept guessing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Combative gas regulator Sir James McKinnon continues to create plenty of hot
air, this time caused by speculation as to the identity of his successor
when he bows out at the end of next month.
With the Department of Trade and Industry expected finally to make its
decision any time now, one relatively unfamiliar name that just keeps
cropping up is that of ex-Treasury official Clare Spottiswoode.
After leaving the civil service, she sold the enterprise she had started at
boarding school - importing silks and cottons from Taiwan - before setting
up in business in 1984 with her sister Alison to found software house
Spottiswoode &amp; Spottiswoode. That was sold after four years to computer
services company Sapphire International, although she continued to run it
for a while.
Not the most obvious preparation for regulating the gas industry, one may
say, but she does have that hands-on business savvy that the DTI has
increasingly favoured in top watch-dog posts. More tellingly, she has
recently been heard asking some penetrating questions concerning the
intricacies of privatised utility regulation - at a pretty high level.
If she gets the post, Spottiswoode will be the first woman to head a utility
regulator, though not the first to be considered. Penny Boys, deputy
director general of Offer, was in the running for Ofgas chief but has just
accepted a post back at the DTI as head of personnel.
Meanwhile, Sally Hunt, a utilities consultant at Nera, the economic research
group, was a candidate to head Oftel - and may, of course, be a challenger
for Ofgas too.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Iron triangle softens image: The Keidanren, or main business
grouping, is adapting to changes in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's six-week coalition government is proving fragile and fractious under
the leadership of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. But one constant source
of influence at the centre of power, even though the long-ruling Liberal
Democratic party was ousted this summer, is the business leader who met Mr
John Major on his visit to Tokyo yesterday.
At the Akasaka Palace, the government's guest house, the British premier and
a delegation of UK industrialists held talks with Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the
78-year-old chairman of the Keidanren, the country's main business grouping.
They put the case for the further opening of Japanese markets, from whisky
to fund management.
Mr Hiraiwa was noncommittal. But one particular form of fund management, in
which the Keidanren has for decades been involved, is unlikely to have been
raised by Mr Major. Mr Hiraiwa last month said the organisation would no
longer act as a conduit for business donations to Japanese political
parties.
The Keidanren, the Japan federation of economic organisations, helped found
the Liberal Democratic party in 1955 and provided it with some Y13bn a year
in funds from its 900-plus members. But less than a week into the life of
the new seven-party administration, Mr Hiraiwa let it be known that this
practice would cease. Ten days later Mr Hosokawa appointed him to head an
advisory panel seeking ways to streamline Japan's administrative system.
Not only were links with the new government cemented, but the appointment of
Mr Hiraiwa to the panel allows the Keidanren to promote deregulation of the
economy, which it has long sought and which Mr Hosokawa has made a main
government priority along with political reform.
The cut-off in funds illustrates the ability of the Keidanren, written off
on several occasions as a relic which speaks for shipbuilders and
steelmakers, to defy its slow-moving image and adapt to changed realities.
Before it lost the election in July, the relationship between the LDP and
Keidanren was a strong element in the bond uniting the interests of
government, industry and the bureaucracy which delivered Japan much of its
post-war economic success. This so-called 'iron triangle' became, however,
so tarnished by corruption scandals that it was the main reason the LDP was
ousted.
The federation's money represented a tenth of the LDP's total income and
influenced companies to give even more. Mr Kazuo Nukazawa, Keidanren
managing director, maintains that this money was the most acceptable,
because it went openly to LDP central funds rather than through a back door
to individual Diet (parliament) members or factions.
'The basic character of the government has not changed,' says Mr Nukazawa.
'It equals the LDP minus corruption.' He adds that LDP politicians 'will
have to live a frugal life. They will have to bring sandwiches to a lunch
meeting. That is good for their health.'
In spite of such stern prescriptions, the ever-careful business organisation
has left itself a get-out clause in case the LDP regains power. Individual
member companies can maintain any direct funding they wish, the Keidanren
says, and a small number have indicated that they will do so. It may in the
future give guidance on the party or parties on which its members might wish
to bestow any largesse.
'Guidance' - a signal of what is acceptable, or indeed expected - from the
Keidanren is taken no less seriously by industry than a similar nudge from a
ministry. Japanese companies generally respect conformity and 'mutual
emulation is very strong', says Prof Haruo Shimada of the school of
economics at Keio University, Tokyo.
This emulation applies, for a start, among the country's various business
groupings themselves. Before acting on political funds, Mr Hiraiwa heard
noises of discontent with the existing order. The complaints came from the
more junior Nikkeiren employers' federation, which usually concerns itself
with labour relations, and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which
represents 1.5m mainly small companies. But they waited for a lead from the
Keidanren before their members could stop payments. As Prof Shimada puts it,
before Mr Hiraiwa spoke out on the issue, he 'pretended he was at the tail
of this procession, then he decided he could say what should happen'.
While doing this, Mr Hiraiwa was falling into step with the new government
in other ways. Mr Hosokawa, in trying to stimulate depressed domestic
demand, is making it clear that consumers rather than the LDP's
long-cultivated producers should be the main beneficiaries from the
favourable effect of the stronger yen on import prices.
Through all the years in which the Keidanren proclaimed the LDP the party of
free enterprise, its members benefited from the party's bias towards the
producer. Only the farmers' lobby, in blocking rice imports while selling
the populace its staple food for five times world prices, has carried clout
comparable with the Keidanren.
First to respond to Mr Hosokawa's message of putting the consumer first were
the electric utilities, offering modest but trend-setting rebates on
customer bills in acknowledgement of the benefits of cheaper imported
energy. Although he played no overt role, Mr Hiraiwa is likely to have been
active behind the scenes as the chairman of Tokyo Electric Power, Japan's
and the world's largest private sector supplier of electricity.
The Keidanren excels not so much at radical innovation as at hauling itself
on to bandwagons and giving them momentum. The federation has long lobbied
for privatisation and claims credit for the state asset sales of the LDP's
last decade - these continue this month with the sell-off of the first part
of the Japan Railways network.
Mr Andrew Lawson, head of the east and south Asia department at the
Confederation of British Industry, says that, while the Keidanren is good at
putting together alliances to meet a sudden turn in events, such as a large
bankruptcy, it often merely 'espouses fashionable virtues', such as the
environment.
The two main areas where resources within the organisation's 200-strong
staff are being increased are environmental affairs, where it is seeking,
for example, to help China control industrial effluents, and the
harmonisation of competition policy with the west. Each can be viewed as
ironic for a body which, with some success, spent much of the 1970s
resisting legislation on pollution controls in Japan, and in the early 1980s
acted to curb anti-monopoly requirements.
As the Keidanren adjusts its image to fit Japan's more consumer-conscious
government, LDP leaders are left checking the price of their sandwiches.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Flexibility is key to restoration of
EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Eichengreen and Charles Wyplosz are surely right to argue
(Personal View, September 17) that the ERM has now become so permissive as
to cast doubt on the feasibility of completing the single market. But their
diagnosis of the flaws is unconvincing.
In 1992-93 the European authorities stubbornly defended exchange rates that
had become seriously misaligned to a point where credibility was totally
undermined once the defences were overwhelmed, and refused to acknowledge
that German unification meant that the rest of Europe needed markedly lower
interest rates than Germany.
Do Eichengreen and Wyplosz really believe that the ERM could have survived
had it been exposed to such pressures prior to the abolition of capital
controls? Are they really claiming that the imposition of deposit
requirements for institutions with open foreign exchange positions would
permit the parities of exchange rates pegged at levels that impose such
strains to survive?
The key to restoring the EMS is not to play at restoring capital controls,
but to resolve once and for all that rates will be pegged at levels that
make sense in the light of the fundamentals and that are promptly changed to
reflect changes in the fundamentals. For the moment that means keeping the
wide band for the D-Mark, because of the need to allow Germany to keep
relatively high interest rates, but there is no reason to delay restoring
relatively narrow bands among all the other currencies (including the pound
and the lira). If that would mean that for the time being the D-Mark would
no longer be at the centre of the ERM, so be it.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No better place to find an answer
than in the late 1960s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN YATES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was with some sadness that I read Malcolm Rutherford's review ('Hair
is wearing thin', September 15).
While it must inevitably be true that the revival of a show which captured a
particular mood a quarter of a century ago should now appear dated, it is
surely misguided for Mr Rutherford to be so casually dismissive of the
culture and values of the late 1960s that Hair so clearly represented.
While I agree with Mr Rutherford that 'the mood now is one of not being
quite sure where to look', surely there can be no better place to find the
answer than in the late 1960s during which a whole generation questioned the
established order of things and craved for a better way of life.
Again, I agree with Mr Rutherford that the fashion has changed: we live in
an age which is more competitive, more stressful, more apathetic, more
materialistic, more violent. In contrast the mood of the late 1960s was one
of peace, love, freedom, self-fulfilment.
It does not surprise me that Mr Rutherford feels it is time to bring back
'Guys and Dolls' as I am sure this would be a more suitable show for him to
enjoy and review favourably.
It is equally clear that he has never had much in common with the hippies
that are a part of Hair.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Renewable energy industry makes sense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The report by Bronwen Maddox ('Answers in the wind', September 15)
points clearly to the two reasons for focusing attention on renewable forms
of energy. Fossil and nuclear fuels are finite and, as we use them up, we
may cause pollution and significant climate change.
Ignoring the environmental issues, we shall find that when stocks of
conventional fuel have shrunk, the market will set an appropriate price for
them and energy management will be taken up enthusiastically. Long before
the time when the potential of energy management is exhausted, alternative
energy sources will no longer be perceived as expensive.
But it is risky to ignore the environmental issues. If we are convinced that
global warming is going to bring the tides to inland doorsteps and that man
is capable of influencing climatic change of that magnitude, then we are
bound to try to exercise that influence.
That is why it makes sense to produce some of our electricity from renewable
energy now, by supporting the best schemes and giving them the experience of
operating in a commercial climate.
Then we shall have an established renewable energy industry capable of
increasing its production when it has to.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Time for long trousers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the week in which Mr Paddy Ashdown must grow up, put on the long
trousers of politics, even, if you follow me, select an appropriate jacket
and tie. At pres-ent he is leader of - I speak metaphorically, you
understand - the short-trousered philanthropists of British politics. The
Liberal Democrats are doing well, but even the most sanguine among them
confess that they are not a coherent national political force. They
represent a collection of local committees, each tailoring its appeal to
what will win votes on this particular pavement or that, each voicing the
parish outrage of the moment.
Street corner opportunism can blow up in the participants' faces, as the
publication of racialist propaganda by Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets
has demonstrated. The perpetrators should be drummed out of politics. The
party leaders, who cannot have been wholly unaware of what was going on,
should be ashamed. The way they are expressing their anger now suggests that
they are. Yet populism can be effective, and legitimate. Here in Torquay it
has produced the most well-attended third-party conference since the high
days of the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance in the early 1980s. It has
badly frightened the government. The Liberal Democrat victories at
Christchurch and Newbury may yet bring down the prime minister.
No one in Torquay believes that would be good enough. More is required if Mr
Ashdown and his colleagues are to become the heirs of Asquith and Lloyd
George. The what? The Lib Dem leader confessed at the weekend that, like any
other ambitious politician, he hopes to be prime minister one day. The
probability that he will achieve that at the next election is low. I would
have said something about a snowball's chances, but Mr Ashdown might demur.
He is the sort of chap who reflects on the capacity of history to surprise
us. Over the past few years it has. The Berlin Wall is down. The Soviet
Union has vanished. Israel and the PLO have signed a peace agreement. Which
do you find easier to believe? All of the above, or the Liberal Democrats
sweeping the country sometime between now and 1996?
The realistic view, as expressed in relaxed conversations by some of the
principals at the party's conference, is more mundane. It is that the best
that can be hoped for is the capture of, say, a further 15 seats from the
Tories. That would put the trailing opposition party at 35-40 members of
parliament. Let us give Mr Ashdown that. Go on. Assume, just for the sake of
argument, that the Conservatives do not recover the protest vote that
currently threatens them. We would then reach a shortlist of two
possibilities, familiar to those who followed the election of April 1992.
Labour would either govern on its own on the basis of a very small majority,
or depend on, say, 35 Liberal Democratic MPs.
Either way, it would make little difference to the governance of Britain.
The Liberal Democrats would grasp the opportunities open to them in a hung
parliament with the eagerness with which they have grabbed the anti-Tory
protest vote. They could do so with a clear conscience. Take their new value
statement, Facing up to the Future, which was debated yesterday. It might as
well have been published by Labour's modernisers. The emphasis on free
markets in the Lib Dems' earlier statements has been softened, by putting
capitalism in the context of regulation and community values. The old
Euro-federalist enthusiasm has been tempered by a new realisation that this
does not sell under every British lamp-post.
The two parties are close enough on constitutional reform for it to be a
fair bet that in either of the two realistic scenarios - a Labour majority
administration, or one dependent on Lib Dem support - there would be early
legislation on a Scottish assembly, and a referendum on proportional
representation. Labour policies on Europe, trade union law, education,
health, and other bread-and-butter issues would sail through. Both parties
support active government; as to taxation it is the Liberal Democrats who
have hit on the possibly useful wheezes of hypothecating imposts, such as a
penny on income tax for education, or moving from taxes on earnings to taxes
on energy. With the latter, you get cash to spend and the green vote thrown
in for free.
In short, the Lib Dems propose next to nothing that would upset the
programme of a Labour government under Mr John Smith. This is probably
welcome news to members of the Liberal Democratic party, who are typically
graduates with salaried jobs, many in the public sector. The results of a
sample survey, presented at the weekend by John Curtice of Strathclyde
University, suggests that while most Lib Dems are middle-class, more than
half support a coalition with Labour. The differences between the parties
are cultural, not matters of policy. Torquay wholly rejects the idea of Mr
Paddy Ashdown and his backbenchers propping up a future Tory government.
This is not to say that life under Labour would be the same if there were no
third party. We have heard much about the effect on the Conservatives of the
persistent strengthening of the Liberal Democrats. What of the effect on
Labour? In the medium term it should strengthen the case for modernising,
for dissociating Labour from relics of its past, such as its dependence on
trade unions, or its hankering after a non-competitive world. This is
essential if either party's dreams are to come true: southern voters will
reject Liberal Democrats if they fear an unmodernised Labour party. Despised
rival or potential partner, the third party is a player in the same centrist
market for votes. It cannot be ignored.
Mr Ashdown may therefore be propelled by events into a greater domestic
political game than that played by his post-1945 Liberal party predecessors,
or by the SDP 'gang of four', Lords Jenkins and Owen and Lady Williams
included. The question is, is he up to it? He has come a long way since he
took over the remnants of the old SDP and Liberals in 1989. He deserves
credit for the success of the new enterprise, although Mr John Major has
probably done more for the Liberal Democrats than anyone else. Mr Ashdown
must now move from being the pied piper of pavement politics to leadership
of a serious party of consistent purpose. He will be watched.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A different view of the purpose of
work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID MARTIN MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Brown, of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce
(Letters, September 8), claims that the Social Chapter amounts to
'shackles'. That says it all. It is typical of a representative of British
commerce to portray the social wage as a 'handicap'. This illustrates why we
will never be at the heart of Europe as long as that view prevails among
commerce and government in the UK.
The letter also illustrates the difference between the left and right in
Europe and the right in the UK. Everybody else believes the purpose of work
and commerce and, indeed, civilisation is to improve the working, living,
social and cultural conditions of the people generally. Mr Brown presumably
believes the sole purpose of commerce is to make the rich richer and the
poor poorer.
I would fully endorse European Commissioner Padraig Flynn's concept of a
World Social Chapter. Indeed, I believe it is essential unless free trade is
to result in beggar-my-neighbour policies on a world scale which will
deprive the workers of the Pacific Rim of any improvements while removing
the hard-won gains from our people.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Andrew Holmes - insight into world of
energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr KIM HOWELLS MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing on behalf of all of Andrew Holmes's friends and admirers,
both inside and outside of parliament, who benefited so enormously from his
unrivalled insight and breadth of knowledge of the world of electricity,
politics and commerce. Not once, even during his busiest moments, did Andrew
deny any of us access to information and intelligence central to our
understanding of the enormous changes being witnessed over the past decade
in the energy industries. He reinforced our trust in and affection for the
FT's specialist energy publications.
His death (Obituary: 'Trenchant analyst of energy', September 14) at the age
of 36 is a cruel blow, not only to his wife Claire and to his children,
Lottie and Jack, but to all who counted him as a friend, an adviser and,
quite simply, as one hell of a good bloke.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Free trade will benefit steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If the Inland Revenue is buying steelwork from Poland, this is not
against British interests, except in the very short run (Letters: 'Steel
subsidised at high cost to UK', September 16).
I run a company which represents British and American producers of auto-ID
equipment in Poland, and we are bidding for a contract from the Katowice
steel mill which will help raise productivity and cut costs. Such sales
depend on relatively free trade.
Protectionism against efficient, low-cost Polish producers is short-sighted,
because it threatens the expansion of trade through which incomes will rise,
east and west. If free trade is allowed, Poland will export more to western
Europe, and be a larger market for the useful and competitive things that
western Europe has to offer.
Let consumers decide which goods and services meet their needs, and not
leave it up to bureaucrats.

Tonight's funniest programme may well be Whicker's World (10.40 ITV).
Whicker is once again in South Africa, at a new 'pleasure park' called Lost
City which, we are told, cost Pounds 150m to create. Whicker's dry, stylised
and highly professional manner of reporting is very entertaining.
Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer have taken their long stick and their big paper
bag and hopped across from Channel 4 to BBC2 where they begin The Smell Of
Reeves And Mortimer (9.00). The BBC describes their comedy as 'surreal', a
word which applies to Samuel Beckett and Spike Milligan but not quite
appropriately to Reeves. It would be pleasant to enthuse over Brighton
Belles, a British version of 'The Golden Girls', but as yet unlikely. The
series may still come right, but so far the funniest thing is the
desperation with which the producers are manipulating the volume slides for
the laughter track (8.30 ITV).
C4 shows the third and last of its documentaries about DW Griffith: Father
Of Film and tries to explain why the great pioneer worked so little for the
last 17 years of his life (9.00).

FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: 'Forger' plea for Plymouth - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arts Council is now considering cutting its entire grant to the Theatre
Royal, Plymouth unless a response from the Plymouth region can persuade it
otherwise by September 22. The theatre has already coordinated a campaign of
90,000 signatures and 6,000 letters. The quality of recent performances and
the quantity of local response should allow the Council to vote a reprieve
without losing face.
The Theatre Royal's most recent play, Master Forger (in repertory until 25
September) starts an autumn season which tables the dependable Les Liaisons
Dangereuses alongside the innovative The Doctor and the Devils, a play by
Dylan Thomas about Burke and Hare. The Theatre Royal's Drum Theatre offers a
line in modern classics and midwinter pantomime. The balanced programme and
sensible scheduling includes visits from the Welsh National Opera,
Glyndebourne Touring, London Contemporary Dance Theatre and The Birmingham
Royal ballet. This breadth makes Plymouth a valuable resource for dance,
opera and theatre in the South West.
Master Forger is a fine new play by Hugh Janes based on the life of the
artist Tom Keating (1917-1984). Keating became famous in 1976 for forging
Samuel Palmer's paintings. But he also forged over 2,000 others. These
'Sexton Blakes', slang for 'fakes', as he called them, included Degas, Goya,
Modigliani, Rembrandt, Sisley, Van Gogh and Vuillard. But he was best at JMW
Turner, another consummate professional who was capable in a visit to Venice
of turning out 300 sketches in three days.
In 1977 Keating was charged with conspiracy and fraud in relation to sale of
paintings, and early in 1979 the trial, which The Observer described as 'the
best free show in town' began. Charges against Keating were dropped before
the spring. Inside five years, he was a national hero, advising on TV and
venting his anger against an art establishment which used money alone to
value art.
The play, directed by Roger Redfarn, sticks to the surface of Keating's
colourful life like the formaldehyde-varnish he used for ageing paintings.
Roy Marsden as the bohemian cockney delivers a fine performance which shows
how the artist was in some sense possessed by the Old Masters, and how his
promiscuous reading emerged as a series of lectures in court: 'The only
thing that amazes me is that I wasn't exposed in the press a lot sooner.'
Marsden's voice is superb, ringing around the revolving set, pleading with
the audience, imparting information or directing models.
Fakes are the way forward. Umberto Eco's Faith in Fakes has a scene where a
California sculpture garden shows the Venus de Milo with both arms. Maybe
now she can write to Arts Council on behalf of Plymouth.
Master Forger in repertory until September 25 (0752 267222)

FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: New WNO 'Lucia' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh from its success at the Edinburgh Festival, Welsh National Opera is
keen not to let the impetus flag. As the season gets underway at the New
Theatre in Cardiff, the company has announced the commission of a new opera
from Peter Maxwell Davies called The Doctors of Myddfai - a mythical Welsh
tale about a mystery illness and unearthly medical secrets, to be seen in
1996.
For the time being more mundane matters are at hand. It is not long since
WNO last put on Lucia di Lammermoor, although a Donizetti evening in which
the most notable protagonist is the conductor can hardly be regarded an
unqualified success. Thinking back to the company's days in the front line
of modernist production styles, one might have assumed that a second try in
so short a period was to invite a controversial producer to deliver the
full-frontal assault missed last time.
Not so: lovers of bel canto can come out of their bunkers. This new
production is virtually non-existent; the singing is left centre-stage.
Following on a line of lyric sopranos that has included Caballe and
Ricciarelli, Janice Watson turns the role of Lucia into a vehicle for
luminous, long-breathed, lyrical singing. Nothing that she has done before
has suggested the ease with which she negotiates the high-lying passages in
the mad scene, sung with the poise of an expert tightrope-walker.
A period of study for the role in Italy has clearly paid off, though not yet
enough to make the coloratura sparkle or the Italian words bite (the
narrative aria 'Regnava nel silenzio' sounded nice but did not tell a
story). Her Lucia is a sweetly vulnerable creature, who skips around the
stage, running her hands innocently through her long blond air.
According to a note in the programme her clandestine romance with Martin
Thompson's visibly neurotic Edgardo makes her grow into a 'quiet
revolutionary', though Rennie Wright's production fails to make clear on
stage what that might mean. Thompson is an American tenor with easy top
notes, an Anglo-Saxon sounding voice and good vocal manners, who is
evidently much in demand. Tenors who can diminuendo on a top C are never
two-a-penny.
Nobody else succeeds in lighting up the miserable gloom of this staging,
which works against David Barrell's Enrico and Michael Druiett's
voluminously loud Raimondo. It is ironic that WNO's Music Director, Carlo
Rizzi, should be opening the season at Covent Garden with Puccini and
Rossini revivals, leaving Italian opera duties in Cardiff to Julian Smith.
Looking at the stage, one could hardly blame him. When a ram gets its throat
cut for a toast in blood at the wedding, it suggests a thirst for novelty
which is nowhere else evident. We know we are in Scotland because the men of
the chorus are wearing kilts, but the rest of the production consists of two
grey walls and half-a-dozen tables, which clansmen shift around periodically
for visual splendour and dramatic thrill. Clearly the money ran out at the
drawing-board stage. Then again, was there a drawing-board stage?

FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: Grant Lee Buffalo - Pop concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grant Lee Buffalo is the type of band that gets record companies interested.
Its lyrics are interesting (or pretentious, depending on your point of
view), its musical style, distinctive but knowingly anchored in mainstream
rock, is marketable but not overtly commercial.
This week the trio played at the ICA in the Mall. They are hardly pin-ups,
looking more like thirtysomething escapees from a David Lynch film about
American lowlife. As Grant Lee Phillips, lead-singer, guitarist and
songwriter, bounced on stage one young woman behind me turned to another and
declared disappointed: 'He's ugly.' 'Really ugly,' replied her friend.
Pudgy, sweaty, bashing on his 12-string electro-acoustic guitar, twitching
awkwardly as he briefly addressed the audience between songs, Phillips
dominates the stage and laps up the applause. He comes from the high-strung,
wild-eyed school of north American singers, somewhere between Henry Rollins
and Neil Young - they finished with a high-speed version of Young's 'For The
Turnstiles'. He instantly raised worries about how efficiently he had been
searched for guns at Heathrow.
Paul Kimble, the bassist, his ratty dyed hair hanging across his face, is a
poor man's Nicholas Cage, Joey Peters, the drummer, pulling faces, grinning
encouragement to no-one in particular, is the sort of man who has animated
conversations with himself on trains.
They can all play. They started like a train, roaring through 'Shining
Hour', the strongest number from what is, hype aside, a strong album. It was
rockabilly on steroids, driven forward by Phillips beefy, pounding drums.
They followed with 'Jupiter and Teardrop' a crunching ballad of ill-starred
love. The opening chord, a shameless steal from Bowie's Moonage Daydream,
has provoked an orgy of spot-the-influence among critics. Could 'Jupiter' be
Bowie himself? Could doomed 'Teardrop' be John Lennon, whose singing some
say Phillips apes? Live he sounded eeriely like Elton John (quite the wrong
market) and the much-examined words like the more endearingly overblown work
of Bernie Taupin, John's lyricist.
On the album Kimble's production gives the songs variety. Live, GLB showed
an astute, though wearisome, mastery of rock's dynamics. Time and again
crashing verse was followed by whispered chorus, rousing chorus by delicate
verse.
They finished in rousing style with 'America Snoring'. If Phillips has not
used up all his songs on Fuzzy, it will sound excellent when GLB starts
playing football stadiums in three or four years.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: New quartet, old orchestra - Weekend music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Skampa Quartet - Czech, prizewinners at two European competitions - was
not entirely new to the Wigmore Hall on Saturday evening: it had preceded
this full-length evening recital with, last February, a Sunday-morning
'Coffee Concert' which evidently left a powerful impression - powerful
enough for word of mouth to get about and the house to be packed on
Saturday.
The euphonious musicality and unforced grace of style of the Skampa - every
phrase given the illusion of displaying its own innate weight and direction,
every rhythmic pattern naturally tapped - are characteristics that might be
deemed traditionally Czech. But, as shown in this programme of Haydn,
Smetana and Dvorak, the personality that emerges from the ensemble -
distinctive, vital, questingly energetic - is anything but familiar.
This arresting combination of tradition and innovation may perhaps be
ascribed to the coaching the group has received from Milan Skampa, violist
of the (alas]) now-defunct Smetana Quartet and a leading chamber-music guru.
The use of his surname pays a compliment which is handsomely returned, for
the performances had a shining freshness miles removed from the hard-drilled
or the masterclass-copied.
From Skampa these players have certainly absorbed the missionary commitment
which overflowed from their account of Smetana's Second Quartet (as it used
to from the Smetana Quartet's celebrated own). In the past this
less-often-played of Smetana's two string quartets, a 'late work' of
sometimes overpowering intensity and telegraphic economy of statement, has
too often been dismissed as the incoherent product of Smetana's overwrought
mental condition (by 1882 his syphilis was already far advanced).
In this reading its pungently dramatic, passionately emotional qualities
were both balanced and heightened by a grasp of its astonishing
concentration of form and lyrical statement, all of which added up to an
overwhelming experience. The Dvorak 'American' quartet, after the interval,
was perhaps one easier to digest but no less exhilarating; only the opening
Haydn (the 'Fifths', Op. 76 no. 2) had been lightly flecked with nervous
imprecision on the part of the quartet's brilliantly communicative leader,
Pavel Fischer.
The quality of the players' instruments is plainly not of the highest (step
forward, some chamber-music-loving Maecenas]). Everything else about the
group arouses huge excitement for the future.
                        *      *      *
The trial has begun in earnest. By the end of this year one of London's
orchestras will know that it has been sentenced to death by starvation of
funds. Until then the Philharmonia, the London Philharmonic and the Royal
Philharmonic will be under close scrutiny.
Given the importance of concerts in London, it was unwise of the
Philharmonia to open its programme at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday with
the Prelude to Act 1 of Wagner's Lohengrin. The orchestra's strings are a
long way from being able to deliver the exposed first few minutes with any
kind of style. There were as many ideas on tuning and ensemble as there were
players, thankfully soon rescued by their colleagues.
That despatched, the rest of the evening proceeded more confidently. The
soloist was Margaret Price, fresh from an impressive performance as saviour
of the Geraint Evans tribute in Cardiff. There she had sung Verdi's
Desdemona with wondrously pure, poised tone. Wagner's Wesendonk Lieder lie
lower and call for a different kind of singer.
Quite rightly not wanting to employ the Margaret Price Mozart voice, she
sang with bigger, richer tone - a plausibly Wagnerian sound, except that it
loses focus when she calls upon it for more volume. The best songs were the
third and fifth, where the scoring is lighter. Unlike other singers,
concerned with keeping up a golden flow of voice in these songs, she sings
words, urgently and intensely. At times the music nearly wandered into the
world of expressionism. Giuseppe Sinopoli is a reasonably considerate
accompanist and she was not often drowned.
In Bruckner he could afford to let the brass rip - and he did. In the
passages of the Fourth Symphony where they sing Bruckner's noble melodies
the strings were more certain of their ensemble, though Sinopoli drove them
so hard that they often sounded under stress. For the rest, the brass
dominated, obliterating everybody else rather than trying to blend.
All of this is central to Sinopoli's views on Bruckner, typified by the
blazing assertiveness of every climax. The comparison here has to be with
the Leipzig Gewandhaus and Kurt Masur, who gave a Bruckner Fourth at the
Proms which was on another level, grand, unforced, eloquent. I do not wish
to suggest that anybody over here should try to follow the Leipzig model but
the Germans do know how to play Bruckner. It is unlikely that any London
super-orchestra would match them.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: Artists - made in America / A look at the later period
of the two current US exhibitions and finds it wanting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER

<TEXT>
American Art in the 20th Century, installed at the Royal Academy and the
Saatchi Gallery for the autumn, manages to be at once highly questionable in
its partiality and deeply conventional in its general view, an unusual
polarity. As to the former aspect, here we have what purports to be a true
and definitive survey, the American chapter in the Academy's on-running
study of our century's art, country by country. Yet it blithely asserts that
America's engagement with the modern movement began only in 1913, with the
Armory show in New York, as though American artists until then knew nothing
and cared less of the European art of the previous 50 years, of Degas and
Manet, Monet and Cezanne, Gauguin, Picasso and Van Gogh.
So it goes on, for if you can ignore Whistler or Sargent at the beginning,
there is hardly a problem with forgetting American realism between the wars,
with its inconvenient reminder, uncomfortable thought, that all art is
modern art in its time, and the avant-garde not set on rails. It is just so
again later on, through the post-war period and on to our own time - no
Milton Avery, Diebenkorn, Morris Louis, no Nevelson, Poons, Kienholz, Segal,
Close. But none of this would matter a jot if the selectors, Norman
Rosenthal of the Academy and Christos Joachimides of the
Zeitgeist-Gesellschaft of Berlin, had only had the nerve to parade their
partiality, and to argue its case.
But no: theirs must be the disinterested survey of the true course of
American modernism, and final judgment on what is significant and, by simple
omission, what is not. It is a large claim and, in relation to particular
artists and their achievement, not one to be lightly dismissed. The case is
especially strong with the early and central phases of abstract
expressionism, at times magnificently displayed, with Arshile Gorky and
Jackson Pollock in the 1940s, and Willem de Kooning and David Smith in the
1950s and 1960s, all of them clearly major figures. Further on the case is
as well made, if more succinctly, with the minimalism of Ellsworth Kelly,
Frank Stella, Agnes Martin and Richard Serra.
But even this is only well-established, conventional stuff, the reading of
American art taken at its own critical valuation as passed on by an
insistent cultural machine these four decades past. If it does not fit the
pattern, leave it out. Early Rothko? Still too problematical. Richard
Diebenkorn? A one-off. But for the rest, of course, the American example led
the way. At times it has even seemed that if it was not made in America and,
more to the point, sold in New York, it was hardly modern art, and Jasper
Johns the greatest artist in the history of the Universe.
What is the story, as it is told here? An early engagement with Duchampian
Dada jumps the decades to affect the conceptualism and anti-art of the past
25 years or so. Meanwhile, an interest in collage and graphic ephemera is
picked up from Picasso only to lie dormant for a generation, to re-emerge,
writ large, as post-war American Pop. Before that comes the big one,
abstract expressionism, that great climacteric after which painting will
never be the same again. And what really was its great and original
contribution? Looking to the painterly surrealism of such as Picasso, Ernst
and Miro, the influences upon American painters were clear. What could they
do to distinguish themselves? Paint it big: better still, paint it vast.
Vive la difference.
Taken as an opportunity and choice rather than an imperative, this new and
more than ample scale in painting represented a genuine development. The
canvas was transformed from support into arena, the mark at the brush's end
amplified into grand theatrical gesture, and colour itself made palpable and
all-enveloping. Painting became an event, a process, a drama, an experience.
The sad misuses of so positive an opportunity are all too apparent at the
Saatchi Gallery, which covers the period since 1970. Here, displayed with an
ironic elegance, is the betrayal of painting in the name of market fashion
and facile reputation. By now anything goes. One mark is as good as another,
and the merest indication of an image is taken for its realisation. Here, as
painting, we find only the witless crudity of Julian Schnabel, the cynical
graffiti of Basquiat, Keith Haring's mechanical illustration and the
pathetic manikins of Jonathan Borofsky. No wonder poor Philip Guston, the
only true painter among them, ducks his head in desperation behind the
parapet.
To get to the review of Agnes Martin's recent work, at the Serpentine, is a
relief. Here again, at its most refined and minimal, is true painting,
though austere and even forbidding to one unfamiliar with its convention.
Given such simplicity - cool, light colour grounds gently inflected, tone to
tone, coloured stripe to stripe, and articulated by nothing more than a
ruled pencil line - the work is unashamedly formulaic and this show might
seem rather small. Yet it is a paradox of such work, with each canvas
requiring time and close attention to reveal its peculiar qualities, that
much more would too soon become a surfeit.
These are objects for quiet and private contemplation rather than the
distraction of the public gallery. A close visual harmony is established,
teasing the eye at the very threshold of actual perception. A linear
structural interval is set up in counter-point, to get going a gentle rhythm
in the eye's mind. It is barely there, ultimately seductive, very beautiful.
William Packer's earlier review was in Saturday's paper.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Handle with care - A H Hermann on some
pitfalls of foreign trade under the Vienna Convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A H HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods concluded in Vienna in 1980 - better known as the Vienna Convention -
is the biggest success so far achieved by inter-governmental attempts at
unification of commercial laws.
The convention has been ratified or accepted by 34 countries and signed by
an additional four (see box, right). The secretariat of the UN Commission
for International Trade Law (Uncitral) hopes the number of countries
incorporating the convention into their law on foreign trade will ultimately
reach 50. Already its acceptance is wide, embracing most trading countries
of importance, with the exception of Japan and the UK.
The reach of the convention goes far beyond the ratifying countries. Almost
all of them will apply the convention to all contracts governed by their
law, even if the parties to the contract, or one of them, are based in a
country which has not adopted the convention. China, Slovakia and the US
will apply the convention only if both parties are in countries which adhere
to it. The Nordic countries will not apply the convention to contracts where
both parties are within their area, preferring to treat these as domestic
contracts.
In contrast with previous such international pacts, the convention applies
automatically, without requiring the contracting parties to mention it in
the contract. It is, no doubt, of great advantage to traders in countries
which have no proper commercial laws of their own and it has been drafted
with particular regard to the interests and requirements of developing
countries.
As an effective instrument of harmonisation and simplification of law the
convention may also prove useful to traders in industrialised countries, but
only if handled with care and awareness of its pitfalls. If the other party
agrees, these can be avoided at a stroke of the pen, by putting in the
contract a clause opting out of the convention.
Where it is impossible or undesirable to opt out of the convention
altogether, it is possible to overrule most of its undesirable provisions by
means of explicit clauses of the contract - but to do that it is necessary
to know the convention.
There is, however, one article of the convention which cannot be overruled
by agreement of parties to the contract. This is Art 12, which safeguards
the position of those countries that made a declaration that they only
recognise contracts, their modifications or termination, when these are made
in writing. Such declarations were made by Argentina, Belarus, Chile,
Hungary, Ukraine and the USSR (now the Russian Federation).
These are some of the convention provisions which deserve particular
attention - and possibly modification by the contract:
Anticipation of breach: Art 71 of the Vienna Convention provides that a
party may unilaterally suspend the performance of its obligations until
provided with 'adequate assurance' if it 'becomes apparent that the other
party will not perform a substantial part of his obligations . . .' This
leaves the supplier at the mercy of the buyer both in respect of what is
'apparent' and what is 'adequate'.
Cure: Art 48 gives the seller the possibility of curing 'any failure to
perform his obligations', even after the expiry of the time fixed for their
performance, as long as he will not cause the buyer unreasonable
inconvenience, expense and delay. The seller can also ask the buyer for
extra time and go ahead with the late performance if no answer is received.
Damages: The convention opens the door to unnecessary disputes, limiting, in
Art 74, damages to levels which do 'not exceed the loss which the party in
breach foresaw or ought to have foreseen . . .'
Force majeure: Art 79 protects the party impeded by force majeure against
damages without providing for avoidance of the contract and, in the case of
a temporary impediment, leaves the entire burden on the impeded party.
Fundamental breach: Art 25 makes the contract voidable only if the
substantial consequences of the breach were or could be foreseen by the
person in breach.
Interest: Art 78 makes interest on overdue debts obligatory but is silent on
how to calculate it. Interpretation: Art 8(2) takes the intention of a party
into account only so far as its expression would be understood by a
reasonable person of the same kind as the other party. Ownership: The
convention has no provisions on the passage of the title to the goods from
the seller to the buyer.
Passage of risk: Art 68 makes the buyer of goods in transit bear the risk
only from the conclusion of the contract, rather than from the time the
goods were handed to the first carrier.
Price reduction: Art 50 allows the dissatisfied buyer to reduce the price
unilaterally, without sufficient safeguards for the seller.
Specific performance: The convention gives priority to a court ordering
specific performance rather than awarding damages, even in a case where the
aggrieved party could have been expected to make a substitute contract.
Common law courts are not bound by this rule by virtue of Art 28.
Stopping goods in transit: Art 71(2) allows the seller who suspects that the
buyer became insolvent, to prevent the handing over of the goods dispatched
earlier even if the buyer holds a document which entitles him to obtain
them. This may cause problems if the goods were transferred by means of the
document to a third party absolutely or as a surety.
Substitute transaction: Art 76 provides that the current market price should
be taken as at the time of the contract avoidance, rather than as at the
time when the performance was due (as according to the UK's Sale of Goods
Act).

FT  21 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Keeping ahead of the game - The
Financial Law Panel plans to act, rather than react
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Law Panel was set up on the recommendation of the Bank of
England's Legal Risks Review Committee to help solve problems of legal
uncertainty said to be threatening London's future as an international
financial centre.
To many outsiders its creation was a sign of weakness, confirmation that
London had a problem. But to Colin Bamford, the panel's new chief executive,
it meant quite the reverse.
'I think it is a sign of the great strength of the English system. It has
been seen as a weakness because of the Hammersmith and Fulham swaps case.
People said 'Oh dear, English law can't cope'. But the same would have been
true about any other jurisdiction. It's just that the problem materialised
here.'
It was the House of Lords' 1990 decision in the Hammersmith and Fulham case
which led to the creation of the Legal Risk Review Committee.
The Law Lords ruled that swaps contracts between banks and local authorities
were invalid because local authorities had never been empowered by
government to carry out swaps. The swaps contracts were therefore ultra
vires. Banks, many of them foreign, were outraged at being unable to enforce
the contracts.
In general, Mr Bamford believes concern that legal uncertainty is
undermining London's position is overdone. English commercial law is the
most advanced in the world, he says. If there is a problem with legal
uncertainty it affects all legal systems equally.
Huge markets are growing up in very quick time. The trouble is that legal
systems tend to be reactive, he says. They don't anticipate problems and
everybody is only too aware that, given the size of these new markets, the
first time a problem arises its impact could be catastrophic.
The panel was set up precisely to try and anticipate where problems might
arise. So it is a positive move, he says, which shows that at least the
English system is addressing the issue. No one else has a similar type of
body - yet.
When the panel was proposed Lord Alexander, the former Bar chairman and
chairman of NatWest who headed the Bank's review committee, said he
envisaged it evolving into a body like the Takeover Panel, giving informal
advice to firms about the legality of financial transactions they might be
contemplating.
Its judgments would not have the force of law but Lord Alexander said he
hoped they would carry weight if they came to court. Lord Justice Hoffmann,
a member of the review committee, had told him he thought the courts would
give weight to the panel's decisions.
But Bamford, a 42-year-old City solicitor with a commercial banking
background, sounds a note of caution. The panel will have to earn the
respect of the courts first and that will take time. The only precedent is
the Takeover Panel, which took 10-15 years to acquire that level of
authority.
He also says that the Panel will have to be careful not to usurp the role of
the courts, particularly in areas which might involve white collar crime.
But it will be able to provide guidance as to best practice in the absence
of specific guidance in the legislation.
All that, however, is for the future. In its first year of operation the
panel is unlikely to be in a position to consult widely and disseminate best
practice on problems brought to it at this stage because one consequence of
the Bank's review committee was that by the time it was set up it had a
ready made agenda.
Three or four years down the line, the Panel may operate on a different
pattern, he says, but for the first year at least everything it looks at
will be drawn from a list of problems presented to Lord Alexander's
committee during its review.
The panel has identified 11 areas of concern on which it will concentrate
over the next 12 months and has already formed working parties to look at
two problem areas - shadow directorships and banks taking security over
cash.
The market needs a definitive view on taking security over cash because at
the moment it is getting different advice from different lawyers, says
Bamford. He has chosen a working party of high-powered lawyers: Professor
Roy Goode, Philip Wood of Allen &amp; Overy, Francis Neate of Slaughter and May
and Michael Crystal QC, to look at the issue. He chose them on the basis
that whatever they say should carry weight with lawyers whichever side of
the debate they are on.
He has also identified three big potential problem areas for early
attention: vires, looking not only at local authorities and swaps but also
at a whole host of associated problems and uncertainties relating to
building societies, insurance companies and public bodies; fiduciary duties
 -a very large and highly complex issue at which the Law Commission is also
looking; and netting.
Netting is an area where if problems arose, consequences for the markets
would be enormous, says Bamford. The Bank's committee received submissions
from the foreign exchange, bullion, derivatives, money and securities
markets stressing the importance of netting and set-off on insolvency.
At its simplest level, netting involves the set-off of reciprocal
obligations between transaction costs. When it works effectively, is
recognised by the counterparties and is designed to reduce insolvency
exposures, capital requirements can be greatly reduced since the credit and
liquidity exposures of participants are also reduced.
The problem is that while netting has always been accepted as a basic
principle of English insolvency law it is not accepted as a basic principle
in the US and in mainland Europe, although America has recently passed
legislation to allow it, so that it can bring its capital adequacy rules
into line with England's.
'It's not that there is a legal problem,' Bamford says. 'It's just that the
consequences if there were one would be so enormous. If you had a collapse
in one of the big markets and someone discovered that the netting of
operations across the market didn't work the way everybody thought that they
would, the implications would be absolutely staggering. So it merits
worrying about even though there is nothing wrong at the moment,' he says.
When the worrying has been done by the various working parties and by
Bamford and his team of seconded lawyers, their deliberations on the issues
will then be considered by the full panel, chaired by Lord Donaldson, former
Master of the Rolls. In general, Bamford expects the 15 panel members to
play a monitoring role, ensuring its work is going in the right direction.
He also expects the panel to be a success. If it is, he says, it will be
interesting to see, by the time he hands over to his successor three years
from now, whether the Americans have followed suit and set up a panel of
their own.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Technology: Prints charming - Paper, long the Cinderella of
the high-tech office, is to go to the ball after all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'paperless office' promised by computers has become a joke. Yet Xerox,
best known as a manufacturer of copiers that add to the deluge of documents,
aims to have the last laugh.
Rather than eliminating paper, Xerox has developed technology that
incorporates computer instructions into paper documents in an almost
invisible format. Known as Glyph, it promises to bridge the gap between
computerised office systems and paper documents and could change the way
paper documents are treated.
Usable Glyph technology became available in a limited form last year in a
product called PaperWorks. The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) is
using it to keep in contact with far-flung staff around the world.
Working in remote and often primitive locations presents Unicef staff with a
communications problem. Power-supply difficulties make it not worth their
while having portable computers, which are anyway expensive, and there is
often an inconvenient time-difference with headquarters in New York.
With PaperWorks software installed on an IBM or compatible PC at
headquarters, Unicef staff who come across a fax machine can send a special
Glyph-encoded form to the fax-card in the PC. By marking up the form with a
pen or pencil, they can indicate what they want done from a number of
possible options.
Once the computer receives the form, it carries out the instructions. These
may be to retrieve any messages addressed to the caller or look up and
transmit data to the caller, or to route documents to other PCs.
If the field-workers do not have a Glyph form with them already, they can
obtain one by faxing a blank sheet of paper to the PC. Unicef says that the
system works well and plans to extend its use.
After filing a series of patents protecting the Glyph technology, Xerox has
lifted a veil of secrecy and says it will soon announce licensing deals with
software firms, office equipment manufacturers and large corporations which
are struggling to manage paper document mountains.
'The question is not whether we will do away with paper but how to find the
best way to integrate it into the office,' says Paul Ricci, president of
Xerox Advanced Office Document Services.
Ricci explains: 'There is a serious productivity issue in the office and
paper is largely disjoined from the electronic world. Xerox, with its focus
on documents, has been seeking ways to bridge the two worlds.'
Glyph technology was developed over a four-year period by the Xerox Palo
Alto Research Centre (Parc). This is the institution that pioneered most of
current desktop technology such as PC graphical user interfaces, laser
printers, Ethernet networking and object-oriented software.
Glyph uses tiny diagonal marks on paper arranged in lines within a
rectangle, rather like a miniature barcode. In documents produced for use by
the scanners in conventional fax machines, which work at lower resolutions,
they can clearly be seen but are unobtrusive.
In documents that can be scanned at higher resolutions, the diagonal marks
look like a uniform grey field which can be incorporated within a logo or
other image, so that readers will not find them ugly or distracting. Yet
even these 'hidden' marks can be read by specially equipped fax machines,
scanners and computers and then translated into computer instructions.
Glyph technology could revolutionise paper use, says Paul Saffo, research
fellow at the California-based technology think-tank Institute for the
Future. 'The problem with paper is that once you print a document, its
information is like a fly trapped in amber. With Glyph technology, it
becomes a two-way trip. It can also help with problems in managing huge
amounts of information, since you can embed hypertext connections that link
the paper document with related information in large databases.'
A printout of a spreadsheet to be used in a presentation could have formulae
embedded in it. If the client then wanted to see how the figures looked on
different growth and inflation assumptions, the page could be scanned in to
a PC and the data manipulated on the spot.
However, Saffo cautions, the large number of potential applications for
Glyph, and its versatility, may make it difficult to market. 'With
foundational technology such as Glyph, it's difficult for us to imagine all
the ways it can be used, because it can be applied in so many ways.'
Xerox will shortly introduce a software development kit that will allow
business applications to access Glyph technology. But to fully realise
Xerox's vision of 'smart paper', computer and office equipment manufacturers
will have to add Glyph-recognition capabilities.
This will require improvements in fax scanner technology and it may take two
years before such products are available.
Ricci says that Xerox is offering attractive licensing deals to help
establish Glyph as an industry standard, which will help keep down the price
of Glyph-compatible equipment. In the meantime, Xerox will integrate Glyph
technology into its products.
Software giant Microsoft is interested in using Glyph as a key part of its
'Microsoft at Work' concept that was announced in early June.
Microsoft At Work will consist of software and hardware that will link
office equipment such as fax machines and copiers to computer networks.
Xerox is developing a multi-function device combining fax, photocopier and
scanner, and integrating Glyph technology and the Microsoft at Work
architecture. The device is to be introduced in 1994.
Xerox envisages a wide range of applications for Glyph and is talking to
several big companies. Ricci declined to go into detail, but mentioned that
one key application being discussed is using Glyph technology in credit
cards to help improve security and cut down on fraud.
Xerox is also developing sophisticated optical recognition technologies that
use artificial intelligence to understand printed words and distinguish
image areas.
With these technologies, Xerox's goal is to rescue paper from its derided
role as voluminous by-product of the digital world and give it a starring
role instead.

FT  21 SEP 93 / People: Sir William Ryrie to join Barings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir William Ryrie has chosen the central role for what looks like being an
active life back in London following his retirement as chief executive of
the International Finance Corporation, the private sector finance arm of the
World Bank.
Sir William, a former second permanent secretary to the Treasury who devised
the 'Ryrie rules' which govern investments by nationalised industries, is to
spend three days a week helping to develop Barings' international
businesses.
The appointment will include a seat on Barings' main board. Sir William will
devote most of his time to encouraging Barings' ventures in emerging markets
such as the Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Sir William, who is 64 and took over as IFC chief executive in 1984, has
developed IFC lending to an expected Dollars 2.4bn this year despite some
overlap with the relatively new European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
Sir William said yesterday that flows of investment from Europe and the US
had grown continuously over the past decade and there was 'no doubt barring
some extraordinary catastrophe that they will be the strongest markets in
coming decades.
'It will be nice to come home,' said Sir William, who expects to be
appointed to 'one or two other boards' in addition to his role at Barings.
He hopes for a 'little less vigorous life' than at the IFC, despite the
appointments.
Andrew Tuckey, Barings' deputy chairman, said the bank hoped that Sir
William would provide particular impetus to securities distribution in
emerging markets as well as helping to develop primary issue and corporate
finance activity.
'To some degree he will have an ambassadorial role, but we also want him to
contribute to hard decisions about what markets we should be in or issues
such as whether we should develop business by taking on local partners,' he
said.

FT  21 SEP 93 / People: Changing chairs in Vocational Qualifications
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Education and training enthusiast Michael Heron, chairman of the Post
Office, has been appointed chairman of the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications which, over the past few years, has been developing
competence-based vocational qualifications.
He replaces Sir Bryan Nicholson who is leaving at the end of his three-year
term and who becomes president of the CBI from April 1994.
Sir Bryan, a skilful negotiator, has been an enthusiastic chairman of the
NCVQ, using his skills of persuasion to gain greater acceptance for national
vocational qualifications.
According to Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, under Sir Bryan's
leadership the NCVQ had made 'excellent progress'. She also said that
Heron's background, experience and commitment to education and training made
him ideally qualified to build on the achievements of his predecessor.
Heron has had both a strong professional and personal commitment to
training. Before joining the Post Office in January, he was director in
charge of personnel worldwide for Unilever. He is deputy chairman and a
member of the board of Business in the Community (pictured in that capacity
right) and was recently appointed vice chairman of the National Advisory
Council on Education and Training Targets. Made up of senior business
leaders and academics, Nacett's role is to oversee progress towards the
attainment of the very same NVQs that the NCVQ has been developing.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Technology: Custom-built toys for pen pushers / Profile of
Telepad, which has big plans for pen computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who needs a pen computer? Everyone who can write, to believe the razzmatazz
over Apple's Newton, Eo's personal communicator, Grid's Gridpad and other
electronic personal assistants.
In practice, innovative devices of this kind are finding favour first with a
smaller but no less demanding audience: agents, salespeople and inspectors
whose job means hours on the road and quantities of data to be analysed and
relayed to headquarters.
Pen computers have no keyboard. Their users write directly on the screen
using a special stylus. The computer's software records the handwritten
input either as the original drawing - a sketch map or a signature, for
example - or translates handwriting into alphanumeric characters.
Insurance companies, engineering concerns and inspectors are already sending
out their staff armed with machines built by Grid and IBM of the US and NEC
of Japan among others.
The machines are not perfect. Persuading a machine to recognise the scrawl
that passes for most people's handwriting is not easy. 'Pen computing will
be a horizontal market - but not yet,' muses Ron Oklewicz, president and
chief executive of Telepad, a three-year old US computer company based in
Reston, Virginia.
What he means is that while pen computing is not yet sufficiently flexible
or reliable for universal use, it has ready applications in niche areas -
field force computing being the obvious example.
Oklewicz's company seeks to exploit the gap between the potential of pen
computing and the reality of building reliable systems based on novel
technology.
Telepad is still in its development phase. It raised Dollars 9m (Pounds
5.8m) through a public offering resulting in a Nasdaq listing on July 15 and
is in many ways a model for the computer company of the future.
It is a 'virtual' company, only 32 people strong and fleet of foot. It
relies on other organisations for product design and manufacture. Its
eponymous product, the Telepad, a foot-square polycarbonate-cased screen
selling for between Dollars 2,400 and Dollars 3,000, is manufactured for it
under contract by IBM, in one of the first examples of the industry giant's
new policy of selling its skills to third parties.
The physical design of the device was entrusted to two US design shops, GVO
of California and Edge of Philadelphia. Warehousing and physical
distribution are handled in the US by LMI of Memphis, Tennessee, which also
takes responsibility for repairing broken machines.
Much of the technology in the Telepad is off-the-shelf. It will run all the
most popular industry operating systems, for example: Windows, OS/2,
Penwrite, Go and Pendos.
So how does Telepad reckon to differentiate itself from the competition? It
claims to be one of the first systems integrators in the pen computing
business, putting together hardware, applications software and
telecommunications in a package customised to the exact needs of the user.
This puts it in a different category from companies like Apple which are
chiefly concerned with selling innovative hardware. Oklewicz, a former
manager of Apple's federal systems division, does not see the Newton as
competition. IBM, on the other hand, 'is perpetual competition, but it is
opening up the market'.
Some prestigious customers are already shopping there. The US Air Force, one
of the world's largest buyers of computer equipment, is spending Dollars 1m
on Telepads for staff inspecting radar installations.
A US police force is using Telepads to replace 14 separate accident report
forms by one electronic entry.
Miniature cameras, or radio devices which communicate with satellites to
pinpoint the user's geographic position, can be linked to the device.
Telepad, however, not only provides the hardware and the communications  -
it also develops the necessary information-processing software.
A store chain, for example, recording its inventory on Telepads could
transmit the data to head office over the telephone or radio links for
analysis.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Technology: Genetic food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there a hint of cannibalism about eating an animal that has been
genetically engineered to include human genes?
Should a Moslem or Jew avoid meat from a cow that includes pig genes? Can
vegetarians eat plants containing animal genes?
Such questions may sound like absurd moral speculation. But biotechnology is
moving so fast that the world's religious and ethical thinkers will soon
have to give practical advice on genetically modified foods.
Some preliminary advice came yesterday from the UK government's Ethical
Committee on Genetic Modification of Food. It found 'no overriding ethical
objections' to foods incorporating copies of human genes, but recommended
that products containing human and other 'ethically sensitive' genes be
labelled clearly to allow consumers to make an informed choice.
The committee of six was chaired by John Polkinghorne, president of Queens'
College, Cambridge, who is an ordained scientist. It consulted widely among
different religious groups and others who feel strongly about food purity.
Its report concludes that a human gene inserted into another species should
not be regarded as human material. This is partly because what is
transplanted is not an original human gene but a copy of one - and, to make
the point, the committee uses throughout the report the cumbersome phrase
'copy genes of human origin'.
In any case, the report says, the gene loses its human character outside the
context of a human cell.
Experimental transgenic animals with human genes already exist - for example
sheep that make Factor IX, the blood-clotting protein, for haemophiliacs.
Such animals are far too valuable to reach the meat market today. But
surplus transgenic sheep - those that do not make enough human protein for
pharmaceutical use - may be sold for food at some point in the future.

A 137-year tradition will end next month when two businessmen join Her
Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.
All previous members of the inspectorate, which monitors police standards
and encourages improvements in efficiency, have been former chief
constables. The appointment of Anthony Williams and Peter Hobbs is part of
the government's Citizen's Charter drive to demonstrate the independence of
inspectorates.
Hobbs, 55, joined the Wellcome Foundation from ICI in 1979, and was until
recently group personnel manager of Wellcome plc. He was the first chairman
of the Employers Forum on Disability, and has twice served as international
vice-president of the Institute of Personnel Management. Wide-ranging
involvement in education and training initiatives includes the chairmanship
of the Learning from Experience Trust.
Williams, 57, a qualified occupational psychologist, is a partner in Hay
Management Consultants. He worked on selection procedures for the police,
fire service and civil service while at the Civil Service Selection Board.
His has also been personnel director for the World Bank.
On a practical level, min-isters hope that the two newcomers' outside
experience will contribute to current attempts to improve managerial
efficiency in the police service.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Up and up for Schindler -
A company that spurned the advice of consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a story to warm the hearts of management consultant sceptics. In
1985, Schindler, the Swiss elevators and escalators group, called in some
consultants to assess its escalator business.
At the time, Schindler was a minor player, active mainly in the European
market and with a world market share of less than 10 per cent.
The consultants told the family-controlled group to give up. The escalator
business, like so many other specialised engineering sectors, was going
global. Schindler lacked critical mass and could not catch up with Otis and
other better established groups, they concluded.
Alfred Schindler, who had just taken over as chief executive, felt
otherwise. 'It is not our style to drop out of a business,' he says.
The group then set out systematically to build up its position to a
sustainable level. The landmark events were fairly predictable -
streamlining of the group's European escalator manufacturing plant in
Vienna, rebuilding a depleted market position in the US after taking over
the Westinghouse elevator and escalator business in 1989, and plunging into
China with three joint ventures.
The result: last week, Schindler announced that it had become the world
market leader in the escalator business with a share of more than 20 per
cent.
Schindler is a fairly secretive group - partly because the sectors in which
it operates are marked by fierce competition among only a few global groups
 -so the whole story of how this success came about will not be told here.
Alfred Schindler nevertheless points to some interesting lessons.
Yes, a considerable amount of investment was required, but money was not the
crucial factor, he insists. No, this project was not the sort of long-term
payback venture that only a family-controlled company could take on,
although a public one might have difficulty getting shareholders to accept
it.
'We raised the stakes as we went along. The opportunities in the Pacific
region developed much faster than we expected,' he says.
'Much more important was getting organised in a global way.' The escalator
business, like many other specialised industrial product sectors, involves a
constant chase after big contracts in open competition. Airports, shopping
centres and underground railways are the main customers.
Often, time is of the essence, and Schindler has worked hard to develop a
single product line and a network of loyal subcontractors throughout the
world. The idea, one pioneered by Caterpillar Tractor several years ago, is
that its products can be manufacturered in any of its plants.
'The advantage we have is that market needs are not tied to a particular
plant capacity,' says Peter Zbinden, president of the escalator division.
'We can adjust to whatever speed of delivery is required.'
Zbinden said speed was particularly important in winning contracts for the
Kansai airport project in Japan and a recent expansion of the Atlanta
airport.
Schindler says the other important factors were emphases on training and
efficient, high-quality production. 'We had a lot of specialists in Europe.
We sent them to the US for long periods, even welding specialists, and then
did the same thing in China.'
The company put a big effort into improving output at a factory for making
escalator steps in Ternitz, Austria. Now competitors buy their steps from
this factory, too, and a few have insisted on buying equity stakes in it for
security.
'It is also very important to work hard and not talk about it,' Schindler
says. 'We are often criticised for being too discreet. But in the military,
you never say anything, unless it is to mislead the enemy.'
Postscript: It is well known that Schindler frequently employs the Boston
Consulting Group. Schindler wishes to make clear that BCG was not the
unfortunate firm used in this case.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The small business market has proved a difficult one for magazine
publishers. A big obstacle has been the refusal of business owners to see
themselves as part of a small firms 'community'. Most define themselves in
terms of their sector of activity - as wine bar owners, software businesses,
and the like.
The latest attempt to break into this market comes in the shape of
Enterprise, a monthly costing Pounds 2. Subjects in the first issue include
raising finance, getting paid on time, and the value of market research.

shape - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new business credit union has been formed by more than 400 small
businesses in North London with the assistance of a Pounds 30,000 injection
from the North London Training and Enterprise Council, writes Lisa Wood.
The companies, many of them micro-businesses, already belong to the North
London Enterprise Club. The members believe in self-help and the
organisation of their own borrowing requirements is a logical step, said the
Tec.
The credit union is not for profit, charging interest at 1 per cent per
month with loans to be repaid over 24 months. The maximum loan available is
Pounds 10,000.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Just don't ask us to pay
for it - President Clinton's health reform is one of a number of sore points
for small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a time, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas was the only governor
ever to have received the 'Guardian of Small Business' award from the
National Federation of Independent Business, a 600,000-member organisation
that is the US's most vocal, and probably most powerful, small business
lobbying group.
After eight months at the White House, however, President Clinton has
crossed swords with the NFIB on a string of issues, most notably a bloody
combat over his budget bill.
Although he has maintained significantly warmer relations with a number of
more moderate groups, Clinton is embarking this week on a further battle
that seems likely to unite the small business lobbies against him. All of
them seem set to oppose a core element of his healthcare reform plan: a
requirement that all employers offer health insurance to their workers and
pay 80 per cent of its cost.
Small business has been a mantra in Clinton's political career, and it
remains a strong theme for his administration. Cabinet members, and Clinton
himself, are fond of observing that 85 per cent of jobs created in the past
12 years have been in businesses employing fewer than 50 people.
Clinton came to office proposing a package of fiscal incentives, including a
50 per cent tax exclusion for long-term investments in start-up businesses
and a targeted investment tax credit intended to spur investment in new
plant and machinery.
While some of these measures fell by the wayside during the long battle in
Congress, the final budget passed in August still included a limited
reduction in capital gains tax on start-up investments in small businesses,
as well as an increase from Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 6,500) to Dollars 17,500
in the limit on the amount of assets that can be declared as expenses in the
year of acquisition, rather than depreciated.
The White House has also taken steps to encourage bank regulators to loosen
their standards for banks lending to small businesses, and has made a
proposal for setting up community development banks to support local
businesses, following the much-publicised example of South Shore Bank in
Chicago.
But many of Clinton's main campaign pledges run headlong into small business
interests, even though in many instances the reaction may be more from the
gut than from a precise analysis of the pain they would inflict.
The Family and Medical Leave Act, which obliges employers to give workers
leave for the birth of a child or to care for a sick relative, was the first
bill Clinton signed into law after taking office.
Although it specifically exempted businesses employing fewer than 50 people,
the act provoked howls of rage from small businesses, partly because word
had not filtered out about the exemption, partly because business owners
feared that once the principle was established, the reach of the legislation
would gradually be extended to them, too.
The White House then ran into another barrage over its budget bill.
Opponents contended that the marginal tax rate for all partners and sole
proprietors, as well as so-called 'subchapter S corporations', which pass
their income directly through to a small number of shareholders, would rise
from 32 per cent to 46 per cent.
The debate was fuelled by David Hale, chief economist with Kemper Financial
in Chicago, who said that 89 per cent of all tax returns with significant
business income, including these different categories, now file under the
personal tax code. He further argued that more than 60 per cent of
subchapter S income goes to people who would be hit by the higher personal
tax rates imposed in the Clinton budget.
Erskine Bowles, head of the Small Business Administration - the government
department responsible for providing assistance and loans to small
businesses - countered that 96 per cent of the 7m taxpayers whose primary
source of income is a partnership, proprietorship or subchapter S
corporation would be unaffected by the increase in marginal tax rates.
The average income of the 4 per cent who would be affected, he added, was
Dollars 560,000 a year.
'It is a bogus issue. It's not a small business issue. What it is, is a rich
person's issue,' he snorted.
Clinton faces the same problem in his health care reform: opposition to the
employer mandate promises to be fierce, even though the great majority of
businesses already provide health insurance to their employees.
A survey of small and medium-sized businesses conducted in April by Arthur
Andersen and NSBU found that 99 per cent of companies with 100-499 employees
offer health insurance, as do 94 per cent of those with 20-99 employees.
Even among businesses with 19 or fewer employees, 54 per cent offer health
insurance.
The survey also found that the average increase in health insurance premiums
over the past year was 22 per cent, suggesting that Clinton ought logically
to be able to win over at least some business owners with the promise of
reduced medical costs.
But at a carefully staged event with small business people in a Washington
hardware store last week, Clinton was still not able to convince the
participants.
It is an argument that he must win if Congress is not to start giving small
businesses the same exemption from providing health insurance that it gave
on family leave - an exemption which could destroy his efforts to ensure
universal coverage.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Lib Dems rule out voting pact
with Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrat leadership yesterday ruled out any prospect of an
electoral pact with Labour ahead of the next general election.
Senior party figures said that informal contacts with members of Mr John
Smith's shadow cabinet had indicated that the Labour leader would be unable
to deliver a pre-election voting deal.
But as the perennial issue of the Liberal Democrats' relationship with
Labour resurfaced on the opening day of the party's conference, several
senior figures stressed the need to exploit common ground with Labour on a
range of social and economic policies.
Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president, voiced the prevailing
view in a speech to the conference suggesting that a move by Labour to
reform its institutional links with the unions might provide the catalyst
for a much bigger shift in Britain's political landscape.
The power of the unions in Labour decision-making has hitherto proved one of
biggest obstacles to the creation of a broad anti-Conservative coalition. Mr
Kennedy said dilution of that role could remove the 'Berlin Wall' of British
politics.
The momentum for increased co-operation has been strengthened by a visible
shift towards the centre-left in the Liberal Democrats' economic strategy.
Mr Kennedy suggested also that his party must exploit the wave of
anti-government sentiment sweeping the electorate by co-operating with
Labour in defending the welfare state. Sir Gordon Borrie, the head of
Labour's Social Justice Commission, was last night among a number of Labour
supporters invited to address fringe meetings at the conference.
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said his party
would be guilty of 'blind stupidity' if it ignored the overwhelming
similarities between its policies for health, education, transport and
social welfare and those advocated by Mr Smith.
To the visible irritation of Mr Malcolm Bruce - the party's spokesman for
trade and industry - Mr Hughes said Liberal Democrats must admit the
overriding priority of removing the Conservatives from office.
Mr Ashdown and his colleagues appear determined to avoid a public row over
the issue of pacts. Senior party figures said the idea had been canvassed in
informal discussions with sympathetic members of the Labour shadow cabinet.
The message was that Mr Smith is convinced his party can win the next
election without any pre-election deal.
The central calculation of senior Liberal Democrat officials remains that
even on relatively optimistic assumptions it will be difficult to win more
than 35 seats at the next general election.
An ICM poll released yesterday suggested that the combined support for
Labour and the Liberal Democrats - at present 69 per cent - would fall only
slightly to 62 per cent if the two parties agreed a formal electoral pact.
But the assumption that many Tory defectors would stick with the Liberal
Democrats in the event of such a deal was challenged by several senior party
figures.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Leftward shift in strategy for
next election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE shift to the left in Liberal Democrat policy-making was confirmed
yesterday as the conference endorsed a paper intended to set the framework
for the party's manifesto at the next election.
The clear rejection of laissez-faire economics and the emphasis on the need
for full employment were highlighted approvingly by representatives
yesterday in the debate on the paper, Facing up to the Future.
Even though the tone of the paper is already markedly more sceptical about
market mechanisms than its precursor, which provoked an angry debate at last
year's conference, some representatives who spoke yesterday expressed
concern that it was still too rightwing and expressed too much in terms of
conventional economics.
One speaker said the paper did not address the over-consumption of global
resources by the first world, while another demanded a commitment to reform
and regulation of City institutions. Yet another said that campaigning on
behalf of the lower-paid who were affected by the abolition of wages
councils was a vital element in ensuring that the Liberal Democrats did not
become 'yet another middle-class party out of touch with some of the real
issues'.
But the tone of the debate was overwhelmingly favourable towards the
document, which was praised for its statement of Liberal Democrats and its
analysis of the challenges facing the UK.
Some representatives, however, were unhappy that the conference committee
had refused to accept for discussion or vote any amendment to the motion
approving it.
Lord Holme, a leading figure in drawing up the document, said the paper
would help the party refute suggestions that it had no policies, and could
speedily form the basis of a manifesto if the parliament failed to run its
course.
The Conservatives yesterday stepped up their offensive against the Liberal
Democrats, who they believe pose the main threat to traditional Tory
strongholds in the south.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, said the party was
'notorious for chopping and changing their policies from one moment to the
next'.
Mr Gerry Malone, Conservative deputy chairman, joined in the attack, saying:
'Their strategy is shameless - to be all things to all men'.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Party to temper its enthusiasm
for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS are to tone down their fervent pro-Europeanism in an
attempt to maximise their party's appeal to disgruntled Conservatives in
next summer's elections for the European parliament.
Mr Paddy Ashdown hopes to treat the elections principally as a referendum on
Mr John Major's government, changing the focus from specifically European
policies.
In a calculated shift in the party's approach to Europe, its strategists
signalled yesterday that the Liberal Democrat manifesto would address the
concerns of an electorate which had become increasingly sceptical about
European integration.
Charging that the Conservatives were seeking to 'misrepresent' the party's
views, they said that the word 'federalist' would not appear in the final
manifesto.
Lord Holme of Cheltenham signalled the change of tone by stressing that the
party would not allow itself to be painted as an 'uncritical admirer of
everything that is done in Europe'. Lord Holme, a key figure on the Liberal
Democrats' policymaking group, was echoed by Mr Roger Liddle, the
co-ordinator for the European manifesto.
In an address to candidates for the Strasbourg parliament Mr Liddle said
that it was 'ludicrous' to suggest that the party favoured a 'United States
of Europe', warning that it needed to distance itself from 'grandiose
federalist rhetoric' which might lay candidates open to that charge.
Instead, the party needed to reflect the reality that Europe was in a phase
of consolidation. It should also avoid talk which implied that a 'single
currency is our only firm idea on economic policy'.
The injection of a Euro-sceptic tinge into the traditionally unalloyed
enthusiasm for Europe reflects the judgment that the party's best hopes of
success in the European elections is to defeat Tories in the south-west.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: 'Green' row looms over plan
for carbon tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROTECTION for people who live in the country and would be hit particularly
hard by higher petrol and diesel prices through a carbon tax will be at the
forefront of today's debate about environmental taxation.
At a private meeting of Liberal Democrat MPs yesterday morning, Mr Malcolm
Bruce, the MP for Gordon, and Mr Alex Carlile, the MP for Montgomery, led
calls that the interests of rural constituencies should be stressed in the
debate in order to avoid a row over the impact of the policy on some of the
party's core support.
Support for a modified version of the European Community's proposal for a
carbon tax is among the most sensitive issues within the party. It carries
the risk of a conflict between the Liberal Democrats' commitment to 'green'
policies and the priority they attach to ensuring that people can still live
in the countryside. Most of the party's 22 seats are in predominantly rural
constituencies.
The paper that will be presented by Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment
spokesman, suggests various ways of protecting rural people who need a car
from the impact of higher petrol prices, such as allowing them to pay lower
rates of local taxation, or enabling them to pay lower vehicle excise duty.
Given the party's campaign against the imposition of value added tax on
domestic fuel, he will also be anxious to stress a desire to compensate
pensioners for the increase in fuel bills. Investment in public transport
will also be highlighted.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Members back anti-racist moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELEGATES yesterday agreed to enhance the status of ethnic minorities within
the party and called for the expulsion of any members found to have resorted
to racist tactics.
Mr Ramesh Dewan, an Asian delegate, led a determined attempt to counter
racist charges against Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets, east London,
where a candidate from the far-right British National Party was elected to
the local council last week.
He said that 507 of the 711 members of the Tower Hamlets party are Asian and
he challenged Labour to say what percentage of its Tower Hamlets party
members is Asian.
The vote to elevate the ethnic minorities group to the status of a specified
associated organisation easily satisfied the two thirds majority required
for such a constitutional change. Earlier, party leader Mr Paddy Ashdown
reaffirmed that expulsions would follow if the inquiry he has ordered
establishes that Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets had used racist tactics.
Endorsing this approach, Mr Dewan promised: 'If we discover a boil we will
lance it'.
The debate came as Labour challenged Mr Ashdown to 'come clean' over his
involvement in the campaigns in Tower Hamlets, claiming the Liberal Democrat
leader was warned about his party's tactics three years before last week's
by-election.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, referred to a letter sent to Mr
Ashdown by a Labour MP in March 1990 complaining about attempts to 'stir up
racial antagonism' in a Liberal Democrat leaflet distributed in the Isle of
Dogs.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Further redundancies expected at Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE REDUNDANCIES are expected to be announced today at Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder.
News of three-figure job losses is likely this morning when receivers Price
Waterhouse meet union leaders.
Since Swans went into receivership on May 13, following its failure to win a
crucial helicopter carrier order from the Ministry of Defence, it has shed
almost 750 jobs, reducing its workforce to 1,700.
More cuts are expected partly because three weeks ago the company lost a
Pounds 50m Oman patrol boat order to French rival Constructions Mecaniques
de Normandie. Union sources said 100 Swans jobs depended on the order. In
addition, one of the three Type 23 navy frigates which are Swans' only
current work is due for completion in a month.
Unions and local MPs fighting to save Swans say that the loss of key staff
and the break-up of teams of workers will make it less attractive to
prospective buyers. But it is understood that potential bidders, keen to
avoid large redundancy bills, are waiting for further job cuts. Mr Tommy
Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering
Unions, said: 'They're playing a waiting game.'
Swans, he said, was now near the minimum 'critical mass' needed to maintain
it as a shipbuilder.
Yesterday the CSEU and Labour MPs and MEPs set out their case to the
European Commission for Swan Hunter to become eligible for intervention
funding by redesignation as a mixed yard. Intervention funding, from which
UK warship yards are barred gives access to a 9 per cent subsidy on merchant
shipbuilding orders.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Hounslow to cut 250 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUNSLOW, the Labour-controlled London borough, is to shed 250 jobs as part
of a Pounds 6m cuts package it said would be necessary to avoid
budget-capping by central government.
It is the first council to announce its planned budget for next year, and it
said the cuts had been made necessary by the government's plan to cut
budgets by 2 per cent.
Hounslow's cut is equivalent to 4.7 per cent of its controllable budget and
the council predicted that other authorities would have to follow suit.
Mr John Chatt, the council leader, said: 'We have gone as far as we can in
recommending cuts which will minimise the effect on direct services to the
community. If we don't get a decent grant settlement then any further cuts,
and the damage they will cause, will be due to the government's failure to
listen to our pleas.'
The Association of London Authorities said Hounslow was the first London
borough to announce its proposals and suggested that a clear pattern of
spending intentions would not emerge until December.

FT  21 SEP 93 / MPs dispute a Budget 'saving': Ivor Owen says financial
debate may be denied to backbenchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RIGHT of all backbench MPs to probe and challenge key tax proposals made
in the Budget will be removed if new procedures for streamlining debate on
the finance bill are adopted.
The Commons procedure committee has recommended that the entire committee
stage of the bill, when the provisions implementing the Budget proposals are
subjected to line-by-line scrutiny, should be handled by a standing
committee with a membership of about 50 MPs.
The two or three-day committee stage on the floor of the House, in which
every backbencher is able to vote if not speak in support of specific
amendments, would be abandoned.
Earlier this year some Tory backbenchers used this stage to join with
opposition MPs in condemning the extension of VAT to domestic fuel. They did
so in the knowledge that their protests would be widely reported on
television and radio as well as by the press. Such exposure is seldom
secured by speeches made in a standing committee.
Mr Nick Budgen, Conservative MP for Wolverhampton south west and an
outspoken critic of the policies which contributed to inflation reaching
10.9 per cent when Mrs Thatcher stepped down from the premiership, will
oppose the change.
Mr Budgen said: 'The whole process of the House of Commons being able to
protest at financial proposals will be weakened.'
Another critic is Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench
finance committee, who believes that the change proposed for the committee
stage of the finance bill is a step too far.
He insists that 'really important tax issues should be discussed on the
floor of the House'.
Mr Denzil Davies, a treasury minister in the last Labour government, said
the finance bill was usually the most important measure in a parliamentary
session and if the procedure committee's proposal were to be adopted it
would be 'an extremely retrograde step'.
Until 1968 the entire committee stage was dealt with on the floor of the
House, with MPs frequently sitting late into the night poring over the
details of controversial tax proposals.
Critics said that the priority accorded to the committee stage of the bill
encouraged filibustering by opposition parties, with the result that complex
tax clauses were often dealt with by bleary-eyed MPs at two or three o'clock
in the morning.
This resulted in frequent complaints that such antics brought the House into
disrepute.
Splitting the committee stage so that all MPs retained the right to
participate in the examination of the most important aspects of the bill,
with the less controversial sections dealt with by the restricted numbers
serving on a standing committee, has proved a workable compromise.
In arguing the case for change the procedure committee claims that the
splitting device was no more than a sop to those who regarded the removal of
any part of the finance bill from the floor of the House as 'revolutionary'.

FT  21 SEP 93 / GMTV aims for middle ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD MORNING Television, the commercial television company, plans to
concentrate on 'the middle ground' in future and may drop cartoons on
weekdays in response to unexpectedly intense competition.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of GMTV and chief executive of London Weekend
Television, a GMTV shareholder, said: 'We've lost the kids.'
The children have left GMTV - which runs only a few minutes of cartoons
during the week - for Channel 4's Big Breakfast - except at weekends, when
GMTV runs more cartoons.
The Big Breakfast matched GMTV with peak quarter-hour audiences of 1.4m each
on weekdays, according to ratings published yesterday. BBC Breakfast News
had 1.1m viewers.
GMTV's reach - those who watch at some time during the programme from Monday
to Friday - at 11.6m outstrips The Big Breakfast, which has a reach of 8.3m.
GMTV lost Pounds 10m in its first six months on air although it is hoped
that cost-cutting measures will keep losses to between Pounds 2m and Pounds
3m in the second half. There are still hopes of reaching oper-ational profit
next year.
GMTV, which bid Pounds 34.6m for its franchise and also has to pay 15 per
cent of advertising revenue to the government, hoped to raise Pounds 80m in
advertising revenue this year. However, competition from The Big Breakfast
and the lingering effects of recession now make Pounds 60m the more likely
total, leaving it in deficit.
With Pounds 5m savings already made, the pressure on costs continues. For
example Central TV, which provides three news inserts for GMTV from its
separate areas, has now been asked to cut back to just one.
Mr Christopher Stoddart, GMTV managing director, said: 'We are fully sold
for the next three months but we could do with some more ratings points.'
He believes he has always been addressing the middle ground between The Big
Breakfast and Breakfast News. The challenge now was to improve quality, he
said.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Aids drug study results delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEDICAL Research Council has had to delay publication of the full
results of its controversial Concorde study about the effectiveness of AZT,
the most widely used treatment for Aids and HIV-positive patients.
In April the council revealed preliminary data suggesting that the drug was
not effective in slowing down progress towards Aids in HIV-positive
patients.
At the same time the medical journal The Lancet published a letter, which
had not been submitted for scientific assessment, from the council about the
Anglo-French study - the largest and longest trial on patients with HIV who
had not developed Aids. Wellcome, AZT's manufacturer, disputed the findings.
Although additional information has been provided, clinicians and patients
have not had full access to scientifically-assessed data.
Dr Janet Darbyshire, head of the council's HIV clinical trials centre, said
there had been some trouble in putting together the data. 'I had hoped it
would be done before, but we have been chasing some data that we did not
have before on dose levels and things like that,' she said.
She said the full data would not change the main findings but would be
supplementary. Full details would be published in The Lancet before the end
of the year, she added.
The council's letter in April shocked the Aids community, since it left
HIV-positive patients, who had not developed Aids, without any proven
therapy.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Vauxhall and Nissan slash car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL, UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is cutting car
production sharply at its two assembly plants this month under the impact of
the steep fall in new car sales in continental Europe.
Later this week Nissan, the Japanese manufacturer, is expected to become
another victim of falling European car sales, when it announces a
significant cut in output at its plant in Sunderland, Tyne &amp; Wear, for the
last three months of the year.
However, the company said last night that there would be 'no lay-offs and no
redundancies'.
Ford, the leading UK vehicle maker, has imposed a four-day week at its
Transit van plant in Southampton, Hampshire, throughout September and
October.
Vauxhall is cutting all production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra in
its Luton, Bedfordshire plant this week with the loss of nine shifts. It is
cutting 14 shifts in Luton during September, which will eliminate the
production of 5,506 cars.
By the end of September it will have cut 74 shifts this year in the Luton
plant. In the first eight months output at the plant fell 23.8 per cent to
84,630 cars from 111,116 a year ago.
Vauxhall's plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, which produces the
Vauxhall/Opel Astra, has virtually been working a three-day week during
September with the elimination of 11 shifts, cutting production of 3,344
cars.
In effect the plant has been closed for production from Thursday afternoon
to Monday afternoon during September. A total of 21 shifts will have been
cut in the first nine months of the year.
In spite of a recovery in UK car sales Vauxhall output has fallen 12.7 per
cent to 168,926 in the first eight months of the year from 193,542 in the
same period last year.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Blow to DTI hopes of attracting Mercedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPARTMENT OF Trade and Industry hopes of finding a site in the UK for
Mercedes-Benz to build small cars, and prepare a deal for the German vehicle
manufacturer, may have been frustrated by public exposure. The UK, France,
the Czech Republic and Germany are on the shortlist.
The disclosure by Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' chief executive, that the
company wants to make 200,000 small cars a year in one of four countries has
triggered rival approaches to its UK headquarters.
To the chagrin of the Invest in Britain Bureau, the DTI agency most closely
involved in seeking to attract the project, even individual chartered
surveyors are understood to have approached Mercedes with proposals for the
250 - 300 acre site sought by the carmaker.
While the bureau last night refused to discuss its role on grounds of
'commercial confidentiality', it is understood that it had been hoping to
maximise the UK's chances of attracting the project by compiling data on all
potential sites in the country, and preparing its own proposal.
So far, only the Northern Development Corporation and Midlands development
authorities have acknowledged that they want the project.
Industry analysts say Mercedes has to decide by the end of this year if
production is to start, as planned, by 1997.
Mercedes has been stepping up its motor component purchases in the UK, which
now supplies Pounds 72m-worth annually. The parent group, Daimler-Benz,
spends Pounds 350m annually with UK suppliers.
The group recently warned component makers not to interpret increased orders
as being linked with the small-car site.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Doubts over future of City's cordon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS DOUBTS emerged yesterday over whether the security cordon thrown
around the City of London in the wake of two IRA car-bomb attacks would be
continued beyond its experimental phase.
City police and the City corporation favour making the traffic restrictions
a permanent feature in the belief that they have improved safety, cut
serious crime and brought environmental benefits. However, senior ministers
are believed to be opposed to using the traffic control scheme to combat
terrorism on the grounds that it has been a propaganda coup for the IRA.
City of London police commissioner Owen Kelly said yesterday that the
traffic control scheme had been 'a key element in keeping the terrorists off
balance'. He told a City seminar on security that the cordon had contributed
to an 18.2 per cent drop in serious crime, mainly burglaries, in the City
this year and helped to improve safety in the wake of the car bomb attacks.
But he added that the cordon had not been universally popular and some
members of the government were thought to be against it. He had the
authority to run the scheme for six months and could renew it for a further
six months but 'after that it is up to the government'.
However, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who also addressed the
seminar, declined to say whether he would support the continuation of the
scheme. He said it would be up to the transport secretary 'to adjudicate at
the time'.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the policy and resources committee of the
City of London Corporation said his understanding was that opposition came
from the Department of Transport.
'It has improved security but it has also had good environmental benefits,'
Mr Cassidy said.
Metropolitan Police commissioner Paul Condon told the seminar, which was
organised by London First, a private sector pressure group of leading
bankers and insurers, that there was a need for greater vigilance, more use
of closed circuit television and a change in the law to allow more random
searches of individuals and vehicles.
The cordon was set up three months ago after a bomb exploded in Bishopsgate
near the NatWest tower and Hongkong and Shanghai bank in April killing one
person and injuring more than 40. In April last year a bomb exploded at St
Mary Axe killing three people and injuring up to 90.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Executives feast on champagne and birdies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS AT the Belfry golf course in Warwickshire were yesterday putting
the final touches to mobile offices and hospitality suites for the Ryder
Cup, which the organisers predict could attract more corporate attendance
than any other sporting event in Britain.
Companies such as IBM, IMI, Chase Manhattan Bank and the Royal Bank of
Scotland have taken hospitality suites for the European-US competition, each
costing Pounds 49,000 for six days.
The suites, known as 'platinum pavilions', have fax machines, mobile phones,
share information and dining facilities for up to 50 guests. Mr Richard
Brown, one of the corporate hospitality organisers, said: 'They can monitor
shares or drink champagne all day. It's up to them.'
All 38 platinum suites have been sold out, as have the less luxurious range
of pavilions, the gold, silver and bronze. Other executives are expected to
rough it in 250-seat restaurants which will cater for the 7,500 corporate
clients expected each day.
Organisers predict ticket receipts of more than Pounds 2m, which will offset
the cost of improving the course's greens and refurbishing the DeVere Hotel,
owned by Greenalls brewers.
The competition on the fairways is likely to be mirrored by the
transatlantic profile of the business guests, Mr Brown added. Executives
from British companies such as Bass will be able to rub shoulders with their
counterparts from Pepsi Cola over four-course lunches in the best suites.
The directors of Pepsi, however, will be arriving at the Belfry in grander
style than those from Bass, based in nearby Burton-on-Trent. Personnel from
the US company flew into Birmingham yesterday on a specially chartered
Concorde with executives from Time Warner, American Express and the US team.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Housing bodies to fight fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSING Corporation, the regulatory body covering Britain's 2,200
housing associations, has urged its members to review their audit procedures
after a large-scale fraud at one of the biggest associations.
The fraud at Circle 33, estimated to have netted between Pounds 600,000 and
Pounds 1m, was discovered in its eastern area maintenance department.
Mr Grahame Coleman, in charge of contracts in the office, and Mr Graham
Dossell, a building contractor whose company carried out much of the work
under investigation, have been traced by detectives to Thailand after they
disappeared from their jobs earlier in the year.
Police, who want to question the men about the fraud, have sent a dossier to
the Crown Prosecution Service. They are hoping to apply for extradition of
the two men.
Circle 33 provides low-cost rented housing for more than 8,500 households,
mainly in London and the home counties. The association said yesterday that
it had centralised its maintenance contracting work and introduced new
controls.
The fraud, involving over-invoicing on contracts, led to the Housing
Corporation suspending Circle 33's 1993/94 programme of works worth Pounds
43m, including a Pounds 27m grant from the corporation. The programme was
reinstated in August after the association introduced new safeguards.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Swan Hunter faces further job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE REDUNDANCIES are expected to be announced today at Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder.
News of three-figure job losses is likely this morning when receivers Price
Waterhouse meet union leaders.
Since Swans went into receivership on May 13, following its failure to win a
crucial helicopter carrier order from the Ministry of Defence, it has shed
almost 750 jobs, reducing its workforce to 1,700.
More cuts are expected partly because three weeks ago the company lost a
Pounds 50m Oman patrol boat order to French rival Constructions Mecaniques
de Normandie. Union sources said 100 Swans jobs depended on the order. In
addition, one of the three Type 23 navy frigates which are Swans' only
current work is due for completion in a month.
Unions and local MPs fighting to save Swans say that the loss of key staff
and the break-up of teams of workers will make it less attractive to
prospective buyers.
But it is understood that potential bidders, keen to avoid large redundancy
bills, are holding back until further jobs are cut. Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne
chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said:
'They're playing a waiting game.'
Swans, he said, was now near the minimum 'critical mass' needed to maintain
it as a shipbuilder.
Yesterday the CSEU and Labour MPs and MEPs launched a document setting out
their case to the European Commission for Swan Hunter to become eligible for
intervention funding by redesignation as a mixed yard. Intervention funding,
from which UK warship yards are barred under a 1985 agreement between the UK
and EC, gives access to a 9 per cent subsidy on merchant shipbuilding
orders.
The MPs and MEPs meet EC competition commissioner Mr Karel van Miert on
September 28 to argue Swans' case. They say it is the only designated
warship yard to have built warships and merchant vessels without
intervention funding. Redesignation would not breach EC directives, they
say.
Mr Nick Brown, MP for Newcastle East, said that it was vital for potential
buyers to know if Swans was to be eligible for the funding, and he accused
the government of being 'lukewarm' on the issue. Industry minister Mr Tim
Sainsbury had failed to argue Swans case effectively, he said, by seeking
subsidy for all UK warship yards.
The DTI said Mr Sainsbury, following initial negotiations, had focused on
Swans' case. A reply from Mr van Miert was expected soon.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Union blocks BT move to part-time work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN union in British Telecommunications has blocked an initiative to
allow full-time engineering workers to convert to part-time working as a
conflict grows between the union and the company over pay and jobs.
The proposal, with a scheme to allow engineers to transfer to clerical jobs,
has been introduced to help BT restructure and reach its goal of 15,000
voluntary redundancies in this financial year.
Although BT and the union expect the total will be reached this year both
sides predict a much tougher battle over the same figure for 1994-95. Mr
Peter Archer, BT's head of personnel, said yesterday: 'It does look as if it
could be a lot more difficult next year.'
The National Communications Union, which since June has been controlled by a
new, more leftwing executive, has opposed the part-time proposal because, it
said, the plan was floated without consultation with the union.
The union, which already has a part-time working agreement for its
predominantly female clerical members, said it believed BT was using the
proposal to undermine the earnings and conditions of the whole workforce.
Fewer than 100 engineering workers have expressed interest, partly because
of union opposition.
The union has rejected a 1.9 per cent pay offer and is recommending strike
action in a ballot of its 140,000 members, with the result expected on
November 9. The union said the average private-sector rise in the three
months to July was 2.5 per cent.
The union argued that, excluding redundancy costs, pre-tax profit per
employee increased by 90 per cent in 1992-93. It also said a 1.9 per cent
rise would cost the company only Pounds 38m compared with Pounds 79m spent
on the dividend in the last financial year.
Mr Archer said: 'It is not a very generous offer but we are already a good
payer - if we pay more we will have to cut even more jobs. I do not believe
there will be support . . . for strike action.'
Mr Archer said that there were no plans to end national bargaining at BT but
more regionalised bargaining was being reviewed.
The transfer of staff from engineering grades to clerical work has attracted
about 4,000 volunteers, which will make it easier to reach the goal of
12,900 voluntary redundancies this year on top of natural wastage of about
2,000.
Little progress is reported in the customer services improvement programme,
BT's plan to increase working time flexibility so that more staff work when
customers are at home.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Road tolls plan moves nearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN GUMMER, envir-onment secretary, yesterday gave the strongest hint
yet that the government favours a system of road pricing or 'congestion
charging' in London.
Mr Gummer said in Manchester that Norwegian experiments in controlling
traffic with electronic tagging and metering had achieved limited success.
'It may just be we have to have a more simple form as far as London is
concerned,' he said.
Mr Gummer was speaking at the Partnerships for Change conference, which is
seen as a follow-up to last year's Earth Summit in Rio.
His main message was overshadowed, however, when he became embroiled in
controversy after branding an environmental activist a fascist after being
heckled by a male demonstrator at the conference over the extension to the
M3 motorway through Twyford Down.
The incident came after members of Earth First] had blockaded a tram on
which he was riding and then interrupted a press conference.
Mr Gummer retorted by saying there were too many people in the environment
movement who were 'absolutists'.
Labour pounced on the outburst saying its timing - less than a week after
the extreme rightwing British National Party won a council seat in east
London - was 'extremely unfortunate'.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's front bench spokesman on environmental protection,
said the use of such 'intemperate language' suggested that Mr Gummer was not
confident of his case.
Mr Gummer's message that increasing traffic problems had to be faced implied
that the debate in government was switching from whether road pricing was
desirable for London to discussions of what form this might take.
Officials confirmed this change in emphasis but said that ministers remained
concerned that controversial measures should not be introduced until it was
established that they would work.
Mr Gummer said opinion polls showed that people favoured measures to
encourage motorists to switch to public transport but objected when these
were applied to them personally.
The issue has aroused heated debate in the government and Whitehall. Mr
Gummer said that the departments of the environment and transport were
working together to reconcile conflicting objectives in areas such as
charging to beat congestion.
He added: 'You need a roads programme which does properly take into account
environmental needs.'
He said the motor vehicle had 'increasingly destroyed our cities and
increasingly destroyed the quality of life of many people.'
'But it has, on the other hand, provided a degree of freedom and opportunity
to many people who didn't have it before. Somehow or other we have to bring
these two things together.'
He defended widening the M25 and building bypasses through the countryside.
The M25 served strategic national needs, such as the transport of freight
which could not be moved by rail between north and south, he said.
Bypasses were needed 'to make life livable' in many villages and small
towns.

FT  21 SEP 93 / TUC expects flexibility in public-sector pay policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUC believes that the government's new public-sector pay policy based on
a cash-limits freeze for the next financial year may prove flexible enough
to defuse the danger of an co-ordinated showdown between the government and
public-sector unions.
Union leaders representing most of Britain's 5.5m public-sector workers are
due to meet at the TUC tomorrow to try to co-ordinate a response to the
policy, due to come into force in November. Statements by Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, have suggested to the TUC that there may be enough ways
around it to prevent an over-rigid pay strategy.
The magnitude of future resistance to the government's public-sector pay
strategy may be evident later this week.
On Thursday Fire Brigades Union leaders are due to meet the local authority
employers in what they describe as a 'last chance' to secure a wage rise in
November based on the 15-year pay formula that links firefighters' pay to
the upper quartile of pre-tax male manual earnings.
If the local government employers continue to insist that they cannot
operate the pay formula this year and must act within the government's
current public-sector 1.5 per cent pay limit policy, delegates to the
union's planned recall conference are expected to vote for a strike ballot.
Contingency plans are in place to provide emergency firefighting services if
there is a strike, the Home Office said. It is understood that under certain
circumstances these could include deploying troops and Green Goddess fire
tenders.
Voting on strike action would start next Monday with the result due on
November 1. Possible disruption could start at fire stations on or after
November 8 but the employers believe the firefighters will not back the
union's strike call. They point out that the government's new pay policy
does not prevent a return to the firefighters' pay formula in the autumn of
1994.
The result of the strike ballot of 500,000 white-collar local government
staff belonging to Unison, the service union, is due on Friday. The members
have been asked to back six one-day strikes over six weeks.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Police chiefs seek deal on Sheehy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF constables yesterday presented the government with compromise
proposals aimed at negotiating around some of the more contentious
recommendations of the Sheehy report.
The Association of Chief Police Officers said in its formal response to the
Sheehy inquiry into police roles and responsibilities that there were
'alternative solutions to the identified problems which are less complex,
less costly, and at least equally effective'.
Relations between Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, and the
police service have soured since the report was published in June. Last week
Sir Patrick described police critics of his proposals as 'demagogues.'
The response seeks to cool the debate, expressing gratitude to the inquiry
for identifying areas of concern and saying many of the recommendations
offered 'substantial potential benefits'. But it remains critical of many of
the core recommendations.
It says that, while sympathetic to linking pay to appraisal, the Sheehy
recommendations for performance related pay are too complex, and the
recommendations for a lower starting rate would endanger recruitment and
retention of high-calibre officers. Proposals to abolish the ranks of chief
inspector, chief superintendent and deputy chief constable failed to
recognise operational requirements, while recommendations for fixed-term
appointments were out of all proportion to the problems of underperformance.
Moves already under way to introduce a flatter management structure have,
say the chief constables, led to the disappearance of 350 senior posts since
1990 - a figure that is likely to reach 1,000 in the next two or three
years.
The recommendations will face further criticism at the conference of the
Police Superintendents Association later this week. Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary, who is due address the conference on Wednesday, is consulting on
the proposals month.

LABOUR IS expected to launch a debate today aimed at abolishing A-level
examinations and introducing some form of payment by graduates for
university education.
The announcement, as part of the launch of the third part of party's 'green

two days before university vice-chancellors announce which extra source of
funds they favour. Last month vice-chancellors said they were considering
options including loans for tuition and an additional income tax for
graduates.
Labour's document is consultative, and so no definite plans will be
announced. Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, has strongly
signalled, however, that Labour should reject the present system of funding
where non-graduates in effect subsidise those who have had the benefit of a
university education.
Labour - like the university principals, who made it clear they welcomed the
party's change of direction - is considering either a system of loans which
would be repaid through the tax system, or a full graduate tax.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, plans to announce his thinking on
funding in a speech to vice-chancellors at Leicester University tomorrow. He
is expected to offer further expansion in the sector if additional sources
of funding can be found.
Labour is expected to call for the abolition of A-levels, described last
week by Mrs Taylor as 'too restrictive and too narrow', in favour of a broad
restructuring of further education and the integration of more vocational
education.
In the last month A-levels have come under attack from employers and from Mr
Robin Wilson, chairman of the Headmasters' Conference, a group of
independent boys' schools.

FT  21 SEP 93 / McAlpine in row on power station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN

<TEXT>
SIR ROBERT McAlpine and Sons has been taking legal advice on a dispute with
the Hong Kong family that took over the mortgage of Battersea Power Station
from Battersea Leisure.
The construction company, which has a Pounds 20m debt on the site, found
that its contractors were locked out of the area yesterday and refused
access to their office and machinery.
Mr Simon Broackes, McAlpine's group property and special projects manager,
said: 'We have very large quantities of material on the site which belong to
us. We have been in discussions with the solicitors all morning. There is a
separate question of whether their (the family's) title is valid.'
The Hwang family of Hong Kong, which holds the site as mortgagee through its
Park View company, had hoped to achieve the takeover through a voluntary
arrangement with secured creditors of Mr John Broome's Battersea Leisure,
which owned the site. Wandsworth council accepted 1p in the pound on its
Pounds 300,000 debt on the site but McAlpine refused a similar offer.
The family said it was not aware of doubts on the title. McAlpine would be
able to take away its plant if it produced a schedule of what it owned.

was yesterday fined Pounds 22,500 and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 100,000
after admitting discharging dangerous chemicals into a main sewer near its
incineration plant at Pontypool, Gwent.
In the four-week trial at Newport Crown Court Rechem at first denied three
charges but then last Tuesday admitted them. It also admitted one charge of
breaching conditions of its licence to discharge into the sewer and was
formerly cleared of three similar charges.
Mr Ian Brown, for Rechem, said after the hearing that the company had only
admitted the charges because it wanted to appeal against the judge's
interpretations of the law.

FT  21 SEP 93 / New universities fail to fill places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER polytechnics have been left with unfilled places following an
unexpected expansion in the numbers of students recruited by the older
universities.
The new universities, which acquired their status last year, have not been
in direct competition with traditional universities before and many are
disappointed by this year's distribution of students.
The figures are in stark contrast to earlier predictions that older
universities would reject far more applicants than usual and the former
polytechnics would find it difficult to accommodate extra demand.
The former polytechnics say that older universities have reduced A-level
requirements, but provisional figures suggest that the new universities have
not shed their image as 'second-class' institutions.
The Polytechnics' Central Admission Service, which is launching an inquiry
into the problems its members have faced, says total acceptances are still
about 10,000 short of last year's final figure of 130,000. It said: 'We are
reasonably happy we will be up on last year's figure, but not by as much as
the other universities.'
Enrolment for the older universities, handled by the Universities Central
Council on Admissions has already increased by about 6,000.
The figures appear to vindicate the view of Mr John Patten, education
secretary, that the effect of a government cut in funding for extra arts
places had been exaggerated. Universities predicted trouble because the cut
was announced only in December, when many institutions had almost completed
giving conditional offers.
Mr Leslie Wagner, chief executive of the University of North London, said:
'A government call to stem the flood of students into higher education was
given such hype in the media that many sixth formers decided they would not
stand a chance of admission unless they obtained high-grade A-levels.'
He said high figures for graduate unemployment had also depressed demand.
The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals said the government's
attempt to regulate places this year had failed because it had been
announced too late, but predicted a much tighter squeeze next year.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Joint rail insurance plan after sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES awarded fran-chises to provide rail services as part of the
privatisation of British Rail are likely to be required to join an
industry-wide scheme for dealing with claims for injury or damage.
One of the results will be to keep the cost of insurance down for franchise
holders, the government says.
The proposals are designed to meet concerns about how claims arising from
accidents such as the Clapham rail disaster would be handled.
The government says that the proposed arrangements should ensure that there
will be no undue delays in settling claims.
Under proposals published yesterday by the transport department, rail
passengers will claim against train operators for injury or damage incurred
on rail journeys. For claims at stations not involving trains the station
operator would bear the liability in the first instance.
These rules would apply even where liability was disputed or shared with
other organisations such as RailTrack, the organisation responsible for the
rail infrastructure.
The new railway regulator will be responsible for ensuring that operators
have adequate third-party insurance to cover claims from people other than
passengers or employees.
The regulator will also require operators to participate in an industry-wide
scheme to adjudicate on claims from passengers and other customers where the
amount claimed is more than Pounds 5,000 but less than Pounds 5m. The
committee will apportion fault between the various parties, including the
operator and RailTrack.
For claims of more than Pounds 5m operators will be expected to pay into a
centrally negotiated insurance policy, with the insurer handling the claim.
Larger operators might be allowed to cover claims up to a higher level, such
as Pounds 15m, in return for lower premiums.
Most claims by passengers will be handled directly by the operators, in the
same way that BR handles them now. The transport department proposes that
this low-value claims process should apply to claims of up to Pounds 5,000 -
about 95 per cent of all claims currently made against BR.
Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: 'We aim to ensure that
passengers and others who wish to make a claim know precisely against whom
claims should be made and that the railway industry does not face heavier
burdens of liability than at present.'
Operators and insurers will be urged to make advance payments in cases of
hardship, as BR does at present.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Lending surge boosts confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES THAT the economic outlook is improving were boosted by an
above-expected increase in bank and building society lending last month,
shown in Bank of England figures published yesterday.
Sterling lending on a seasonally adjusted basis increased by Pounds 3.3bn,
compared with Pounds 3bn in July, for the largest monthly increase since
May. It compared with a figure of Pounds 2.5bn expected by City economists.
The Bank also said the M4 measure of the money supply - notes and coins in
circulation plus bank and building society deposits - rose 3.7 per cent in
the year to last month after 3.6 per cent in the 12 months to July. The
figures fit in with evidence that demand is steadily growing although they
dampen any suggestions that the economic take-off from recession will be
rapid.
Separately, the Gallup market research company said consumer confidence had
stayed about constant in August compared with July, with 32 per cent of a
sample of nearly 2,000 people expecting an economic improvement over the
next year and 29 per cent thinking the economy will worsen.
Gallup said consumer confidence was 'hardening' albeit at a low level. A
continuing depressing factor was that many people are worried they will lose
their jobs, which stops them rushing into big purchases.
Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the lending
data underlined how economic activity was gradually picking up from the low
point which occured around the end of last year.
This message also emerged from the British Bankers' Association, which said
the UK's nine biggest banks lent a net Pounds 2.8bn in August, double the
July increase of Pounds 1.4bn and the largest monthly increase since March
1990. Much of the increase was due to high levels of borrowing by securities
dealers, however, apparently related to the need to gain large amounts of
sterling for trading in foreign exchange and financial instruments.
Mortgage lending by the banks was also high, although the association said
overall demand for consumer credit in August was 'surprisingly weak'.
Demand for credit is normally fairly high in August as a result of people
borrowing to buy new cars and for holiday spending.
The association added: 'August's large underlying increase confirms the
upward trend in lending, but only takes it back to last year's level of
activity, which itself was not indicative of any great economic upturn.'

FT  21 SEP 93 / Ministers admit ban on exports to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day confirmed that it was revoking all export licences
for Iraq after the discovery of fraudulent United Nations and Department of
Trade and Industry documents.
The DTI said yesterday: 'It has come to our attention that there may have
been falsification of certain UK licences to Iraq.'
It added: 'We have therefore decided it would be prudent to revoke existing
licences and issue new licences.'
The fraud involves the doctoring of documents to give false statements of
export volumes on goods classified as humanitarian aid.
Under the sanctions regime which was imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait
in August 1990 humanitarian aid includes medicines and baby food.
The move is believed to concern borderline cases where the aid could have a
defence-related application, such as vehicle spare parts and concrete. These
particular cases are subject to UN scrutiny and require a UN letter of
authorisation.
It is understood that British officials have been debating how to prevent
the fraud from spreading. One problem facing Whitehall is that some of the
fraud appears to have involved go-betweens in Jordan, which is being viewed
by the government as a potential ally in the Middle East.
British officials also had to consider the consequences of being seen not to
take action once the fraud had come to light. It is understood that the
Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry was an influence on some officials, forcing an
early decision to stamp out the fraud.
The present head of the Foreign Office's UN department is Mr William Patey.
During the 1980s Mr Patey was chairman of the Whitehall inter-departmental
committee which vetted export licences to Iraq.

FT  21 SEP 93 / 9 per cent choose teaching as their first choice of career
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 9 per cent of final-year university students made teaching their first
choice of career, a survey showed yesterday.
The survey, in which 411 students at 22 universities were interviewed by
BMRB International for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, also
showed that teaching was least popular among engineering and science
graduates. It is government policy to encourage science teaching.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has said pay claims as high as 14
per cent by teachers' unions were unrealistic because 'students are queueing
up to be teachers'.
The research, however, suggests that the healthy numbers entering
teacher-training are caused by the recession. Of those graduates who made
teaching their first choice, only 8 per cent mentioned a high starting
salary or high social recognition for teachers' status, and only 3 per cent
mentioned high quality resources, support and equipment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN energy industry leaders and environmentalists will be watching the
Finnish parliament closely today as debate opens on whether to approve
construction of a new nuclear power plant.
The project, one of a few of its kind in Europe, has become the focus for
wider arguments over the merits of nuclear power. Within Finland, it has
prompted sharp debate in recent years, with the outcome of a free vote by
MPs due on Friday still uncertain.
Commercial interests are also watching developments closely. Bids to build
the proposed FM10bn-FM15bn (Pounds 1.1bn-Pounds 1.7bn) plant have already
been received from ABB Atom of Sweden, Atomenergoexport of Russia and NPI, a
consortium formed by Siemens of Germany and Framatome of France.
Finland already has four nuclear reactors, built in the 1970s, with a total
capacity of 2,300MW. They supply about a third of the country's electricity
needs and about 15 per cent of total energy needs.
In 1975, talks began on building a fifth reactor, of about 1,000MW capacity,
at one of the two existing sites. By 1986, the authorities were close to
giving the go-ahead when the Chernobyl nuclear accident led to radioactive
fall-out on Finland.
The project was frozen until two years ago. The cabinet finally gave its
assent, by an 11:6 vote, last February, but this intensified a debate which
has split the two largest political parties, the governing Centre party and
the opposition Social Democrats.

FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: EC's row over farm trade hits tariff talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks posed by French
resistance to last year's US-EC farm trade pact is having an adverse impact
on vital multilateral talks in Geneva designed to lower tariffs on
industrial and agricultural goods.
At a stocktaking meeting last Friday, a number of countries expressed
concerns that the negotiations were being impeded by the continuing row
within the EC over the Blair House accord. Although intensive talks are
continuing, aimed at cutting overall tariffs by at least a third, countries
are unwilling to come forward with further concessions while the row is
unresolved.
Community officials have been unable to convince trading partners that they
should bargain seriously on the basis of an EC market-access offer for farm
goods that derives from the Blair House deal.
Failure to make progress soon could delay the tariff negotiations which,
with parallel talks on market-opening measures for services, are an integral
part of the Uruguay Round package. The Round must be completed by December
15, when US fast-track negotiating authority expires.
For agricultural exporting countries, liberalisation of farm trade is the
key to successful completion of the Round and there is strong opposition to
any watering down of the Blair House accord. This was stressed last Friday,
both in Geneva and in Montevideo, where the Rio Group of Latin American
nations said they needed better market-access terms for their agricultural
goods if the final Uruguay Round package was to be acceptable.
Developing countries also repeated complaints in Geneva on Friday that the
tariff-cutting deal negotiated by the 'Quad nations' (the US, EC, Japan and
Canada) in Tokyo in July did not meet their concerns in such areas as
textiles, tropical products and natural resource-based products.
The situation looks more promising for services, where a stocktaking meeting
yesterday reported progress in finalising the draft framework agreement
laying down rules for services liberalisation. However, trade officials say
they do not expect the issue of audio-visual services, in which the US is
pitted against the EC, to be resolved at this stage.
The EC wishes to preserve its freedom to restrict the showing of
non-European TV programmes and to continue support for European film makers.

JAPAN is likely to liberalise its controlled rice market in time to allow
completion of the Uruguay Round negotiations by a December 15 deadline, Mr
John Major, the British prime minister, indicated after talks in Tokyo
yesterday.
Mr Major, who is on a four-day visit to Japan, said Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
the Japanese prime minister, had agreed during two hours of talks that
completion of the Round was 'crucial' for world trade.
'We share the determination that it should be concluded by December 15,' Mr
Major said. 'We agreed that immense damage would be done to international
confidence and trade were there not to be an agreement in the Uruguay
Round.'
Mr Hosokawa said he and Mr Major had 'mutually reaffirmed' the need for
countries facing 'difficult' agricultural problems to over-ride these
differences.
British officials refused to expand on Mr Major's remarks. However, Mr
Hosokawa is thought to have given a private assurance that Japan will move
quickly to ensure that rice does not constitute a last-minute hurdle for the
talks.
Japan has come under increasing pressure from the US and members of the
14-strong Cairns Group of agricultural exporting nations, chaired by
Australia.
The issue of Japan's closed rice market has been in abeyance because of the
controversy in Europe over French opposition to the Blair House agreement
between the US and the EC on agricultural trade.
However, Tokyo is aware that world attention will shift to the rice market
if it becomes clear that the Blair House agreement will survive.
Mr Major said he had relayed to Mr Hosokawa Britain's strong opposition to
French demands for a renegotiation of Blair House.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Tax treaty may spark corporate shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the Netherlands have approved a draft tax treaty which could
prompt restructuring of a number of multinational companies.
The assistant secretary for tax policy at the US Treasury and the
director-general for fiscal affairs in the Netherlands have agreed
amendments to the US-Dutch tax treaty initialled last December, which clear
the way for ratification, possibly by the end of the year.
Even if the one-year grace period permitted by the treaty is invoked, the
agreement means that from January 1 1995 US subsidiaries held through
companies in the Netherlands will no longer be eligible to take advantage of
low tax rates between the two countries.
'A large number of companies may be restructuring, beginning December 31
this year,' Mr Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp;
Young, said yesterday.
The revised treaty, negotiated over more than 11 years, imposes tough new
criteria for eligibility. Those companies excluded will see US withholding
taxes on dividends to Dutch companies rise from 5 per cent to 30 per cent
and on interest payments from zero to 30 per cent.
One of the principal reasons for the delay was a clause concerning tax
treatment of Swiss branches of Dutch companies, which had not been
finalised.
Negotiators have now agreed a text, which states the US will impose a 15 per
cent withholding tax unless income from Swiss branches is taxed at more than
17.5 per cent.

<TEXT>
MR John Cahill, British Aerospace chairman, will pay a 'courtesy visit' to
Taiwan this week, the company said yesterday.
The trip comes as Taiwanese opposition politicians are questioning a planned
joint venture between BAe and Taiwan Aerospace (TAC) to build regional jet
aircraft in the UK and Taiwan.
The joint venture, called Avro, is part of Mr Cahill's strategy to improve
the company's profitability. It would also allow Taiwan to enter the civil
airliner business.
Avro has had to clear a series of hurdles raised by Taiwanese banks lending
money to the joint venture company. Some politicians have also expressed
their doubts.
BAe said that Mr Cahill's visit was unrelated to any opposition to the joint
venture.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Cuts proposed to axe deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton may have thought his budget battles were over, at
least for this year, but two former senators came back to Washington
yesterday to sound a trumpet call for more radical measures to eliminate the
federal budget deficit entirely by 2000.
Mr Paul Tsongas and Mr Warren Rudman laid out a programme that scrapes
virtually every political nerve in the US, proposing means-testing for most
social security benefits, severe cuts in the Medicare health plan for the
elderly, and a steep increase in petrol taxes.
Mr Tsongas and Mr Rudman come from different political parties, but they
share a sense of urgency about the need to bring under control the federal
budget deficit, now rising at a rate of Dollars 12,000 (Pounds 7,800) a
second.
'That is Dollars 12,000 a second of debt that we leave to our children.
Those numbers are generationally immoral,' Mr Tsongas said yesterday at a
small rally on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, midway between the White
House and Capitol Hill.
The US deficit is projected to reach Dollars 251bn in 2000.
The central proposal of the programme outlined by Mr Tsongas and Mr Rudman
is a sliding scale means test, which would progressively reduce benefit
payments to all those whose income exceeds Dollars 40,000 a year.
They calculate that this would save Dollars 67.6bn in 2000. 'We must change
the conception in America about how this deficit is being caused: not, as
many Americans think, by waste and fraud, by too much foreign aid or by too
many congressional perks, but by entitlements,' Mr Rudman said.
The programme also proposes raising Dollars 44.8bn in 2000 through adding 50
cents a gallon to the petrol tax, Dollars 18.7bn from alcohol and tobacco
taxes, and Dollars 19bn from domestic spending cuts - in areas such as the
space station, or community development block grants paid to cities and
states.

FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japanese carmakers are showing strain over
trade friction with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE carmakers are showing increasing signs of the strains of trade
friction with the US.
Mitsubishi Motors said yesterday it was studying the possibility of selling
in Japan a new car developed by Chrysler, called the Neon, reflecting the
pressure on manufacturers to help the cause of the US car industry there.
The US wants Japanese carmakers to buy more US-manufactured parts and help
sell US cars in Japan. Vehicle trade comprises about 37 per cent of Japan's
trade surplus with the US, according to the US Department of Commerce.
As part of voluntary efforts to help rectify this imbalance the Japanese
manufacturers have indicated they are willing to buy Dollars 19bn (Pounds
12.3bn) worth of US car parts in fiscal 1994.
Mitsubishi, which is also considering the possibility of selling Chrysler's
popular LH car in Japan, has said it would import 6,000 cars from the US in
fiscal 1995. This compares with 540 cars it imported from its Diamond Star
Motors facility in the US, which was a joint venture with Chrysler until the
US company pulled out in October 1991.
Mitsubishi said it was studying what the target market for the Neon might be
and which of its distribution channels it might sell the car through.
The Neon, which was launched by Chrysler in Frankfurt earlier this month and
is scheduled to go on sale in the US in January, was developed by the US
company to compete in style, size, quality and price against Japanese
vehicles. Its planned US price tag of less than Dollars 10,000 is already
sending tremors through the Japanese car industry.
If the Neon lives up to its reputation it could deliver a heavy blow to the
Japanese car industry, already reeling under the effects of the rapid surge
in the yen's value against the dollar. This is hurting the competitiveness
of Japanese carmakers and forcing them to review global strategies, from
manufacturing to exports and pricing.
The currency movement is also forcing most Japanese car manufacturers to
raise prices in the US, with Mitsubishi vehicles increasing by an average
8.4 per cent, Nissan by 5.2 per cent and Toyota by 3.9 per cent for 1994
models.
Meanwhile, Honda has decided to shift manufacturing of most of its popular
Civic and Accord models sold in the US to North America.
The company said manufacturing of the Civic, which sells about 20,000 models
in North America, would be shifted from next spring and that of the Accord,
which sells 60,000 vehicles, from April 1996.
The move is part of the company's plans to strengthen manufacturing in North
America to avoid the worst effects of currency fluctuations.
The US is already a significant export base for Honda; last year it exported
55,000 cars from the US to the rest of the world.
While other Japanese carmakers would like to follow Honda's lead, most are
constrained by domestic considerations, such as the need to use capacity at
new facilities in Japan, maintenance of ties with domestic suppliers and the
difficulty of reducing employee levels.
But with Toyota, the largest Japanese carmaker, warning it could make a loss
if the yen stays at its current level, Honda could indeed be setting an
industry trend.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Slippery steps away from inflation: Angus Foster finds
Brazil's finance minister planning amid growth but under a cloud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE MONTHS after launching yet another plan to tackle Brazil's budget
deficit and rising inflation, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance
minister, and his advisers are trying to calm fears that shock tactics are
on the way.
Driven by rising industrial production and exports, the economy shifted gear
in the final quarter of last year, after disappointing growth since 1986. It
could grow by 4 to 5 per cent this year, but it is being hindered by
political problems and annual inflation heading for 2,000 per cent.
Car production is at record levels and the country is running a trade
surplus of more than Dollars 1bn a month. There are also encouraging signs
of improved productivity in the private sector, following cuts in both costs
and labour, in reaction to Brazil's market liberalisation policies since
1990.
But all this good news pales is overshadowed by the cloud of inflation. The
September rate is likely to be nearly 40 per cent, only 10 percentage points
below the level many economists call hyperinflation. Six months ago, it was
less than 20 per cent.
The steady rise in inflation has ignited fears that the government will come
under political pressure from Congress and other groups to launch another
shock plan, such as those which were tried, and which failed, under the two
previous presidents, Mr Sarney and Mr Collor. These aimed to squeeze
inflation out of the system by freezing prices or wages. They failed, partly
because they did not tackle the bigger problem of inflationary budget
deficits.
Brazil's chronic inflation is inspired by politics as much as economics,
institutionalised by successive years of lax spending controls, government
deficits and indexation.
According to one observer, 'the political leadership in Congress is not
scared of inflation; they don't believe the numbers the government shows
them and they don't have the will to make these difficult decisions.'
Part of the problem stems from the 1988 constitution, which transferred
tax-raising powers from the federal government to states and municipalities,
without transferring all the spending responsibilities. So, the federal
government loses nearly 70 per cent of its revenues in transfers to the
states and in wage bills. Of the rest, a further 17 per cent went in
interest payments last year. This gives the federal government little room
to cut spending. Indeed, simply to pay for essential services in 1994, an
operational deficit of about 4 per cent of forecast GDP is expected.
However, in the last three months, the government's new team has signed debt
accords with more than half Brazil's 26 states, clamped down on tax
avoidance to lift tax revenues, separated the accounts of the Central Bank
and Treasury to give greater clarity to their respective spending, and
maintained the momentum of the privatisation programme, although critics
argue that this remains too slow.
A serious setback came last week when the Supreme Court ruled
unconstitutional a new tax on all financial transactions before next year,
which the government hoped would raise the equivalent of Dollars 300m-400m a
month this year.
It is likely that the next step will be the announcement, probably in the
first week of next month, of new rules on privatisation designed to widen
the scope and scale of the programme and signal a symbolic redefinition of
the state's role in Brazil. For example, some sectors closed to the private
sector, such as electricity generation, could be gradually opened.
Second, probably in the next couple of months, the government plans to
launch a big package of fiscal reforms. These have to be finalised but could
focus on freeing some of the resources the federal government is now obliged
to give to states and municipalities. There would also have to be large
spending cuts designed to acheive a balanced budget. As a parallel
development, such longer-term reforms as the reconstitution of the
burdensome social security system would be affected through the
constitutional review.
The final stage of the programme, not to begin until the government has an
operationally balanced budget and a favourable political situation, would be
a de-indexation programme to tackle 'inertial' inflation caused by price and
wage indexing.
This neat and tidy timetable, however, could be derailed by the interest
groups which scuppered previous plans. Mr Cardoso's calls for a political
consensus to implement reform and control spending appear optimistic before
next year's presidential election, the proximity of which tends to inhibit a
will to cut public spending.
Mr Cardoso may be his own worst enemy. He denies he will run for president
next year, but is assumed by his opponents to have just that intention.
The argument between President Itamar Franco and the Party of the Brazilian
Democratic Movement (PMDB), which last week threatened to withdraw support
from the president, may reflect PMDB worries that Mr Cardoso's plans will
succeed, leaving him as a strong candidate for next year.

JAPAN has offered its main trading partners partial satisfaction on
long-standing demands to open the heavily regulated Japanese legal
profession to foreign practitioners.
The US and the European Community have pressed Japan to ease curbs on
foreign lawyers' freedom to work in one of the world's largest and most
lucrative legal markets. The issue is on the agenda of Mr John Major, UK
prime minister, now on an official visit to Japan.
Government officials in Tokyo have announced that foreign lawyers will be
allowed to run legal firms with Japanese partners, under a plan which is to
be be presented to parliament next January.
At present, foreign lawyers in Japan are only allowed to work out of court,
based on their own countries' laws. They cannot practice in court work
related to Japanese law.
The US and EC claim this is an unfair infringement of free competition. A
mere 76 foreign lawyers are registered with the Japanese bar.

FT  21 SEP 93 / US may end backing foranti-drug drive in Peru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE UPPER HUALLAGA VALLEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration has warned the Peruvian government that it may have to
end support for anti-narcotics efforts in Peru's main coca-growing zone, US
officials said in Washington yesterday.
However, contrary to indications from Lima last week, agents of the US Drugs
Enforcement Administration remain conducting coca eradication at the Santa
Luca base in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, the officials said.
Uncertainty over US anti-narcotics efforts in Latin America has been
intensified by a Dollars 47m (Pounds 30.5m) cut by the US Senate
appropriations committee in the Dollars 147m budget of the State Department
unit running drugs interdiction in Latin America.
The cut will take effect with the start of the new fiscal year next month,
if it is confirmed by a joint committee of the Senate and the House of
Representatives.
The US also supports air operations in Bolivia, Guatemala, Colombia and
Belize from this budget, as well as a sizeable number of other programmes.
The reduction comes as the the US administration is reviewing its
anti-narcotics policy after serious questions as to the benefits of the US
drugs effort abroad. US government officials said the review, which should
be completed by the end of this month, has led to sharp divisions between US
government departments connected with the efforts.
A classified National Security Council document, which forms part of the
review, concluded, according to the Washington Post, that the Pentagon's
Dollars 1.1bn drugs interdiction budget - much of it spent in central
America and the Caribbean - has proved largely ineffective in stopping
cocaine reaching consumers in the US.
Peru is the largest cultivator of coca in the world, producing two-thirds of
this leaf which is raw material for cocaine. The State Department estimates
that some 129,100 hectares are under cultivation, over half of these being
in the Huallaga Valley north-east of Lima.
Official Peruvian policy is aimed at containing the growth of coca
production and increasingly emphasises alternative development for farmers,
which includes crop substitution. However, the remoteness of the
coca-growing areas and the lack of roads militate against such solutions.

engineering studies for the CDollars 250m (Pounds 126m) project, which
involves refurbishing and expanding a disused rocket range.
Churchill is on the western shore of Hudson Bay and best known for polar
bears and Beluga whales.
The 'spaceport' is predicated on a surge in demand for small
telecommunications satellites in polar orbits a few hundred miles above the
earth. Ms Siobhan Mullen, Akjuit president, declined to name potential
customers.
Among the companies planning communications satellite networks are Motorola,
Iridium, Loral, and Orbital Sciences Corporation.
Churchill is competing for the small-satellite business with launch sites in
California, Alaska, Australia, the CIS, Sweden and Norway.
Ms Mullen predicted no more than two polar spaceports will be commercially
viable - 'whoever gets there first, wins.'
Akjuit's chairman is Mr George Richardson, a prominent Winnipeg businessman.
Its board includes a former chief executive of Telsat Canada, the
government's satellite agency, and the head of Bombardier Capital, a finance
subsidiary of the Montreal-based transport equipment group. Local aboriginal
groups are involved in the project.
Akjuit aims to begin satellite launches from Churchill by late-1995. The
facility will accommodate rockets with payloads of up to 6,000 pounds.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Greek Elections: Papandreou opens campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andreas Papandreou, the Greek opposition leader, has opened his election
campaign with the old-fashioned political rhetoric his supporters like to
hear.
He promised to raise living standards and provide full employment if his
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) returns to power at the October 10
general election.
Over 100,000 Pasok supporters crowded the Thessaloniki waterfront at the
weekend to hear the former premier speak enthusiastically, if vaguely, of
'policies that will lead to development, policies that will provide social
protection.'
Opinion polls give Pasok a a small overall majority in a new electoral law
that favours the front-running party. Yet much will depend on Mr
Papandreou's ability to convince floating voters he is fit enough to be
prime minister again.
There can be no doubting Mr Papandreou's capacity to make a political
comeback. He has survived open-heart surgery, held on to the Pasok
leadership despite three successive election defeats, and been acquitted of
charges of corruption while in office.
Now 75, he makes few public appearances and his speeches are shorter than
they used to be. He keeps a tight grip on Pasok as there is no obvious
candidate to challenge him for the leadership.
None of the six personalities mentioned as likely successors to Mr
Papandreou seem to command support from all Pasok's factions.
However, Mr Papandreou's reluctance to co-operate with potential rivals
means policy is made in a vacuum. Ask a prominent party economist how a
socialist government would cope with Greece's widening public sector deficit
and the answer is as vague as any of Mr Papandreou's campaign promises.
The conservative New Democracy party's election tactic is to provoke Mr
Papandreou into being specific. He has said he does not intend to devalue
the drachma, but refuses to be drawn on how a Pasok government might cover
the revenue shortfall that would result from cancelling the privatisation
programme.
Still, the socialists say they are committed to steadily reducing inflation
and the public sector deficit so Greece can achieve economic convergence
with the rest of the European Community by the year 2000.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Japan scales down ambitions at UN: Campaign for seat may
divide coalition

<TEXT>
JAPAN will tone down its campaign for a permanent seat on the UN Security
Council when Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, addresses the UN
General Assembly next Monday.
He is expected to avoid mentioning security council membership, in a speech
he is due to make before the assembly.
This, the latest issue to cause divisions in Japan's seven-party coalition,
indicates that the coalition could find it hard to stick to its pledge to
pursue the same foreign policy that of as the previous LDP government.
However, in a demonstration of support for UN peacekeeping operations, Tokyo
will make a Dollars 196m (Pounds 127m) contribution to the peacekeeping
budget, said officials.
The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition partner, argues that
sending troops overseas contravenes article nine of Japan's constitution,
which renounces military force to settle international conflicts.
At the other extreme, the Japan Renewal party of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the main
powerbroker behind the government, believes Japanese troops should take an
increasing part in UN peacekeeping, in line with the country's attempts to
take a more prominent part in international affairs.
The issue has been been in the public eye during the past week, with the
return home of Japanese peacekeepers from Cambodia, at the end of their
six-month mission.
Mr Hosokawa, who has avoided taking sides in this, will restrict himself to
stressing that Japan will do all it can to support UN reform so as to pursue
peace in the post-cold war era, said officials.
This is cautious by comparison with a Japanese official position paper, sent
to the UN secretariat in July, in which Tokyo offers to assume all security
council duties necessary.
Mr Hosokawa is prepared to compromise with the SDP because the government's
top priorities are the reform of Japan's political system - the main item of
business on a 90-day extraordinary parliamentary session which began last
week - and measures to revive the flagging economy.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S crackdown on political corruption claimed its most famous corporate
victim last night as prosecutors arrested Mr Teruzo Yoshino, chairman of
Shimizu, the leading Japanese contractor, for the alleged bribery of a
provincial governor.
Mr Yoshino, aged 75, denies he provided funds to Mr Fujio Takeuchi, the
former governor of Ibaraki prefecture north-east of Tokyo, in the hope that
the company would win contracts for a range of planned public works
projects.
'No, absolutely not,' Mr Yoshino, whose home was raided by investigators,
told reporters earlier yesterday. 'I would never do anything as silly as
attempting to bribe someone.'
However, 15 other construction company employees have been arrested in the
past year for illegally providing money to local government officials,
including Mr Takeuchi who is already charged with illegally receiving Y55m
(Pounds 345,000) from the industry.
The arrest last night follows the questioning of Mr Takeuchi and, according
to the prosecutors, allegedly arises from Y10m that he claims to have
received from Mr Yoshino in December last year.
On Sunday Japan and the US concluded a round of construction market
negotiations at which Tokyo was urged to ensure that foreign companies have
an opportunity to bid for all public works contracts.
Mr Yoshino, in his role as federation chairman, said earlier yesterday that
the request was excessive, and Japan should experiment with a 'conditional'
open bidding system to replace the present designated bidder system.
The spate of arrests and confessions in the past year have provided US
negotiators with evidence in their attempts to demolish the dango, the
cartels which allegedly control the awarding of contracts by pre-selecting a
winner and ensuring that other bidders put in estimates far higher than the
'winner'.
However, the allegations against Mr Yoshino reflect the at times fierce
competition among Japanese contractors for lucrative provincial contracts,
particularly dams, civic centres and universities, all of which were planned
in Ibaraki prefecture.
Apart from highlighting the sometimes unsavoury links between politicians
and contractors, the investigation has drawn attention to the priorities of
provincial governments, alleged to outlay huge sums on unnecessary dams and
government buildings, while neglecting less lucrative but more needed
projects.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hafez al-Assad of Syria warned in an interview published yesterday
that only Israel had benefited from last week's outline peace agreement with
the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
He said there was no justification for the secret talks between the PLO and
Israel. 'In my opinion the PLO has lost, as have the Arabs,' he told the
Egyptian newspaper al-Akhbar.
Mr Assad stopped short of threatening to oppose the agreement, but said
there was nothing he could do to prevent conflict between those who
supported it and those who were against. 'If we wanted to oppose the
agreement we could have made it fail,' he declared.
But he said that he had told Mr Yassir Arafat that it was the PLO leader's
duty to unite Palestinians in order to avoid the risk of massacres.
Mr Arafat travelled to Amman yesterday for talks with King Hussein in an
attempt to calm fears that Jordan was being excluded from crucial issues
affecting the region. In spite of initial reservations, King Hussein has
endorsed the Palestinian deal. There has, however, been a noticeable shift
in policy over the past week from the traditional joint
Jordanian-Palestinian stance to one where the kingdom's interests take
priority.
The two key issues expected to be discussed by Mr Arafat and the king were
Jordan's economic relationship with the West Bank, and the future status of
the kingdom's Palestinians, who make up more than half the population.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday called a conference of potential donors to drum up aid in
support of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said he and Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, would convene a donors' conference to help
co-ordinate aid for Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
'Today, on behalf of President Clinton, I announce our intention to lead a
wide-ranging effort not simply to give peace a chance but to ensure that it
will not fail,' Mr Christopher said in a speech at New York's Columbia
University.
Administration officials said the purpose of the conference was not just
economic, but to demonstrate the international community's backing for last
week's agreement and to maintain momentum for the peace process.
Mr Christopher said the US would itself contribute Dollars 250m (Pounds
162m) in cash, loans and guarantees in the next two years.
Senior administration officials said the conference was likely to be held in
Washington in the next two weeks, taking advantage of the arrival in the US
of finance and foreign ministers attending the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as the United
Nations General Assembly.
They hoped the conference would produce several hundred million dollars of
commitments to cover the next 18 months, making a successful start towards
the World Bank's Dollars 300m a year estimate of investment needs over the
next 10 years.
Reuter adds from Washington: The International Monetary Fund said yesterday
it had approved a three-year, Dollars 569m (Pounds 370m) loan for Egypt to
back up the country's efforts to open up and reform its economy.
'The overall objective of Egypt's medium term reform programme. . . is to
create a decentralised, outward-oriented market economy with sustained
growth,' the IMF said.
Although Egypt does not plan to draw down on the loan, Cairo needed IMF
approval of its economic reform programme to win more than Dollars 3bn in
debt forgiveness from the US and other creditor nations.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Tokyo to consider PoW compensation payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday agreed to consider British proposals to encourage voluntary
compensation payments from Japanese companies which exploited prisoners of
war during the second world war.
During talks in Tokyo, Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa told Mr
John Major, his British counterpart, that the issue had been legally closed
by the 1951 San Francisco treaty. That provided a lump sum of Dollars 1.5m
(Pounds 970m) to be shared by 12,000 former British prisoners and is
regarded as unacceptable by PoW organisations.
However, Mr Major said Mr Hosokawa had agreed to consider 'non-government
measures' to defuse the issue. Under the UK plan, companies such as
Mitsubishi and Nissan, which benefited by PoW labour during the war, would
donate voluntarily to a non-government compensation fund.
However, the offer failed to satisfy the Japanese Labour Camp Survivors'
Association, which said it would take legal action unless further progress
were made quickly.
British officials said agreement on voluntary compensation was unlikely
before Mr Major leaves Tokyo today for a two-day visit to Malaysia.
Britain accepts that Mr Hosokawa took a political risk by apologising
formally for the behaviour of Japan's imperial army during the war. Tokyo's
freedom of movement is also constrained by the likelihood that any agreement
with Britain would set off an avalanche of similar claims from PoW
organisations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOCIAL Democratic party, the largest group in Japan's coalition
government, yesterday chose Mr Tomiichi Murayama as its new chairman in an
election highlighting party members' unease at their alliance with
conservative parties.
Mr Murayama, 69, was backed by most factions within the SDP, formerly the
Japan Socialist party, but 33 per cent of members did not vote and 22 per
cent of the voters supported a far-left candidate, Mr Masatoshi Ito, who
opposes political reforms proposed by the coalition.
Before standing in the election, Mr Murayama had criticised the reforms, but
he has agreed to offer public support for four bills which the coalition
government hopes to push through during an extraordinary session of
parliament, which began on Friday.
Mr Murayama replaces Mr Sadao Yamahana, who resigned after the SDP's poor
showing at a July election, when it lost votes to newer parties and saw its
representation cut from 134 to 70 in the lower house of parliament.
Since the election, party members have disagreed over whether traditional
left-leaning policies, including support for totalitarian North Korea,
should be replaced or whether the party was losing supporters because of the
move towards the middle ground.
Mr Murayama was a compromise candidate who had not planned to stand for the
leadership until pushed by more pragmatic leaders, who feared that a
candidate too closely linked to the pro-reform group of Mr Yamahana could
lose.
However, Mr Murayama had joined a pro-reform group in 1972, when he opposed
the attempts by the far left to take control of policy-making. The son of a
fisherman, he was elected to local government after serving as a
representative of a fishing co-operative in the south of Japan.
He has chaired study groups which have defended Japan's ban on rice imports
and his links to fishing co-operatives mean that he will be under pressure
to take a stand against other proposals to liberalise food im-ports.
After his election yesterday, Mr Murayama said the SDP would continue to
support the coalition government and to reform itself. But Mr Ito argued
that the unexpectedly large number of votes he received 'gives me a strong
foundation on which to fight against political reforms'.
While Mr Murayama pledged support for the coalition, he also campaigned
against Japan's 3 per cent value added tax, which several other members of
the seven-party coalition want to increase to as much as 10 per cent.
The SDP also differs with most of its coalition partners on defence issues,
including Japan's quest for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.
Mr Murayama will be repeatedly torn between his loyalty to SDP policy and
the need to hold the coalition together.

<TEXT>
BUSINESSMEN in Taiwan and Hong Kong believe Beijing should be awarded the
Olympics so as further to entrench China's move away from communism.
Businessmen claim the west has an interest in supporting China's current
leadership which has committed itself to economic reform and the award of
the Olympics would secure the leaders' position.
China's failure to win the 2000 Olympics would also create widespread
resentment among Chinese communities outside the mainland.
Many people in Taiwan and Hong Kong see the Olympics as a recognition of
Chinese culture and civilisation, not the government in Beijing.
In Taiwan especially, pride in being part of China's civilisation transcends
anti-communism and dislike of the current regime. A rebuff by the
International Olympic Committee, which votes on Thursday, would be seen as
just another rejection of China by the west. Disappointment would be further
reinforced as Beijing has promised to stage some events in Taiwan and Hong
Kong.
It is claimed that Beijing will be more careful in its treatment of Hong
Kong and in the wooing of Taiwan with the games than without them.
China has bowed to world pressure by agreeing to a human rights probe just
days before the Olympics decision, the International Federation of Human
Rights (FIDH) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Daniel Jacoby, FIDH president, told a news conference his group had
received an invitation to investigate claims of human rights abuse from Chen
Xitong, president of the Beijing Olympic Bid Committee, during weekend talks
in Monte Carlo.

The Russian parliament has postponed until further notice a final vote on

Mr Medvedev said an increasing number of deputies supported his
behind-the-scenes efforts to get parliament to drop its proposed ban, which
it had been expected to examine last Friday. The proposed restrictions first
appeared in parliament as a result of lobbying by Russian commercial banks
seeking protection from foreign competition, but has been opposed by the
government, central bank, and Mr Medvedev's sub-committee.

according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, writes Michael

In the introduction to his annual report to the general assembly, which

conflicts 'where major powers are not willing to venture themselves.'
At the same time, the UN was struggling to deal with problems of the poorest
states in which rich nations were no longer so interested now that decades
of ideological competition for their votes were at an end.

THE JAPANESE central bank is expected to cut its main lending rate by at
least half a percentage point today, in the latest attempt to pull the
economy out of recession.
The cut in the official discount rate, from the already record low of 2.5
per cent which has held for the past eight months, was predicted yesterday
by NHK public television, a normally reliable forecaster of official rate
changes.
Bank of Japan officials refused to comment. But a senior government official
said he would not be surprised if the long-expected rate cut happened today,
assuming the central bank followed its usual line of timing rate changes for
maximum psychological impact.
Domestic and international pressure for a cut in interest rates has been
rising in line with a stream of gloomy economic indicators. Gross national
product fell an annualised 2 per cent in the three months to June and is
probably declining in the current quarter, so putting Japan into recession.
If the central bank does move as expected, this should relieve some of the
disappointment that met a government pump-priming package of deregulation,
measures to pass on the benefits of the high yen to consumers and Y6,150bn
(Pounds 38bn) of public spending announced last week. It included neither a
rate cut nor reductions in income tax, as demanded by Japanese industry.
Possible tax cuts, a politically divisive issue, are being studied by a
government panel.
A senior International Monetary Fund official welcomed the package but said
recent economic data were so disappointing that more budgetary and monetary
action could well be needed. A 'strong cocktail' of fiscal and monetary
stimulus should be considered, he said. The US has also urged Japan to make
income tax cuts, say Japanese officials.
Yet the Bank of Japan has been cautious about cutting rates partly because
it wants to avoid repeating the liquidity-fed rise in asset prices that
preceded the downturn and partly because it believes industry needs to cut
more capacity.
Nevertheless, the bank cut the official discount rate three times in 1991,
twice last year and once last February, from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
A rate cut is like to have a psychological impact and help restrain the
yen's rise, but will not bring a marked cut in companies' borrowing costs,
said analysts. If the discount rate does come down today, commercial banks
are expected to drop their prime rates on October 1, in line with previous
practice. However, a decreasing number of banks maintain a tight link
between prime and actual lending rates because of the pressure on margins
from the need for heavy bad debt provisions.
Emiko Terazono adds: Japan's residential and commercial land prices have
declined for a second consecutive year, the longest fall on record.
According to a land price survey released by the National Land Agency,
residential land prices fell by an average 3.6 per cent as of July 1 from a
year before, while commercial areas saw a 7.7 per cent decline. The survey,
which started in 1975, is likely to prompt an early lifting of the
government's 'land price monitoring system', aimed to curb price increases
in designated areas.
An easing of the monitoring system was included in the coalition
government's emergency economic package announced last Thursday. While land
prices, especially in cities, remain high relative to income levels for the
ordinary Japanese, a further fall could hurt the country's banks, which hold
land as collateral for bad loans.
Residential land in the Tokyo area declined 12.3 per cent after a 12.7 per
cent fall last year. Tokyo's central 23 wards saw drops of 20 per cent, with
Chuo ward, the business centre, registering a 37.9 per cent decline.
Meanwhile confidence among Japanese consumers declined sharply in August,
says Dentsu, the world's largest advertising and marketing agency.
According to a survey, the higher yen, cold summer weather, and increasing
reports of corporate restructurings have depressed consumers' outlook on the
economy.
Last month 37.4 per cent of those surveyed thought the economy would worsen,
a sharp jump from 21.8 per cent in July and 21.1 per cent in June. Over 54
per cent said they would curb spending against 43.2 per cent in July.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Assad cool on deal with Israel

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hafez al-Assad of Syria warned in an interview published yesterday
that only Israel had benefited from last week's outline peace agreement with
the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
He said there was no justification for the secret talks between the PLO and
Israel. 'In my opinion the PLO has lost, as have the Arabs,' he told the
Egyptian newspaper al-Akhbar.
Mr Assad stopped short of threatening to oppose the agreement, but said
there was nothing he could do to prevent conflict between those who
supported it and those who were against. 'If we wanted to oppose the
agreement we could have made it fail,' he declared.
But he said that he had told Mr Yassir Arafat that it was the PLO leader's
duty to unite Palestinians in order to avoid the risk of massacres.
Mr Arafat travelled to Amman yesterday for talks with King Hussein in an
attempt to calm fears that Jordan was being excluded from crucial issues
affecting the region. Despite initial reservations, King Hussein has
endorsed the Palestinian deal. There has, however, been a noticeable shift
in policy over the past week from traditional joint Jordanian-Palestinian
stance to one where the kingdom's interests take priority.
The two key issues expected to be discussed by Mr Arafat and the king were
Jordan's economic relationship with the West Bank, and the future status of
the kingdom's Palestinians who make up over half the population.
Mr Assad, whose relationship with Mr Arafat has been marked by long periods
of hostility, said the news of the PLO-Israel agreement had come as a
'painful surprise' and he claimed Syria had postponed many critical issues
because of the Palestinians.
Mr Assad's comments underline the urgency felt by the US for there to be
swift progress on talks between Israel and Syria to resolve the Golan
Heights issue. He has made it clear he will accept nothing less than full
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, seized in the 1967 war.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Calls to liberalise industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders across Europe would welcome increased competition,
especially in the telecommunications sector, but most believe they are
unable to persuade their governments to accelerate liberalisation.
This is the principal finding of a survey carried out by Harris Research on
behalf of British Telecom of the UK which examined attitudes to
liberalisation in eight continental European countries.
The business leaders believe increased liberalisation of telecommunications
would cut costs, increase efficiency and improve quality of service.
Britain has the most competitive telecommunications market in Europe and BT
has been pressing for a speeding up of the liberalisation process in other
countries.
Some 60 per cent of the senior business people consulted chose
telecommunications as the industry they would like to see liberalised.
The survey shows that almost three-quarters of large companies are prepared
to consider changing their telecommunications suppliers and believe that
doing so would not expose their businesses to unnecessary risk.
The greatest resistance to change came from France and Sweden where only
about one- fifth of business people showed a willingness to change supplier;
94 per cent of Italians, on the other hand, said they would be happy to go
to an alternative supplier.
However, companies were virtually unanimous in lacking confidence in their
ability to influence their national governments to accelerate
liberalisation.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Kohl attempts to reunite coalition after protest vote
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday chaired a crisis meeting of leaders of
Germany's three coalition parties in an effort to paper over cracks in his
ruling alliance. The parties suffered a decisive vote of no confidence in
local elections in Hamburg on Sunday.
Both Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and the opposition Social
Democratic party admitted that a big protest vote in Hamburg in favour of
the Greens, two extreme rightwing parties and an anti-party alliance was a
warning to the traditional political establishment.
The result was worse for Mr Kohl's CDU, with a slump in support from 35 per
cent in 1991 to 25 per cent on Sunday, in spite of a swing against the
ruling SPD government which saw it lose its overall majority in the city.
SPD support fell from 48 per cent to 40.4 per cent.
Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, warned that the splintering
of support for the main parties would undermine future coalition government.
The main parties must tackle the fundamental causes of protest, he said,
including rising crime, unemployment, and the lack of cheap housing.
The meeting yesterday did produce agreement on a social insurance plan to
pay for nursing care for the elderly. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and
leader of the liberal Free Democratic party, which lost all its seats in the
Hamburg election, promised that he would not allow the coalition to collapse
over the issue.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the SPD, said the continuing rise of the
extreme rightwing parties - although they failed to win any seats, they
gained a combined 7.6 per cent of the vote - was 'alarming'.
The Greens were the big winners in the city election, almost doubling their
vote from 7.1 to 13.5 per cent, followed by the Statt Partei - literally the
'Instead of a Party' - which won eight seats in Hamburg with 5.6 per cent of
the vote, although it has no political platform.
The extreme rightwing parties, the Republicans and German People's Union
(DVU) split the far right vote.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Spain cuts reserve cash requirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday cut the reserve cash requirement it imposes on
the banking sector from 3 per cent to 2 per cent, thus freeing some Pta440bn
(Pounds 2.2bn) of deposits that had been trapped, interest free, with the
bank authority.
The cut , which brings the domestic banking sector closer in line with
Europe, follows a half a point cut to 10 per cent in the bank's key
intervention rate at the begining of this month. It should enable the
private banks and saving institutions to lower the cost of borrowing.
It will also reduce pressure on the interbank market where the bank has been
forced to increase sharply the volume of its routine financing to credit
institutions.
Liquidity on the interbank market has been very narrow. Currency
uncertainties have left the institutions short of pesetas and the strong
demand for funding has hampered the central bank's monetary policy.
Potential income from the funds freed by the latest cut represents nearly 4
per cent of the total pre-tax profit of domestic banks last year. However
the impact of the cut on this year's bank results should be more muted
because the sector, although under pressure to increase its lending, is
nervous of increasing bad debts.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Drop in car sales slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST European new car sales have posted their smallest monthly decline this
year, slipping only 1.5 per cent in August to an estimated 1.03m.
However, the European new car market is distorted in August by the UK, where
20 to 25 per cent of annual new car registrations take place in the period.
The UK is also the only market in west Europe where sales have been growing
this year, albeit from a depressed level.
UK new car sales in the month were 17.8 per cent higher than a year ago at
440,000, and accounted for 43 per cent of the west European market.
Excluding the UK, new car sales in west Europe were still 12.2 per cent
lower than a year ago. The rate of decline moderated in some markets,
notably in Germany and Spain, while sales were higher in the Netherlands,
Norway, Denmark and Austria.
New car sales in August were lower than a year ago in 12 of 17 markets
across west Europe, while in the first eight months sales were lower than a
year ago in 16 of 17 markets, with only the UK achieving any growth with an
increase of 11.8 per cent. Overall, in the first eight months sales fell by
15.9 per cent to 8.03m from 9.55m in the corresponding period a year ago,
according to industry estimates.
August sales in Germany fell year-on-year by 10.3 per cent.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Most French oppose Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of French - 54 per cent - would now vote against the Maastricht
treaty, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, exactly one year
after the referendum that gave the European union pact a 1.1 per cent margin
of approval.
The Sofres poll, conducted for Le Figaro newspaper and Europe 1 radio
station, has sombre implications for France's ruling coalition parties and
their unity in European and presidential elections in the next two years.
The survey shows the French split, on Europe as on other issues like
unemployment, between what most of them expect to happen and what most of
them want to happen. Thus, 79 per cent expect their government will press on
with European construction. But the share of those who believe this will
benefit France has dropped over the past year from 41 to 33 per cent.
A plurality - 46 per cent - want 'a pause' in European integration, a
sentiment related probably to the fact that 42 per cent say they would
prefer the franc to float free of the D-Mark in order to reflate the
economy, as opposed to 39 per cent whose priority is still a strong franc as
France's passport to European monetary union.
The poll highlights the problem for Mr Edouard Balladur, the pro-European
premier, leading a coalition of his own RPR Gaullist party which remains
almost two-thirds against Maastricht and of the centre-right UDF whose
majority still backs Maastricht. If, in next June's European parliament
elections, this division is reflected in two separate electoral lists
(roughly along RPR and UDF lines), it may tear Mr Balladur's government
apart.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Flexibility sought on works councils

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European employers body, Unice, yesterday accepted the inevitability of
European Community legislation on employee consultation and pressed for
greater flexibility than contained in the existing works council directive.
The works councils for employee consultation could be one of the first
directives to be pushed through the social chapter mechanism of the
Maastricht treaty which excludes the UK.
The directive will require up to 1200 multinationals operating in the EC to
convene works councils at least once a year.
Yesterday Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, said the
social partners - unions and employers - should work together with the EC
Commission to find an acceptable alternative to the current draft directive.
He said: 'The directive as it stands will not achieve its stated objective,
which is to improve the information and consultation of workers. However
Unice is ready to sit down with the Commission and European unions to
develop a positive and constructive procedure that is acceptable to all
parties.'
Unice, including the Confederation of British Industry, is now ready to
accept some legal underpinning to achieve the ends of European-wide employee
consultation but insists on greater flexibility with regard to the means.
At the same Brussels meeting the multi-national business forum launched a
report, 'Thriving on diversity', which seeks to illustrate benefits of a
range of consultation methods. The report argues there is little difference
in the provision of strategic and financial data between countries such as
Germany where there are extensive rights to employee information and
countries such as the UK where there are no legal provisions.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Paris orders job cuts curb: Balladur demands redundancy
reviews by state companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday ordered
state-owned companies to minimise job cuts, demanding they review redundancy
plans in the light of a five-year jobs package to be debated in parliament
later this month.
The plan urges employers to use short-time working, part-time employment and
early retirement as ways of avoiding sacking staff. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the
government spokesman, said public companies' redundancy plans would be
rejected by the state if they failed to use such measures as fully as
possible.
Yesterday's statement followed a meeting of several ministers, chaired by Mr
Balladur, which had been called in response to a wave of public sector
redundancy plans. On one day last week, dubbed Black Wednesday by the French
press, state-owned companies announced about 13,000 job cuts.
The redundancy plans, which included large job cuts at Air France, Bull, the
computer manufacturer, Thomson CSF, the defence electronics group, and
Snecma, the air engine manufacturer, represented a serious blow to Mr
Balladur, who has said that curbing unemployment growth is his top priority.
The unemployment rate, which stands at 11.7 per cent and is forecast to
exceed 12 per cent by the end of the year, is regarded as the government's
biggest political liability. Last week's job losses sparked an angry
reaction from unions who demanded a six-month employment freeze at public
companies.
Mr Balladur's orders immediately met with a favourable response from
Thomson-CSF. The electronics group said it had started negotiations with
unions yesterday to propose a cut in working hours in exchange for a cut in
redundancies. The company said it might be possible to avoid all of the
planned 1,600 job cuts due by the end of next year if the unions accepted
its plans.
Economists, however, were sceptical about the impact of Mr Balladur's
statement. They said many state-owned groups had already received the
go-ahead for job cutting plans. The government's budget deficit, targeted at
FFr317bn (Pounds 36.1bn) this year, reduced its ability to support state
industry and necessitated economy measures at state companies.

<TEXT>
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Turkish premier Tansu Ciller yesterday
agreed to set up a committee to discuss neo-Nazi attacks and citizenship
rights for Germany's large Turkish minority.
The Turkish government is known to favour the introduction of dual
citizenship for the 1.8m Turks permanently residing in the country. But Mr
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), together with its conservative
Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU), want instead to slightly
ease access to German citizenship, which Turks can only obtain if they give
up their own passports.
Local Turkish organisations yesterday said the committee would probably do
little to help the integration of Turks who have been regular targets of
racist violence.
Ms Ciller is expected to further discuss ways in which Turks in Germany
could receive political rights as she meets Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign
minister, today and a member of the Free Democrats (FDP). The Turkish
premier is also due to meet business leaders.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Spain cuts reserve cash requirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday cut the reserve cash requirement it imposes on
the banking sector from 3 per cent to 2 per cent, thus freeing some Pta440bn
(Pounds 2.2bn) of deposits that had been trapped, interest free, with the
bank authority.
The cut , which brings the domestic banking sector closer in line with
Europe, follows a half a point cut to 10 per cent in the bank's key
intervention rate at the begining of this month. It should enable the
private banks and saving institutions to lower the cost of borrowing.
It will also reduce pressure on the interbank market where the bank has been
forced to increase sharply the volume of its routine financing to credit
institutions. Liquidity on the interbank market has been very narrow.
Currency uncertainties have left the institutions short of pesetas and the
strong demand for funding has hampered the central bank's monetary policy.
Potential income from the funds freed by the latest cut represents nearly 4
per cent of the total pre-tax profit of domestic banks last year. However
the impact of the cut on this year's bank results should be more muted
because the sector, although under pressure to increase its lending, is
nervous of increasing bad debts.
'The gain for the banks is that they will be able to use the new funds to
lower their lending while keeping their balance sheets undamaged,' said Mr
Jose Manuel Arrojo, banking analyst of the Madrid securities house, AB
Asesores.
Several of Spain's financial institutions have in recent weeks cut their
preferential lending rates to below 10 per cent but they have maintained
credit for all but top clients at a minimum of about 16.5 per cent. In
August non-performing loans grew by some Pta35bn to account for 7.4 per cent
of all loan portfolios.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Bosnia talks again fail to progress

SECRET talks on board a British warship aimed at securing a Bosnian peace
deal ended in failure last night, according to United Nations officials.
International mediators said there had been some progress but acted swiftly
to call off a meeting at Sarajevo airport today, at which Bosnia's three
ethnic leaders were supposed to sign a peace deal.
The decision came after a last-minute attempt to wring concessions from Serb
and Croat powerbrokers and win endorsement from Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the
Bosnian president, for the republic's partition plan, ended without success.
'There won't be a meeting in Sarajevo tomorrow because all sides have not
shown sufficient flexibility', said Mr John Mills, spokesman for mediators
Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.
The collapse of prospects for a speedy settlement occurred after the two
envoys had sequestered Mr Izetbegovic and his Serb and Croat adversaries for
secretive meetings on board a British naval vessel.
They tried to persuade Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban and his patron Mr
Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, to grant access to ports on the
Adriatic ports to the mostly Moslem republic of Mr Izetbegovic - one of
three ethnic statelets envisaged under the partition plan.
Mr Mills cited progress after the meetings. But details were unavailable.
The mediators earlier had announced that the three leaders would sign a deal
today at Sarajevo airport.
The talks on board the carrier HMS Invincible appeared to be aimed at
stepping up pressure, especially on the isolated Mr Izetbegovic. But it was
unclear how they intended to squeeze more land out of victorious Serb and
Croat leaders who at the weekend reiterated their refusal to make
concessions.
Mr Izetbegovic on September 1 rejected the proposed maps because they left
his republic land-locked with slim prospects for economic viability.
Mr Slavisa Rakovic, adviser to Mr Karadzic, was unmoved last night in Pale,
the mountain stronghold of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, by the
breakdown of talks. He dismissed Mr Izetbegovic's rejection as
'manoeuvring'. He appeared to believe that the outgunned, besieged Moslems
would have little choice but to sign the proposed package sooner or later.
The key sticking points remain Serb refusal to restore parts of eastern
Bosnia which were mostly Moslem before the war to Moslem control and Croat
intransigence over ports on the Adriatic.
Russia may be unwilling to send extra troops to help enforce a peace
agreement in Bosnia, General Pavel Grachev, its defence minister, has
indicated, writes David White in Moscow.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, said General Grachev made
clear in talks yesterday that he was not contemplating an increase.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Warsaw sends reform warning eastwards: The Polish economy
had hitherto been a source of encouragement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTORAL victory of the two political parties with their roots in
Poland's communist past imparts a new and negative spin to the country's
track record as the harbinger of change in a volatile region.
It was Polish economists, led by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, working closely with
US academic advisers such as Harvard professor Jeffrey Sachs, who pioneered
'shock therapy' economic reforms in eastern Europe four years ago.
After taking the medicine, Poland became the first country to plunge into
recession in 1990 and the first to resume economic growth two years later.
Now, as the election results have made clear, Poles have become the first to
register a strong political protest against the social and economic costs of
the painful transition to a market economy.
The resurgence of Poland's neo-communists could change not only the
political map of Poland but send shudders throughout the former Soviet
empire.
In Hungary, the conservative coalition, which has introduced market reforms
that have attracted more than Dollars 5bn in foreign investment, faces a
similar backlash. In Budapest, the xenophobic nationalist right, led by Mr
Istvan Csurka, has been making the headlines. But the reformed communists,
led by Mr Gulya Horn, have also been vying to take votes away from the
centre parties, including the youthful Fidesz party.
Only the Czech Republic has been able to produce a leader with the tenacity
to argue the pro-market reform case tirelessly and clearly, in speeches and
through his weekly column in a popular newspaper: Mr Vaclav Klaus, a
passionate advocate of privatisation.
The promise of Poland's neo-communists to square the circle of reform
without pain is clearly gaining credence. Lithuania, Poland's north-eastern
neighbour, sent out the first warning signal six months ago when this former
Soviet Baltic state re-elected the new-style communists to power.
Until now the success of Poland's economic reforms, measured by well-stocked
shops, rapidly rising industrial growth and labour productivity, a growing
inflow of foreign capital, declining inflation and a successful switch to
western markets after the collapse of Comecon, has been a great source of
encouragement to the embattled pro-market reformers in the former Soviet
states.
The positive results of Poland's adherence to tight spending and budget
deficit targets, imposed by the International Monetary Fund, helped the
small band of Russian reform economists to persuade President Boris Yeltsin
to support their efforts to stabilise the economy.
The Polish experience thus gave substance to the intellectual arguments of
those in Russia who favoured rapid economic reform.
It helped them overcome the siren songs of powerful men from the factory
nomenklatura elite who argued that it was impossible for the
heavily-militarised Soviet command economy to be transformed into a
functioning market economy in a hurry.
The trump card of the go-slow brigade was, and remains, the argument that
the social costs of high unemployment and declining living standards would
make such change politically impossible and raise the risk of a bloody
revolt.
This argument echoed through the 10-week-long Polish election campaign with
subtle but important differences. Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the 39-year-old
leader of Poland's Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), does not argue against
the basic thrust of the economic reform strategy introduced by Mr
Balcerowicz, nor does he ignore the benefits of IMF and World Bank
supervision or the need to continue privatisation.
Under its pragmatic new leaders, the SLD presented itself to the electorate
as the party best able to guarantee the continuation of economic reform.
This could only continue, the party's young leaders argued, if the economic
and social costs borne by the poorest sections of the community were
alleviated.
But to deliver the goods, Mr Kwasniewski believes that it will take at least
four more years of market-orientated reform under a stable government.
Without any false modesty he is putting his party forward as the guarantor
of that stability.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Poland's ex-communists seek partners

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S politicians yesterday began a search for government coalition
partners in the wake of Sunday's election victory by the former communist
Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) which won a fifth of the votes and more than
one third of the seats in the lower house of parliament.
Preliminary results put the farmers PSL movement into second place, with a
15 per cent share of the vote. This party, which collaborated with the
communists in the post-war years, is the dominant force in rural areas where
40 per cent of Poland's voters live and work.
Final results giving a breakdown of the 460 seats are expected tomorrow and
it is then that President Lech Walesa will name a party leader to form the
next government. He has already stated that he will choose the largest
single party, although he has no constitutional obligation to do so.
Yesterday Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the 39-year-old leader of the SLD said
that he was 'elastic' about possible talks with coalition partners. But he
made no secret of the fact he would prefer to work in the next government
with the Democratic Union (UD), a mainstream Solidarity-based party which
won only 10.5 per cent of the vote.
According to one western banker in Warsaw, a coalition between the UD and
the SLD would provide guarantees 'that privatisation would continue, maybe
in a slightly different form with possibly a greater accent on employee buy
outs'. The rural-based PSL is regarded as the most suspicious of
privatisation.
Leaders of the UD met last night to discuss their next move. Earlier in the
day, however, many reacted to the initial election results with talk of
going into opposition and leaving responsibility for the next government in
the hands of the PSL and the SLD.
Poles in general yesterday greeted the news of the victory by parties with a
communist past calmly and foreign exchange vendors reported no signs of a
rush to purchase currency in response to fears of higher inflation. Demand
remained strong on the Warsaw stock exchange, albeit at a lower price level.

The National Bank of Yugoslavia is to issue a 10bn dinar note to replace
currency made almost worthless by a devastating daily inflation rate of 20
per cent, Reuter reports from Belgrade.
The new white, black and red note will be issued today, the Belgrade-based
news agency Tanjug quoted central bank officials as saying. It is worth
Dollars 6 on Belgrade's foreign currency black market.
This will be the third new banknote issued in a month, each with more and
more zeroes to it. In mid-August the bank issued a 500m dinar note then
worth Dollars 3.50 and now worth 30 US cents.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Cable network makes Dollars 9.5bn competing bid for
Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
A TAKEOVER battle broke out last night over Paramount Communications, the US
entertainment group, as QVC Network launched a hostile Dollars 9.5bn (Pounds
6.16bn) bid to compete with an agreed Dollars 8.2bn bid announced by cable
company Viacom International nine days ago.
QVC is a fast-growing home shopping cable network, headed for the past nine
months by Mr Barry Diller, a prominent film industry figure who developed
Fox into America's fourth national network for Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation.
QVC is much smaller than both Paramount and Viacom but its bid has the
support of its two major corporate shareholders, cable programmer Liberty
Media and cable service company Comcast, which have agreed to bolster its
finances for the fight by each purchasing Dollars 500m of QVC convertible
preferred stock.
Their support could boost the credibility of QVC's bid on Wall Street and
help bolster its share price, which could come under pressure when stock
markets open today and absorb the new offer.
The bid was announced after the markets closed last night. At that point,
QVC's shares stood at Dollars 56, down Dollars 3 1/2 , on the Nasdaq market,
amid rumours of an impending announcement. That makes its offer of 0.893 QVC
shares and Dollars 30 in cash worth Dollars 80 for each Paramount share.
Viacom's offer of Dollars 9.10 in cash and a mix of stock is worth Dollars
63.175 a share, based on last night's closing prices, and values Paramount
at Dollars 7.5bn. Paramount's shares closed at Dollars 69 5/8 , up Dollars 1
1/4 .
Mr Diller said it was his long-term goal to build a multi-media company and
QVC, with consistent strong growth, generating cash flow of more than
Dollars 173m, little debt, and strategic partners willing to invest Dollars
1bn, was the ideal company to make an offer for Paramount.
Seeking to capitalise on his Hollywood reputation, he said that a
'combination between Paramount and QVC rests on the belief that the future
belongs to the people who create the best programming for each emerging form
of distribution'.
The new bid is likely to be bitterly fought by Paramount and Viacom, which
reiterated in a statement yesterday morning that no hostile takeover would
be permitted to obstruct their ' well-considered' merger agreement.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Brussels to press US over farm trade accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community ministers agreed early today to seek new flexibility from
the US on the Blair House farm trade accord without formally renegotiating
the deal.
Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EC trade negotiator, praised the compromise by
35 foreign, trade and agriculture ministers meeting in Brussels, declaring
that it had 'cleared the air'.
Sir Leon, who had fiercely resisted French demands to reopen the accord,
said the Community was unanimously agreed on the need to respect a December
15 deadline for reaching final agreement on the Gatt Uruguay Round.
The compromise came shortly after 3am this morning after 12 hours of talks.
It followed a Franco-German initiative to avert a political crisis within
the Community over the world trade talks.
During the late-night talks, Sir Leon complained however that proposals
based on a Franco-German draft paper risked tying his hands in forthcoming
negotiations with the US. His intervention provoked a stormy response from
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister.
The essentially French paper, supported without much obvious enthusiasm by
Germany, identified many of the chief French concerns about the Blair House
accord limiting subsidised food exports.
It followed demands from some ministers that the European Commission should
test whether the US was ready to accept a 'clarification' of Blair House to
accommodate the French and head off a full-scale political crisis in the
already embattled Community. Several ministers voiced concern that the
French-German draft could tempt the Clinton administration to blame the EC
for a breakdown in the Gatt talks, or encourage the US to produce
counter-demands.
US officials remained adamant last night that 'clarifications' could not be
allowed to serve as a guise for reopening the pact.
The draft identified five difficulties with Blair House. These included an
extension of the so-called peace clause preventing unilateral sanctions by
either side; flexibility to make the cuts on subsidised food exports at any
oint during the six-year life of the agreement; ensuring that EC food
mountains are exempt from export curbs; strengthening of existing provisions
to prevent surges in cheap US cereal substitutes; and guarantees that the EC
will get a full share of any growth in world food markets.
The draft makes clear, however, that these demands do not amount to a new
negotiating mandate for the European Commission. It emerged hours after a
snap summit between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois
Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in Paris.
A key sticking point centred on Sir Leon's objections that the text could be
interpreted as supporting France's contention that the Blair House deal is
incompatible with the EC's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Earlier Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, warned that the EC would be
paralysed by recriminations if the Uruguay Round failed.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Major insists he has no intention of quitting post: PM in
Tokyo scorns reports of isolation as attacks on his leadership continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR shrugged off continuing attacks on his leadership yesterday
and insisted that he had no intention of resigning.
As senior Tories redoubled their efforts to rally round him in the face of
persistent sniping from rightwing critics, the prime minister declared in
Tokyo that there was 'no vacancy' - neither was there going to be one.
Clearly irritated by media questions about his leadership, he poured scorn
on reports that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was one of three cabinet
ministers being drafted to stand against him.
Remarks by Mr Clarke at the weekend, in which he appeared to confirm that he
had been approached to stand, were said to have been misinterpreted. Aides
said the remarks had been 'supportive', and relations between the chancellor
and the prime minister remained good.
Asked about reports that he felt lonely and isolated, Mr Major said: 'Heaven
alone knows where this nonsense comes from. It is not for me to speculate
where everything that appears in public comes from. If I did that I would be
lonely and isolated. I do not, and I am not.'
The prime minister also won the unanimous support of British businessmen
travelling with his party. Mr Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever, said it
was 'impossible to conceive of greater support and leadership than we have
had in the last two days'.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said the leadership
speculation had not been raised by Japanese businessmen or officials.
However, the continued sniping from the right suggests that Mr Major's
attempt to bring the rebels to heel by calling for an end to 'stupid
internecine squabbling' has failed.
He was said to be frustrated by his inability to get his message across, but
looking forward to a showdown with the rebels at the Tory party conference
next month.
In London, backbench criticism continued, with Mr Tony Marlow, Tory MP for
Northampton North, arguing that a change of leader was now inevitable.
Mr John Biffen, a former Tory cabinet minister, said Mr Major must 'add to'
his acknowledged strengths of amiability and decency. But senior Tories
lined up to pledge their support for the prime minister as speculation about
a possible leadership challenge this autumn continued.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said it was 'ridiculous' that
prominence was being given to 'totally unfounded rumours of cabinet splits,
soundbites from the same handful of backbenchers and hype about minor
incidents'.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, said the party backed Mr
Major and wanted him to 'remain our leader'. After meetings with
constituency party chairmen around the country, Sir Norman said the
'overwhelming view' of the party was 'strongly in favour of the prime
minister'.

FT  21 SEP 93 / EC battles to head off crisis over Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community was last night desperately trying to head off a
crisis over the Gatt world trade talks amid a warning from the UK that
failure to reach a deal would bring normal EC business to a halt.
Germany warned of 'catastrophic dangers' to its economy if France's
objections to the Blair House agreement between the EC and the US on
limiting subsidised farm trade wreck chances of concluding the Uruguay Round
by its December 15 deadline.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the EC would be paralysed by
recriminations if the Uruguay Round failed. 'It's not the case that in
causing a crisis in Gatt we can avoid an internal EC crisis,' he said. 'I
cannot conceive how the EC will continue with the normal transaction of
business if it were seen as causing the collapse of the Uruguay Round.'
As 35 EC foreign, agriculture and trade ministers met in Brussels, there
were nevertheless signs of an emerging consensus in favour of giving the
European Commission authority to test if the US is ready to accept an
amplification of Blair House to address French concerns over limits on
lucrative food exports.
Senior Commission officials, and others who negotiated Blair House last
November, said efforts to reach a compromise would centre on finding a
formula to delay cuts in subsidised food exports so as to run down EC food
mountains. 'If the Americans want to be helpful, that is an area in which we
can help resolve this,' one Commission negotiator said.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EC trade negotiator, has written to Washington
setting out concerns. But he warned ministers of the danger that the US
would in turn exact new concessions in other areas of the Gatt talks.
France's latest outline of its demands went further, covering adequate
protection for the EC against food imports, extension of the so-called
'peace clause' on EC-US farm trade disputes, and a provision indexing the
EC's share of international markets to their future growth, particularly in
Asia. 'What is at stake is the basic concept of Europe and solidarity
between us,' said Mr Alan Juppe, French foreign minister.
UK officials would not be drawn on whether Mr Hurd's comments amounted to a
UK threat to boycott EC initiatives. French officials seemed surprised by
the hardening of Britain's position, which other member states and the
Commission warned could make it more difficult to paper over differences.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister and Bonn's foremost defender of
Gatt, said the French were 'playing for the highest stakes,' but added that
'we don't want to have a clash.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) World Bank to raise lending commitments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 21st September 1993) appended to this article.
THE World Bank plans to increase lending commitments by up to Dollars 3.2bn
in its current fiscal year from Dollars 26.9bn in the past year to June 30,
reflecting the cost of its battle against poverty and the growing financing
needs of former communist states.
The bank's annual report, published yesterday, disclosed that both arms of
the bank - the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
and its soft loan affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA)
 -have been authorised to increase lending this year.
The IBRD, which made commitments of Dollars 16.95bn in the past financial
year, has been empowered to boost its lending commitments to between Dollars
17bn and Dollars 19.5bn in fiscal 1994. The IDA, which lends funds to the
poorest developing nations at very low, subsidised interest rates, is
expected to commit about Dollars 7.4bn in 1993-94 against Dollars 6.75bn in
1992-93. Countries qualifying for IDA credits have incomes per head of
Dollars 765 or less.
The report contained figures showing how World Bank lending provides
business for companies in the industrialised world. The UK, which has
provided Dollars 6.08bn for the IBRD and IDA since their inception, has won
contracts worth Dollars 11.2bn in support of World Bank projects,
representing a return of Dollars 1.85 in orders for every Dollars 1 invested
in the bank.
In the case of the US, the return has been Dollars 1.09 for each Dollars 1
ploughed into the World Bank. This compares with Dollars 1.01 in the case of
Japan; Dollars 1.51 for Germany and Dollars 1.82 for France.
Total World Bank lending to Europe and central Asia increased to Dollars
3.84bn in 1992-93 from Dollars 2.14bn the previous year, as 11 former Soviet
republics and two of the Baltic republics joined the bank. Russia became the
third largest user of IBRD funds, with four borrowings totalling Dollars
1.37bn.
The two heaviest borrowers from the IBRD in 1992-93 were China (Dollars
2.16bn) and Argentina (Dollars 1.96bn); Mexico and India took fourth and
fifth places. India was the biggest drawer on IDA, borrowing Dollars 1.53bn,
followed by China (Dollars 1.02bn), Pakistan (Dollars 429m), Ethiopia
(Dollars 371m) and Ghana (Dollars 354m).
In regional terms, Africa was the biggest user of IDA finance, taking
Dollars 2.77bn in 1992-93. But overall World Bank lending to Africa fell
sharply to Dollars 2.8bn from Dollars 3.9bn reflecting the absence of any
IBRD lending to Nigeria or the Ivory Coast.
Actual IBRD and IDA lending to the poorest countries (with annual per capita
incomes of less than Dollars 635) fell last year to Dollars 9.96bn from
Dollars 10.86bn. However, the bank is placing greater emphasis on poverty
reduction in its programmes.

CORRECTION
In the article 'World Bank to raise lending commitments', in the Financial
Times of September 20, a reference was made in the first paragraph to the
bank's lending commitments of 'Dollars 26.9bn in the past year to June 30'.
This figure should have been Dollars 23.7bn.

FT  20 SEP 93 / German insurance plan in disarray
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's plans to build a new pillar of Germany's social
security system in time for next year's elections were in disarray at the
weekend, after compromise talks with the opposition Social Democrats were
abandoned.
The project for a new multi-billion D-Mark insurance scheme to pay for
residential care for the old and handicapped, to be jointly financed by
contributions from workers and employers, faces opposition from business and
trade unions.
Hopes for a cross-party consensus were dashed by the liberal Free Democratic
party (FDP), the minority partners in the ruling coalition, which rejected
on Friday any suggestion of renegotiation with the opposition SPD.
Mr Kohl has called the leaders of the ruling coalition for talks today in an
attempt to end the dispute, which is beginning to threaten the government's
cohesion.
The cancellation of negotiations with the SPD led to bitter recriminations,
above all from Mr Norbert Blum, the employment minister from Mr Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Mr Rudolf Dressler, deputy
parliamentary leader of the SPD. Both accused the FDP of breaking its
promise to discuss the issue.
At its heart is a promise by the government to compensate German employers
for their extra contributions towards the cost of the nursing care scheme -
estimated at DM13bn (Dollars 8bn) in the first year.
The present proposal, already before the Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament, proposes cancelling one day of paid sick leave for workers,
thereby reducing the guaranteed payment from three days to two.
That has aroused opposition from the SPD and trade unions, who have
announced a 'hot autumn' of protest against the plan.
The employers oppose the entire public insurance scheme, saying it should
remain a private, voluntary scheme until the economy recovers enough to pay
for it. They reject the compensation plan as inadequate, arguing that it
would amount to a one-off reduction in their costs, whereas the price of
residential care, with a steadily ageing population and ever-shrinking
workforce, would increase rapidly.
Without a cross-party consensus, the plan will be condemned to negotiations
in a conciliation committee between the Bundestag, where the coalition has a
majority, and the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament where the SPD has
a majority. That would delay the plan and leave the final solution in doubt.
The apparently interminable debate over how to finance the nursing care
scheme has already been a significant factor in fuelling popular discontent
with the political establishment.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S former communists appeared to have made gains in close-run
parliamentary elections yesterday as many voters switched allegiance from
the mainstream, ex-Solidarity, parties in power since the communists fells
in 1989.
Straw polls in Warsaw indicated a leftward shift, but the high volatility of
voting signalled a very close race.
The mainstream Democratic Union (UD) party of Ms Hanna Suchocka, the
outgoing prime minister, which has been at the centre of government since
1989, might be relegated to third place.
If opinion polls are borne out, the strongest parties will be the two with
roots in the communist past. They are the Polish Peasants party, which is
tipped to become the largest single party with about 18 per cent of the
votes, and the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), with up to 15 per cent.
Huddles of voters were still making up their minds yesterday afternoon at
the polling station on a housing estate on the edge of Warsaw.
Many voters there and at nearby polling stations said they had little
enthusiasm for any of the 35 parties competing for election to the 460-seat
Sejm, the lower house of parliament, or the 100-seat Senate.
While many voters agreed that their lives had improved since the Solidarity
movement brought down the communist system, several cited the alliance's
acrimonious disintegration as grounds for shifting their votes.
More than 27m were eligible to vote yesterday in the second general election
since Poland became the first country in eastern Europe to sweep communists
from power in August 1989.
Lengthy inter-party horse-trading is likely to begin this morning in the
light of the poll results.

FT  20 SEP 93 / E Germany's first blooms: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Germany's Dresdner Bank, has complained that
the European Community is not doing its share in helping the integration of
the former East Germany.
'Unfortunately,' he said last week, 'it is virtually taken for granted in
Europe that the Federal Republic must deal with the economic integration of
east Germany on its own. Why should southern Italy, parts of Greece and
Portugal, and French agriculture be seen as European problems, while eastern
Germany remains a purely German affair?' This could jeopardise pro-European
sentiment in west Germany, he warned.
From a factual point of view, of course, Mr Sarrazin's moan is misleading.
The Community's farm policy applies just as much to east Germany as it does
to France, and the same is true of the Regional Fund.
On the other hand, it is easy to see why some west Germans should now have
second thoughts about their original decision to treat economic unification
as a purely German affair. The budgetary costs are turning out to be many
times greater than expected by the daffy optimists (who included Dresdner
Bank), and the results much more disappointing, or at least much slower.
In December 1989, Chancellor Helmut Kohl predicted that there would be
'blooming landscapes' in the eastern Lander within two or three years; but
these blooming landscapes have yet to appear, and Mr Kohl's words are daily
held against him by the many disillusioned people of the east.
The main reason for disillusionment has been the steep rise in unemployment
and the general collapse of east Germany's uncompetitive industries. Recent
figures show an average unemployment rate of 16 per cent. If you add in job
creation, career training, and early retirement or equivalent, the real
total of the unemployed and the under-employed together is reckoned to be 35
per cent or more.
I recently visited the east German Lander on a tour arranged by the
Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the German think-tank associated with the SPD
social democrat party. By and large the trip confirmed the seriousness of
the economic problems of the east. But it also suggested that the picture is
not as unrelievedly bleak as the crude unemployment statistics imply.
In agriculture, as in industry, there has been a collapse in employment. In
Mecklenberg-Vorpommern the number of farm jobs has dropped from 180,000 to
25,000, in Brandenberg from 300,000 to 30,000. But we met one man who,
virtually overnight, has been transformed from being an ordinary farm
co-operative member to a large-scale farmer.
In 1991 the 360 members of the co-operative in the village of Puchow
received vouchers valuing their shares. In exchange for an undertaking to
pay off the other members over five years, Detlef Sunboldt and a partner now
farm 2,800 hectares, on which they pay DM300,000 (Pounds 120,000) rent, and
employ 31 members of the co-operative. No doubt the choice, and the change,
were difficult for other members; but it sounds like a shrewd arrangement
for the market economy.
In Neubrandenburg, the biggest industry under the old regime, the vast
Warsaw Pact RWN tank repair centre, is being broken up and privatised. Heinz
Schewe, an employee of RWN, worked his way up from an apprenticeship in 1969
to an engineering diploma. In 1990 he and a partner bought out one of the
RWN subsidiaries, on money borrowed from Commerzbank. The company, which
makes aluminium frames and windows, now employs 80 people, and last year
doubled its turnover to DM15m.
In the late 1980s, the GDR built a vast penicillin factory. But when it came
on stream in May 1990, it became clear that it was totally uncompetitive,
and it had to be closed. 'It was on much too large a scale,' says Manfred
Pfeifer, the company's production director. 'We were not ready for the free
market - indeed, we had no market, once the state disappeared.' On the
wreckage of the company, the liquidator built a 68-room hotel, which Dr
Pfeifer is now run-ning, apparently profitably.
One of the constant laments in the east is that the modernisation or
reconstruction of old housing is being obstructed or even paralysed by
disputed ownership claims. In Saxony they have settled 112,000 such claims,
but that leaves nearly 300,000 unsettled. In Dresden, the 40,000 outstanding
claims have driven land prices so high that building costs are more
expensive than in Munich.
And yet there is no denying the vigour of the construction boom, confirmed
both by the ubiquity of large building cranes and by the statistics:
construction turnover in Saxony up 11 per cent this year. But what is being
built is not productive industry. 'The new companies coming here are not
producers,' says Dr Pfeifer. 'They are wholesalers, cash and carry,
builders' merchants, steel merchants, furniture warehouses.' He might have
added: petrol stations, car showrooms, insurance companies and banks (83 new
banks in Dresden alone).
Some analysts worry that the east is skewed in the direction of consumerism
and services, unsustainably dependent on budget transfers from Bonn. Yet
perhaps the development of services and infrastructure are really the
precondition for industrial investment.
But the most important task is the reconstruction of society: the weeding
out of tainted judges and the introduction of good law, retraining of
teachers, conversion of bureaucracy, education in politics. This will take a
generation; and of course it is something that only the Germans can do, and
they must do it by themselves.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Monday Interview: Poised for the home run - Ted Turner,
founder of Cable News Network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jane Fonda's husband is set to make his acting debut in a film that receives
its premier next month. By any standards the scale of the film is enormous,
with more than 5,000 extras and a running time of four hours and eight
minutes.
The film is Gettysburg, the story of the American civil war, where 150,000
fought and 50,000 died. The man responsible for it is Jane Fonda's husband -
Mr Ted Turner, founder of Cable News Network (CNN), the 24-hour satellite
news service, owner of the Atlanta Braves baseball team and much more
besides.
'You have to watch closely. I'm only in the film for 30 seconds and then I
get shot,' says Mr Turner, a southerner who naturally plays a Confederate
colonel leading a charge on the Yankees.
As a civil war buff - the entrance to the boardroom of Turner Broadcasting
System, Mr Turner's holding company, is lined with guns from the American
civil war - Mr Turner is keen to show off his new Dollars 18m film.
In his vast office on the 14th floor of the CNN Center in Atlanta, an office
crammed with personal memorabilia such as silver yachting trophies,
basketballs and a doll of his favourite admiral, Lord Horatio Nelson, Mr
Turner presses a button and a large movie screen slides electronically from
the ceiling.
As the clips of Gettysburg run its proud owner remarks on the absence of
fashionable and gratuitious nastiness.
'We made it in the old-fashioned way,' says Mr Turner, owner of the MGM
library, which includes classics such as Gone with the Wind, Singing in the
Rain and the Wizard of Oz.
His enthusiasm for Hollywood and feature films is unmistakable. In 1986 he
bought MGM for Dollars 1.5bn and also took on Dollars 500m in debt as part
of the purchase price. But the financial strain of the deal forced him to
quickly sell most of MGM, including the famous roaring lion logo, leaving
him with only the library.
Now Mr Turner has mounted another attack on Hollywood with last month's
Dollars 672m (Pounds 450m) agreement to buy two independent studios: Castle
Rock, which produced hit films such as In the Line of Fire and A Few Good
Men, and New Line Cinema, best known for lower budget pictures such as
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Nightmare on Elm Street.
'I had to (buy back into Hollywood). No question,' says Mr Turner, in
sanguine mood the day after the Altanta Braves had unexpectedly beaten the
Cincinnati Reds, making a place in the World Series baseball finals more
likely.
'I have more than 3,000 old movies (from the MGM library) and no new movies
except television movies. If you are going to be a big player you have got
to have the product. Rupert (Murdoch) has got Twenthieth Century Fox
studios,' he says.
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The News Corporation, is Mr Turner's bugbear:
the subject of Mr Murdoch creeps frequently into the interview.
Mr Murdoch may have been one of the reasons why the elusive Mr Turner agreed
to speak to European newspapers and magazines to coincide with the European
launch last Friday of his new satellite channel, TNT. The channel, largely
based on the MGM library and the Cartoon Network, is already beamed to Latin
America and Mr Turner is considering extending it to Asia.
Mr Murdoch's skillful generation of headlines with his promises to beam Sky
News around the world and develop Star TV in Asia, seem to have caused
irritation at CNN. After all, say Mr Turner's staff in Atlanta, CNN is
already broadcasting worldwide on 13 satellites and, on big story days such
as the recent Middle East settlement, is viewed by as many as 1bn people
through satellite, cable and rebroadcast extracts.
Mr Turner does not mince his words on Mr Murdoch. 'He wants to conquer the
world. I don't want to conquer it. I just want to be one among many. I want
to entertain and inform the world,' he says with passion.
Mr Turner is critical of the News Corporation chairman on three fronts: his
decision to give up his Australian citizenship in favour of an American one
so that he could own a US network; his eagerness to go downmarket to
increase sales; and Mr Murdoch's political interference in his newspapers.
'We all know Mr Murdoch would go downmarket at the drop of a hat and that's
something we haven't done. He has also used his newspapers to promote his
own political views and that is something I don't do (through CNN). Everyone
should have their say,' says Mr Turner, who has campaigned with his wife on
environment issues and on reducing the amount of violence on television.
'We have the sweeter stuff - its Yogi Bear,' he says, pointing to his tie
depicting characters from The Flintstones, another old-fashioned favourite
in the Turner library.
'The easiest way to make a quick buck is to go downmarket, to take off
clothes, to blow someone's brains out, to stage a car crash.' Mr Turner
insists his programme channels will stick to 'the high ground', a course
that will, ultimately, he believes, prove the soundest business strategy.
The only thing that cheers him up about Mr Murdoch is his age: Mr Murdoch is
62, eight years older than Mr Turner.
'I'm a lot smaller than Rupert (in terms of business size) but Rupert is a
lot older than I am. According to the actuarial tables I'll have 10 years
after he's gone off if everything works out right.'
Whatever the age differences, the pressure is on as the new breed of
international media moguls compete to integrate the production and
distrubution of films and televison programes and beam their channels around
the world by satellite.
Mr Murdoch, Mr Turner and Mr Sumner Redstone's Viacom, owner of MTV the pop
music channel and Nickelodeon, the children's channel, are at the forefront
of this race. Mr Redstone has just staked his claim for such status with an
Dollars 8bn bid for Paramount, one of the few Hollywood studios not
controlled by an international conglomerate.
Is Mr Turner, who tilted audaciously but unsuccessfully at the CBS network
in 1985 and then concluded a messy, incomplete deal over MGM, now preparing
to ride off in pursuit of Paramount? Last week he was dismissive of the
possibility because of the costs. But there is growing speculation that Mr
Turner, who shares with Mr Murdoch a visceral feel for strategic deals, may
be about to enter a rampant bid phase again.
Shortly after after his marriage to Jane Fonda Mr Turner retreated to his
Montana ranch where he breeds bison; he was content to turn up at CNN just
one day a month. Now he is back and looking for action.
Although Paramount would be an enormous target for Turner Broadcasting
System, which last year earned net income of Dollars 77.6m on revenues of
Dollars 1.77bn, the parent has powerful shareholders, who might provide
support. They include John Malone of TCI, the largest cable operator in the
world with an equally voracious appetite for Hollywood films, and Time
Warner.
While Mr Turner ponders whether to seriously go for a home run on Paramount,
he has encountered a little local difficulty in Europe, where the French and
Belgian authorities are blocking his TNT/Cartoon Network on the grounds of
insufficient European content. Even the British government is starting to
hint that satellite channels should carry more European programmes.
'They've (the French) got this bee in their bonnet about French culture,
they've got a great culture. I've been to Versailles,' he says.
Paramount aside, what does Mr Turner, who admits taking medicine for mild
manic phases, still want to achieve?
'Catch a 10lb bass and win a World Series,' he replies quick as a flash.
And, of course, remaining happy to be known as Jane Fonda's husband.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Greenspan faces monetary test: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most delicate question for central bankers is how quickly to start
tightening monetary policy after an economic recovery gains momentum. Last
week, a group of economists led by Professor Allan Meltzer, the well-known
monetarist from Carnegie-Mellon university, accused the US Federal Reserve
of having delayed far too long already.
Policy, they claim, is irresponsibly expansionary because narrow measures of
the money supply are growing at double digit rates, far in excess of
monetary demand in the real economy. The excess liquidity is pouring into
financial markets, artificially bidding up the prices of shares and bonds.
Unless the Fed begins to tighten policy quickly, they say, the US could face
an 'asset price bubble' of the kind that destabilised the Japanese economy
in the late 1980s.
Fed policymakers meet in Washington tomorrow for their regular six-weekly
assessment of monetary conditions. Most will be inclined to argue that fears
of a speculative bubble are exaggerated. In his Humphrey-Hawkins
congressional testimony in July, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, echoed
conventional wisdom when he argued that the relationship between monetary
aggregates and other economic variables, such as growth or inflation, had
broken down.
He was trying to explain why abnormally slow growth of M2, a broad measure
of money, did not justify further cuts in interest rates. But his argument
could equally well be used to justify not raising rates in response to
exceptionally rapid growth of narrow measures of money, such as the monetary
base (currency plus banks' reserves).
A glance at real estate markets confirms that the US is not suffering a
Japanese-style bubble in asset values. It is equally unwise to read too much
into movements of the monetary base: the currency component, for example,
has been inflated by large foreign holdings of dollar bills in Latin America
and formerly communist countries. Yet there is a kernel of truth in the
charge that financial institutions awash with liquidity are bidding up the
prices of financial assets. To understand why, recall that monetary policy
in recent years has had an important sub-plot: restoring the financial
health of the US banking system.
To raise bank profits, Mr Greenspan has deliberately engineered some of the
biggest interest rate margins in US financial history. The Fed is pumping
reserves into the banking system to keep interbank rates at the artificially
low level of 3 per cent - zero in real terms. The cost of retail deposits
has fallen to a derisory 2 per cent. But the Fed has put no pressure on the
big banks to reduce their loan rates accordingly: the prime lending is still
6 per cent rate and many short-term loans are far more expensive.
Instead of competing to lend at cheaper rates, banks are enjoying high
margins and ploughing cash into US government securities. After growing at a
compound annual rate of nearly 20 per cent for three years, bank holdings of
government bonds stood at a giddy Dollars 700bn in June, roughly a third of
their outstanding loans.
The Greenspan policy has had a startling impact on bank finances. On the
verge of bankruptcy at the end of the 1980s, US banks are now among the best
capitalised in the world. Bank profits nearly doubled 1992 and have risen
further this year. The average return on assets has soared to record levels.
'It's a very, very generous situation for the banks,' muses Mr Leonard
Santow, a Wall Street bond market commentator. 'I'm not sure we have ever
had margins like this.'
Share and bond prices were bound to rise sharply as the economy emerged from
recession. But would long bond yields have fallen three percentage points to
the lowest levels in a generation without the extra push from banks? And if
bond yields had not fallen so fast would the Dow Jones average have risen
nearly 50 per cent from its trough in 1990? The Fed's policy of shoring up
the banking system initially made sense. But with profitability fully
restored, continued largesse seems unnecessary.
Raising the cost of reserves for banks would make little sense if the
economy as a whole still needed a big monetary stimulus. But does it? The
recession formally ended more than two years ago. Huge revisions to
statistics show that the downturn was milder than previously thought and the
rebound stronger: economic growth has averaged a respectable 2.5 per cent a
year since spring 1991, in spite of weak export markets. Recent figures for
retail sales and production suggest the economy may currently be growing at
an annual rate of about 3 per cent. More than 2m jobs have been created in
the past 18 months. The jobless rate has fallen more than a percentage point
to 6.7 per cent, low by the standards of much of the buoyant 1980s.
The popular view is that the Fed does not need to tighten monetary policy
because inflation seems under control; a spurt in prices in the spring has
since reversed itself. Yet most forecasters still expect inflation to
average 3 per cent or slightly more in coming years - hardly the price
stability promised by Mr Greenspan. With the economy growing steadily and
financial markets decidedly frothy, his policy of zero real interest rates
is getting ever harder to justify.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Awaiting M3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY dealers will focus on the performance of the dollar/D-Mark exchange
rate this week, with key data coming out in both countries, writes James
Blitz.
Few dealers expect any change in official interest rates at this week's
Bundesbank council meeting, which is set to be Mr Helmut Schlesinger's last
as president.
However, there have been several indications that M3 money supply data for
August and consumer price inflation for September have both been somewhat
lower than expected, raising expectations that the Bundesbank will ease
policy more quickly than anticipat-ed.
The M3 data could come out at any time from today. Dealers had been
expecting the figure to be well above 8 per cent because of the huge
intervention by the Bundes-bank to support European exchange rate mechanism
currencies last month. However, Mr Schlesinger strongly hinted last week
that the outlook for M3 may be better than the market expects.
Consumer prices data for the German Lander are also due throughout this
week. Some analysts are optimistic about the outlook for German inflation,
suggesting that it could be as low as 4 per cent for western Germany this
month.
In the US, the only data that might affect the dollar are the durable goods
orders for August, due on Friday. The market consensus is for a
month-on-month rise of 1.5 per cent.
In the UK, today's M4 lending figures for August, due today, could have a
significant impact on the pound. The market appears to be expecting M4
lending to have been Pounds 2.5bn - but a lower figure could increase the
speculation about a base rate cut before the end of the year, which was
gaining ground at the end of last week.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Risk and Reward: Secondary market investors turn to eastern
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the secondary market in Latin American commercial bank debt has matured
and become more expensive, successful investors in that market have turned
to eastern Europe.
'The LDC debt market relies on the improvement in economic management,' said
Mr Mark Evans of ING Bank, 'and that process is clearly under way in eastern
Europe.'
Trading volume in eastern European debt has surged this year as the market
rallied. Poland's commercial bank debt has been actively traded for a number
of years, but Russia and Bulgaria both defaulted on their debt more
recently.
Continental Bank estimates that trading volume in Russian debt will have
grown from around Dollars 800m in 1992 to between Dollars 3bn and Dollars
4bn in 1993, while annual volume in Polish debt is around Dollars 15bn.
The scope of the market's investor base is also growing rapidly. 'The market
has broadened from hedge funds and specialist LDC boutiques to portfolio
managers, and, particularly in the last six months, to investors in North
and Central America,' said Mr Igor Sitnin of Continental Bank.
Low interest rates may spell good news for most companies, but they leave
investors starved of high-yield investments. In the quest for yield, they
have extended the maturity of their bond holdings, bought 'junk' bonds and
ventured into the emerging bond markets. The eastern European secondary debt
market 'offers the next big opportunity,' claims one bank salesman - but it
is also a highly volatile market.
Even Polish debt, the most mature market, has ranged between a low of 24 1/2
cents in the dollar and a high of 39 cents. (When Bulgaria defaulted on its
bank debt in 1990, the price of the debt fell from 95 cents to 5 cents in
under a year.)
But the magnet for investors is that potentially there are large gains to be
made, if the experience in the Latin American debt market is to be repeated.
Investors who bought Russian Vnesheconombank debt at the turn of the year
for 15 1/2 cents in the dollar have seen their investment more than double
to 36 1/2 cents.
Mr Paul Luke, head of developing country research at Morgan Grenfell, points
out that Russian bonds, which were never in default, have performed
particularly well.
He argues that Russian bonds are not likely to be rescheduled. 'Looking
forward, it would take an extraordinarily severe foreign exchange crisis or
complete political melt-down to oblige Russia to cease paying on its bonds.'
But the outlook for further strong performance in eastern European debt is
also viewed as positive.
'Russia is talking to the London club and has promised Dollars 500m in
payments this autumn,' said Mr Sitnin. 'If that payment goes ahead, there is
room for significant price improvement.'
Bulgaria is also talking to its banks while Poland is expected to go ahead
with a Brady-style debt agreement.
Traders say the market will be vulnerable not only to the progress of debt
negotiations, but also to the performance of the Treasury bond market. Low
interest rates also make it easier for countries to pay their interest.
Veterans of the Latin American debt market are ready to ride any potential
storms.
The notional principal value of foreign currency and interest rate swaps
outstanding at the end of 1992 reached Dollars 4,600bn, an increase of 19
per cent over year-end 1991, according to a market survey conducted by
Arthur Andersen for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
The increase in swap activity came mainly from trade in non-US debt
instruments. Capital at risk in a swap is the cash flows it generates,
usually two to four per cent of its notional value.
In the second half of 1992, new interest rate swaps contracts increased by
14 per cent over the first half, to a notional value of Dollars 1,500bn.
Foreign exchange swap volume declined by 6 per cent from the first half, to
Dollars 146bn.
ISDA said a decline in short-term interest rates in the US appears to have
reduced the demand for interest rate swaps among corporate end-users.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Electronic bridge clears way for
quicker settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new electronic bridge set up last weekend by the world's two largest
securities clearing houses is expected to save millions of dollars in
transaction costs as well as improving processing speed and market
liquidity.
In response to the sharp rise in cross-border trading over recent years,
Cedel, the Luxembourg-based settlement firm owned by an international
consortium of 104 banks, and Brussels-based Euroclear, which is owned by 119
financial institutions and operated by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co, signed an
agreement in March 1992 to upgrade the bridge agreement which has existed
between them since 1980.
The new bridge is aimed at offering customers 'greater efficiency and
liquidity, better cash management facilities and improved reporting,' said
Mr Andre Lussi, Cedel's chief executive.
Previously, transactions between customers of both houses were complicated
by the fact that Cedel cleared trades during the day while Euroclear
operated overnight, causing a time lag between delivery of securities and
payment for them.
This meant that users of both systems were losing a day's worth of value and
liquidity, and that they had to bear the burden of covering positions
exposed by the time lag.
With its move to multiple overnight processing, Cedel's clients can settle
back-to-back trades with Euroclear participants for same-day value. Clearing
information is exchanged twice a night, so that the clearing houses can
report their settlements to the banks by the following morning. There are
plans to add a third file exchange per night in about a year.
Cedel stands to gain most from the new bridge agreement. Until now, the firm
has been compensating its clients for the losses caused by the settlement
delay. The subsidy cost Cedel some Dollars 65m in 1992 alone, said Mr Lussi.
Moreover, Cedel claims it has gained a competitive edge as it will now be
processing trades around the clock. However, both houses are likely to move
to 24-hour settlement processing eventually.
'There is no question (the bridge) makes Cedel much more competitive,' said
Mr John Olds, Euroclear's chief executive. The reason Euroclear went along
with the innovation was that 'the market wanted this issue resolved and
wants to be able to choose between two viable competitors,' he said.
Observers now hope Cedel's savings will primarily benefit its customers.
'Hopefully most of the savings will be passed on to the banks,' said Mr John
Langton, chief executive of the International Securities Market Association.
Competition between the two houses is set to sharpen as a result of the new
bridge. 'It will be interesting to see whether Cedel can claw back some
market share' now that they are operating on a level playing field with
Euroclear, said Mr John Dowsett, a partner with Luthy, Baillie, Dowsett,
Pethick. Until now, Euroclear has held the lion's share of securities
turnover.
Mr Olds of Euroclear said he would not be surprised if Cedel did gain market
share, though he was quick to add 'we have no intention of giving them our
business.'
At the end of the day, however, the real winner will be the market,
observers agree. 'I am delighted to see a new delivery-versus-payment system
in place,' said Mr John Langton of ISMA. 'It will be a benefit to the market
as a whole.'
The bridge comes as ISMA members consider formally changing the Euromarket's
existing settlement period from trade date plus seven working days to trade
date plus two to three working days.
'I think it's absolutely essential that before the two to three-day period
is agreed the bridge is in place,' said ISMA's Mr Langton.
Technically, one to two day settlement has been feasible for some time, but
its formal implementation may be facilitated by the bridge, observers say.
A reduction in the 'open' period between transaction and settlement is seen
as reducing the level of counterparty and market risks. Moreover, with
shorter settlement, banks need to hold less capital in order to meet
regulatory requirements.
Both clearing houses emphasise the flexible nature of the new bridge
arrangement, the so-called 'evolving bridge'. Contrary to the former bridge
agreement, which covered only the most basic areas of mutual interest, the
new bridge is designed to to adapt to changing customer requirements and
technological changes, and the two houses plan regular contact to discuss
these issues as they arise.
'We are competitors, but we have excellent co-operation, and that's good for
the market,' Mr Lussi said.
Market participants now hope this bridge will lead to similar developments
among other clearing houses.
'The market has been very much focused on the relationship between the two
competing clearing systems, but what we're doing will probably be repeated
in many markets,' said Mr Olds.

FT  20 SEP 93 / US Money and Credit: Inflation genie refuses to stay in its
bottle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE inflation genie refuses to stay in its bottle. The US bond market's
remarkable seven-week rally went into reverse last week as a fresh round of
inflation worries hit traders.
The benchmark 30-year issue, which had dropped from a yield of 6.7 per cent
in late July to 5.87 at the end of the week before last, backed up again and
closed on Friday night at 6.04 per cent. The 10-year note yielded 5.37 per
cent, up from 5.28 per cent.
The initial cause was statistics released on Tuesday showing a larger than
expected rise in the consumer price index, which rose 0.3 per cent in
August, compared to analysts' expectations of around 0.1 per cent.
That was followed on Thursday by stronger than expected weekly money supply
figures, showing M2 rising by a sharp Dollars 12.7bn in the week of
September 6, putting the M2 growth rate up 1.2 per cent compared to the
fourth quarter of last year. This was just inside the Federal Reserve's
target range of between 1 per cent and 5 per cent, and pushed the closing
yield on the long bond above the psychologically significant 6 per cent
barrier for the first time since September 2.
The anxiety was compounded by remarks during the week by Mr David Mullins,
vice-chairman of the Fed, and separately by a group of US monetarist
economists, about the dangers of a 'bubble' of rising share and bond prices
similar to that which destabilised Japan in the late 1980s.
The monetarists, who belong to the shadow open market committee, a group
which challenges conventional wisdom on monetary policy, said the Fed was
pursuing an irresponsibly expansive monetary policy and the economy was
awash with liquidity.
Most of this liquidity had found its way into financial markets and this,
rather than confidence in low inflation, accounted for the sharp fall in
long bond yields.
This assessment runs counter to the views of most economists, who argue that
the US's sluggish growth rate is in danger of even greater weakness as the
federal government's new taxes take effect. Some argue the Fed should be
considering more cuts in short term interest rates.
That, however, seems unlikely in the light of an interview Mr Mullins gave
to the New York Times last week. Referring to concerns about a bubble, he
declared: 'That's one reason to be wary of being more accommodative.'
The Fed's policy-making open market committee is due to meet on Tuesday and
is generally expected to leave monetary policy unchanged. The economy is
still expanding, albeit at a sluggish 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent a year, and
despite the market's reaction, the August consumer price index was not too
awful.
The index was distorted by sharp rise in clothing prices and leaves consumer
inflation running at an annual rate of only 2.9 per cent, compared with 3
per cent last year.
As for the 'bubble' theory, many economists point out that the relationship
between the growth of the monetary base and nominal income has been weak in
the past, and that a yield of 6 per cent is not surprising, given the level
of inflation.
Still, the shadow market committee has at least refocused the market's
attention on the fact that the Fed will tighten monetary policy sooner or
later, assuming the recovery holds.
In any event, the bond market had been heading for a correction after its
sharp summer rise, and it has now got one. Whether the market can resume its
advance will depend partly on the next round of economic statistics. But it
will also depend on any further policy messages which may leak from the Fed
over the next few weeks.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: ABN-Amro to centre equities
in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABN-AMRO, the Netherlands-based bank, is reorganising its worldwide
investment banking activities along product lines, and plans to centre its
international equities operations in London.
In abandoning the geographical organisation it has maintained until now,
ABN-Amro is joining a growing trend among investment banks of recognising
the increasingly cross-border nature of both investment management and
securities trading.
The bank said that it believed the reorganisation would substantially
enhance the international competitive position of its equity businesses.
Mr Nick Whitney, chief executive of ABN-Amro's UK stockbroking subsidiary,
Hoare Govett, will become responsible for the global equity network.
Mr Whitney said the bank had concluded that geographic organisation has
significant drawbacks for a firm with extensive international operations.
'Among other things, you may find yourselves emphasising one product to the
detriment of others within a region,' he said.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Spanish Bonds: Investor optimism beginning to wane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE August rally in Spanish bonds, almost entirely fuelled by non-residents,
brought yields down by a full point to below 9 per cent. Ignoring events in
Spain, the market travelled in the slipstream of enthusiasm elsewhere.
But time is running out for the government as it tries to convince the
unions of the need for economic rigour, and the optimism that investors
demonstrated last month is begining to wane.
Last week, bond prices fell by 2 1/2 points and the long end of the market
in particular remains vulnerable. Traders want to know, as soon as possible,
what the government's much-heralded social pact agreement with the unions is
going to look like.
In this interim period the good news is that the government and the unions
are still talking. The bad news is that it is increasingly looking as if
they are not talking about very meaningful rigour.
The economy and finance ministry is hinting that its 1994 inflation target
will be 4 per cent, against a current annual rate of 4.6 per cent, although
it could be reduced to 3.5 per cent if the unions agree to wage restraint.
The ministry also says that the general budget deficit will stand at around
5 per cent of GDP, perhaps as high as 5.5 per cent - around half a point
less than what is expected this year.
Such targets are certainly not ambitious, particularly set against far more
aggressive policies unveiled by other European governments.
The government's original plan was that negotiations over the social pact,
the cornerstone of which is a three-year incomes policy, should be completed
before the budget goes before parliament at the end of this month.
It appears that talks with the unions and the employers' confederation will
continue to the end of the year, and that the wage restraint issue has been
set aside to allow for prior agreement on social spending.
It is this apparent lack of ambition and seeming absence of urgency that is
unsettling the market.
As things stand, the government is very unlikely to gain an agreement, as it
originally wished, to reduce purchasing power by six points over the next
three years. But it could gain assent to essentially flat wages through to
1996.
To lock the unions into such restraint the government will probably have to
jettison part of its planned reform of the overtly rigid labour laws. But
the prize will be the first forward-looking incomes policy in Spain since
the early 1980s.
In its new mood of realism, Spain's bond market is right to believe that the
short end of the curve is the safest. In any case, the Spanish yield curve
is among the flattest in Europe, so the main reason not to buy the short end
is that it could benefit less from a rally.
But looking ahead there is good reason for optimism to return. The onset of
recession has been such that the government could have erred on the side of
caution by suggesting a 4 per cent inflation target next year, and the Bank
of Spain, once satisfied that there is a wage calendar in place, will be in
the mood for cutting rates.

FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Gilts: Correction in yields brings relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE a man with toothache who has finally succumbed to treatment, the gilt
market is glad it's over. The big event was the long-awaited correction in
yields to compensate for the fairly obvious overvaluation of UK bonds which
has been a feature of the past month or so.
The excuse for the sell-off was the publication last Wednesday of Central
Statistical Office figures showing a higher than expected rise in retail
inflation last month.
Gilt traders were glad of the CSO's decision to release such data two hours
earlier, which gave them more time to sell the securities and gave the gilt
market its worst day since the pound left the European exchange rate
mechanism a year ago.
After the fall of nearly 2 points for 15-year dated gilts on the day, the
bonds traded nervously for the rest of the week. On Friday night, gilts of
this maturity showed yields at just over 7 per cent on a par basis, roughly
20 basis points higher than the week before.
As a result of this change, the difference between UK government and German
bond yields was quoted at around 1 percentage point, from the low of around
70 basis points recorded when gilts were performing particularly well in
mid-August.
The big question now for the gilt market is whether the latest inflation
data are a blip or whether the assumptions which have underpinned the
market's recent rally will have to be jettisoned for good.
If it is the latter, then yields - particularly at the long end of the curve
 -may be expected to rise in the next few weeks.
The general mood in the gilt market last week, however, was that investor
interest is likely to hold fairly steady in the near future. Although some
economists warned of further nasty surprises on the inflation front, many
went along with the sentiments of Mr Robin Aspinall, an economist at Panmure
Gordon, who said the inflation figures were 'nothing to get excited about'.
In the year to August the retail prices index rose 1.7 per cent, up from 1.4
per cent in the 12 months to July. The Treasury's favoured measure of
underlying inflation, the year-on-year rise in the RPI excluding mortgage
interest payments, went up to 3.1 per cent in August from 2.9 per cent.
A large part of the rise was due to price increases in shops, apparently
resulting from retailers trying to compensate for the recent pressure on
margins linked to the recession and the long period of discounting.
However, Mr Hugh Clarke, trade policy director of the British Retail
Consortium, a trade body for the sector, disputed that shops were in any
position to push through big price increases. 'A lot of retailers are still
suffering fierce competition and weak demand and see little opportunity to
increase prices,' he said.
Also, the latest evidence on pay is that undue inflationary pressures appear
to be dormant. According to the Confederation of British Industry, the pay
bill in manufacturing has not grown at all this year and industry is heading
for a reduction in unit labour costs this year for the the first time since
1960.
Although the year-on-year underlying increase in average weekly earnings
across the economy stayed static in July at 3.5 per cent, the same as in
June, the figure is historically extremely low and illustrates the weakness
of wage pressures.
UK economic data released this week are likely to provide few opportunities
for big selling or buying, with most interest focusing on the second-quarter
figures for gross domestic product in the second quarter due out tomorrow.
Gilts were little moved by the announcement that the next gilt auction will
be on September 29, when the Bank of England will sell an unspecified amount
of stock in the maturity range 2002 to 2006 inclusive. Details of the amount
and the auction stock will be announced tomorrow.

EASTMAN KODAK, the US photographic products company which recently ousted
its chairman, has warned that it would be a 'challenge' to match last year's

In the third quarter of 1992 the company reported net earnings of Dollars
330m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, before special charges.
Kodak is searching for a new chairman from outside the company, following
the forced resignation in August of Mr Kay Whitmore. The company, said
revenues for July and August were down by 'mid-single digits' because volume
gains had been offset by negative currency exchange and lower prices.

GLAVERBEL, the Belgian glass manufacturer, blamed its first loss for more

and recent 'competitive' currency devaluations within the European
Community, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The group announced an operating loss of BFr665m (Dollars 19m) for the first
half, further aggravated by the BFr1.09bn cost of restructuring US and
Belgian operations. It recorded a net interim loss of BFr1.75bn against a
profit of BFr673m in the first half of last year.
Interim sales fell by more than 10 per cent to BFr15.44bn (BFr17.26bn).
Mr Luc Willame, chief executive, said that excluding Glaverbec, the group's
US subsidiary, sales had declined by 9 per cent.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Time Warner announces shake-up
in publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the US media group, last night announced a management shake-up
of its publishing arm, Time Inc, which it said was meant to produce
continued growth for the rest of the decade and initiative a process of
change that would virtually 'reinvent the company'.
The shake-up centres on Time Inc's New York magazine publishing operations
and, in particular, its three leading titles - Time, People and Sports
Illustrated.
At Time and People a new position, president, is being created above that of
publisher. The publisher, who previously handled a wide range of tasks, will
now focus on advertising sales. At Sports Illustrated, the previously
combined job of president and publisher is being split in two.
This is supposed to be the start of a decentralising, cost-saving process
which will involve some staff cuts, primarily through attrition. The company
is also setting up a new group to handle multi-media, which it wants to grow
into a third business leg, alongside magazines and books.

THE French government's ambitious privatisation programme gets under way
today with the start of the pre-marketing process for Banque Nationale de
Paris.
The privatisation of BNP, the first of 21 state-controlled groups that the
government of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur has targeted for sale, is
expected to raise between FFr25bn and FFr30bn (Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars
5.3bn).
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said the BNP privatisation would
be completed by December 20 at the latest, although most analysts believe
the timetable will be shorter.
The pre-marketing process, in which investors can make non-binding claims
for shares, will provide a measure of the demand for the issue. It will be
used to determine the price at which the shares will be sold.
According to the economy ministry, the government will offer about 40 per
cent of the share capital of BNP, or some 72m shares, for open sale. At
least half of this amount will be sold through a public offer in France.
About 12.5m shares will be sold to French institutions and some 23.5m shares
placed abroad, while about 8m shares will be offered on preferential terms
to BNP staff.
The government also confirmed that a core group of stable investors -
including Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned insurance group -
will hold about 30 per cent of BNP's shares after privatisation.
Individual French residents and citizens of the EC will have the right to at
least 40 shares in BNP. Investors who subscribed to the 'Balladur bond', a
government borrowing scheme, will have the right to a further 40 shares if
they convert some of their 6 per cent bonds into privatisation equity.
BNP chairman Mr Michel Pebereau yesterday repeated his forecast of a FFr1bn
net profit for full-year 1993, and said that the first half of next year
would be 'tricky', Reuter adds.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Proton selects local partner

<TEXT>
PROTON, the listed Malaysian car manufacturer, is to enter into partnership
with another local company to make 'model variants' of its cars, writes
Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Diversified Resources, an assembler of foreign cars for the Malaysian
market, will have a controlling stake in the new enterprise.
The move has caused some concern among industry analysts. They argue that
the new arrangement, by transferring part of the car production process
outside Proton's control, goes against the carmaker's efforts to achieve
economies of scale.
Proton aims to produce up to 120,000 cars this year at its plant outside
Kuala Lumpur and 150,000 units by 1995.
Diversified Resources is a relatively small company with a plant on the east
coast of peninsular Malaysia, a considerable distance from Kuala Lumpur.
Proton, which receives substantial government protection, has captured about
70 per cent of the Malaysian car market.
The company also exports, with the UK its biggest overseas market.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, which is divesting peripheral businesses in order to focus
on its lossmaking North American car operations, is selling its rear axle,
propeller shaft and forging business to an investor group. The business will
be renamed American Axle &amp; Manufacturing and its chief executive will be Mr
Richard Dausch, a former executive of Chrysler.
The deal with American Axle is the first significant sale by GM of one of
its car components businesses, although it has also sold several operations
not connected with the vehicle industry. Last week, for example, it sold its
Allison Gas Turbine division in a leveraged buy-out.
GM put the American Axle businesses up for sale last December, and the deal
is expected to be concluded by the end of this December.
Many analysts say that to improve its North American manufacturing costs, GM
needs to shed many of its component operations, which frequently have higher
labour and other costs than independent, non-union businesses. The company
relies on its own subsidiaries for around 70 per cent of the components that
go into its vehicles. However, the United Auto Workers union has adopted a
generally hostile approach to moves by the company to source components from
outside.
GM was quick to point out that as part of the deal, the UAW will continue to
represent the new company's hourly-paid workers.
Mr Dausch, who resigned as executive vice-president of manufacturing at
Chrysler in 1991, has recently been working in Detroit as a consultant.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Austrian Industries in flotation
move

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIAN Industries, the troubled state-owned metals and engineering group,
has proposed hiving off several subsidiaries and then floating at least half
of its equity in international capital markets early next year.
SG Warburg, which advised AI on the scheme, said the slimmed-down group,
consisting only of its steel and related engineering businesses, would have
a market value of about Sch15bn (Dollars 1.33bn).
Both AI and the Austrian government have long wanted to proceed with a
flotation, not least because of the existence of a Sch3bn 'going public' AI
bond issue which is convertible into shares until 1995.
But they have been frustratedby spectacular losses at the group's Austria
Metal (AMAG) aluminium subsidiary. These are likely to reach Sch13bn in the
three years to 1994, swamping the profitability of the group's core
businesses.
AI's main proposals are to sell all its non-core subsidiaries, including
AMAG, back to its parent company, Oesterreichische Industriebeteiligungs
(OIAG). On 1992 figures, this would leave a group with sales of Sch59.6bn,
operating profits of Sch991m and net debt of Sch3.2bn, 23 per cent of
shareholders'funds.
A few of the subsidiaries to be hived off, such as the Bohler Uddeholm
special steels business and the VA Bergtechnik mining equipment unit, are
successful and could be floated at a later time. Siemens has agreed to buy
the SGP Verkehrstechnik railway equipment subsidiary.
Mr Michael Sekyra, AI chief executive, said the government had broadly
accepted the plan and a final decision was expected next month.
The key to its success was for the government to underwrite the losses of
AMAG until OIAG was able to sell off other holdings.
The government's problem is that it has promised not to commit any more
taxpayers' money to the accident-prone nationalised industries. AI has
proposed that it provide a temporary guarantee for OIAG borrowing, and it
appears that this has been accepted.

WELLCOME, the UK-based drugs company, has agreed to take a 5 per cent stake
in Centocor, once a high-flying US biotechnology company that was brought
low last year when it failed to secure Food and Drug Administration approval
for its main product.
Wellcome will help develop and market some of the company's anti-cancer
drugs, principally Panorex, Centocor said on Friday. This drug is in final
trials in Germany and its first sales there could come in 1995, said Mr
David Holveck, chief executive.
Wellcome will buy 2m new shares in the company, whose stock closed on Friday
before the announcement at Dollars 9 1/4 . The price was not revealed but Mr
Holveck said it was paying a premium. It will also pay royalties to the
company, though these have yet to be agreed.
In a similar deal last year, Eli Lilly is believed to have paid Dollars 50m
for a 5 per cent stake in Centocor as part of a plan to develop and market
Centoxin, a treatment for bacterial infection.
The FDA's failure to approve Centoxin for the US market led to a collapse in
the share price of Centocor, which had previously been among the top five US
biotech companies by market capitalisation.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Novelle gives away Unix rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE among personal computer software suppliers for leadership in the
multi-million dollar operating system market will take an unexpected and
controversial turn tomorrow.
Mr Raymond Noorda, chief executive of the US networking specialist Novelle,
will announce he is 'giving away' Novelle's rights to Unix, one of the main
contenders to become the standard operating software for networked
computers, according to Unigram. X, an industry newsletter.
Less than three months ago, Novelle paid Dollars 320m to buy Unix Systems
Laboratories from AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant which developed the
software.
Novelle is expected to give the rights to Unix to a computer industry
consortium, X/Open, whose members include IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun
Microsystems.
Novelle will apparently still collect royalties from Unix sales, but the
move may pacify customers upset that a single company could control such
important software.
Operating systems are the key to what functions a computer can perform and
what software it can use.
Microsoft of the US grew to become the world's largest personal software
company because of its ownership of MS/Dos, the most popular software for
single-user computers.
Six weeks ago Microsoft introduced its own Unix-like software, Windows NT,
and has been trying to establish it as the industry standard.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: IRI reconsiders options for SME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company which is mounting an ambitious
privatisation campaign, will this week reconsider its options after another
embarrassing setback.
IRI has said that it will re-examine plans to privatise the supermarkets and
catering operations of its big SME foods and retailing subsidiary, after
failing to find suitable buyers last week.
The group will turn to the government to redraw the criteria for disposing
of the SME operations after potential buyers indicated they found the terms
too unattractive to warrant acceptable bids.
The failure to sell SME's GS (supermarkets) and Autogrill (catering) arms
follows last month's failure to sell another part of SME on account of a
lack of acceptable bids.
Selling GS and Autogrill would have marked the biggest transaction in IRI's
privatisation plans, which include the disposal of its majority stakes in
Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, two of Italy's biggest
banks.
The latest setback is a blow to IRI's credibility and especially to its
urgent cash-raising plans. On Friday night, the group announced the creation
of a new privatisation and restructuring department.
IRI, which had consolidated debts of about L73,000bn (Dollars 47bn) last
year, has targeted privatisation receipts as a vital financial lifeline at a
time when two of its biggest operations, Ilva (steel) and Iritecna
(construction and general contracting) are losing money heavily.
Last week, IRI suffered a further blow when parliament failed to approve a
government proposal to repay the group about L2,000bn in overdue tax
credits.
SME's supermarket subsidiary had sales of L2,631bn last year, making it one
of Italy's biggest retailers. The catering side is the nation's biggest
operation of its kind, with 1993 turnover of L1,115bn.
IRI said the offers to buy just over half its 62 per cent holding, had been
either 'unsatisfactory' or had failed to conform to the terms stipulated.
IRI's management, advised by Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking
group, had adopted a complex formula to create a hard core of investors and
avoid the need for a full public offer for the minority of shares already
floating.
Separately, IRI could shortly announce the outcome of its renewed attempts
to find buyers for SME's Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica (CBD) foods arm. The
previous bidding round is believed to have collapsed when none of the
interested parties came up with offers which met IRI's terms, or made very
low bids.
The failure of the first round for CBD means potential buyers may now be
allowed to bid for separate parts of the tinned foods, vegetable oils and
milk group, rather than only for the entire operation.
Subject to government approval, the terms are also likely to be relaxed for
SME's GS and Autogrill operations, with separate bids being permitted for
the retailing and catering arms and potential buyers being allowed to take
all IRI's 62 per cent stake, rather than having to form a consortium.

FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Venables faces more allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH allegations of irregularities at Tottenham Hotspur Football Club were
made in the Channel 4 programme Dispatches last night, writes Barry Riley.
Two weeks after Mr Terry Venables, former chief executive, left the club in
June this year, two bundles of cash totalling Pounds 8,750 were found in the
safe at Spurs. The money, according to the programme, was VAT originally
added in error to a cash payment of Pounds 50,000 in August 1992 to Mr Frank
McLintock, a former star footballer who is now a partner of a players'
agency.
At least in part, the money was a payment for handling the transfer of Mr
Teddy Sheringham from Nottingham Forest to Spurs late in 1991. Such payments
are against Football Association rules and both Mr Venables and Mr McLintock
told the programme's producers that the invoice was misleadingly made out in
order to get around this.
Another payment to an intermediary, an Italian restaurateur called Mr Gino
Santin, was highlighted by the programme as the original trigger for the
eventual breakdown of relations between Mr Venables and Spurs' chairman, Mr
Alan Sugar.
When Mr Santin was called in by Mr Venables in July 1991 to assist with the
complex and protracted negotiations to sell Mr Paul Gascoigne to the Italian
club Lazio, Mr Sugar was told by Mr Venables that Mr Santin would act for
nothing. In 1992, however, Mr Santin submitted an invoice for Pounds 200,000
in respect of 'activities and assistance regarding the transfer of Paul
Casgoigne (sic) to Latio (sic) Rome'.
Mr Santin, the programme reported, said that what started as a favour soon
developed into a different role.
There are contradictions between the claims of Mr Venables, who insists Mr
Santin was instrumental in raising the price from Pounds 4.825m to Pounds
5.5m, and Lazio, which says that the Pounds 5.5m offer was made two weeks
before Mr Santin became involved.
However, Lazio agreed, according to Dispatches, that Mr Santin was crucial
in keeping the deal going.

<TEXT>
COURT CAVENDISH Group. the nursing home company, has made its first
acquisitions since coming to the market in July.
The group is paying Pounds 3.75m cash for two privately-owned care homes in
Essex and Kent, with a combined total of 122 registered beds. In addition
the group has acquired from administrators a further 50-bed nursing home in
Sussex, which it has been managing, for Pounds 375,000.
Mr Tony Heywood, finance director, said the flotation had enabled the group
to clear its debt, leaving Pounds 15m to finance its expansion plans. It was
still looking for further suitable acquisitions in the south of England.
The group now operates 26 homes with a total of 1,306 beds. It is aiming to
expand at the rate of 500 beds a year.
The group also announced yesterday the appointment of Sir Donald Acheson,
chief medical adviser to the government from 1983 to 1991, as a
non-executive director with effect from October 1.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mid-States advances 36%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A 24 per cent increase in sales from Pounds 25m to Pounds 30.9m, pre-tax
profits of Mid-States, the wholesale and retail distributor of automotive
parts in the US, were boosted 36 per cent to Pounds 2.61m for the first half
of 1993, against Pounds 1.92m.
Mr William Cherry, chief executive, stated that the second half of the year
had opened strongly and prospects for the full period were 'most
encouraging'.
The share price rose 13p to 86p last Friday.
Profits of this USM-quoted company, which operates through its subsidiary,
Mid-State Automotive Distributors of Nashville, Tennessee, were after higher
interest payable of Pounds 522,000 (Pounds 412,000) and subject to tax of
Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 360,000).
Earnings per share were higher at 4.5p (3.2p). The interim dividend is held
at 0.75p with an enhanced scrip alternative of 1.125p.
The directors are also paying a special distribution of 2.25p with an
enhanced scrip alternative of 3.375p.
The company intends to implement an American Depositary Receipt programme in
the US as it is believed that shareholder value would be improved.
Following the implementation of the ADR programme, the company intends to
reduce its dividend pay-out 'so as to provide additional funds for
expansion.' The directors, therefore, plan that dividends would be set 'at a
level which is at most nominal.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram expected to lose Rooney and
advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM, the bathrooms and kitchens group, is expected to announce today
sweeping changes to its advisers.
The accounting firm Price Waterhouse is likely to take over the audit from
Arthur Andersen, while Barclays de Zoete Wedd are set to replace Panmure
Gordon as brokers.
These moves anticipate the climax in the group's long-running crisis
expected to be reached later this week with the exit of Mr Bill Rooney, one
of the founders of the company and its biggest shareholder.
On Wednesday the group will announce interim results. Unofficial market
estimates of the loss have grown from Pounds 25m a few weeks ago to as much
as Pounds 40m. Such a result could trigger Mr Rooney's departure, along with
other senior directors.
At the same time Mr Roger Regan, who was appointed chairman at the end of
July, is due to unveil his promised operational review, alongside a full
financial review from Price Waterhouse.
Mr Rooney, who still holds a 16 per cent stake, lost his job as executive
chairman to Mr Regan, a building industry veteran. Mr Regan was approached
by investment institutions, led by Prudential Corporation, after the West
Yorkshire-based company issued three profit warnings within eight months,
causing a collapse in the share price.
Although Mr Rooney has continued as chief executive working alongside Mr
Regan on a trial basis, the new chairman has enough votes on the board to
sack him.
Inconclusive bid talks last month, were followed by growing tension at board
level.

FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Mexican boost as Laser-Scan hits Pounds
45,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the return to profit in the second half of 1992, Laser-Scan
Holdings, computer software group, produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 45,000
for the first six months of 1993, compared with a Pounds 408,000 loss.
Turnover for the period expanded by 45 per cent from Pounds 3.99m to Pounds
5.78m.
The directors said that much of the improvement could be attributed to the
final deliveries against the Mexican contract.
The substantial amounts of third party hardware involved, although at
relatively low margins, 'made a useful contribution to profit' they said.
The second half is not expected to produce the same level of profit as last
year - Pounds 488,000 for the six months - although the directors believed
there was the potential ' to grow and to improve its profitability.'
Earnings per share were 0.3p (losses of 2.5p).

FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hozelock in Pounds 50m flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOZELOCK, the manufacturer of garden equipment, is to be floated on the
stock market in November at an estimated value of Pounds 50m.
The company, which is forecasting a 30 per cent increase in operating
profits from Pounds 3.8m in the 12 months to September 25 1992 to Pounds 5m
this year, hopes to raise up to Pounds 20m to fund expansion and reduce
gearing.
Mr David Codling, managing director, said the company needed to come to the
market to strengthen its balance sheet. The proceeds will repay bank loans
and redeem existing preference shares.
'Our aim is to raise enough capital to have very conservative gearing, so
that if an acquisition came along we wouldn't have to go back to the bank,'
Mr Codling said.
He expected many of Hozelock's customers in the UK, where the market in
garden products is estimated to be worth more than Pounds 1.5bn, to become
investors.
Sales to such customers have grown by more than 10 per cent a year since a
Pounds 24m management buy-out from Ropner in 1990. This year turnover is
expected to grow to Pounds 32m, against Pounds 27.3m last time.
Although the proportion of the share capital coming to the market has yet to
be finalised, the team of 20 executives who led the buy-out could see the
total value of their shareholdings increase to Pounds 8m if the market
capitalisation is set at Pounds 50m.
The company hopes a listing will help it expand operations overseas, where
sales this year are expected to exceed Pounds 8m.
Manufacturing of the group's 300 products is due to increase next year when
it moves its main plant from Aston, Birmingham, to a new Pounds 8.5m factory
on the other side of the city.
The flotation will be sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and James Capel
will act as brokers.

FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Second threat to Glaxo's Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO'S victory on Friday over Novopharm, the Canadian manufacturer of
generics drugs, about the US patents of Zantac, the world's best-selling
medicine, increases the British group's chances of winning a second patent
case next year.
Genpharm, a Canadian generics company smaller than Novopharm, is due to
challenge Glaxo's patents next May. Lawyers representing Genpharm attended
the Novopharm case, which was heard in North Carolina, near Glaxo's US
headquarters.
Both Canadian groups claim an unstable liquid form of the drug, for which
Glaxo's patent expires in December 1995, is insufficiently different from
the marketed form to justify different patents. The stable form's patents
expire in 2002.
If Novopharm had won, it would have been able to market a generic version of
Zantac in the US from January 1996.
Glaxo's victory was crucial to the company's future. In the last financial
year, Zantac, an ulcer treatment, generated sales of Pounds 2.17bn,
equivalent to 44 per cent of group turnover.
Sales of drugs whose US patents have recently expired have halved in a year.
About half Zantac's sales are in the US. Some analysts believe the case
depressed the shares by up to 100p. The shares closed at 644p on Friday.
At Glaxo's full-year results earlier this month, Dr Richard Sykes, chief
executive, warned there were additional threats to Zantac other than the
patent challenges. They remain:
The expiry next year of the US patents of Zantac's main competitor,
SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Zantac will have to compete with cheap generic
versions of that drug.
The eradication of helicobacter pylori, a bacterium which has recently been
discovered to be implicated in ulcers. If doctors decided to eradicate the
bug rather than prescribe Zantac-type drugs, the market could collapse.
Over-the-counter non-prescription versions of best-selling anti-ulcer drugs
such as Tagamet and Merck's Pepcid. The immediacy of this threat receded
last week because of the refusal of US Food and Drug Administration advisory
committees to recommend an OTC version of Tagamet.
New-generation drugs, such as Astra's Losec.
Generic versions of unstable liquid form of Zantac after its patents expire
at the end of 1995. Dr Sykes played down this threat, arguing there were
doubts about the quality of generic manufacturing.

FT  20 SEP 93 / HK completes Pounds 3.9m probe into Allied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HONG KONG government issued on Saturday the results of a 13-month
investigation into alleged corporate fraud by the Allied group, a probe
which has cost HKDollars 46m (Pounds 3.9m) and sparked the largest
commercial crime raid in the colony's history.
The report details how Allied chairman Mr Lee Ming-tee created a network of
listed, but supposedly independent companies. It alleges that he used these
to consolidate control of a sprawling corporate empire, to by-pass listing
regulations, and to manipulate share prices of group companies.
The investigation has been described locally as 'the Carrian of the 1990s',
referring to the infamous HKDollars 100m court battle over the collapse of
the Carrian property group in 1983. But while the scale of the Allied
investigation has been immense, the allegations are less damaging.
The inspector's report lists five recommendations, of which only two were
made public. These concern the creation of safeguards within the group to
prevent misconduct by individual directors, and such measures have already
been implemented.
It is understood that the three unpublished recommendations are:
That indications of criminal activity should be further investigated. This
was addressed in Wednesday's raid on Allied offices by 300 police officers.
The Stock Exchange and Securities and Futures Commission is advised to
examine further any alleged breaches in listing regulations.
It is suggested that the companies involved in the report should examine the
findings and consider any further action.
The report finds evidence of market manipulation, non-disclosure of
substantial shareholdings and inter-group deals disguised as arms-length
transactions. It remains to be seen, however, whether it has there is
sufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings.
Allied described the investigation as a 'witch hunt'. According to Allied's
managing director Mr Brian O'Connor, the colony's financial secretary, Mr
Hamish MacLeod, had promised the group an advance copy of the report and a
meeting prior to its release. Neither of these promises had been fulfilled,
Mr O'Connor said.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Markets aground on a reef of cautious results: The UK
interim reporting season has caused concern about the speed of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gathering confidence that UK economic recovery is under way appears to
have been a dealt a blow by the cautious tone of many of the companies
reporting during the interim results season.
Forecasters hoping that a strong earnings growth would underpin the recent
rise in the Footsie index were first given a nasty shock by BTR, the
industrial conglomerate. It said that there was no evidence to suggest that
recovery was translating into significant increases in corporate
profitability and warned the outlook remained uncertain for any 'meaningful
upturn' in the second half.
A similar message came from Williams Holdings, another industrial
conglomerate. Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said the pace of the UK recovery was
slow and warned that in the low inflationary environment it was proving very
hard to increase prices.
Both conglomerates increased pre-tax profits but their shares fell on the
back of their less-than-ebullient trading statements. A week later the
Footsie followed suit, falling below 3,000 less than a month after it
reached an all-time high by breaking through the 3,100 mark.
Mr Jerry Evans, strategist at NatWest Markets, believes recent falls in the
market reflect concern about the prospects for profits. Though he is not
changing his earnings forecasts after three weeks of results, Mr Evans says
it is clear UK earnings would have to pick up significantly to sustain the
Footsie index above the 3000 mark.
Some chairmen who have been unable to deliver such an increase have been
unable to hide their anger at the expectations which had been created.
Lord Sterling, chairman of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company,
which disappointed the market with lower than expected profits before
disposals, said: 'It would have been abundantly clear to anyone who read our
annual report that the UK recovery is slower than anticipated.'
Another chairman blamed economists and politicians for talking up a recovery
'beyond the realms of reality'.
But how much weight should the market be attaching to the reservations of
companies about recovery prospects?
Mr Mark Cusack, conglomerate analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, believes
many industrialists during the recession made the mistake of calling the
upturn too quickly. 'It is possible that they are now being too cautious,'
Mr Cusack says.
This view is reinforced by Mr John Thomson, senior investment manager at
Standard Life. 'Companies are always cautious at this stage of the recovery.
They have been through hell and are not about to scream from the rooftops
when things get better. The market may be a hundred points off its high but
it is still good value.'
Regardless of whether companies are exaggerating the slow upturn,
forecasters take comfort from the fact that the gloom about the UK's
recovery prospects is not universally shared. Some of the housebuilders,
such as Blue Circle Industries, have become more upbeat.
There have been some surprisingly generous dividend increases. Glaxo,
Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, reported a 17 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the year and increased the dividend by 29 per cent.
Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurance company, raised its
interim dividend almost 10 per cent.
Some fund managers believe the outlook for dividend growth may be better
than many forecasts, irrespective of the slow recovery in earnings.
However, even if there is a delay in the earnings recovery it does not
necessarily mean that the benefits of sterling leaving the European exchange
rate mechanism last September, and the interest rate cuts which have
followed, will not materialise. It could be that they have just been
postponed.
Whether that postponement is temporary or longer-term, Mr George Hodgson,
strategist at Warburg Securities, believes earnings disappointed the market
because people failed to take account of the fact that the UK is virtually
alone in enjoying rising confidence about prospects for recovery.
Mr Hodgson explained: 'While economists in the UK were throwing their hats
up in the air at the prospect of a strong recovery mainland Europe was going
down the tubes, Japan was in serious trouble and the rate of recovery in the
US slowed.'
The significant slippage in world growth forecasts for 1993 - they have
nearly halved since the beginning of the year - has gone unnoticed in a UK
market pre-occupied with domestic issues.
Mr Christopher Miller, chief executive of Wassall, a small conglomerate,
concurs. 'In the UK, the ingredients for a sustained economic improvement
are in place. But a full recovery may have to wait for further falls in
Continental interest rates. You cannot have the one without the other.'
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that companies with an international
spread of activities are starting to sound more cautious about second-half
earnings.
Notwithstanding last week's inflation figures, showing the year-on-year
increase in the RPI - excluding mortgage interest payments - edging up to
3.1 per cent in August from 2.9 per cent in July, most companies remain
confident the outlook for low inflation is good. With falling bond yields
investors may have no other option but to put their money into equities.
'That is one of the best reasons to look for the exit door,' says Mr
Hodgson, who argues that deteriorating world growth makes it highly
plausible that multiples will come under increasing downward pressure.
This may explain why many analysts assume that the FT-SE Index will move
back into the trading range established in the first half of the year -
around the 2,900 level.

FT  20 SEP 93 / BAe space sale talks face early restart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS AIMED at selling British Aerospace's satellite-making division to
Matra-Marconi Space, the Anglo-French joint venture, are set to restart next
month.
The sale to Matra-Marconi Space, which is Europe's biggest manufacturer of
satellites, could help secure the future of BAe's remaining space operations
at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and Filton, near Bristol.
Matra-Marconi would integrate design and manufacturing at the two BAe sites
into its own two centres at Portsmouth, Hampshire, and Toulouse, in
south-west France.
A sale would be part of BAe's strategy to dispose of non-core businesses in
an attempt to improve its profitability.
An attempt last year to sell the division, which has a turnover of about
Pounds 120m a year, fell through when Matra-Marconi Space declined to take
on all the businesses on offer.
Since then, BAe's space division has roughly halved its workforce to 1,100.
It spun off its communications services operation last November.
The restructuring had cleared the way for a reopening of talks, said Mr
Claude Goumy, chairman of Matra-Marconi Space.
He said any deal could be completed quickly because last year's talks got as
far as a due diligence study by Matra-Marconi Space. 'We are hoping that
talks will start next month and that an outcome will be clear by the end of
the year.'
Matra-Marconi Space is 51 per cent owned by Matra-Hachette of France and 49
per cent by GEC.
BAe acknowledged that the division was still up for sale but said talks had
not yet started. The group was likely to argue that restructuring has put a
higher price tag on the business.
Mr Goumy, by contrast, said the operation was 'not worth much. It's a
question of negotiating goodwill.'
BAe's activities in the commercial space industry have been shrinking for
several years. Last October, it failed to win a Pounds 150m contract to
build a telecommunications satellite for the Arabsat consortium.
It is working on two main contracts: Envisat, part of a Dollars 2.2bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) European Space Agency (ESA) programme due for launch in 1998;
and Skynet 4 for the UK Ministry of Defence for which it has a Pounds 10m
project development programme.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Economics Notebook: Aux armes, consumers - France wants its
people to spend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's consumers are being called to arms to help lift the country from
recession. But measures to boost household spending to be presented to the
cabinet this week as part of next year's budget would be more persuasive if
consumers were not still digesting the effects of earlier tax increases and
if the continued rise in unemployment was not sapping confidence.
A recovery in household spending is certainly necessary if France's escape
from its economic slump. Household consumption suffered a sharp fall of 0.7
per cent in the first quarter. It rose by 0.4 per cent in the second
quarter, but most economists describe this as an unsustainable correction
rather than a rally.
The zero rate of inflation in August and a series of gloomy surveys of the
retail sector indicate the fragile state of domestic spending.
'An increase in demand, particularly from households, is now an important
means to aid the economy,' says an official at the French finance ministry
in Paris. Economists are blunt. 'Consumer spending is the only hope for
economic recovery,' says Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at Morgan Guaranty in
Paris. 'Investment won't recover without it, and external demand remains
weak.'
The response of the French government has been to reach for the fiscal
levers. The budget measures will include a FFr19bn (Pounds 2.16bn) cut in
income taxes, aimed principally at the middle classes. The reduction, says
the government, will be achieved through a reform of the country's complex
system of tax bands and will apply to income earned this year. Officials
indicate that half of income tax payers will see their bills reduced by at
least 10 per cent after the reform.
At the same time, the government plans to allow private investors to
withdraw early from eight-year personal savings plans while maintaining the
tax advantages and interest payments of the scheme. The measure will be
included in the budget, but is expected to be retroactive from the end of
this month.
The finance ministry says such savings plans currently hold about FFr300bn.
The reform will apply to individual investors who do not pay income tax. But
with more than 40 per cent of French households included in this category -
because the bulk of French taxes are raised through indirect means - about
one-quarter of the total amount in PEPs would be covered by the measures.
'This is a potentially powerful way of shifting the balance of household
funds towards consumption,' says one Paris banker.
Already, the government has sought to ease the pressure on consumers by
one-off measures. At the beginning of this month, for example, the state
increased from FFr400 to FFr1,500 the payment to families with
schoolchildren to help cover the costs of the return to classes. The
increase, for lower and middle income families, is estimated to have
involved an additional FFr5bn of government expenditure.
The government is not alone in wooing French consumers. The Caisse d'Epargne
de Paris said last month that it would reduce its minimum borrowing rate for
consumers by three percentage points to 9 per cent from the beginning of
October. Credit du Nord and Credit Lyonnais have since followed suit.
The banks are acting in anticipation of lower interest rates, despite the
government's glacial pace in reducing borrowing costs since the European
currency crisis forced the effective flotation of the franc at the beginning
of August. 'They expect interest rates will come down, and they are seeking
to gain market share in advance,' says one French banker.
But despite this array of appetisers, consumers may not be tempted, either
by the banks or by the government's exhortations. Part of the problem is
that French consumers are still coming to terms with an increase, from 1.1
per cent to 2.4 per cent, in the Contribution Sociale Generalisee, a special
tax on all revenue. This increase took effect at the beginning of July,
along with an increase in taxes on petrol, alcohol and tobacco.
'These items are fairly price inelastic' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier,
French economist at Salomon Bros. 'Households are therefore likely to spend
less on other items to compensate.
Nor are lower interest rates entirely good news for consumption. A study
published last month by the Bank of France estimated that a 1.5 percentage
point cut in long term interest rates and a 3 percentage point cut in short
term rates would cut household income by FFr50bn, leading to a 0.5 per cent
fall in consumer spending in the first year and a 0.2 point fall in the
following year.
Economists, however, still believe lower rates are necessary to revive
consumption and the French economy. 'The most important function of interest
rates is as a relative price between savings and consumption. A reduction
will therefore boost spending,' says one economist at a Paris-based bank.
Perhaps more importantly, reduced interest rates could ease the root problem
facing French consumers - the relentless rise of unemployment, currently at
11.7 per cent, and the resulting loss in economic confidence and increased
precautionary savings.
According to the Bank of France study, the effects of their notional
reductions in interest rates would knock FFr40bn off companies' annual
interest payments. By easing pressure on the balance sheet, it would also
ease pressures on their payrolls.
Without an improvement in unemployment, few economists expect a rapid
recovery in consumer confidence. 'If you think your job is in danger then
you are reluctant to consume,' says Mr Mercier at Salomon Bros.
In addition, the depressed labour market has kept real wage increases, and
hence purchasing power, flat.
If the French monetary authorities can guide real interest rates lower,
cutting the key intervention rate a few percentage points below its current
level of 6.75 per cent, then economists forecast a revival in spending.
Until then, however, consumers may be reluctant to take their hands from
their pockets.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Bid war looming in US over Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION is intensifying that other US media moguls will initiate a
bidding war for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group
which agreed to be acquired by Viacom for Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 5.3bn) a
week ago.
Reacting to the possibility of a rival bid, a Paramount spokesman said: 'We
repeat what we have said from the first day: the merger with Viacom is a
perfect business fit and is in the best interests of our shareholders. It
will be completed.'
However, a routine board meeting of Turner Broadcasting on Friday is
believed to have given Mr Ted Turner, the mercurial founder of the Cable
News Network television channel, a green light to examine ways of getting
involved in a rival bid.
In an interview with the Financial Times conducted last Thursday (see Monday
interview, Back Page) Mr Turner was dismissive of the idea that he might
enter a bidding war because it would be too costly, but analysts speculated
yesterday that he might launch one in conjunction with other media groups.
Turner Broadcasting is much smaller than Paramount.
Another possible bidder is Mr Barry Diller, who played a key role helping Mr
Rupert Murdoch build Fox into America's fourth television network and now
heads QVC Network, which offers cable television home shopping. Mr Diller is
ambitious to build QVC into a more broadly based network.

FT  20 SEP 93 / UK warns France over threat to EC farm trade agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, QUENTIN PEEL and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, BONN, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government threatened yesterday to block French initiatives in
the European Community unless Paris drops threats to veto the Blair House
agreement on farm trade.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said in speeches and interviews in Tokyo
that French opposition to the agreement was 'wrong and dangerous'.
Officials said Mr Major was 'extremely concerned' about the possibility that
the Uruguay Round talks on the general agreement on tariffs and trade might
unravel if Paris succeeded in reopening the agreement, which sets out a
common EC and US position on agricultural trade.
France remained resolutely opposed to the US-EC Blair House agreement,
threatening to veto the deal unless its EC partners agreed that negotiations
would be reopened.
'The EC cannot conclude any Gatt agreement without a unanimous decision of
its members,' said Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the French government spokesman,
after a meeting of cabinet ministers called to discuss today's negotiations
in Brussels.
A statement issued by the office of the French prime minister, Mr Edouard
Balladur, said: 'The so-called Blair House pre-accord is incompatible with
the reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy.' As a result, the
statement said, discussions must be launched on a new basis between the EC
and its partners, particularly the US.
Mr Major's comments set the scene for a fierce argument over the agreement
at a meeting in Brussels today of EC farm, foreign and trade ministers.
The conflict is causing growing worries in Bonn that the UK government may
take almost as intransigent a position in defence of the Blair House
agreement as the French government is taking in attacking it - thus
precipitating deadlock. 'The British seem to see this as a good way of
undermining the Franco-German alliance,' a senior Bonn official said at the
weekend. 'They are taking a very hard line in rejecting any attempt to help
the French government.'
Germany's position has been that it is not ready to 'renegotiate' the Blair
House accord, but is prepared to try to 'reinterpret' it to soften the blow
for French exports.
Privately, UK officials used much stronger language. A senior aide to the
prime minister said the UK was 'determined to stop the French wrecking the
Uruguay Round'.
Britain is understood to be drawing up a list of EC issues on which life
could be made 'difficult' for France. The top priority is likely to be
blocking French ambitions for the proposed European Monetary Institute.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Treasury hires consultant to shake up top management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury has brought in a management consultant usually paid about
Pounds 2,000 a day to change its organisational culture and increase the
effectiveness of its senior officials.
Ms Wendy Pritchard, who has helped push through change at big companies
including BP and Lloyds Bank is working with top Treasury officials under
Sir Terry Burns, the permanent secretary.
The radical move to bring in an outside consultant to shed light on the
Treasury's closed world is a sign of the pressure on the mandarins to
respond to sustained criticism that the department is out of touch and
inward looking.
Ms Pritchard, who runs her own London-based consultancy, has been hired to
work part-time. She is known in the consultancy world for working
intensively behind closed doors with senior managers to discuss how they
manage their workforce and relate to each other.
Ms Pritchard said: 'I find all this (publicity) slightly alarming as I
normally try to keep out of the newspapers.'
She is described as a 'an entrepreneur who acts as general practitioner to
top executives,' by Mr Richard Beckhard, a New York based consultant who has
collaborated with her.
Ms Pritchard is among a small number of people in management consultancy in
her field of 'change management'.
A close associate said she that would normally charge about Pounds 2,000 a
day. 'This kind of person does not come cheap,' he said.
Ms Pritchard did not comment on how much the Treasury was paying her. The
Treasury said it had nothing to say on an internal management exercise.
Ms Pritchard has previously been employed full time at Rank Xerox, and at
Shell International, where she worked for 15 years and was head of
organisational effectiveness. She set up her consultancy, Wendy Pritchard
Associates, about three years ago. Recently advised the Department of Health
on how to introduce change into the health service.
The consultant was introduced by Sir Terry to senior Treasury officials at
an unpublicised meeting in a Berkshire hotel in May. The gathering was
mainly for top 15 or so people who constitute the Treasury 'management
board' and who are in charge of the 1,500-strong organisation.
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry
and a former McKinsey consultant, attended a dinner after the meeting to
review how the Treasury could change the way it managed decisions in its
field of economic policy and public spending.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Canada's smugglers make a packet: A look at the growing
trade in cut-price US cigarettes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY along the US-Canada border is increasingly reminiscent of the
rough, tough days of Prohibition. The difference is that the direction of
the illicit traffic has been reversed, and the product being smuggled is not
whisky, but cigarettes.
Cross-border smuggling has become a huge headache for Canada's tobacco
industry and for law enforcement agencies.
According to industry estimates, almost one in five cartons of cigarettes
sold in Canada has been smuggled across the border. Retailers in Quebec,
where the problem is at its worst, say they are losing more than half their
business to smugglers.
The surge in cigarette smuggling can be traced to the 'sin' taxes imposed on
tobacco.
In most provinces, smokers pay four different federal and provincial taxes.
This means a pack of 20 cigarettes costing about CDollars 6.30 (USDollars
4.85) in a Toronto drugstore will be USDollars 2.15, in a US store over the
border in Buffalo, New York.
Official figures show that domestic cigarette sales fell 26 per cent in
July, compared to a year earlier. But, as Mr Jacques LaRiviere,
vice-president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council, points out:
'What has happened is not a decline in consumption. The consumer has been
looking for alternatives, and where there is demand, there develops supply.'
Many of the smuggled cigarettes meeting that demand are made in Canada
because Canadian smokers tend to prefer Canadian brands which use pure
Virginia tobacco.
Canadian cigarettes sold to some US wholesalers are being resold to
organised crime syndicates which then transport them back across the border
in small boats or under the false floors of cars and trucks.
As a result, while domestic sales have been shrinking, exports have surged
by 88 per cent to 9.7bn cigarettes in the first seven months of this year.
Once back in Canada, the cigarettes are sold tax-free in bars, shopping mall
parking lots and schools.
Prominent labels on exported cigarette packs, which warn that the contents
are not for sale in Canada, have failed to stop the trade. Manufacturers
report that a growing proportion of smuggled cigarettes come in packs that
are almost identical to those produced for the domestic market.
Greater vigilance by police and customs officials at border crossings has
been ineffective. Enforcement is complicated by the fact that much of the
traffic is channelled through Indian reserves which straddle the border and
whose inhabitants claim that outside authorities have no right to interfere.
Some in the industry say the best, and perhaps the only, way to stop the
illicit traffic would be to lighten the tax burden on tobacco. But that
appears unlikely. Hefty taxes on cigarettes are designed to discourage
smoking as well as providing revenues to the government.
But as the cross-border bootleggers proved 70 years ago, smokers and
drinkers will not easily let politicians deprive them of their pleasures.

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: RTZ
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ is coming to the end of its greatest shuffling of assets since it bought
BP's minerals division and sold out of specialty chemicals in 1989. The
acquisition of Nerco's US coal interests in February and disposal of Pillar
sharpens RTZ's focus on mining. While laudable in terms of strategy,
shedding Pounds 1bn of industrial turnover nudges the group's sensitivity to
metals prices higher still. It comes as no surprise to find that the 6 per
cent fall in the shares so far this month is matched by a fall in copper,
RTZ's most important metal due to the BP acquisition.
With the copper price taking another tumble on Friday, the immediate outlook
for the shares is far from rosy. While copper might quickly recover from the
current depths, a sustained improvement looks a year or more away. Copper
has suffered less than other metals on the downswing, but the overhang of
stock in the market will act as a drag on recovery. The broader question is
what mix of commodity exposures RTZ wants to build in the longer term.
Acquiring an interest in US coal makes perfect sense by providing a stable
stream of earnings to balance the metals interests. But low-cost reserves of
the type RTZ finds attractive are few and far between. Building an interest
in aggregates might perform a similar function. With gearing reduced to 17
per cent following the disposal of Pillar, it has room to make another
substantial move.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having reshaped the profit and loss and introduced a new style cash flow
statement, the Accounting Standards Board is turning its attention to the
balance sheet. The current hodge-podge of current cost and historical cost
asset valuations clearly needs an overhaul. There is little consistency
between companies as to what assets are revalued and how often. The ASB must
also come up with a solution for the thorny issue of acquired goodwill,
which many companies argue should not be amortised like a physical asset but
revalued instead.
Yet any move towards a system under which all assets are subject to regular
revaluation is sure to meet resistance. Mr Ron Paterson of Ernst &amp; Young,
the accountancy firm, has argued for a more traditional approach. He is not
alone in the view that the only hard evidence of what most assets are worth
arises when they change hands. Introducing regular asset revaluations risks
undermining the credibility of information contained on the balance sheet.
Extending that approach to intangible assets such as acquired goodwill would
introduce another layer of subjectivity.
These practical arguments conceal deeper disagreements about the function of
the balance sheet and accounts in general. Mr Paterson says that valuation
is the job of the market, not the accountant. The balance sheet should thus
confine itself to recording transactions and return to a system of pure
historical cost. It is not necessary to agree with that conclusion to
appreciate the sentiment. Whichever approach to the balance sheet the ASB
finally takes, it must be wary of creating an expectations gap between what
accounts can provide and what users think they are getting.

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Corporate bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The year since sterling left the ERM has seen a remarkable transformation of
the UK corporate bond market. As long rates have fallen, spreads over gilts
have narrowed sharply - by about 70 basis points to around 100 on 15-year
unsecured issues, according to BZW. Such tight spreads raise doubts about
whether corporate bonds can continue to outperform, especially if worries
about inflation stop gilt yields falling. In theory, supply should then
increase as companies hurry to issue debt before absolute yields rise;
demand would diminish as higher gilt yields reduce the need for investors to
trade risk for extra return.
Real life looks more complicated. The credit standing of some borrowers has
undergone a sea change. This applies not only in the property sector but
also to companies such as British Aerospace whose bonds due 2014 trade at a
spread less than half last autumn's 310 point peak. Such exceptional
outperformance makes BAe's paper vulnerable to correction. More generally,
though, the shape of the yield curve seems likely to be decisive. While it
remains steeply positive, retail investors will continue shopping for higher
returns. They may only look closely at the risks of buying subordinated bank
and building society paper when base rates rise again.
An upward sloping yield curve is equally a deterrent to borrowers. Recent
issuance has concentrated on maturities of up to ten years where interest
rate swaps are available. At the long end, supply is short. Corporate
borrowers incur a cost by borrowing long when the proceeds can only be
invested at lower rates in the money market. Rightly or wrongly, that is
making treasurers dither.

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Growing pains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is sometimes difficult to believe that Europe's leaders are interested in
growth at all. Not only are ERM countries deeply reluctant to cut interest
rates, France is trying to persuade its partners to put the world trading
system at risk by reopening the Blair House agreement on farm trade while EC
support is apparently growing for the reimposition of capital controls. This
seems curious when there is also so much concern about unemployment - at
least to those who hold that free trade, and by extension free movement of
capital, is the best way to secure long-term growth and sustainable jobs.
Europe seems to be drifting towards a dirigiste approach in which the need
to maximise growth is subordinate to other priorities. The Gatt may matter
less to those who assume that social and political problems are best dealt
with by trade protection. In a world of trading blocs, the US and Pacific
Rim would flourish: Europe, with the additional burden of refloating former
communist countries, would see less growth and more inflation.
That is bad news for European equities which have risen on expectations of
lower interest rates, economic revival and a robust recovery in earnings. At
current levels, markets cannot afford much of a shock, least of all with so
much privatisation business in the wings. They would look unkindly on the
threat to recovery from trade sanctions which would surely follow any
breakdown of the Gatt.

Reflective Liberal Democrats at the seaside town of Torquay for their
party's annual jamboree may have bitter-sweet memories of 1985.
That year in Torquay, David Owen held his most successful conference as
leader of the old Social Democrats.
Then, as now, the centrist forces were riding high in the polls, flushed
with local election triumphs. There was the same sense of panic among the
Tories. Now Paddy Ashdown hopes to cut the same sort of dash as Owen.
But Lib Dems must be hoping comparisons end there. For Torquay 1985 marked a
watershed; thereafter, it was all downhill as the Tories recovered and won
in 1987. The Social Democrats split - the majority merging with the Liberals
and the minority following Owen in a splinter group.
Still, a reminder of the past which will not upset conference delegates is
one of Torquay's more well-known landmarks - the Thatcher rock.

With Peter Morgan, the fiery, Welsh-born director-general of the Institute

attention shifts to the question of his successor.
Amid some suggestions that Morgan would not have been entirely unhappy to
consider another term at the top, headhunters are seeking a man or woman
with 'vision, energy, drive and commitment' to occupy the spacious office
suite at the top of the IoD's gracious Pall Mall headquarters.
Morgan, who has managed to raise the profile of the IoD in his battles to
promote the forces of free enterprise, will be a hard act to follow. The
organisation, which is said to be engaged in a fairly heated debate over its
future strategic role, will certainly need someone else capable of making a
public impact like Howard Davies over at the CBI.
Word is that redundant politicians need not apply and that someone who has
already made a mark on industry would go down well. But if the IoD really
wants to break new ground and raise a few members' eyebrows it might
consider Mrs Ann Robinson, its own director of policy.

As if John Major hasn't got enough problems with his backbench 'devils', he
is also having to cope with stroppy businessmen. There was an unseemly
incident at Heathrow when industry captains travelling to Tokyo with him
boarded the British Airways chartered DC10.
Some of the captains of industry were unhappy to discover they were expected
to pass the 12-hour flight in business class accommodation, while the prime
minister's party travelled first class. The most vigorous complaints were
made by Lord Prior, chairman of GEC and former cabinet minister, who got
himself upgraded to first class. But only at the expense of a secretary
travelling with Richard Needham, the trade minister, who was unceremoniously
shunted back down the aircraft.
The seating was not the only shock for Major's flying compatriots. While the
prime minister's party was given the usual red carpet treatment on arrival,
the businessmen had to find their own way onto the tarmac, many carrying
their own bags.
The entire experience came as a bit of a shock to some. Lord Young, chairman
of Cable &amp; Wireless, was good humoured about it all, even though he was
obviously missing the red carpet treatment he got as Mrs Thatcher's trade
secretary. Nothing like a bit of bag-carrying to keep one's feet on the
ground.

At the end of debates in France's National Assembly, some MPs can be seen
walking up and down the vacant benches, pressing the electronic voting
buttons belonging to their absent colleagues.
Lazy MPs know their more active friends will record them as having voted,
and they can thus absent themselves to pursue more rewarding entertainments.
This must stop, says the assembly's president, Philippe Seguin. He has
issued a ruling that MPs should stick to the constitution and cast only
their own votes.
Seguin is trying to stamp out the practice of multiple proxy voting,
prevalent since the 1959 introduction of electronic balloting, not because
of the risk it may lead to political malpractice. Rather, he wants to boost
attendance in the assembly because its plenary debates will from next month
be carried on cable television.
He also plans to bring in outside stars; King Juan Carlos of Spain will
address the Assembly on October 7. The last foreign leader accorded such an
opportunity was US President Woodrow Wilson, in 1919.

The anglophile Russian ambassador to London, Boris Pankin, is reluctantly
leaving at the behest of president Boris Yeltsin.
A youthful 62, Pankin would have relished staying on but he is to return to
his pre-diplomatic career as a writer and publicist.
A graduate of Moscow State university who in his early 30s edited the daily
Komsomolskaya Pravda, Pankin became ambassador, first to Sweden and then in
Prague.
Almost alone among Soviet envoys, he condemned the 1991 putsch before its
outcome was clear. His reward was a brief stint as Soviet foreign minister,
before moving to London in 1991.
But it has been clear for some time that Pankin, seen as an amiable but
inactive ambassador, believed he had fallen from grace. Yeltsin is said to
want to move Vladimir Lukin, his US ambassador, to another post - and needs
an empty embassy. But the ambitious Lukin has so far refused the lesser
London posting.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Siting the Games
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM THE beginning of the modern Olympic movement a century ago, the right
to host the quadrennial games has been hotly contested. At first the
contestants were merely the sporting establishments in different countries -
in 1896 the Greek government was apparently not consulted - but the issue
inevitably became politicised as the prestige of the Games grew. National
and civic pride were involved from the start. The economic and commercial
stakes have also become considerable, although the costs have kept pace: few
have forgotten the spectacular overrun at Montreal in 1976.
Since that time financial guarantees, from national governments and private
interests (especially television), have been a big consideration for the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) in deciding where to hold the Games.
The support of American television and other corporate sponsors was almost
certainly decisive in securing the 1996 Games for Atlanta, when many had
expected that for their centenary they would return to Greece.
Favoured city
The IOC has also tended to make its decisions further and further in
advance. The choice for 1996 was made in September 1990; that for 2000 is to
be made this week. The object of this is, of course, to give the favoured
city time for the more and more spectacular preparations that are deemed
necessary. Hosting the Olympics has come to be seen as the key to unlock a
veritable El Dorado of public and private investment. Even a bid which is
not given a very strong chance of success - like that of Manchester this
time - can be used as the centrepiece of a development strategy aimed at
changing a city's image.
But the Olympics cannot work miracles, as the authorities in Brasilia
implicitly recognised when they withdrew their bid last month. It is no good
having the backing of your national authorities if they themselves are
generally perceived as insolvent. Perhaps unfairly, similar consid-erations
will almost certainly rule out Istanbul, while Berlin has to contend with
the memory of the 1936 Olympics, opened by Chancellor Adolf Hitler and ably
exploited by his propaganda chief Josef Goebbels.
The final choice seems likely to be between Sydney and Beijing. The former
has many technical considerations in its favour, but the latter may have the
edge for reasons largely unconnected with sport. The Chinese authorities
desperately want it, and China is now widely seen as the most exciting area
of the world economy.
Troubled memories
Yet it would surely be imprudent, as well as unjust, to let memories of 1936
count against Berlin while giving Beijing the benefit of the doubt. If 1936
looms large in Berlin's case, it is because a minority of the city's own
inhabitants is deeply troubled by those memories, and is free to draw
attention to them. The memory of what happened in Beijing in 1989 - the
Tiananmen Square massacre - may not have been drawn so directly to the IOC's
attention, but it should be much fresher.
No doubt things have improved in China since then, and with luck by 2000
they will have improved even more. But who can possibly tell? The IOC should
not risk inflicting on the world another drama like that of Mexico in 1968,
when the Games were held in a city from which the blood of hundreds of
student rioters had scarcely been cleaned; nor yet another dilemma like that
of Moscow in 1980, when those who competed, in defiance of a US-led boycott,
found themselves implicitly condoning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Trade sanctions are not an appropriate way to advance the cause of human
rights in China. But to commit the world to holding its top sporting event
in Beijing in seven years would amount to a vote of confidence in China's
rulers which they cannot be said to have earned. The Chinese authorities
have in recent weeks sought to boost their chances by taking steps to
improve their image on human rights. But they have also corralled their
citizens into assisting their bid in typically repressive fashion and would
almost certainly do likewise during the event itself. Beijing should be told
that it can stage the Games only when its own people are at liberty to enjoy
them.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Germany's giant driven off course: A look at the impact of
recession at Daimler-Benz, the country's flagship group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, DAVID WALLER and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For decades the three-cornered star on the bonnet of every Mercedes-Benz car
has symbolised the success of Germany's postwar economy. More recently, the
star has come to symbolise something different: the difficulties experienced
by German manufacturing industry in the country's deepest recession since
1945.
The Daimler-Benz group, of which the Mercedes-Benz car and commercial
vehicle operations are the core, is suffering badly in the current downturn.
On Friday the group disclosed losses of DM949m (Pounds 380m) in the first
six months of 1993, a DM1.9bn swing into the red. The figures were
calculated for the first time under the much more revealing US accounting
rules ahead of Daimler-Benz's listing, next month, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Yet even this reversal does not represent the low-point for Germany's
flagship industrial group: that is yet to come. Mr Gerhard Liener, finance
director, warned that losses would be 'considerably worse' after the third
quarter.
The deficit reflects the problems afflicting German manufacturing industry
as a whole: collapsing demand in its main markets compounded by the impact
of a strong D-Mark on exports and high domestic manufacturing costs.
After a slow initial recognition of the intensity of the downturn,
Daimler-Benz has responded to the crisis with increasingly far-reaching
measures. These include:
Job cuts. On Friday Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz's chief executive,
announced plans to cut a total of 43,900 jobs this year and next, taking the
total number of jobs shed in 1992-94 to 60,000. A fifth of the group's
domestic workforce will disappear by 1995. The group aims to achieve cost
savings of DM8bn between 1992 and 1997.
An unprecedented willingness to manufacture at low-cost centres outside
Germany. 'There is no room for protected species and taboos if production
locations in Germany are to remain competitive,' said Mr Reuter.
Daimler-Benz is expanding its manufacturing in the US, Mexico and east and
south-east Asia. A transformation of product strategy at Mercedes-Benz aimed
at taking one of the world's top luxury carmakers into new sectors of the
international automobile market. By the late-1990s Mercedes-Benz will have
added small cars, four-wheel drive sports/utility and multi-purpose vehicles
to its traditional range of luxury cars.
A new approach to capital markets. The most obvious reflection of this is
Daimler-Benz's decision to seek a full New York listing. As the first and
only German company to be listed on the NYSE, Daimler-Benz will enjoy direct
access to the world's largest equity market.
Collectively, these measures amount to a corporate revolution, testimony to
how the depth of the recession has jolted complacent German management into
action. In sectors throughout Germany, companies are in the throes of
restructuring and rationalisation.
But is this enough? Mr Reuter says he is confident about Daimler-Benz's
future in the medium term; once the world economy revives, he says,
Daimler-Benz will be lean and poised to generate suitable profits for a
group with a turnover of nearly DM100bn.
The problem is that Mr Reuter has always pointed to the medium-term when
talking about profitability: but Daimler-Benz's problem is making profits
today rather than always tomorrow.
The process of turning Daimler-Benz into a leaner machine is under way. The
car business, for instance, is undergoing a cultural upheaval - a shift into
the small car market.
The centrepiece of the Mercedes-Benz stand at the Frankfurt motor show over
the past two weeks has been a concept small car. At 3.35m in length it is
shorter than a Ford Fiesta or a Renault Clio, and a far cry from
Mercedes-Benz's two-tonne S-Class luxury car launched two years ago.
Mr Helmut Werner, the new chief executive at Mercedes-Benz, insists a small
car will be in production by '1997 at the latest. The S-Class was our
premium profit producer, but this has changed and we must act accordingly.
Our customers are on the move into segments they have not been in before.
They are also buying small cars. We have to be sure we follow our
customers.'
Mercedes-Benz's plan to enter the small car market is being accompanied by
the development of other 'lifestyle' vehicles, such as the MPV or 'people
carrier', to challenge the likes of the Renault Espace, and a sports/utility
vehicle to rival the Land Rover Discovery.
The MPV, due for launch in 1995, will be built in Spain. At the end of this
month Mercedes-Benz will announce the US location of its new plant to build
the four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicle.
At the same time, Mercedes-Benz is looking for a site in Europe to build its
planned small-car plant with a production capacity of 200,000 vehicles a
year; the search has narrowed down to the UK, the Czech Republic, France and
Germany itself.
The company is also forming alliances to break into fresh markets. In South
Korea, for instance, it has reached a co-operation deal with Ssangyong
Motor, enabling the South Korean vehicle maker to begin car production in
Korea based on Mercedes-Benz technology.
However, the brave new world is not going to be won without pain. Mr Werner
accepts that Mercedes-Benz still lags way behind its rivals in costs and
productivity.
Fixed costs are 'still appreciably too high', layers of management are being
removed and a 'rigorous pruning' of the white collar central staff is under
way. Some 13,000 jobs were cut last year in Germany. In the 12 months to
June the Mercedes-Benz workforce was cut from 233,000 to 215,000. About
27,000 jobs are being cut this year and next.
Mercedes-Benz's change of strategic direction - from luxury executive cars
to downmarket vehicles - is brave, but is by no means assured of success.
Similar doubts clouded Daimler-Benz's move four years ago into the aerospace
business. At the time critics warned that its new aerospace subsidiary,
Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), would be a financial drain and divert management
attention away from the group's traditional motor vehicle operations. But
supporters of the diversification argued that the move was the best way of
restructuring the faltering domestic aerospace industry and, under the
Daimler-Benz umbrella, re-positioning Germany at the top of the world
aerospace league.
However, the ambitious diversification, which has seen Daimler-Benz absorb
disparate components of the German aerospace industry, launch several
international partnerships and acquire control of the Dutch Fokker aircraft
group, has been undermined by a slump in civil aviation, defence cuts and
the slowdown in the domestic economy.
But Mr Reuter remains convinced the strategy will pay off in the longer
term: the aerospace diversification has already expanded the group's
industrial base and helped instil a more aggressive US-type management style
in other parts of the group.
Under the leadership of Mr Jurgen Schrempp, who is tipped to succeed Mr
Reuter when he retires next year, DASA has led the way among the
Daimler-Benz subsidiaries in cutting costs.
Last year, Mr Schrempp slashed two layers of senior management and announced
a package of job cuts totalling 7,500 over a three-year period to 1995. This
summer, having already put some 24,000 workers on short time, DASA said it
would cut a further 2,800 jobs linked to its activities on the European
Airbus programme.
Mr Reuter says the restructuring at DASA is now 'mainly completed' and that
it is in an 'outstanding strategic situation'. Although DASA is expected to
lose money again this year and next after running up losses of DM341m in
1992, Mr Schrempp insists DASA will start making a contribution to group
profits by 1995.
That will provide some relief to a group whose misfortunes mirror those of
the German economy as a whole, and which show few signs of easing. The
Mercedes-Benz star may take some time to shine again.

FT  20 SEP 93 / A wait for hidden fruit: The Arab economic boycott of Israel
is unlikely to be rapidly reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic fruits of peace moves in the Middle East are unlikely to emerge
with the drama and suddenness of Mr Yassir Arafat's appearance last week on
the south lawn of the White House. As Mr James Baker, the former US
secretary of state, commented after the two historic handshakes between the
Palestine Liberation Organisation leader and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
prime minister: 'This is not peace. But it makes peace more likely.'
Israel has already learned from its experience with Egypt since 1979 that
even a full peace treaty, with all its provisions for a full normalisation
of relations, is not necessarily a precursor of closer economic links. But
where Israel might realistically have grounds for optimism is that the
momentum created for a wider peace in the region will further erode the
long-standing Arab efforts to deny the Jewish state access to international
investment and trade.
The main vehicle for pursuing this policy over the past nearly half-century
has been the Arab boycott, intended initially to check Jewish political
aspirations in Palestine and later formalised by the League of Arab States.
Its purpose has been twofold. First, to isolate Israel economically within
the region and then, more controversially, to persuade non-Arab countries
and companies not to do business with Israel. The persuasion came in the
form of threats, administered from the Arab League boycott office in
Damascus, the Syrian capital. It drew up and maintains a blacklist of
companies which, theoretically, are barred from doing business in the Arab
world because of their connections with Israel. Companies seeking to operate
in Arab countries are supposed to certify that they have no dealings with
Israel.
How effective these restrictions have been is a matter of debate. Plainly,
the boycott has not prevented Israel blooming economically. On the other
hand, some Israeli officials argue that it has cost the country some Dollars
2bn-Dollars 3bn annually in lost trade and investment as companies decided
not to take the risk of endangering their Arab markets, particularly those
in the main oil-producing nations.
Calculating the extent of the risk has long been an imprecise exercise,
given the apparently haphazard operations of the Damascus office. No
blacklist is published although some sources claim it contains more than
10,000 names. Companies are not informed of their status, while a few have
blatantly ignored the boycott and escaped any retribution.
More are now likely to follow. Diplomats from Arab states which have
supported the peace process say that it is unlikely in the short-term that
the weakened and divided Arab League will take a formal decision to end the
boycott. Any such move, they say, would depend on far more substantial
progress in the peace negotiations.
However, they point out that the boycott has already been significantly
weakened, and international pressure for its abrogation was already mounting
before Israel and the PLO signed their declaration of principles on a
negotiated settlement in Washington last week.
The Group of Seven industrialised nations meeting in Tokyo this summer
called for the boycott to be ended, while companies such as Coca-Cola have
shown that it is possible both to defy the boycott and to be taken off the
Damascus list. Kuwait, in its fury at PLO support for Iraq during the Gulf
War, announced that it would no longer support the secondary aspects of the
boycott.
But Arab governments and businessmen can also see benefits in not rushing to
bury the boycott formally. The competition for foreign investment in the
Middle East is certain to intensify should it become apparent that the peace
process is irreversible.
Many billions of dollars will be required to underpin the fragile political
evolution in the occupied territories. Lebanon is seeking similar sums to
rebuild its infrastructure, while Jordan and eventually Syria will be no
less anxious to attract capital and develop trade.
Israel and its smaller Arab neighbours have all studied Singapore's
achievement in becoming the banking, services, transport and technological
hub of a wider region. Mr Rafiq al-Hariri, the most entrepreneurial prime
minister in the Middle East, has no doubt that Lebanon's future lies in
capitalising regionally on any similar opportunities that are offered by
peace.
He and others are also well aware that Israel's relative sophistication
gives it a massive initial advantage. So while the Arab boycott will be
increasingly ignored by the international business community, the informal
economic fences around Israel will take much longer to dismantle.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Leading Article: A shiver in east London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTREME right's victory in a local authority by-election last week has
sent a shiver through British political life. Concern has already been
rising over the level of racial attacks reported to the police in many UK
cities. Politicians, churchmen and community leaders have been quick to
deplore the success of a party that is openly racist in its programme.
It is much too soon, however, to see the election of a British National
party councillor in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets as evidence of
a far-right breakthrough. The BNP victory, on less than 34 per cent of the
vote, was achieved only because of a close three-way split in the voting. It
was the first electoral success for the party in the 12 years of its
existence. Its predecessor, the National Front, won only two council seats,
despite a backlash in some parts of the country over the arrival of east
African Asians.
The docklands to the east of London have offered fertile ground for the
BNP's brand of politics. Many white, working-class people in the area have
been economically marginalised by the docks' decline. The skyline is
dominated by prestige office developments such as Canary Wharf that provide
few jobs for the unskilled. Fortified apartments in luxury developments back
on to run-down rented housing built by the local council for low-income
families. The housing of homeless Bangladeshis in new homes by the council
has provided a convenient scapegoat, which the BNP has been quick to target.
Indeed, it might be thought surprising that in a recession the BNP has not
been able to win more support in this and similar communities throughout the
UK. Elsewhere in western Europe, extreme right parties have won as much as
15 per cent of the popular vote, control local authorities and are
represented in parliament.
Fringe parties
That the extreme right has been less successful in the UK is partly due to
the first-past-the-post electoral system. This makes it hard for fringe
parties to break through. But mostly it can be attributed to the ease with
which an island state is able to limit immigration. Britain has been able to
reduce the flow of immigrants to a level that makes it easier to absorb
newcomers without social conflict. It has also found it all too easy to shut
out the tide of refugees flooding into the rest of Europe from the east.
Only when ethnic minorities have become concentrated in particular locations
has the social fabric been seriously strained.
More integration
The counterpoint of stiff immigration controls, however, has been a concern
to integrate ethnic minorities into British life and offer equality of
opportunity. There is also a well-established legal framework to deter
racial discrimination and outlaw incitement to racial hatred. This approach
can claim some success, certainly in comparison with some other multi-ethnic
societies.
Yet reports of increasing racial attacks in Tower Hamlets and other urban
areas indicate a seamier side to this picture of an open and tolerant
multi-racial society. Many people from ethnic minorities live in fear of
abuse and violence, not always confident that the police are willing or able
to defend them. Their rights must be defended and their property protected
if they are not to be forced into defensive ghettos. The law may need to be
strengthened if it proves ineffective in dealing with racial violence
inspired by extreme right political activities.
Choking off the grievances that feed the growth of far-right politics may be
rather harder, however. A society where all can aspire to economic
opportunity is less likely to seek scapegoats among identifiable minorities.
Central and local government clearly has an important, if limited, role to
play in creating such a society. Much can also be done by the sort of
partnerships between the public sector and business that have already
contributed to regeneration in east London, albeit erratically on some
occasions.
But restoring hope to areas such as docklands is essential if extreme right
politics is not to be a recurrent form of protest in elections. Cancers in
the body politic - even in the smallest community - disfigure and threaten
the whole.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No sign of revolution in US
healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP MICKELBOROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'Revolution' seems a terribly strong word with which to headline
Michael Prowse's report on the proposed US healthcare reforms ('Healthcare
revolution is nigh: Will Clinton's plan mean cheap care or a free lunch?'
September 10).
The trickle of leaks may now have become a torrent, but the ideas are little
different from those suggested well before Hillary Clinton's task force was
set up.
Interestingly, the two most radical ideas to have come from America recently
appear to have been dismissed. The Oregon plan accepted that rationing of
health care was universal and inevitable however it was disguised.
Under that scheme individual diseases and treatments were paired up, and
each condition/treatment pair was rated by cost and its effectiveness in
improving quality of life. These pairs were ranked in order of descending
cost-effectiveness and a cut-off point, determined by the budget available,
was set. The aim was to eliminate expensive treatments for minor ailments,
and, more controversially, ineffective treatments for serious illnesses.
More recently, economists John Goodman and Gerald Musgrave (also noted by
Michael Prowse in his column, 'A contrary view on healthcare', August 23)
pointed out how little market forces apply when healthcare is bought by an
employer or the government.
Their suggestion was to eliminate insurance for minor conditions, so
re-introducing market-based price and consumption controls for the majority
of treatments. More serious illnesses would be covered by insurance, but
that cover would be purchased by the individual rather than his or her
employer, and again some link between consumption, risk and cost would be
introduced.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Personal View: Japan Inc in need of long-term reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENICHI OHMAE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If history is the result of a series of accidents, some, in hindsight, can
be clearly seen to mark significant turning points. At first glance, the
appointment in early August of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as Japan's prime
minister seems precisely such a turning point. On reflection, however, it is
only a deepening of the rot in which Japanese politics - and the Japanese
economy - have long been mired.
Mr Hosokawa comes from the country's fifth largest political party, The
Japan New Party, which secured only 35 of the 511 seats in the Diet's Lower
House; the Liberal Democratic party is still, by far, the largest single
grouping in the Diet. Even within Mr Hosokawa's coalition government, the
Socialists, with 70 seats, dominate. Mr Hosokawa was chosen as prime
minister by this coalition because he was thought to be, in the eyes of the
public, the least of the evils and the safest protection against a
revengeful LDP. If a small group of just 33 members fled the coalition, the
LDP might well regain control.
Most coalition members are already nervous about the next election, given
the fact that each of the coalition parties had to suppress its ideological
claims in order to form the alliance in the first place. Equally revealing,
all the coalition parties have now declared that they will continue to
support and apply the politics long advocated by the LDP. As a result, Japan
Inc. marches on - unreformed.
Thus, the new government cannot - and will not - be able to discuss any
serious policy matters for fear of losing its control, temper or harmony
(though it has embarked on some reforms to deregulate the economy).
So the government will concentrate on reforming the electoral system from
its traditional wide area, multi-seat approach to a narrow area, single-seat
system. However, once these 300 new electoral districts are agreed,
coalition members will begin fighting among themselves for the nominations.
In such an environment, serious attention to changing Japan from a producer-
to a consumer-oriented society is impossible.
There will be no help from Mr Irhiro Ozawa, shadow 'Shogun' of the Shinseito
party, whose near 30 years as an LDP politician makes the creation of a new
conservative party, with the same structure as the LDP, his easiest and most
logical choice. After all, it was he who perfected in the old days Japan's
'iron triangle' of political-bureaucratic-industrial collusion.
The fragility of the government, coupled with the strong pull of the
entrenched 'iron triangle', is deeply unfortunate. Together, they produce
paralysis - and at a time of unprecedented economic slowdown. Although macro
indicators suggest positive signs - export surplus at an all-time high of
Dollars 150bn; personal deposits and savings at the staggering level of
Dollars 500 trillion - the economic gloom persists. Average consumer
households already have two TVs and 1.5 cars. They will not buy any more.
Nor is there space in their small homes to put additional refrigerators or
stereos.
Less visible but no less troublesome, most Japanese corporations earning
export dollars are actually losing money. They export at a loss because the
rigidities of an inflexible employment system mean they cannot adjust their
annual business plans. What is counted in national statistics as an export
surplus is nothing but an accumulation of money-losing business, especially
at Y105 to the dollar or less. The right exchange rate for the yen, as
determined by purchasing power, would be about Y180 to the dollar.
The current rate is often seen in Japan as punishment by the international
community for Tokyo's trade policies (the Japanese government finds it
extremely difficult to regulate the currency market as it regulates other
markets).
The best - perhaps only - way to boost the economy is to invest in housing
on a large scale, tapping the huge well of private savings. Average Japanese
households comprise 80 square metres of floor space, compared with 100 sq m
in the three largest European economies. Given the availability of land and
high-speed commuter trains, there is no reason why housing should be so
expensive. The ideal remedy is to remove the regulations and lighten the
taxes that discourage improvement of housing. Larger houses will, in turn,
create consumer demand.
Improving the life style of Japanese people will not only boost the economy,
but also normalise the exchange rate. Such a move would balance the trade
statistics and make the Japanese market more accessible to other nations. In
short, creating a good life for Japanese people is in everyone's interest -
except the power brokers of the new political system and the remnants of the
'iron triangle' who look, instead, only for the short-term economic 'fixes'.
Japan must shift to a genuine free-market economy. Initially, this would
certainly lead to a plunge in property values and stock markets. These
'real' prices may also bankrupt over-extended financial institutions and
bust the 'bubble' players. But such a move would attract responsible
investors and consumers, with their huge savings, back into the market.
The practical question is whether a weak new government can tell a powerful
'iron triangle' to keep its hands off. If it will not, or cannot, the good
life will remain a mirage and the rest of the world will remain frustrated
with our markets and our currency.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public sector must also 'take
medicine' of pay restraint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A W BUNCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was incensed at the reaction of public sector workers when it was
announced that, to help government spending, there would be an effective pay
freeze in the year 1994-95 ('Unions warn of 'chaos' over public pay stance',
September 15).
Why do they consider themselves immune from the recession which the rest of
society has had to suffer? I am a director of a small service company in
Devon. Our livelihood depends on the prosperity of other companies and the
recession has hit this area very hard - but we are not alone in that.
To help protect the company our employees and directors have made many
sacrifices, involving no pay increases since January 1991, 5 per cent pay
reduction, redundancies, suspended pension contributions, etc.
I think my company, along with thousands of others around the country, has
by necessity taken the necessary steps to cut costs. I therefore pose the
question - why should the public sector be exempt? After all, we pay their
wages out of our reduced means. I also believe the average salaries shown in
your article compare very favourably with the private sector.
Public sector workers should take their medicine like the rest of us and
stop whingeing. Think positive, think productivity, think cost-saving, think
of others.

FT  20 SEP 93 / No reason for a warm glow: A look at UK efforts to meet Rio
Summit commitments on global warming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's progress on meeting targets on global warming will come under the
spotlight this week in Manchester at a grandly titled 'Partnerships for
Change' forum.
The forum is the initiative of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who
offered to hold the event for more than 350 environmental pressure groups at
last year's Rio Earth Summit. But government officials are wondering whether
the guests will bite the hand that feeds them: the meeting will draw
attention to whether the UK can meet the Rio targets on global warming at an
awkward point in the development of its environmental policy.
Under particular scrutiny is the UK's strategy for meeting the Rio
commitment to cut emissions of gases which might cause global warming.
Although scientists may take decades to establish whether warming is
occuring, governments decided at Rio that the threat was so great that
immediate action was necessary.
Mr Major has called global warming one of Britain's environmental
priorities. At Rio, Britain promised to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, one
of the main 'greenhouse' gases, to 1990 levels by 2000. According to the
Department of Trade and Industry, this means a cut of 10m tonnes of carbon
(mtC) on projected levels of emissions, or about 6 per cent.
In the past six months the government has published several accounts of how
it will make those cuts (see table). But environmentalists - many of them in
Manchester today - argue that the government's explanations are inadequate.
Tory backbenchers, mindful of the party conference in three weeks, also fear
that the proposals are a political minefield.
According to the government's latest plan, measures announced in the March
Budget - the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and increased
road and petrol taxes - will cut emissions by 3mtC, by reducing consumption.
But some economists and environmentalists argue that these taxes will not
have have much impact on emissions because people's use of transport and
household energy is relatively insensitive to price. 'VAT is blunt and its
application will produce little by way of a demand response,' says Mr Dieter
Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, a forecasting group.
In addition, the VAT move has provoked the summer's biggest political storm.
Road and car lobby groups have also warned the government that plans to
raise vehicle tax will be unpopular.
In spite of these concerns the government is likely to press ahead with
these revenue-raising measures because of its Pounds 50bn public sector
borrowing requirement.
Environmentalists have also questioned the likely effectiveness of the
Energy Saving Trust, a newly-formed partnership between government and the
utilities designed to encourage households to save energy. Headed by Lord
John Moore, a former cabinet minister, the trust's brief is to deliver a
quarter of the Rio target cuts in emissions.
But the trust has had a slow start. In the current year it is likely to
invest only a few million pounds in energy-saving projects such as
encouraging householders to install more efficient boilers. According to
government estimates, the trust needs to invest some Pounds 450m a year in
such projects to achieve its share of the carbon emission cuts.
The trust's director, Mr Eoin Lees, acknowledges that it 'will be something
of a challenge' to expand the trust's annual investments to the level stated
by the government by 2000. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the London-based
Association for the Conservation of Energy, puts it more bluntly: 'It is
hard to see how the trust is on course to achieve a fraction of the targets
the government has set.'
However, if the trust is successful, it also could, paradoxically, stir up
more political trouble: for the cost of its investments will be passed on to
all households - including those which have not benefitted from its projects
 -as an extra charge on their gas and electricity bills.
The government says that if the trust invests the Pounds 450m annually
needed to meet the emission targets, the result could be an increase in
domestic energy bills of some 4 per cent - on top of the VAT on domestic
fuel that is causing such political uproar. This calculation has attracted
less attention than the VAT move, but it nevertheless contains the seeds of
future trouble.
Besides these central planks of its carbon-saving plans, the government
hopes that four smaller schemes will collectively save an extra 1mtC - one
tenth of the Rio target. The four initiatives are a change in UK regulations
on new buildings to encourage better insulation, government backing for a
small increase in the share of electricity generated by solar, wind and wave
power, and two EC projects known as EMAS and SAVE, which are designed to
promote 'green' management and energy efficiency respectively.
Together, these measures - the Budget proposals, the Energy Saving Trust and
the four smaller schemes - should, the government says, save more than 6.5
mtC in total, two-thirds of the Rio target.
Environmentalists, already sceptical of these proposals, were even more
startled in July when the prime minister asserted that 'our plans are now
complete'. The remaining one-third of the Rio target, he said, would be met
by enhanced energy efficiency in business, households and transport, though
he refused to spell out the measures.
Mr Major's statement raises more questions than it answers. In particular,
steadily rising volumes of road traffic - and the government's programme to
build more roads - threaten to increase carbon emissions.
The government has said it will not address the issues raised by its critics
until the end of the year, when it will publish a full and detailed
explanation of how it will meet the Rio targets.
Does it matter if the government's plans to cut carbon emissions are
inadequate? It has invested much of its environmental reputation in
publishing a credible plan. Without such a plan the UK government would, in
effect, be excluded from the growing debate about whether global warming
should be combatted through investment in energy schemes in developing
countries, rather than in industrialised ones.
However, as far as meeting the Rio 2000 target is concerned, the government
may find that recession and the decline of the coal industry cut emissions
more effectively than its disparate collection of small carbon-saving
schemes.
The DTI's forecast that a 10mtC cut is needed to reduce emissions to 1990
levels was based on the assumption of an annual growth in gross domestic
product of 2.5 per cent between 1990 and 2000. However, in 1991 GDP fell by
2.3 per cent, and in 1992 by 0.4 per cent, and economists now predict only a
sluggish recovery over the next few years. The UK may therefore not need to
cut 10mtC to bring emissions back to 1990 levels by 2000.
At the same time, the electricity industry may switch more quickly to
gas-fired power stations than is assumed in the DTI models. Gas emits less
carbon than coal-burning stations, so this will help.
So as far as meeting the letter of the Rio targets goes, the government's
task may be easier than it first thought, which could compensate for
weaknesses in its carbon-saving plans.
But what happens beyond 2000? Ministers have acknowledged that although the
Rio target is commonly described as 'stabilisation', emissions are likely to
rise sharply after that year as the economy continues to grow.
If government critics are right, and the UK's schemes to cut carbon
emissions are ineffectual, then the country will be poorly placed to tackle
those long-term trends. That will be true even if it manages, by virtue of a
sluggish economy, to meet the Rio targets by 2000.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: The irony of Morocco playing host
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, King Hassan of Morocco enjoyed something of a publicity coup as a
result of the recent Middle East peace settlement. First, Yassir Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, arrived in Washington on
a Moroccan aircraft; then Israeli prime minister Yitzak Rabin's first port
of call his way back home was Rabat.
Nothing wrong, it should be said, with an Arab leader getting in on the
wider rapprochement between Israel and the Arab states. But is there not
some irony in Hassan playing host while his country remains in illegal
occupation of another country, the Western Sahara? The Moroccan army moved
into the Western Sahara eight years after Israel occupied the West Bank and
Gaza. Despite UN involvement, there seems little sign that Hassan intends to
allow the inhabitants of the Western Sahara a free vote on their future.
Perhaps Arafat or Rabin, or even better US secretary of state Warren
Christopher, should point out to Hassan that if he wants to play a part in
the new Middle East, he should put his own house in order. Like the
Palestinians, the Saharawi people have been waiting too long for the
opportunity to exercise their right to self-determination.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why inflation is never slain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER GREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was a shade presumptuous of the financial secretary to the Treasury
to declare the British economy 'inflation-free' ('Unions attack Dorrell
inflation claim', September 15). Nemesis, judging by August's RPI figure,
may already be on the march. The inflation dragon, of course, though
occasionally worsted, is never slain. The war against it is unending and has
to be re-fought continuously. The enemy is never more dangerous, moreover,
than when it looks down and out.
The start of a cyclical upswing is particularly critical. It is precisely
then that, often unseen and unguarded, the seeds of a fresh inflationary
boom, and its recessionary aftermath, are apt to be sown, keeping the whole
familiar show on the road. Those who make light of a danger they are
ostensibly determined to combat are like fighters with one arm tied behind
their back.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Lack of choice on technologies
worrying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL RUSKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I welcome the idea that the UK is to pick ideas in which technology
funding should be concentrated ('Science foresight plan launched', September
13). As with any company, the UK needs to have a clear vision of where to
invest its resources in order to develop a competitive technological
position.
However, it is worrying to learn that the technology foresight steering
group has yet to decide how to choose between technologies.
The process suggested - in which many scientists, academics and
industrialists will be consulted - may unfortunately lead to the choice of
important technologies in which we cannot be competitive.
We need to decide where we will try to be world leaders, where we are better
working in partnerships (for example, with our colleagues in the European
Community), and where we would do better to buy in. Britain is to some
extent a niche player in the world of technology: it needs to choose
carefully.
The government must also make best use of the substantial independent
contract research and development sector in enhancing these technologies.
This sector provides a cost-effective means of transferring technology to a
broad range of industries in the UK, while maintaining centres of
excellence.

A good night to stay in if you enjoy wildlife programmes and sports talk.
Will To Win (7.40 BBC2) is described with breathtaking condescension as a
six-part series 'celebrating black achievement in sport'. Can you imagine
BBC2 doing a series celebrating white achievement in sport? However, it
seems that this is really about black sportsmen's experience of racism.
Sport In Question (10.40 ITV) ends its run with Ian St John and Jimmy
Greaves joined on the rostrum by golfer Peter Alliss, footballer George Best
and commentator Reg Gutteridge.
BBC1's series about the Serengeti, The Savage Paradise, ends with a film by

FT  20 SEP 93 / Arts: Schiller and a fiery anorak - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There have been two outstanding openings in the London theatre in the last
few days apart from the already acclaimed revival of Tom Stoppard's
Travesties at the Barbican. One is Schiller's Wallenstein at the Royal
Shakespeare Company's much smaller theatre, The Pit. The other is Anorak of
Fire, a wonderful one-man show which has arrived at The Arts Theatre
non-stop from the Edinburgh Festival.
Between them they show the best of the old and the hopes of the new, though
naturally we shall take the Schiller first.
It would be foolish to pretend that even in this truncated version - down to
just over three hours from an original eight - Wallenstein is not at times
heavy going, especially at the beginning. It takes a while to acclimatise,
to the geography as well as the style. For this is high German seriousness
about the passions involved in the thirty years' war. If you make the
initial effort, however, you are in for a magnificent experience.
To summarise wildly, the main difference between Schiller and Shakespearean
tragedy is the absence of comic relief. In Schiller there are no sub-plots,
no trips below the stairs. It is intensity throughout. Yet even that is
slightly unfair. The full trilogy of Wallenstein contains an opening play,
Wallenstein's Camp, which deals with the reactions of the peasants and
ordinary soldiers to the war. This has been completely omitted from the
adaptation and direction by Tim Albery at The Pit.
The surprise is how well the omission works. Apart from a few chairs,
practically the only prop is a map of central Europe circa 1633. The map
matters, though not in detail, for it shows what a melting pot Europe was.
The wars were fought by mercenaries from all over the continent, including
offshore islands such as Britain. They could be hired, fired, and could
defect.
Wallenstein was a minor nobleman and a military genius who inspired loyalty
in his troops and whose ambitions eventually clashed with those of the
Emperor Ferdinand. He sought to defect to the Protestants and failed. That
essentially is what the play is about. Watch, and feel, the passions as it
unfolds.
Ken Bones, who specialises in austere parts such as Sir Thomas More at the
Shaw three years ago, plays the agonising and the pride of Wallenstein to
perfection. There is pathos (and some lightening of tone) from Olivia
Williams as his daughter, Thekla. Above all, there is some superb playing
between Philip Voss as Piccolomini, the officer who betrays Wallenstein, and
Toby Stephens as the Piccolomini son whose loyalties are divided. The blank
verse translation by Francis Lamport is immaculate - and moving. True, it is
not Shakespeare, but nor is it meant to be.
*** Anorak of Fire, the first stage work by Stephen Dinsdale, revolves
around the unlikely subject of train-spotting, though as James Holmes speaks
his lines, you will see that there is more to spotting than trains.
Holmes has a lovely shy Yorkshire voice, an engaging walk and face, while
Dinsdale has given him some splendidly funny lines. Note the explanations
for why spotting is on the increase and why real spotters wear trousers not
jeans.
On this showing Dinsdale is the most interesting new talent in London
theatre since Alan Ayckbourn arrived, also at The Arts, about 30 years ago.
Wallenstein is in repertory at The Pit (071) 638 8891.
Anorak of Fire is at The Arts until October 2 (071) 836 2132.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Arts: A Victorian lesson for 2000 - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrast could hardly be greater than between the state of Britain at
the end of the 19th century and its condition today. It is especially
interesting, therefore, to look at what architecture of that period was
trying to express.
In 1900 Britain was coming to the end of a colossal wave of public and
municipal building in the capital and the provinces. Law courts, public
libraries, police stations, boarding schools, polytechnics, cathedrals and
universities were being built throughout the land. In London the Imperial
College of Science, the Victoria and Albert Museum, County Hall, the
extension to the British Museum and the Old Bailey were all built between
1890 and the turn of the century. Architectural competitions were
commonplace and the 10,700 architects on the census return of 1901 were all
fully employed within Britain and its empire.
Today there are around 25,000 architects and more than a third are
unemployed. After two world wars and the end of a great empire, there is
almost no significant public building programme. A great project, such as
the Channel Tunnel, is likely to be left with no grand terminal and there
are unlikely to be public funds for significant building projects to mark
the millennium.
These thoughts are prompted by a fascinating exhibition that has just opened
in London of the work of Arthur Beresford Pite (1861-1934). The exhibition,
at the Royal Institute of British Architects Heinz Gallery, has been
sponsored by The Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, Price
Waterhouse and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Pite is a forgotten figure, his reputation overshadowed by great
contemporaries such as Sir Edwin Lutyens and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. He
was a teacher and practitioner and his words, when he spoke at Riba in 1900,
could easily have been spoken today. 'When the lamp went out, there was no
residuum of framework or principle, only the inchoate notion of the wild but
real beauty of all old work and a new delight in an unaffected stylessness
of difficult simplicity.' Pite was worried that the craftsmanship he admired
in architects and designers such as William Morris and Philip Webb could
never be adequate for the demands of 20th century building. Pite's own work
 -and his built oeuvre is quite small - shows that he brought an intense and
odd individuality to his designs while trying to link them to established
traditions. He was not looking for history to copy. He wanted his work to be
based upon what he called 'intelligent archaeology' to provide modern
architecture with a 'vitalising background', which he rightly felt was
missing.
Pite was a brilliant draughtsman, so this exhibition is well worth seeing
for the quality of his drawings alone. He leapt to fame on the strength of
one remarkable drawing, 'A design for a West End Club House', which won him
the Soane Medallion in 1882 and was exhibited at the Royal Academy that
year. It is a wild gothic fantasy with overtones of Nuremburg and Albrecht
Durer. It has a magical quality that was rarely to appear in his built
works. His drawing skill led him naturally to become a good designer of
patterns for materials and of furnishings.
His surviving buildings are few and mainly in London. Christ Church, Brixton
Road in south London, is an extraordinary Byzantine Romanesque structure,
cruciform in plan, with a broad dome. The triumph of the interior is the
inscription by the great lettering designer Edward Johnston. This lettering
covers the pendentives of the dome and is so well spaced and organised that
its appearance convinces you that what it says is true.
Pite's architecture has that same kind of integrity. It convinces by the
boldness of its experimentation. Look at his London, Edinburgh and Glasgow
Assurance building in Euston Square, which is next door to the Greek
neo-classical St Pancras church - Pite's building is designed to be a
sympathetic neighbour. In his Marylebone houses, 37 and 48 Harley Street and
82 Mortimer Street, he brings sculpture and architecture together in a
powerful combination. The great virtue of his building for the Institute of
Chartered Accountants off Moorgate, which he designed with John Belcher, is
that the whole facade is an exercise in sculptural architecture - much
helped by the quality of the sculpture by Hamo Thorneycroft and Harry Bates.
One of his most visible and enjoyable compositions is the Piccadilly end of
the Burlington Arcade - notice the tiny sculptured figures nestling in the
central volutes and the powerful, strange smiling giants that guard the
entrance.
Much of Pite's major work is abroad. He designed the Anglican cathedral at
Kampala, a church at Entebbe in Uganda, and English churches in Safad,
Bucharest, Warsaw and Jerusalem.
He is a difficult architect but one that repays study. He is a classic
example of turn of the century individualism and the lesson to be taken from
his work and teaching is that it is possible to be experimental and
contextually tactful at the same time. A good lesson for those architects
who are still employed to remember in the year 2000.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Arts: L'italiana in Algeri - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My abiding memory of Marilyn Horne will be of a curtain-call at Covent
Garden a couple of years ago. Amid enthusiastic applause there was one man
who kept booing insistently from upstairs. The redoubtable Miss Horne
marched to the front of the stage, stopped the applause and defied him to
'Come on down]' - then, having silenced him, raised her fist in the air and
marched off in triumph.
That was at a performance of Rossini's La donna del lago. Sadly we shall not
be seeing any more of Marilyn Horne in her famed Rossini roles. The Royal
Opera's revival of L'italiana in Algeri, which opened on Saturday, is her
last Rossini opera on stage, not just in London, but anywhere. For more than
30 years she has been a formidable heroine (and hero in trousers) in so many
of this composer's operas, expert at knowing how to shape his slow music,
exciting in the coloratura, ready to fire her booming chest register like a
cannon when she was roused.
Most of those facilities are still available to her, though she has to
husband her resources carefully these days. Top notes have to be approached
very gingerly and phrases that move up through the voice are apt to waver
out-of-tune. To the qualities outlined earlier, I would add here that she
has the gift of keeping the longest vocal lines going somewhere and that her
exactitude of rhythm is exemplary. Decades of polishing each Rossini
semiquaver have kept them sparkling as new.
As the Italian girl in Algiers, she gives a star performance, with all that
that implies. Mobility is visibly painful for her, but Horne's Isabella
keeps joy on her face, resourcefulness in her spirit, while mugging almost
all the comic moments to excess.
The Mustafa whom she captivates is Ruggero Raimondi - hair slicked back,
long black whiskers, glinting eyes, plenty to remind us that a once
formidable Don Giovanni is hiding under the Turkish cloak and baggy
trousers. His way with the music is casual, as is his wont. In contrast, no
care was too great for Bruce Ford in Lindoro's opening aria of love, which
he floated as gently as a kiss on the breeze; he has become a most appealing
Rossini tenor. Alessandro Corbelli repeated his amusing Taddeo and Carlo
Rizzi kept the whole ensemble firmly in hand from the pit.
If only the production understood wit as well as it does comedy. This is the
Ponnelle staging which opens with a gaggle of grotesque eunuchs (what is the
collective noun?) embroidering tasselled curtains. I did not recall that
they return at the end sporting false red noses and silly walks, but fear I
shall never be able to forget it now. The humour seems to have grown cruder
with the years, as when Isabella floors Mustafa with a right hook at the end
of the first act.
Or perhaps that is just in character for a Rossini mezzo who has always been
a knock-out. Incidentally, I am told that the unsatisfied customer at La
donna del lago did go down to Marilyn Horne's dressing-room afterwards to
tell her to her face why he had been booing: a brave man, or a foolish one.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Arts: The 'wrong man' wins at Leeds - Piano competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a melodramatic surprise-ending to the final round of the Harveys
Leeds International Pianoforte Competition this weekend: on the official
jury's vote, the wrong man won.
Popular myth says that Leeds often picks the wrong man (no woman has won
yet). But popular myth is wrong: since the 1966 contest, when Hans Keller
detonated a public row about his fellow-jurors preferring flashy Rafael
Orozco over the deeply musical Victoria Postnikova, there have been just two
years, 1981 and 1984, when there was serious doubt about the winner's
superiority - arguable superiority, anyway - to some of the runners-up.
This time, however, the lucky 'wrong man' was Ricardo Castro, a 28-year-old
Brazilian with strong fingers and sound tempi, good sense and good taste,
but little evident personality. For the finals he chose Beethoven's
monumental 'Emperor' Concerto - a strange competition-choice. Alone among
Beethoven's piano concerti, it was not composed for himself as soloist, for
by then he was deaf. Roughly speaking, either you can play it or you can't
(Castro could); if you can, it still takes a major artist to give it an
individual stamp, and this pianist did not.
Just as in his semi-final recital - his excellent Schumann let down by an
un-buoyant finale, his thrill-free Liszt - Castro met all the requirements
creditably but delivered no bonuses. Nothing to challenge the wit and
brilliance of Leon McCawley's Beethoven First; still less the mature
breadth, power and deep feeling of Mark Anderson's Brahms First; and both
those artists had offered memorable playing in the semi-finals too.
Either the jury (mostly piano-teachers, including Castro's own) was
prescient beyond our ken, in which case he may learn to open up and become
exciting while he fulfils all the engagements that now await him; or else,
as one suspects, he was a compromise choice.
BBC2 outdid itself. Do viewers realise how vastly better such BBC coverage
is than comparable TV elsewhere? The camera-work was faultless, the editing
geared faithfully to the progress of the music (director: Rodney Greenberg).
The composer Michael Berkeley was again a canny, sympathetic presenter, the
pianist Paul Crossley a perceptive - and bracingly candid - unofficial
assessor of the performances.
Mischievously, BBC2 held its own phone-in ballot: of about 35,000 votes
12,000 went to Anderson, 10,000 to McCawley and 6,000 to Maxim Philippov -
but Berkeley was too polite to report the remainder.
Young Philippov played Rakhmaninov's Third Concerto with splendid passion
and very few rough patches, more impressive than most of his solo recital
earlier. Justifiably, he won the Rakhmaninov prize donated by the composer's
grandson. Margarita Schevchenko was charming in the Beethoven First, still
employing her all-purpose expressive manner (after the climactic note in
most phrases a swift wilt, ever so delicate). Filippo Gamba offered a sturdy
Beethoven Third, somewhat dour. For all these pianists Rattle was a superbly
supportive, creative partner - abetted by the CBSO's first oboe, who is a
treasure.

FT  20 SEP 93 / People: Shell UK chairman to Vestey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Collins is leaving his current post of chairman and chief executive
at Shell UK to take over as chief executive of the Vestey group, with effect
from January next year.
His responsibilities at Vestey will include supervising both long-term
strategy and its daily managerial control.
His successor at Shell UK is Christopher Fay (right), who since 1989 has
been managing director of both Shell UK and Shell UK's exploration and
production, the UK's biggest off-shore operator, producing about one-third
of the country's oil and gas.
Collins joined Shell International Chemical company as a marketing assistant
in 1964, rising through the ranks through a variety of posts and serving in
Nigeria and Colombia.
In 1989 he became a director of Shell International Petroleum and a director
of Shell UK (Holdings).
He is a member of the president's committee of the CBI and also of the
Women's Economic Development Target Team, which campaigns to increase female
participation in the workforce.
Fay is another long-serving Shell man, having joined Shell International
Petroleum in 1970, going to the Netherlands as an offshore design engineer.
Among his many posts with Shell, Fay spent four years in Malaysia, in charge
of more than 10 start-up structures in the south China sea.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Management: Aged enfants terribles - The McCain brothers
seemed to have the ideal succession plan but they have paralysed the company
by falling out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrison and Wallace McCain seemed to be following all the best management
principles when they drew up a succession plan for their family-owned
potato-chip and frozen-food empire, based in New Brunswick, Canada.
The plan embodied the give-and-take spirit that has marked the brothers'
partnership as McCain Foods' joint chief executives since they built their
first potato-processing plant on a cow pasture 37 years ago.
It appeared to cover just about every eventuality. Both brothers would
retire no later than age 75, unless the board asked them to stay on. If one
died earlier, the other would take sole control. The chairman of the company
would not be from the same branch of the family as the remaining brother.
Wallace and Harrison even picked the head of McCain's UK operation to
succeed them in the unlikely event they both died at the same time.
To help identify successors and smooth the transition, the brothers also
agreed two years ago to bring four prominent outsiders on to the board of
their main operating company. These outside directors were to form a
'management resources committee' to recommend who should fill the brothers'
shoes.
But carefully worded agreements and a fruitful business relationship
spanning more than three decades have not been enough to prevent the sparks
flying in the McCain family. A row has blown up between Harrison and
Wallace, after Wallace unilaterally appointed his son Michael to head the US
subsidiary in October 1990, casting a shadow over the future of a highly
regarded business.
With annual sales of more than CDollars 3bn (Pounds 1.4bn), McCain Foods
almost doubled its profits last year. The group employs 12,500 people in
North America, Europe and Australia, and sells its potato chips, frozen
juices, cheeses and processed meats in 60 countries.
The succession dispute has paralysed McCain Foods to the point where the
directors of the holding company - all but one of whom are McCain family
members - recently voted to oust Wallace as joint CEO and president by the
end of this month. Wallace will ask a New Brunswick court later this week to
overturn the board resolution. He has also proposed splitting the company
into two roughly equal parts. One, to be owned by his side of the family,
would comprise the North and South American and Asia/Pacific operations; the
other, consisting of the UK and European interests, would be in Harrison's
hands.
Each of the McCain brothers appears to have underestimated the other's
determination to protect his own interests. An adviser to Wallace says that,
in drawing up their succession plan, each brother may have hoped 'that the
other guy would be the first to go. But then it looks likely that you're the
first to go, and you say: 'Good grief, what have I agreed to?''
A total of 33 McCains are shareholders in McCain Foods. Six younger family
members are also active in the business. Wallace's son Michael heads the US
operations. Michael's brother Scott is vice-president of production. One of
Harrison's sons is vice-president for export sales, another is a business
analyst. Allison McCain, son of one of Wallace and Harrison's two dead
brothers, is managing director of the UK subsidiary. Until 1991, the boards
of the family holding company and the operating company were identical. But
as part of the effort to ensure a smooth handover, the family decided to
reserve six of seven holding company directorships for members of the
younger generation. The chairman, Andrew McCain, runs a small investment
company in rural New Brunswick, but has no management or executive
experience.
Harrison and Wallace thought they were moving the succession process along
by giving their sons and nephews an increasingly active role. But it is hard
to escape the conclusion that the participation of so many McCain family
members in the business hampered rather than helped the process. Harrison
says the close relationship with his brother changed after Wallace promoted
Michael. Since then, Harrison says in an affidavit, 'an atmosphere of
distrust, intrigue and manoeuvring has existed'.
Wallace, for his part, alleges that his nephews have made little
contribution to the business. One of them, he says, does little more than
send him newspaper clippings.
The sour mood created by Michael's appointment and the subsequent flurry of
offers and counter-offers among the family shareholders have stalled efforts
to identify a new CEO. Although the succession plan was adopted in mid-1991,
the committee of outside directors set up to identify up-and-coming talent
only began meeting towards the end of last year. The committee's chairman,
Arden Haynes, who is the retired head of Canada's biggest oil company, told
the brothers last May that the outside directors would not proceed with the
search 'until the family dispute has been settled'.
Wallace's first choice is still to stick with the original plan, which
allows him to stay on till the age of 75, and perhaps even beyond. 'I am 63
years of age, in excellent health, work long hours and enjoy my involvement
in the McCain Group,' he says in a recent court affidavit.
Wallace maintains that the four outsiders on the management resources
committee will need at least two years to familiarise themselves with the
company before attempting to identify successors.
Harrison, who is two years older, underwent heart surgery in early 1992,
which kept him away from the office for three months. 'Harrison is in poor
health,' Wallace says in his affidavit. '(He) is jealous that my son Michael
may be the heir to the position that he would vacate.' Harrison counters
that relations between himself and Wallace have deteriorated to the point
where the future of the entire company is in jeopardy unless a new CEO is
installed soon. 'I have reconciled myself to changing my role in the
company,' Harrison said last month. 'I think it's time Wallace did too.'
The future of McCain Foods is set to be decided in the courts, causing what
Harrison describes as 'embarrassment and humiliation to all members of the
McCain families'. It is ironic that the family might have been spared some
of its present anguish if Wallace and Harrison had put tighter limits on
their sons' and nephews' role in the business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Hales, chief executive of Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks company,
and Bob Sellier, chief executive of YJ Lovell (Holdings), the construction
group, have been appointed non-executive directors of Welsh Water, the
privatised utility.
They replace Iain Evans, who became Welsh Water's chairman in April, and
John James, who became engineering services director in June. Those
appointments had reduced Welsh Water's non-executive directorships to two,
below the level recommended by the Cadbury committee on corporate
governance.

FT  20 SEP 93 / People: Planners for UK civil disasters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's contingency planning for dealing with serious civil emergencies is
passing into new hands.
The responsibility for co-ordinating emergency planning will fall to Rear
Admiral David Bawtree, who becomes civil emergencies adviser when Air
Vice-Marshal David Brook retires on October 18. Promoting emergency
preparedness is now the job of Air Vice-Marshal Allan Blackley, who took
over as principal of the Emergency Planning College on September 13
following the retirement of Brigadier John Bettridge.
Bawtree, 55, recently retired from the navy after 38 years' service, during
which he was naval base commander for Portsmouth.
His involvement in safety and emergency planning for the navy involved the
sort of liaison and co-operation with local and central government that will
be his duty to encourage in his new post.
The Emergency Planning College runs courses and seminars to publicise best
practice in planning for major emergencies.
Blackley, 55, has 34 years' air force service. He was operational commander
of the military search and rescue organisation, co-ordinating air force and
naval efforts.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Management: If you don't strike oil fast, stop boring - Tips
from the Top / Sipko Huismans of Courtaulds gives advice on how to make an
after-dinner speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIPKO HUISMANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Giving an after-dinner speech usually seems a better idea at the time you
accept the invitation than it does when you are just finishing the main
course on the night.
This is one of those rare moments in life when a certain amount of humility
can be very helpful. The most useful thing I can suggest is to imagine the
thoughts going through the mind of one of the dinner guests as the speaker's
moment arrives. Who is the speaker? Why is he speaking? What does he have to
say that is worthwhile? Will it be boring? How long will it be?
If you're such a celebrity that your mere presence is an attraction in
itself, these remarks do not apply, but my presumption is that few of us
businessmen are in the Bill Clinton or Madonna 'glamour' class. Even then,
be sure that your speech lives up to the glamour image - you can only go
downhill from the moment you stand up. Much better to come from behind - 'a
boring grey businessman'. At least then if you are boring, there are no
surprises and if you did manage to stimulate and entertain, you're ahead of
the game.
I have seen countless articulate and persuasive communicators (and they have
to be, to some extent, to have become senior managers in the first place)
read out speeches written by newly recruited MBAs in the corporate
communications department that are utterly unconvincing.
Whatever you do - do it yourself. If you are dull and without anything
original to say, nothing is lost - your true self is revealed. The danger is
that you put across an image much worse than reality.
Pick a subject you believe in. Something you can put a bit of passion and
emotion into. If the subject you're asked to speak on is dull, do the
politicians' trick: answer the question you were not asked - or if all else
fails, refuse to do it. Don't get trapped into a speech on 'the merits of M1
as a means of measuring the money supply' if you're not a passionate
monetarist. And if you are, make it entertaining - over-simplify - use quite
inappropriate role models to explain - anything to wake them up and keep
their interest. After all, you're there for a purpose: either to persuade
them of your point of view, to entertain, or because you're being paid (I've
heard of this, but it has never happened to me).
You have to establish a rapport with the audience - the best way is to make
them laugh. I've never found the story of the 'dog and the two old ladies'
funny when delivered by someone who is profoundly unfunny - resist the
manufactured joke. The best and safest funnies are told against yourself:
you can risk a joke against the haggis (when you're in Scotland) or the
cricket team (when you're in England) but don't go too far.
When you get into your subject, find someone in the audience who agrees with
you. You will recognise that person when he or she nods at your most
profound points. Identify a sympathiser and look for the occasional bit of
confirmation of your views.
By all means have a shortlist of topics that you need to touch on, but at
all costs resist a written-out speech. You're not the chancellor of the
exchequer, whose every word is weighed and re-interpreted. The risk of
forgetting something or saying something slightly indiscreet is far
outweighed by the risk of being deadly dull and boring.
Look at your audience - you'll know when you've lost them - and it won't be
because of what you say but how you say it. And when they're getting bored
or you've gone on too long, wind it up fast and sit down. If that happens
within minutes of starting, you're on to a dead loser and you had best keep
it short.
From then on it is classic stuff - tell them what you're going to say - say
it - and tell them what you've just said. Use anecdotes to illustrate the
points. Above all, never forget - you're the entertainment.
Thank the host for asking you, thank the audience for listening, and thank
heaven it's over and you can get to the port and cigars.
Next Monday: Sir Alistair Grant of the Argyll Group on how to stay close to
your customers.

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Spring Ram await Wednesday's interim results with a sense of
foreboding. Mr Roger Regan, the new chairman, has probably ordered a harsh
examination of the troubled kitchens and bathrooms group's fortunes after
being brought in by institutions following three profits warnings and a
share price collapse.
Analysts are in the dark about what figures to expect, but will want to be
reassured that no black holes are lurking in the accounts of the fallen
stock market favourite.
Tesco, the UK's second biggest grocery retailer, is expected on Tuesday to
announce a 6 per cent increase in interim profits from Pounds 253m to about
Pounds 268m. In spite of the expected increase, the figures are unlikely to
improve market sentiment concerning Tesco, especially as Mr Archie Norman,
chief executive of rival supermarket group Asda, may make further
pessimistic observations about saturation in the UK food market at that
company's annual meeting on Wednesday.
William Morrison Supermarkets, the supermarket chain based in the north and
Scotland, reports on Thursday and is expected to lift pre-tax profits from
Pounds 36.2m last time to between Pounds 43m and Pounds 45m. The benefits of
tactical pricing, adopted six months ago, should now be accruing, though
Asda might have made a small impact on market share. The dividend is likely
to be lifted from 0.16p to between 0.19p and 0.2p.
MAI, the financial services group which reports annual profits on Monday, is
expected to unveil a 9 per cent increase to about Pounds 78m before tax. The
growth will have been fuelled by a 20 per cent rise in the wholesale broking
arm. Shareholders are expected to be rewarded with a 10 per cent rise in the
dividend to 6.6p.
Hays, the business services group, is expected to report full-year profits
of about Pounds 66m on Tuesday. Analysts had forecast a figure as high as
Pounds 75m until the interim results in March, which were at the bottom end
of expectations. Interest will focus on the pace of recovery in the UK and
the group's growing European ambitions, following its acquisition of a
German contract distributor in July.
Analysts are undecided about Thursday's half-year pre-tax results for
Guinness, the brewing company, and have made forecasts of between Pounds
305m and Pounds 338m, against Pounds 353m, for the six months to June 30. A
dividend of about 3.7p (3.35p) is expected. The market will be looking for
progress in the company's Spanish beer operations, will be watching the
price of spirits in a competitive market and will be checking the size of
any currency gain.
Fashion retailer Next is reporting on Wednesday and interim profits are
expected to double from Pounds 8.3m to about Pounds 17m. Analysts are hoping
to confirm that recovery is not faltering, and are expected to quiz
management about plans for a joint venture in the US.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: Single site court house takes shape
in Utrecht
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PSA PROJECTS has been awarded the contract to design and supervise
construction of the Utrecht Court House, a Fl 70m (Pounds 26m) project,
concentrating the administration of justice in Utrecht on a single site.
The contract was awarded by the development company Maatschappij voor
Bedrijfsobjecten NV (MBO), a subsidiary of the Internationale Nederlandse
Groep (lNG), the largest banking organisation in the Netherlands.
At present, the adminstration of justice in Utrecht is spread across several
sites. The 30,000 square metre court house will provide 13 new court rooms
and 13 small hearing rooms, with ancillary spaces.
The new court house is to be in the city centre, near the Utrecht Central
Station.
It is hoped that the building will improve control, efficiency and
convenience.
Since October 1992, a design team from PSA Projects Edinburgh, led by Coin
Thorn, has been working with the Rijksgebouwendienst (the Dutch Public Works
Department) on a preliminary design and has won the approval of the local
planning authority. For this scheme, PSA Projects has teamed up with a local
Dutch architectural practice, Buro Schiller.
'Two existing buildings with frontages on to the main street will be
retained,' says Colin Thom, divisional director at PSA Projects.
'One of these is listed and was designed in the 19th Century by the
architect Van Lockhorst for the Anatomy Department of Utrecht University, by
which it is still used. A small district power station at the rear of the
site will also be retained.'

AMEC DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT has won a Pounds 9m contract to design, engineer
and construct a Pounds 9m aroma chemical plant for International Flavours
and Fragrances, at its Haverhill site, Suffolk.
The new plant, which will be constructed under a guaranteed maximum price
contract will produce Galaxolide TM, a basic ingredient used in fragrances
for quality perfumes, washing powders, soap, detergent and other consumer
products. It will replace an existing Galaxolide manufacturing facility at
Haverhill.
The Amec/IFF design team has incorporated the latest process chemistry and
engineering technology, including Batneec and IPC, to ensure that the new
plant is more energy and water-efficient and produces less effluent.
Construction starts September this year and is due for completion in August
1994.
The new plant will be a significant expansion of IFF's aroma chemicals
operation and is the American-owned company's largest investment outside the
US. It is anticipated that 90 per cent of the output from the new plant will
be used for export to continental Europe, the Far East and America.
Amec is part of the international construction, engineering and development
Amec group.

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Leadership defensive over
Tower Hamlets activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACTIVITIES of Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets, east London, once
again forced Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, on to the defensive
yesterday, as attention was focused on the national party's failure to act
effectively after warning local activists three years ago to clean up their
campaigning.
Mr Ashdown said that the inquiry he had set up into the local party's
tactics would look at the breakdown in the procedures set up after a court
action brought by Labour in 1990 to monitor the campaigning material which
the local party used.
One of the leaflets which he said had given him most concern for its racist
undertones had not even been cleared by the Liberal Democrat leader of the
council, let alone anyone from the party nationally.
But he sought to regain the offensive by demanding that Labour examine how
its activities had contributed to the victory for the far-right British
National party in last week's council by-election. 'Both of us made
mistakes,' he said, but where the Liberal Democrats had responded clearly
and decisively, Labour's problems appeared to have been overlooked.
Mr Ashdown's emphasis on the need for Labour to look at its own role in the
BNP's win contrasted with the comments of Baroness Williams, a senior party
member, who stressed the need for the party not to be deflected from
examining its own actions.
'I hope the committee of inquiry into Tower Hamlets will not be diverted by
trying to blame other parties, however bad their record may be, but ask what
we Liberal Democrats have done in difficult circumstances to try to provide
equal justice and fairness to all of our citizens,' she said.
As senior figures sought to draw a line under the embarrassment, Mr Charles
Kennedy, party president, gave a clear statement that racism would not be
tolerated in the party. He emphasised that Liberal Democrat members signed
up to the party's ideals and beliefs.
He was cheered as he told the English Liberal Democrat conference: '(We) . .
are at one in recognising racism for what it is, wherever it is found: a
disgusting moral stench in the nostrils of society.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Ashdown says party 'near
breakthrough'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats were on the verge of breakthrough to the political big
time, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said yesterday, as he underlined
the strength of the party's base in the country.
Speaking just ahead of the party's annual conference, Mr Ashdown highlighted
a survey, published yesterday, which showed that the Liberal Democrats had
established a decisive lead over the Conservatives in the south-west of
England and were making inroads into Tory support in the south-east.
The poll, by Mori for The Sunday Times, found that 46 per cent of those
questioned in the south-west supported the Liberal Democrats, with only 30
per cent supporting the Tories. This is almost a reversal of the parties'
positions at the general election.
Mr Ashdown said he hoped the conference would demonstrate the party's
maturity and ability to put across a clear message. He hoped its mood would
be 'serious, workmanlike and determined to ensure that the position we now
have, we hold'.
While emphasising that the party's base support in the country as a whole
was higher than it had ever been, he warned that Liberal Democrats still had
a long way to go and much work to do to build on the achievements so far.
His warnings against triumphalism were slightly undermined, however, by his
own refusal, in a weekend newspaper interview, to rule out the possibility
of his becoming prime minister. Yesterday he sought to play down the
significance of that, saying that every party leader wanted to be prime
minister.
This week's debates are seen by Liberal Democrat strategists as an important
opportunity for the party to communicate a distinctive political identity.
This is seen as crucial to its ability to turn the protest votes it has been
attracting into positive support.
The aim is to concentrate on policies in areas such as taxation and
employment, where the Liberal Democrats' ideas can be presented as more
radical than those put forward by either of the other parties.
Mr Ashdown said that 'opportunity' was at the heart of the party's message.
'The politics of the 1990s will be dominated by the party most able to offer
opportunity to every citizen in the land.'
He continued to resist suggestions that the Liberal Democrats were closer to
Labour than to the Tories, insisting that British politics was now
multi-dimensional. The party's co-operation with the government over the
Maastricht bill demolished, he said, the idea that the Liberal Democrats
were interested in creating a 'Lib-Lab' coalition.
Proposals for a greenfield development tax were approved by delegates at the
final conference of the English Liberal Democrats acting as a separate
entity. The tax is aimed at discouraging the building of out-of-town
hypermarkets and similar projects.

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Tories fear heavy loss of
Euro seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER John Major faces the humiliating prospect that a quarter of
the Conservative party's remaining seats in the European parliament could be
lost to the Liberal Democrats next June unless the government improves its
standing with the electorate.
A confidential analysis conducted by Conservative Central Office suggests
that if this year's local election results were replicated in the European
parliament vote next summer the Liberal Democrats would win eight of the 32
seats held by the government.
The study - pointing to a collapse in the Conservative vote across a swathe
of southern England from Brighton to Bath and beyond that into Cornwall -
will provide a further boost to the morale of Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats at the formal opening of their annual conference this morning.
It will reinforce the concerns of up to two dozen Tory MPs in southern and
south-western England that their parliamentary seats are imperilled by the
steady Liberal Democrat advance eastwards from Cornwall and Devon.
Mr Major and Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, acknowledged during
visits to the West Country earlier this month that they could no longer
brush aside the Liberal Democrat resurgence as a mid-term protest vote.
That was followed by Conservative Central Office's decision to start
immediately the selection process for the Westminster seats of Bath, North
Cornwall and Devon so that the party's candidates are well entrenched by
1996 or 1997.
At present Mr Ashdown's party holds none of the 78 European seats in
England, Scotland and Wales and its ambitions have been limited to picking
up perhaps two or at most three in next year's poll.
The Conservative analysis could overstate the threat - the Liberal Democrat
performance in local elections tends to be better than in European ones,
partly because many wavering Conservative voters are unhappy with Mr
Ashdown's pro-Europeanism.
But senior Liberal Democrat figures suggested yesterday that the party might
fight next June's election on national rather than European issues to
capitalise on Mr Major's unpopularity.
Conservative strategists are talking comfort from the fact that the analysis
suggests it would lose at most one seat to Labour were local election
results to be replicated. The government would also expect to win at least
three and perhaps four of the six seats which will be created before next
June's elections.
But ministers are aware that the Conservatives' disastrous performance in
the 1989 European elections - when Labour won 45 seats - marked the
beginning of the end of Lady Thatcher's premiership. Assuming Mr Major
survives the present political storms, the loss of a further batch of seats
would be another dangerous blow to his premiership.

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: From Tokyo to Torquay -
Conference Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE HAVE been here before. As the Liberal Democrats gathered in Torquay
yesterday for the start of the autumn conference season it was hard to
gainsay their claim that the third party is in better shape than at any time
since the heyday of the old Alliance in the early 1980s.
True, the row over the party's activities in Tower Hamlets soured the
atmosphere. Mr Paddy Ashdown's assertion that the national party had acted
swiftly to ensure errant activists were brought into line was less than
convincing. Senior party insiders admitted that the Tower Hamlets party had
been given a 'final warning' as long ago as 1990 to expunge any racist
undertones from its campaigning. Three years - and the election of a racist
British National party councillor - later Mr Ashdown's protestations of
ignorance offer a hollow defence.
But with Mr John Major's government engulfed by a semi-permanent state of
crisis and Mr John Smith's Labour party still fighting yesterday's battles,
the Liberal Democrats will not allow the issue to cloud their week. Mr Major
is unable even to spend a few days in Tokyo without being forced to call for
loyalty from his own backbenchers. So the mood in Torquay is understandably
buoyant.
Victories this year in Newbury and Christchurch and in the county council
elections have been followed by opinion poll ratings which more than once
have pushed the government into third place. The Conservatives' own analysis
suggests that a quarter of its remaining 32 seats in the European parliament
could be lost to the Liberal Democrats next June. Ironically, the mood of
anti-politics across the country which has restored the party's fortunes
holds out the prospect of turning the Liberal Democrats into the natural
party of government in the south west of England.
So Mr Ashdown's followers now see their real opportunity in the
self-destruction of the Conservative party. The talk of the 1980s - that
Labour could be driven back permanently into a few northern strongholds -
has been replaced by a sense that it is the Conservatives who are destined
for a long spell in the political wilderness. A glance at the continued
turmoil over Mr Major's leadership confirms that is no longer an incredible
claim.
The paucity of talent on the Conservative and Labour front benches has
obscured the obvious weakness of the Liberal Democrats at Westminster. No
more than a third of the party's 22 MPs could in other circumstances claim
real standing as national figures.
But by-election and council election successes won on the back of
disenchantment in the Tory heartlands are not enough - nor is the
unaccustomed and flattering interest now being shown by the media in the
Liberal Democrats' fortunes. Mr Ashdown, still prone to the hyperbole which
prompted him at the weekend to speculate on his own chances of reaching No
10 Downing Street, needs policies as well as popularity.
The party's latest policy document recognises the gap. The rather eclectic
faith in market mechanisms of previous statements has been replaced by a
more distinctive centre-left approach to macroeconomic policy. Full
employment - regarded for much of the 1980s as a goal only of socialist
ideologues - has returned to the stage as a legitimate objective of
government. The launch yesterday of a new policy-orientated journal by the
party's intelligensia - Shirley Williams among them - is intended to
reinforce the trend.
But some of Mr Ashdown's colleagues believe the leadership is still too
preoccupied with headline-grabbing gimmicks - the proposals for citizens'
referenda and co-opted members in the cabinet were the latest. Many of the
Liberal Democrats' instincts - devolution of political power, the
reassertion of the idea that individual opportunity and society can be
allies rather than enemies - strike a chord with a disenchanted electorate.
The mood of the country is not one susceptible to the 'government knows
best' attitude which sustained the Conservatives for much of the 1980s.
But as one senior Liberal Democrat said yesterday, a huge leap must be taken
before his party's status as a refuge for protest can be translated into
power. The bridge - a credible policy framework - has still to be built.
Then there is that other question: the Labour party. There has been
surprisingly little talk so far this week of that perennial third-party
issue - electoral pacts. Perhaps that is because no one now believes a deal
with Mr Smith is conceivable before the next general election. Many in Mr
Ashdown's party also are indifferent if not hostile to national rather than
local politicking.
But few doubt that the extent to which the Liberal Democrats are prepared to
acknowledge common ground with Labour will be crucial to their electoral
fortunes. The mould of British politics has been badly cracked. But it is
not yet broken.

FT  20 SEP 93 / The Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Williams plea for jobs
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE RESOLUTE action to counter unemployment was urged yesterday by Baroness
Williams of Crosby at the launch of The Reformer, a new quarterly Liberal
Democrat journal.
The former Labour cabinet minister stressed that it was no longer a problem
confined to unskilled and semi-skilled workers in areas where traditional
industries had either contracted or disappeared.
She said: 'Unemployment will become a real political issue from which
politicians can no longer walk away.'
Lady Williams suggested that in some cases prolonged unemployment led to
racism and other crime and said it was time to address 'the seedbeds from
which the flowers of hate grow'.
Writing in the first issue of The Reformer, she argues that Britain can no
longer afford to send nearly half of school leavers unprepared into the
labour market.
'At the very least we should pick up where the 1944 education act left us,
with a requirement for two days a week of further education between 16 and
18, with the work component gradually increasing.'
Lady Williams notes that while the Liberal Democrats have discussed the idea
of national community service, no similar steps have been taken by the
government.
She urges that consideration be given to the introduction of a community
service scheme designed to supplement the 'bare bones student grant' so as
to attract prospective university students as well as un-employed inner city
youths.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Trial row may cost Pounds 500,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POTENTIAL saving to the taxpayer of up to Pounds 500,000 in the costs of
the West Wiltshire Information Systems fraud trial could be lost because of
a dispute between the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Legal Aid Board.
The dispute is over who should pay for the hire of a computerised
note-taking system which Judge Peter Fallon, the trial judge, believes could
reduce the trial by up to five weeks. The trial, which is due to start in
Bristol next month, is expected to last between four and six months.
Mr Gerald Garland, former chief executive of West Wiltshire District
Council, and six other former council officials are charged with conspiracy
to defraud after West Wiltshire Information Systems, the company they set up
in 1989 to run the council's privatised computer systems division, went into
liquidation in July 1990.
The council received no cash for the business, which was independently
valued at between Pounds 6m and Pounds 8m.
The cost of hiring the Livenote computerised note-taking system, which
allows a transcript of evidence to be relayed almost immediately to the
judge and lawyers via laptop computers, is estimated at Pounds 5,000 a week.
Judge Fallon, who has been experimenting with the use of Livenote for two
years, believes that in long trials it can save up to a day per week. This
is achieved by cutting the time it takes to find and use documents in court
and by avoiding the need for multiple copying of documents.
The average cost of the trial is estimated at between Pounds 75,000 and
Pounds 100,000 a week. Ms Judith Brown, a defence lawyer of Bristol
solicitors Lawrence Tucketts, believes that as all seven men are legally
aided the Legal Aid Board should pay at least part of the cost of the
system.
The board says the use of such a system would not be of specific benefit to
the defendants, only to the administration of justice generally, and
therefore the Lord Chancellor's Department should pay.
Neither the department nor the board disputes that savings could be made but
the department says the cost should be shared by those who would benefit
from any savings. The board would benefit from a reduction in fees paid to
barristers and solicitors, and it should therefore be prepared to pay part
of the cost.
The department said it was prepared to look at any application for it to pay
its share.
Ms Brown said defence lawyers were dismayed by the apparent reluctance to
make a saving of up to Pounds 500,000.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Birt defends BBC licence fee

THE BBC has gone on the offensive to try to defend the value of its licence
fee, which raises about Pounds 1.5bn a year.
Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, speaking at the Cambridge Convention of
the Royal Television Society at the weekend, called on the government to
preserve the value of the licence fee and continue to link it to the retail
prices index.
The government is expected to decide in November on the level of the
licence, currently Pounds 83 for a colour television, for the last three
years of the BBC's present royal charter.
'I don't believe that the organisation can sensibly be pushed further,' Mr
Birt said. In addition to Pounds 100m savings this financial year, savings
of Pounds 50m were planned for next year and Pounds 25m the year after. 'The
time will come - and it's not too far away - when major efficiency savings
on the BBC are no longer possible. At that point preserving, let alone
developing, our programme services will be at an end, unless there is a real
increase in the licence fee.'
At the convention Mr Leslie Hill, chairman and chief executive of Central
Independent Television, re-opened the issue of changes in ownership in ITV -
a possibility being considered by the government.
Without relaxation of the rules that prevent any of the nine largest ITV
companies taking each other over, British commercial television would be
increasingly dominated by US, continental European and possibly Japanese
companies.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Former ministers face Iraq arms probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arms-for-Iraq inquiry enters its most overtly political phase today when
Mr Timothy Renton, former Foreign Office minister and chief government whip,
becomes the first in a line of senior ministers to give evidence in public.
He will be followed during the week by Mr David Mellor, who resigned from
the cabinet last autumn in the midst of a row over his personal life, and by
Mr William Waldegrave, who remains a serving minister. Lord Justice Scott
and his abrasive counsel
Miss Presiley Baxendale QC are likely to subject the ministers to a detailed
grilling.
Jimmy Burns looks at the evidence given so far and poses the questions that
the politicians may face from the inquiry.
Timothy Renton, Foreign Office minister from October 1985 to June 1987
Why did Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary, take nearly a year to
announce guidelines restricting arms exports to Iraq?
Mr Renton's predecessor Sir Richard Luce told the inquiry he wanted the
guidelines, which had been agreed secretly by ministers in November 1984, to
be announced to the Commons. He had to accept the majority government view
that the guidelines 'trickle out' before being announced in October 1985
when Mr Renton was in the post.
What did you know about the Pounds 270m defence package Britain signed with
Jordan in September 1985?
Evidence to the inquiry suggests the government agreed to the package in
spite of knowing that Jordan was being used as a route for military exports
to Iraq.
What was said at meetings in London held on December 4 1985 between
government ministers - including the prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher -
and Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister?
Officially all Mr Aziz wanted, and apparently got, was an asurance that the
UK would remain neutral in the Iran-Iraq war and sell no arms to Iran. But
the Foreign Office was under pressure from other government departments to
approve pending contracts with Iraq including one for a missile complex
arranged by IMS, a defence company wholly owned by the Ministry of Defence.
How did you apply the guidelines that the UK should not export defence
equipment which would enhance the capability of either side to exacerbate
the conflict?
Mr Paul Channon, former trade secretary, said the MoD and the Foreign Office
'changed the rules as they went along'.
William Waldegrave, Foreign Office minister from July 1988 to November 1990,
currently minister for open government
What did you know about the export of British machine tools to Iraq by
companies such as Matrix-Churchill?
In February 1989 Mr Waldegrave, together with other ministers, approved the
export to Iraq by Matrix-Churchill of sophisticated lathe equipment which
Whitehall knew could be used in the development of nuclear weapons.
The Whitehall line was that intelligence on Iraq provided by
Matrix-Churchill outweighed the potential nuclear threat, an argument that
Mr Waldegrave seemed at one point to have shared.
Last week Mr David Gore-Booth, a former senior Foreign Office official,
suggested that the trade and defence ministries may have withheld
intelligence information from Mr Waldgrave.
When and how did you learn about the UK involvement in Iraq's supergun
project?
According to Mr Paul Henderson, a Matrix-Churchill executive, detailed
intelligence about the project was sent to the Cabinet in October 1989. Yet
six months later Mr Nicholas Ridley, the trade and industry secretary, told
the House of Commons that the government had only recently become aware 'in
general terms' of the project.
David Mellor, Foreign Office minister from June 1987 to July 1988
What did you know about the export of British machine-tools to Iraq by
companies such as Matrix-Churchill?
During 1987 and 1988, Whitehall officials recommended the export of British
machine-tools even though intelligence information suggested that the Iraqi
factories for which they were destined were involved in making munitions,
both nuclear and chemical.
In January 1988 a Foreign Office official working under Mr Mellor
recommended that because of the threatened UN arms embargo, British
manufacturers 'should be warned of the falling guillotine and urged to
produce as fast as they can'.
At issue is whether the minister acquiesced in the apparent breach of the
government's guidelines.
What did you tell Iraqi president Saddam Hussein when you visited Baghdad on
February 23 1988?
Two days later the Iraqi government released Mr John Smith, a British
businessman jailed on suspicion of spying. This was followed by a Foreign
office announcement of a campaign for a world ban on arms sales to Iran.
From Baghdad, Mr Mellor went to Jordan.
What was ministerial policy towards countries suspected of being used as a
conduit for arms to Iraq?
In documents which were made available to the Scott inquiry Saudi Arabia is
identified as a country 'known or suspected' of diverting sensitive
defence-related equipment in 1987 and 1988.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Resale of council homes 'blocked by loans policy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT, ROLAND ADBURGHAM and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOMEOWNERS WHO bought property from local authorities could be trapped in
houses they cannot sell, a study of building society lending policies says.
The study, conducted in the Midlands by a Birmingham City Council housing
official, suggests many owners will be unable to sell because of building
defects or the reluctance of lenders to offer mortgages in rundown areas.
The report concludes that a growing number of former council house tenants
who exercised the right to buy are finding that building societies have
become increasingly reluctant to offer mortgages on properties of
non-traditional construction - mainly houses with prefabricated reinforced
concrete or steel frames.
According to Mr Trevor Graham, the study's author, who questioned 15 lenders
during academic research on the subject, some societies will not offer loans
on such housing - favoured by councils because it was quick and cheap to
build - as it has a reputation for cracking and corrosion which makes it a
bad risk.
The problem has been raised in parliament, where the Commons environment
committee has demanded a government inquiry into the growing numbers of
'unsaleable right-to-buy properties'.
Mr Alex Smith, a Birmingham chartered surveyor, said: 'The societies have
made too many bad loans, so now they're much tougher. On every property they
ask, 'Has it got bricks in it?''
Leading building societies deny refusing to lend on properties of
non-traditional construction. Each case is treated individually, according
to societies such as Nationwide and Halifax, which add that their mortgage
managers have not been advised to steer clear of former council properties.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Britons win the techno-battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH may have to grant that the French are best in the kitchen and
yield to the Germans in public transport, but when it comes to using
technology they are right on the button.
Nearly one in four Britons is a 'techno-wizard', according to a
multinational survey which shows they are more comfortable using a computer,
tuning a car radio and even programming a video recorder than their
Continental counterparts in France and Germany.
Even North Americans, in spite of their apparently greater familiarity with
gadgetry, are more prone than the British to 'technophobia' - a fear of, and
resistance to modern technology - in their everyday lives. About 55 per cent
of American adults and teenagers admitted to technophobia compared with only
46 per cent of Britons.
The electronic word processor is clearly set to stay, however. Fewer than a
quarter of those questioned - regardless of nationality - look back with
nostalgia to manual typewriters and the delights of changing ribbons.
The survey, by the US computer company Dell, identified a family of
techno-types. Techno-wizards want the hottest technology at the cheapest
price. Their greatest fear is being behind the times.
Techno-boomers want to look smart and research endlessly before purchasing.
They are scared of being seen to make the wrong decision. The techno-to-go
category want machines that work straight out of the box. Their greatest
fear is being left without support.
Some of the survey's findings simply reinforce popular prejudices. Men are
more comfortable with technology than women and the young are more likely to
savour the challenge of technology than the old.
But there are surprises. Car phones and fax machines are seen across Europe
as complicated and difficult to use, while only just over half of those
surveyed are prepared or able to programme their favourite stations into
their car radios.
There is evidence of a north-south divide in the UK. Scottish pupils are
significantly more likely to use a computer in school than pupils from any
other part of the country, with London coming off worst.
'Incredibly,' the survey says, '72 per cent of adults in the south of the UK
have never set a burglar alarm, compared with 56 per cent of northerners.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / Warning on dairy prices is attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW DARE, chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board, has attacked
claims by some of the UK's large dairy companies that consumer milk prices
will rise when the Pounds 3.3bn industry enters a free market next April.
Mr Dare said: 'There will certainly be some rises in price, but they should
be modest.' He believes consumer prices should not rise by more than 8 per
cent and will be kept down by intense competition among dairy companies.
The UK's dairy industry became embroiled in a row about pricing after Mr
Dare held out the prospect of higher prices to farmers for their supplies if
they joined Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk Marketing Board, which is
to be abolished.
Mr Dare believes that the removal of the current pricing system, which
charges dairy company customers different prices for milk depending on its
end-use, will see consumers paying higher prices for products such as butter
or cheese.
He said: 'But prices to UK farmers are not high by European standards. I
don't see why UK farmers shouldn't get higher prices while consumer price
rises are kept at a modest level.'
A report by Adas, the government's farm development service, says farmers
should be wary of counting on higher payments over the long term.
Mr John Sumner, head of dairy development at Adas, said: 'The milk price
could stay good for a couple of years as milk buyers bid for supplies, but
after that the effects of a Gatt settlement will bring pressure on prices.'
The Adas report, which is due to be released on Wednesday, urges the
industry to become more involved in higher-quality, added-value products
such as dairy desserts, fromage frais and soft cheeses as a way of competing
against imports.
The UK produces only 85 per cent of its own dairy needs, and is constrained
by European Community quotas from raising output. But countries such as The
Netherlands and Denmark produce two to three times their own consumption and
look to the UK as a lucrative export market. The UK's dairy trade deficit
was Pounds 609m last year.
The abolition of the Milk Marketing Board introduces competition into milk
buying for the first time since the 1930s, and many UK dairy companies are
looking to buy directly from farmers.
The forces of competition could accelerate the rationalisation of the dairy
industry, with many plants closing because of over-capacity. The size of
dairy farms is expected to increase as many smaller producers go out of
business.
Mr Sumner believes that a third of the UK's 29,000 dairy farmers will leave
the business by the year 2000, pushed by pressure on incomes and tempted by
high asset values - such as the price for selling EC quota.

go to the barricade for the BBC licence fee.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / Publicans take row over leases to European stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLICANS involved in a long-running campaign against the terms of their
leases from Inntrepreneur Estates, the joint venture between Grand
Metropolitan and Courage, are taking the dispute to the European Commission.
The publicans, backed by the National Association of Inntrepreneur Lessees
(Nail), say they are trying to block an attempt by Inntrepreneur to win an
exemption from EC regulations on anti-competitive practices.
This would allow Inntrepreneur to keep the tie which obliges 4,350 of its
6,830 pubs to buy their beer from Courage. Inntrepreneur said yesterday it
hoped to win the exemption by the end of this year.
Mrs Tricia Boyes, Nail's chairwoman, said yesterday that publicans buying
their beer from Courage were paying Pounds 70 extra for each 36-gallon
barrel of beer.
Mrs Boyes said about 400 publicans had written individually to the
Commission, and Nail had also sent a report on the issue to Brussels. It is
meeting a senior official at the DTI on Thursday.
Inntrepreneur said leaseholders' rent was discounted to reflect the fact
that publicans had to buy their beer from Courage. It also noted that all
pubs in the group would be freed of the tie in 1998.
Nail's appeal to the Commission is the latest salvo in its campaign against
the pub-leasing scheme. In March executives from Inntrepreneur were
cross-examined by the Commons agriculture committee.
Three months later the Department of Trade and Industry said it was
investigating the scheme.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Call to aid small manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should consider establishing a German-style bank to enable
small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMEs) to obtain finance on the same
terms as larger companies, says a report out this week.
The report, prepared by Professor Jack Levy for the Institution of
Electrical Engineers, also calls for a new Manufacturing Expansion Scheme
aimed at smaller companies. This would replace the Business Expansion
Scheme, which is being phased out.
It says SMMEs in the UK are regarded by banks and venture capitalists as
high risk, and have to pay much higher interest rates than larger companies.
Their workforces are also much less well trained than in Germany and Japan.
When large companies have had first pick of educated people, the SMMEs are
left underskilled both in technical and administrative capabilities.
The report says the Department of Trade and Industry's measures and schemes
have been of some help to the SMMEs, but have not penetrated to the
majority. It lists 50 actions, 25 each for Government and industry, which
would help ensure the successful survival of the sector.
These include encouragement for a new structure of inter-industry
partnerships in research and development and wider tax relief on investments
in growing businesses.
But Prof Levy says the SMMEs themselves have to review their methods of
working and use fully the available support from the government and the
European Community,
The institution says the Government has expressed its concern that the UK
manufacturing base is not as strong as it needs to be if it is to make its
necessary contribution to the national economy. The report is meant to
contribute to the debate on how to rectify this.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Bootle banks on a bonanza: A look at the change in fortunes
which oil may bring to Merseyside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a whiff of an oil bonanza in the air of Bootle, Merseyside.
News that Hamilton Oil, partnered by Lasmo and Monument, has discovered oil
and gas in Liverpool Bay brought more than 130 local companies to Bootle
town hall last week in search of a share of the action. They were attracted
by the arrival of Mr Terry Aldridge, Hamilton's procurement manager.
Mr Roger Pearson, Hamilton's project director, says there are 200m barrels
of oil, mainly in Douglas, a field 15 miles north of Point of Ayr on the
Welsh side of the Dee estuary. The rest is in a field called Lennox, only
five miles west of the genteel resort of Southport.
Lennox also contains gas - part of one trillion (million million) cu ft
Hamilton has so far found there and in two other fields it has called
Hamilton and Hamilton North. Field life is estimated at 17 years, but the
Hamilton consortium expects to find more, as do other oil companies which
have since dashed for exploration licences.
Fabrication of production platforms will start in April. Hamilton has
scheduled oil production for December 1995 and gas one month later.
Bootle badly needs a boom. About 3,600 people will be employed in the
development of the fields. These are precious jobs in a town where male
unemployment runs at 36 per cent in some electoral wards.
Bootle's people are less healthy and more likely to be unemployed than in
the country as a whole. Between half and three-quarters of households in
eight of its nine wards have no car. A quarter of homes are occupied by
pensioners, many are overcrowded and the overwhelming majority of households
are officially defined as 'working class'. Since the rundown of the local
docks the local authority has been the main employer.
Work has just started on a gas terminal at Point of Ayr. Powergen is to
build a gas-fired power station nearby.
Sefton Borough Council - the local authority for the Merseyside coastal
strip running from Bootle to Southport - arranged meetings at the town hall.
Representatives armed with promotional material and business cards queued
for interviews. Some were from big corporations with plants in the borough,
but most from medium-sized or smaller engineering companies, offering to
make basic metal components. Many were from car-hire operators, corporate
travel agents, caterers, hotel keepers, local builders and taxi firms hoping
to win contracts.
Because the offshore industry has long-standing relationships with large
contractors it knows well, Bootle may get only crumbs. But with Pounds
350,000 of purchased items in Hamilton's Pounds 1bn development budget,
those crumbs could feed a lot of small companies.
Mr Aldridge said there were always shortfalls of every type of equipment and
service to be filled locally and at short notice. Hamilton favoured local
companies with good records for safety, quality, delivery, price and
financial stability - and paid them on time.
Barrow-in-Furness and Heysham are competing for the base to service the
field, but Mersey Docks and Harbour Company has offered what it hopes will
be a winning choice of Bootle and Birkenhead. A potential clincher for
Bootle is that Liverpool has a fully serviced but underused airport.
Bootle's grimy culture is based on servicing the sea. The town was built for
130,000 people who fled famine in Ireland to man the docks. Jobs were handed
down through the generations, and lost in their thousands as the port
modernised.
For the first time in several generations people are looking out to
Liverpool Bay for work.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Workers give job security lower priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB SECURITY has a relatively low priority for employees in the south of
England, a survey published yesterday by the Industrial Society shows.
The survey was released as Manpower, the employment services company,
forecast that the recent gradual upswing in confidence about job prospects
would continue into the last quarter of the year in spite of rises in
unemployment in July and August. The organisation's regular quarterly survey
of more than 2,000 employers showed that 23 per cent forecast job increases
and 16 per cent job losses.
The Industrial Society survey shows that enjoyable work, good pay and a
sense of achievement rate more highly than job security among employees. It
found that one in three employees in the south are dissatisfied with their
work. Public-sector employees are most satisfied and those in the financial
services and engineering sectors least. Only 17 per cent of employees said
they could contribute to their full potential at work.
Ms Christine Garner, head of the society's southern region, said: 'Job
security is a concern for everybody, but not an expectation for anybody.
People know they no longer have jobs for life.'
A good relationship with the boss, good terms and conditions of employment,
a good working environment and status have even lower priority than job
security.
Manpower said: 'Overall the trend which emerges from the forecasts of this
quarter continues to bear a distinct similarity to the same period 10 years
ago, when the UK was emerging from the 1979 recession.'
The survey showed that only one region, East Anglia, was forecasting a
decrease in job levels for the last quarter, compared with six regions for
the same period last year.
The public sector was the worst-affected sector for job prospects for the
seventh consecutive quarter, with the service sector the most optimistic.
The manufacturing sector saw the greatest improvement over last year with a
swing from a net balance of minus 4 per cent to a positive net balance of 7
per cent.
It is 11 times harder to get a job now than when Mr John Major, the prime
minister, left school in 1959, a Labour party survey says today. Mr Frank
Dobson, employment spokesman, says research shows there were two people
after every job then. The figure is now 22.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Claims on milk prices attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW DARE, chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board, has attacked
claims by some of the UK's large dairy companies that consumer milk prices
will rise when the Pounds 3.3bn industry enters a free market next April.
Mr Dare said: 'There will certainly be some rises in price, but they should
be modest.' He believes consumer prices should not rise by more than 8 per
cent and will be kept down by intense competition among dairy companies.
The UK's dairy industry became embroiled in a row about pricing after Mr
Dare held out the prospect of higher prices to farmers for their supplies if
they joined Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk Marketing Board, which is
to be abolished.
Mr Dare believes that the removal of the current pricing system, which
charges dairy company customers different prices for milk depending on its
end-use, will see consumers paying higher prices for products such as butter
or cheese.
'But prices to UK farmers are not high by European standards. I don't see
why UK farmers shouldn't get higher prices while consumer price rises are
kept at a modest level,' he said.
A report by Adas, the government's farm development service, says farmers
should be wary of counting on higher payments over the long term.
Mr John Sumner, head of dairy development at Adas, said: 'The milk price
could stay good for a couple of years as milk buyers bid for supplies, but
after that the effects of a Gatt settlement will bring pressure on prices.'
The Adas report, which is due to be released on Wednesday, urges the
industry to become more involved in higher-quality, added-value products
such as dairy desserts, fromage frais and soft cheeses as a way of competing
against imports.
The UK produces only 85 per cent of its own dairy needs, and is constrained
by European Community quotas from raising output. But countries such as The
Netherlands and Denmark produce two to three times their own consumption and
look to the UK as a lucrative export market. The UK's dairy trade deficit
was Pounds 609m last year.
The abolition of the Milk Marketing Board introduces competition into milk
buying for the first time since the 1930s, and many UK dairy companies are
looking to buy directly from farmers.
The forces of competition could speed up the rationalisation of the dairy
industry, with many plants closing because of over-capacity. The size of
dairy farms is expected to increase as many smaller producers go out of
business.
Mr Sumner believes that a third of the UK's 29,000 dairy farmers will leave
the business by the year 2000, pushed by pressure on incomes and tempted by
high asset values - such as the price for selling EC quota.
'Farmers have a short period of fairly good profits in the next couple of
years when they should improve their facilities and gear up their financial
base for the hard times to come,' he said.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Manchester aims to win even in defeat: The race for the 2000
Olympic Games will be decided on Thursday / A look at the prizes to be won
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER IS going to celebrate even if it loses on Thursday. Unlike its
bid for the 1996 Olympic Games - when there was little to show for its
efforts afterwards - the campaign for the 2000 games will leave a tangible
legacy.
Mr Tim Johnson, a KPMG Peat Marwick accountant in Liverpool who has led the
economic analysis of the bid, said Pounds 200m of expenditure, supporting
480 jobs, had already been created by the bid alone. More than Pounds 70m
had come from the government.
Most of the money is for two big capital projects and environmental
improvements which are well under way.
A velodrome on the main Olympic site in Manchester's Eastlands will give
Britain its first international-standard indoor cycling stadium. This will
become the national cycling centre and the sport's training and
administrative headquarters.
The other big facility is a Pounds 49m indoor arena which is spearheading
redevelopment of a bleak area around Victoria Station. The project will
extend and enhance the city centre.
A 20-year contract to run the arena from its opening in 1995 was given in
June to Ogden Entertainment Services, the US leisure management specialist,
which will use it as its European flagship. Ogden sees it as a principal
international venue for gymnastics, ice skating, ice hockey, concerts,
conferences and a range of entertainments.
Having these buildings under construction has been crucial to convincing
visiting International Olympic Committee members of the seriousness of
Britain's bid for the games. The projects would be mere pump primers should
Manchester win on Thursday.
Mr Johnson's team calculates that the games would bring Pounds 4.1bn of
extra spending power into the north-west region, creating 11,145 jobs.
Manchester would have to build a main stadium and a second, smaller arena to
go with the velodrome and city centre arena. Liverpool, which would stage
the boxing, would build an arena next to the Albert Dock on the waterfront.
Swimming facilities would be built in Wigan.
The Olympic village would be needed anyway. Greater Manchester has four
universities, a postgraduate business school, a conservatoire and many other
colleges. After the games the village would ease chronic accommodation
problems for students.
One bonus for Manchester is that its telecommunications and road, rail and
air transport infrastructure is already largely in place.
It would not require the scale of investment seen in Barcelona - about half
the Dollars 6.7bn Spain spent was put into capital projects. Manchester's
direct capital budget would be about Pounds 1.5bn.
This is about the same as the aggregate investment by the north-west's
manufacturing sector in a non-recession year. The bidders believe the most
long-lasting returns would come from inward and more general investment
retained in the region.
Mr Johnson believes an extra Pounds 400m of tax revenues would be generated
overall.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Tories slump in Scots opinion poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT for the Conservatives in Scotland has fallen to its lowest figure on
record, according to a poll in The Scotsman today.
In a survey of 1,004 voters only 13 per cent backed the Tories compared with
26 per cent at the 1992 election.
Suport for Labour has risen to 53 per cent, up 14 per cent on the 1992
figure.
The others were: Scottish National Party 23 per cent (up 2 on 1992); and
Liberal Democrats 10 per cent (down 3).
The survey was carried out in 52 Scottish constituencies on September 13-14.
Asked about party leaders, only 15 per cent said they were satisfied with Mr
John Major. Labour leader Mr John Smith won support from 45 per cent,
Liberal Democrat leader Mr Paddy Ashdown 42 per cent, and SNP leader Mr Alex
Salmond 33 per cent.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Labour members 'back vote reform'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR PARTY members have given 'substantial backing' to the case for
electoral reform - with 60 per cent of constituencies agreeing the party
should end its support of the first-past-the-post voting system, an MP said
yesterday.
Mr Jeff Rooker, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr and chairman of the Labour
campaign for electoral reform, said the findings 'nail the lie that Labour
is losing interest in electoral reform'.
Labour modernisers today seek to intensify pressure on union leaders to fall
into line behind Mr John Smith's party reforms.
Writing in the Fabian Review, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, says the
party must resist those on the left whose solutions offer a return to
Labour's past.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Bugatti to develop cheaper Lotus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUGATTI International, which recently took over Group Lotus, the UK
automotive engineering consultancy and maker of sports cars, plans to
develop an affordable Lotus sports car for production in the second half of
the 1990s, Kevin Done writes.
Lotus, which was previously owned by General Motors of the US, abandoned the
two-seat roadster market last year. Rising losses and the high cost of
production forced it to halt output of its Elan less than 2 1/2 years after
launch.
Mr Romano Artioli, president of Bugatti Automobili, and Mr Mario Barbieri,
vice-chairman, have become chairman and vice-chairman of Group Lotus.
Lotus plans initially to resume output of a limited edition of 500 to 700
units of the axed Elan in order to use up the existing stock of parts,
including nearly 800 Isuzu engines left when output was abandoned last year.
Once these stocks have been used up Lotus will continue to try to sell the
Elan design and production equipment abroad, possibly to a carmaker in South
Korea.

A DUVET sporting the Olympic colours lay under a spotlight in Barcelona's
newly-opened Olympic museum.
Just over a year ago, as an emotional Spanish journalist pointed out, it
would have covered an athlete who lay dreaming about a gold medal.
Next to it nestled an official Olympic pillow. Behind it was a matching
tooth mug. Hanging on the back of a door in the display was an official
athlete's bathrobe.
For Barcelona's city leaders there are loftier mementoes of the 16-day,
Dollars 6.7bn bonanza that engulfed them last year. Walking around the city
a year later it is hard to escape them.
The hill above the city sports a new telephone exchange and sports stadiums.
The spruced-up city centre is dotted with sculptures and litter bins. City
officials can boast a series of statistics to convince the sceptic of
benefits that can be reaped from the spectacle.
Unemployment in Barcelona is now 10.5 per cent - less than half the Spanish
average. The city has apparently become the seventh most popular conference
centre in the world. The logistics of the Olympics has left the city basking
in civic pride over its 'project management' skills.
According to the city's Olympic museum Barcelona welcomed more than 1m
visitors during the games. The Olympic village alone received 88,000
telephone calls and 60 kilos of mail each day.
In the athletes' village 7,751 condoms were dispensed, 937 lost objects
handed in and Silence of the Lambs was the most popular video.
But although the statistics seem impressive enough, it is hard to escape a
sense of Spanish melancholy.
An official at Barcelona's port said: 'When the Olympics happened everyone
was so excited. And then it finished and there was a real downturn. Now
everyone asks, 'What now? what was it all for?''
What, in other words, does a city do with all the stadiums, telephone
exchanges and paraphernalia when the athletes have gone home?
Barcelona's leaders refuse to reconcile themselves to a return to obscurity,
and like other Olympic cities before them are trying to turn everything
Olympic into something economic.
The city's 5,000 new hotel rooms are being advertised to tourists and
conference organisers. The stadium that hosted the gymnastics is used for
film shows and indoor windsurfing. Accommodation in the Olympic village is
being sold as 5,500 flats and the former Olympic harbour is now a marina,
with half-built shops and restaurants.
Efforts are being made to channel the city's new organisational expertise
into service industries and consultancy.
Delegations from Barcelona have already travelled to Manchester and other
Olympic hopefuls to advise them on how to bid for the games.
So far these delegations have tactfully refrained from commenting on which
would be best placed to win the games. Mr Pasqual Maragall, city mayor,
said: 'Each city must do it their own way. It would be wrong to try to
repeat the games as in Barcelona.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / Recovery 'slowed by European recession'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC recovery will be 'patchy and anaemic' because of recession in
continental Europe, says Oxford Economic Forecasting.
Weakness in the financial and construction sectors is also holding back
growth, the UK-based independent consultancy says in its latest review of
industrial prospects, published today.
Mr John Walker, the group's chief economist, said: 'The sectoral impact of
the recession has been unusual, to say the least.' The group says that the
construction sector, which normally leads recovery, is still suffering from
falling output 'mainly because of the excesses of the 1980s'.
In spite of those warnings, the report expects a 'sustained recovery' with
GDP growth of 1.9 per cent this year and 3.2 per cent next year, following
falls in the past two years.
In contrast to the forecasts of some other economists, the group predicts
that the government's proposal to impose value added tax on domestic fuel in
stages over the next three years will have a big effect on demand for fuel.
The output of the fuels and water sector will be nearly 2 per cent lower in
1996, it says.
The latest set of economic forecasts from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy
and consultancy group, agrees that the recovery will be sluggish and patchy.
The report, which blames the weakness on high consumer debt among other
factors, expects slower growth than the Oxford forecasts - only 1.5 per cent
this year and 2 per cent next year.
Ms Rosemary Radcliffe, Coopers' head of economics, said that in the next 10
to 15 years even if Continental prospects improved, the emerging Asian
markets would be the key to high growth.

'I HAD three letters from Chinese people this morning,' said Dame Mary Glen
Haig last week. 'But it doesn't make any difference who writes.'
After 11 years as one of the UK's two representatives to the International
Olympic Committee - the other is the Princess Royal - Dame Mary is used to
resisting the blandishments of Olympics-hungry cities such as Beijing.
'When Tokyo wanted the games I got postcards from Japanese schoolchildren,'
she said.
For Dame Mary, who fenced for Britain in four consecutive Olympics from
1948, the decision on venue is simple.
You consider the skills of the local organisers. You ensure they have the
required money and ability. 'Then you look at it from the athlete's point of
view,' she said. 'How far, for example, is the athletes' village from the
arena.'
To her, the process seems to be rather tedious. 'The thing that captures the
imagination,' she said, 'is working with the IOC medical commission, which
deals among other things with the misuse of drugs by athletes.'
Even this issue has been linked with the bids this year. Chinese women
athletes have broken world records by huge margins, triggering speculation
of help from drugs.
At 75, Dame Mary must retire from the IOC after this week's vote. Her
businesslike self-control only wavered when she talked of what the
atmosphere would be like when this year's voting was over. There would be an
end-of-term feeling, she said, 'and a party.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / US Health Reform: Political imperative to end costly
hodge-podge - President Clinton formally launches his health crusade this
week. A look at why change is so vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Wednesday President Bill Clinton will formally launch his healthcare
reform proposal in an address to Congress. The best way for non-Americans to
understand why reform has become a political imperative is to imagine what
the health system in the UK, say, might look like if the National Health
Service had not been created in the late 1940s.
In the absence of an all-embracing public system, most large companies would
have offered health insurance as a fringe benefit, along with corporate
pension schemes. At some stage pressure of public opinion would have forced
government to set up public schemes to cover particularly vulnerable groups
 -such as the elderly and the poor - that companies could not be expected to
cater for.
The result would have been a hodge-podge.
Some people would be in lavish private schemes financed entirely by
employers. Some would qualify for public healthcare. Some - for example,
employees of small companies that could not afford to set up corporate
health schemes - would not have any insurance. Nearly everybody would face a
great deal of insecurity: a job change, for example, might involve
acceptance of a less generous insurance scheme; a bad illness might leave an
employee uninsurable.
In such a system it would be hard to control costs. If government attempted
to reduce spending on public schemes, doctors and hospitals would probably
respond by charging private patients more. In emergencies, uninsured
patients would have to be treated and the bills would again be passed on in
higher fees for privately insured patients. With employers paying for most
people's insurance, patients and physicians would have little incentive to
economise on treatments or new technology.
This scenario describes what has occurred in recent decades in the US. The
government set up two public schemes in the 1960s - Medicare for the elderly
and Medicaid for the poor. But most people of working age still rely on
voluntary employer-provided health insurance.
Some 37m people (15 per cent of the population) are without insurance cover;
most are employees of small companies (or their dependants), and some are
poor people who do not qualify for Medicaid.
The absence of an overall budget, such as that which the Treasury imposes on
the NHS and the lack of incentives for individuals to ration demand for
care, has permitted explosive growth of medical spending. Since 1960 per
capita healthcare expenditure has grown at an average annual rate of 4.6 per
cent in real terms. Spending has grown from 5 per cent of gross domestic
product to 14 per cent, nearly double that in most European countries. Much
of this has fallen directly on US employers who complain bitterly that their
foreign competitors are not expected to shoulder comparable burdens.
Business spending on healthcare rose from 3.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent of
salaries between 1970 and 1990.
Yet although the US spends far more than any other country on healthcare,
the results are not particularly impressive. The US has pioneered many
advanced treatments yet has one of the highest rates of infant mortality in
the developed world. Life expectancy is lower than in many poorer countries.
There is evidence that much unnecessary surgery occurs; for example, an
abnormally high proportion of births are by caesarian section.
The low apparent return on heavy investment in healthcare has many causes.
The reliance on hundreds of private insurance companies, with different
rules and procedures, has led to high administrative costs. Physicians have
gravitated toward the most lucrative high-tech specialties, leaving primary
and preventive care understaffed and starved of resources. The geographic
distribution of care is very unequal, reflecting the low profitability of
medical practice in inner cities and poor rural areas.
In the 1980s Republican administrations failed to address the emerging
crisis in US healthcare. But the soaring financial burden on employers
prompted a revolution of sorts in the private sector. To control costs,
large companies have increasingly insisted that employees join health
maintenance organisations (HMOs) or other forms of 'managed care'.
An HMO charges a flat annual fee and then guarantees to provide whatever
care members need. Physicians in HMOs have a much stronger incentive to
control costs than those who charge a separate fee for each item of service
 -the usual practice in the US. The corporate drive to control costs has
resulted in soaring membership of HMOs (and similar arrangements) - from
9.1m in 1980 to 41.4m last year, 16 per cent of the population.
President Bill Clinton's reform will seek to build on the strengths of the
US system while importing European-style budgetary controls.
He will provide financial incentives to try to push a larger fraction of the
population into HMOs or other forms of tightly managed care. He will seek to
replace the current voluntary system of corporate-financed care with a legal
requirement that employers pay at least 80 per cent of employees' healthcare
costs. And he will try to impose caps on the growth of healthcare spending
in the private as well as the public sector.

FT  20 SEP 93 / US Health Reform: Business begins to count the cost -
Executives fear increased state intrusion and bigger bills / A look at the
likely impact on American companies, both big and small
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<TEXT>
US companies know exactly who will foot the bill if the grand claims made of
the Clinton health reform plan fail to materialise. They will.
Mr John Extale, whose Syracuse-based Central New York Building Products
employs eight people, is typical of those who might be expected to applaud
the plan, but are not. His roofing products company has been hit by
escalating health insurance premiums and falling levels of cover in recent
years. Annual premiums will cost his company more than Dollars 25,000
(Pounds 16,230) this year.
By putting a ceiling on the healthcare costs of small companies and forcing
them to buy through large 'health alliances,' gaining advantages of scale,
the Clinton plan is meant to help people like Mr Extale. But he is not
impressed. 'They may put a cap on it for now. But politicians are
politicians - what's true now may not be in six months' time.'
For many large companies, extra costs would show through in other ways.
Individual states would be able to levy a payroll tax on companies that
opted out of the health alliances. Clinton officials have suggested that the
premium ceilings for small companies would last for nine or 10 years, and
that the payroll tax would not top 1 per cent. But if healthcare costs
cannot be reined in, businesses fear these promises would be worthless.
Meanwhile, based on two big assumptions - that the administration's
financial projections turn out to be correct and the plan is adopted in its
current form - the early draft of the reforms appears to throw up both
corporate winners and losers.
The winners would be those which have ageing workforces (generally more
expensive in healthcare terms) and many retired workers; the losers, those
with large numbers of part-time workers.
The draft proposals circulated so far suggest that big car companies, among
others, can look forward to a windfall from the reforms. The government
would pick up 80 per cent of the healthcare costs of people who choose, or
are forced, to retire early, greatly benefiting defence companies or those
like IBM which have had to restructure. Also, there would be a cap on
employee healthcare costs at 7.9 per cent of the payroll for all companies,
regardless of size.
It is difficult to predict the effect of this cap on companies like General
Motors. US healthcare, much of it for retired workers, cost the company
Dollars 5.6bn last year, adding Dollars 1,469 to the cost of every car it
produced. That is 19 per cent of its payroll.
With the cost of providing current employees with the basic package of
benefits capped, the company's total costs (once additional benefits and
retirees are added in) are difficult to predict. GM refuses to discuss the
Clinton plan, but other car companies are generally buoyant about the
prospects.
'It will have a positive impact on any businesses that have been around for
a long time, and those that have been through some sort of restructuring,'
says Mr Wallace Maher, director of federal government relations at Chrysler.
'The overall effect is going to be very beneficial.'
Many retailers, restaurateurs and others in service industries are likely to
see their healthcare costs rise. That is in part because these industries
support a large proportion of small businesses, many of which would be
forced to provide cover for their employees for the first time. Also, the
Clinton plan requires companies to provide cover for all part-timers who
work more than 10 hours a week.
Whatever the outcome on particular companies, there is a widespread fear
among big groups that the reforms will lead to greater state intrusion and
bureaucracy. Prompted by an escalation of costs in the 1980s, most big
companies have already made efforts to hold down the growth in their
healthcare bills.
One way of doing this has been to reduce the benefits paid for under company
plans and to increase the amount that employees have to pay themselves
towards their healthcare cover. Another change has been for companies to buy
services through managed care networks such as health maintenance
organisations, which hold down costs.
The Clinton plans could interfere with these developments. By forcing
companies to pay at least 80 per cent of employees' insurance costs and
laying down a minimum package of benefits, the plan would halt the trend for
big companies gradually to eat into their benefits packages.
Also, many fear they will be sucked into health alliances (only those
employing more than 5,000 would remain outside). And big companies would no
longer be exempt from state-level controls on healthcare provision, a
freedom conferred in 1974.
For the small companies that already provide insurance for their workers -
virtually all those which have more than 20 employees - the changes would in
theory reduce healthcare costs. The economies of scale and 'community
rating' benefits that would come from buying through alliances (insurance
companies would no longer be allowed to assess each company on its own
claims experience) could lead to lower premiums. Also, premiums would be
capped at between 3.5 per cent of payroll costs for low-wage companies and
7.9 per cent.
However, for those businesses which do not provide cover (around half of
those which employ fewer than 20 people) the obligation to do so will add to
the costs of employment.
Small business lobby groups and many individual businessmen claim this will
force companies to lay off workers or to close.
'I'll go out of business, there's nothing else to it,' says Mr Bob Hopkins,
who employs three people in his car repair business in Syracuse in upper New
York state. 'There's just not enough money in the business.'

<TEXT>
US DRUGS companies face a significant slowdown in earnings growth if
President Bill Clinton's draft healthcare proposals are implemented.
Growth in average earnings per share of nine of the top 10 US drugs
companies will fall in 1996 to 6.6 per cent, from a previously expected 8.4
per cent, according to Salomon Brothers, the New York-based brokers. Its
study excludes Marion Merrell Dow, whose earnings are expected to fall 27
per cent even without the reforms.
The industry as a whole, however, sees the proposed health package as not as
bad as it could have been. Most importantly, there will be no direct
controls on the price of either new or existing drugs, a measure that was
publicly contemplated at one stage by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton's
healthcare taskforce.
The administration appears willing to give the sector an opportunity to
regulate itself. Nevertheless, Mr Clinton is expected to propose the
creation of a board to look into the issue of new drugs pricing.
The package is also expected to contain powers for the health secretary to
be given the right to exclude from Medicare, the state programme for the
elderly, medicines whose prices were deemed excessive.
The proposals also include the government paying a proportion of out-patient
drugs for the elderly under the Medicare system. Salomon Brothers estimates
this will cost Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.67bn) over five years.
To pay for these benefits Mr Clinton is proposing the introduction of 15 per
cent rebates on Medicare drugs. These would be implemented by July 1 1996.
Medicaid rebates for the poor already cost the sector Dollars 1.2bn a year,
and the Medicare rebates could amount to Dollars 2.5bn by 1996, according to
Salomon Brothers.
If the rebates are implemented, Salomon Brothers estimates Merck's earnings
per share in 1996 would increase 9.5 per cent (instead of 12.4 per cent),
Bristol-Myers Squibb's 4 per cent (5.3 per cent), Pfizer's 14.1 per cent
(15.6 per cent), Eli Lilly's 4.2 per cent (6.3 per cent), American Home
Products' 6.4 per cent (8.2 per cent), Schering'Plough's 13.2 per cent (15.2
per cent), Syntex's 0.2 per cent (3.7 per cent), and Warner Lambert's 9.5
per cent (10.5 per cent).
Upjohn's fall in earnings growth would be 2.1 per cent instead of 1.4 per
cent, while Marion Merrell Dow's would be 29 per cent (27.4 per cent).

FT  20 SEP 93 / US Health Reform: Guarantee of access for all citizens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAFT versions of the Clinton plan propose the following:
Universal benefits: For the first time all Americans would be guaranteed
access to a standard package of healthcare regardless of income or
employment status. National health security cards would prove eligibility.
el,2
Employer mandate: Employers would be required to pay at least 80 per cent of
the average cost of insurance premiums for employees although none would be
expected to pay more than 7.9 per cent of payroll. Federal government would
subsidise small businesses, and help low-paid employees and unemployed.
el,2
Health alliances: Most individuals and companies would obtain care via
regional purchasing co-operatives known as 'health alliances'. These public
or private sector entities would use market clout to buy high-quality care
at the lowest prices from competing 'health plans', offered by networks of
doctors and hospitals. Companies with more than 5,000 employees would be
able to set up independent 'corporate alliances'.
National Health Board: A federal panel would oversee the creation of health
alliances and regulate healthcare. It would set limits for growth rates of
private-sector premiums, and government healthcare programmes. Caps on
private premiums would aim to cut annual growth of private spending from
about 7.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent by 2000.
Managed care: Health alliances would supervise local health plans and
facilitate consumer choice with information on prices, physicians and
service quality. There would be a choice of traditional fee-for-service
medicine, pre-paid health maintenance organisations (HMOs), which restrict
choice of doctors, and hybrid schemes. Financial incentives would encourage
choice of HMOs, which are seen as more cost-efficient.
el,2
Financing: Goal is to finance the extension of health insurance to the 37m
without cover and improve healthcare quality without a general tax increase.
Revenue would come from new 'sin taxes' on cigarettes and alcohol, but main
source is projected to come from capping growth of federal programmes, such
as Medicare and Medicaid.
Tax reforms: Employer-provided benefits in excess of the federally
guaranteed package to be treated as taxable income of employees. Tax changes
to be phased in over 10 years. Self-employed would be treated like those in
employment, and be able to deduct 100 per cent of the cost of the standard
benefits package.
Primary care: Financial incentives would aim to increase proportion of
doctors trained as GPs rather than specialists, and to encourage physicians
to work in inner city and rural areas.
New benefits: Dollars 80bn federal long-term care programme would subsidise
nursing home and community care for the elderly and chronically ill. Range
of mental health benefits to be expanded, and subsidies offered on
prescription drugs.
Timetable: Some states expected to introduce reforms in 1995, but all
expected to meet a deadline for setting up health alliances of January 1997.
Administrative costs to be reduced by standardising insurance claim forms;
health alliances expected to reduce the need for thousands of small
insurance companies.

FT  20 SEP 93 / US Health Reform: Congressional adversaries find common
ground in plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE over healthcare reform has carried none of the political savagery
that accompanied the battle over President Bill Clinton's budget.
US politicians on all sides have expressed respect for the efforts put in on
the issue and have declared their willingness to work together to craft a
bipartisan reform.
'President and Mrs (Hillary Rodham) Clinton have spent months putting their
proposal together. It is a serious, honest effort to deal with a complex
subject,' Senator Bob Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, said last week
as members of his party announced their proposals for reform.
On the Democratic side, Senator Jay Rockefeller returned the compliment,
calling the Republican proposals 'a giant step forward'.
This gentlemanliness reflects, in part, a growing consensus that the US
health system must be reformed - a view that, just two years ago, was held
by only a handful in Washington, mostly budget specialists who saw the
long-term effects of medical inflation on the government deficit.
But it also reveals a feeling of vulnerability and uncertainty throughout
the political spectrum. It is easy to support healthcare reform - along with
more than three quarters of the population - but less easy to determine the
political pluses and minuses of specific elements of healthcare policy.
Besides Mr Clinton's plan, there are three main competing schools of thought
on healthcare reform.
On the president's left, a sizeable number of Democrats favours a
single-payer plan along Canadian lines. One of the leaders of this group is
Congressman Jim McDermott of Seattle, the only doctor in Congress.
Single-payer systems are viewed by a majority in Congress as dangerously
close to 'socialised medicine', an unpopular label in a country whose
inhabitants are terrified they will be prevented from choosing their own
doctors. Even so, advocates of such systems have the advantage of some
comprehensive budget analyses, which suggest they offer a greater chance of
curbing costs than co-operative purchasing alliances of the sort proposed by
Mr Clinton.
On the right, some conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives,
and a handful in the Senate such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, want to
leave healthcare to individuals and the market, helping those who have no
insurance with tax-sheltered medical savings accounts.
In the centre, however, there is an emerging majority in Congress which
believes any solution must provide universal coverage, both for reasons of
equity and to settle one of the key economic problems of the current system:
the shifting of costs from those who cannot pay to those who can.
There is a variety of proposals from both moderate Republicans and
conservative Democrats that share much ground with Mr Clinton's plan,
although they differ on crucial points.
One of the most prominent schemes, unveiled last week and backed by 20
Republican senators, was devised by Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island.
Like the Clinton plan, Mr Chafee's proposal would set up healthcare
purchasing co-operatives - but these would be voluntary, whereas Mr Clinton
would require enrolment of all except those covered by a large company plan.
Mr Chafee would also oblige the individual to buy insurance, where the
Clinton plan would place the onus on employers to offer coverage, and to pay
for 80 per cent of the premiums.
Another Republican version, backed by Congressman Bob Michel, the party's
leader in the House, splits the difference by requiring employers to offer,
but not to pay for, health insurance.
While Republicans have been critical of the requirement that employers pay
part of the premium, they have been careful to state that even this would
not make them turn their backs on a deal.
Congressional leaders have begun to take heart at the sight of so much
potential common ground. No-one relishes passing such a fundamental reform
by the single-vote margins with which Mr Clinton prevailed on his budget.
But the task may grow harder as next year's congressional elections get
closer.
The White House plans to send the legislative language for its proposal to
Congress in the first week of October, and hopes it may pass early next
year, by spring at the latest. Some members believe it may take longer than
that.

MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said last night that he had
formally notified the Queen of his government's intention to sever his
country's links with the British monarchy and to create a republic by the
year 2001.
The announcement was made in Dublin where Mr Keating arrived after his visit
to the UK which culminated in a meeting on Saturday with the Queen and an
overnight stay at Balmoral in Scotland. It had been unclear whether Mr
Keating would formally declare Australia's intentions at Balmoral.
Mr Keating said: 'There is a long-standing convention that the content of
these conversations remain confidential. But I am able to say that I
explained to Her Majesty that, not withstanding the deep respect and warm
affection felt towards her by the Australian people, there was a growing
feeling that Australia should make the necessary constitutional changes to
allow the appointment of an Australian head of state.'
He said the move was seen as necessary 'to establish clearly Australia's
identity as an independent nation. I outlined to Her Majesty the various
steps that would be involved in such a process, including the need for a
referendum to approve constitutional amendments. . . the Australian
government's view was that if approved by the Australian people at a
referendum, it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic by
the centenary of federation in 2001.'
Mr Keating said he had informed the Queen that in such a situation Australia
would remain a member of the Commonwealth and that Australians would warmly
welcome visits to Australia by the Queen as Commonwealth head.
Mr Keating added: 'Her Majesty authorised me to say that she would, of
course, act on the advice of her Australian ministers, as she always has,
and on any decision made by the Australian people.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / US goods evade Vietnam embargo: 'Just about every American
consumer product is here'
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR Nguyen Xuan Phong's office in Hanoi is pleasantly cool
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
thanks to a brand new air conditioner made by the US company Carrier.
Mr Nguyen heads the Americas department at the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry,
but his communist government has no formal diplomatic relations with
Washington and his country is supposed to be victim of a US economic embargo
since the 1975 communist victory in the Vietnam war.
But as the air-conditioners demonstrate, the US sanctions are almost wholly
ineffective.
Hanoi businessmen say the US authorities let the air-conditioners go to
Vietnam for 'humanitarian' use in schools and hospitals, which apparently
resold them to the Foreign Ministry.
Kodak films, Hewlett-Packard computer printers, and even Chef Boy Ardee
canned ravioli (microwave-cookable version) are all on sale in Vietnam,
although microwave ovens are almost unheard of.
Coca-Cola smuggled from Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Singapore - sometimes by way of Cambodia or Laos - is available from Vung
Tau in the south to the Chinese border in the north. Vietnam uses Boeing
airliners leased from Switzerland or Australia and discreetly painted white.
'Just about every American consumer product is here,' says Mr James
Rockwell, managing director of the Vatico consultancy firm which represents
US companies as they wait impatiently for the embargo to be lifted.
'I buy Snickers candy bars, Pringle potato chips and Budweiser beer. I buy
American shaving cream and American anti-perspirant.'
One local entrepreneur has even opened an Apple computer showroom in Ho Chi
Minh City (formerly Saigon), the country's commercial centre, where he sells
Apple computers imported from France. Motorola telephone handsets are
advertised in the press.
Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton have softened the embargo in the
last two years, and last week Mr Clinton allowed US companies to compete for
projects funded by international financial bodies such as the World Bank.
But the basic embargo remains in place in spite of pleadings by US
corporations. They presented a brief report to US congressmen visiting Hanoi
recently in which they complained they were losing business to their
competitors and pointed out that the sanctions were full of holes and
encouraged the use of pirated personal computer software.
The US embargo is particularly difficult to police because it is unilateral
 -Washington is alone in maintaining sanctions - and because US subsidiaries
and joint ventures can be found all over Asia. The presence in the US of
some 1m people of Vietnamese origin, many eager to do business in their
former homeland, makes enforcement even harder.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Funds sought to back low-interest loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is looking for contributions worth SDR1.5bn
(Pounds 1.64bn) from donor countries to help subsidise low interest rate
loans to developing nations.
The money would go towards establishing a successor to the IMF's Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (Esaf), a trust fund set up in 1987 to lend
at 0.5 per cent interest rates to low-income countries with protracted
economic problems. The Esaf is due to expire in November.
A senior IMF official said the Washington-based institution was looking for
SDR5bn of capital for the new Esaf, in the form of interest-bearing loans
from donor countries.
In addition, the Esaf would need SDR2.1bn to finance the subsidy element in
its loans. The IMF believes it can contribute SDR500m-600m from its own
resources, leaving SDR1.5bn to be culled from donor countries.
'The amounts are sizeable but within reach,' the official said, adding that
it should be possible to complete negotiations by the end of the year.
The IMF will use its annual meetings, starting this weekend in Washington,
as a fund-raising opportunity for the new Esaf, but officials expect to meet
a cool initial response.
Budget difficulties have made many countries reluctant to dip into their own
treasuries, and the UK earlier this year suggested the IMF should sell some
of its own gold reserves to finance the Esaf - a proposal which appears to
have been dropped.

MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday flew to Alexandria for
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Mr Rabin's surprise trip came as the government prepared to muster its
forces to face right-wing demonstrations and a two-day parliamentary debate
over the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. Over the weekend Mr Rabin and Mr
Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, appeared to rule out the possibility of
a referendum on the peace deal.

Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and how to make progress in peace talks
with Syria and Lebanon.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was
also in Egypt yesterday where he addressed Arab League foreign ministers but
Israeli officials said a Rabin-Arafat meeting was unlikely.
PLO officials, preparing for meetings with Israel, Arab states and the World
Bank said they were asking the bank to more than double a Dollars 3bn
development plan to rehabilitate the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Separately,
The Japanese government is considering contributing Dollars 100m a year to
Palestinian communities according to weekend press reports.
In the occupied territories the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement said
it had not reached an accord with the PLO, as announced by PLO headquarters
in Tunis. Hamas also said it would not participate in elections to a
self-rule council and would urge Palestinians to boycott the vote.
Also yesterday, the Jordanian government indicated it may postpone
multi-party elections to avoid debate on the Palestinian self-rule agreement
from overshadowing other issues.
The elections, due on 8 November, were to be the first since 1956 in which
political parties would campaign.
King Hussein and government officials say they fear the elections may become
a referendum on the peace process. They also expressed concern that
Palestinians who intend to return to the West Bank and Gaza under the
PLO-Israeli agreement will distort the result.
Jordan's nationalist parties and tribal leaders have been vocal in their
calls for postponing the elections. Head of the nationalist party Al Ahd, Mr
Hadi Abdul Majali, argues that either Palestinians who will be allowed to
return should have their voting rights relinquished or the elections should
be postponed.

FT  20 SEP 93 / UK urges 'Trinidad terms'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH officials said Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer,
would use his first visit to the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank later this month to call on industrialised
countries to adopt the 'Trinidad terms' for reducing the official debt of
the poorest developing countries. The scheme was first put forward by Mr
John Major when he was chancellor three years ago.
The Trinidad terms envisage that the stock of official debt owed to western
governments by poor developing nations carrying out market-oriented economic
reform programmes should be reduced by two- thirds.
An important aspect of the terms, which were designed mainly to help African
countries, is that the reduction should apply to the entire stock of
official debt rather than to selected maturities.
Mr Major and Treasury ministers have been campaigning this year for the
general adoption of the Trinidad terms by all big industrialised countries.
The US has dropped its objections to the scheme since President Bill Clinton
entered the White House.

FT  20 SEP 93 / 'Ombudsman' panel in view

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD BANK directors are expected to agree tomorrow to set up a new
inspection panel to serve both as a form of ombudsman for outside complaints
and as an internal check on management, writes George Graham in Washington.
The panel would set a precedent for international organisations to allow
outside complaints, although it falls short of some of the demands of US
environmental groups, which have been among the World Bank's most vocal
critics.
The panel can only hear complaints about the Bank's failure to follow its
own procedures or policies, not about the content of those policies. Among
other changes, the new draft increases the panel's proposed budget to
Dollars 1.5m from Dollars 600,000, with three panel members, two of whom may
initially serve only part-time.

FT  20 SEP 93 / China's Mr Zhu pursues creative destruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the hype, China's high-speed dash towards economic development
is highly unlikely to be affected by the outcome of its bid to host the 2000
Olympic games in Beijing. Much more important for China's future, if
currently less geo-politically touchy, is vice-premier Zhu Rongji's attempt
to slow its over-heating economy and avoid a hard landing.
It is too early to tell whether he will succeed - Mr Zhu only took over at
the central bank in July. But he has wasted no time in using a mix of market
and administrative measures to rein in credit creation. Market interest
rates have risen by 25 percentage points to around 35 per cent since June;
credit quotas for local banks have been cut and all speculative loans to the
real estate sector. More than 1,000 special economic development zones have
been closed since August and land prices in coastal cities have fallen by
between 20 and 30 per cent from their May 1993 peak.
Foreign investors appear willing to give Mr Zhu the benefit of the doubt, at
least for now. For, as a new Bank Credit Analyst publication, The China
Analyst, points out, utilised direct foreign investment reached a record
Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 6.1bn) in the first half of 1993, 150 per cent higher
than in the same period a year earlier. The BCA forecasts it will reach
Dollars 18bn this year.
Moreover, there are signs that this tight monetary policy is starting to
affect spending and output. Retail sales in August were 23.8 per cent higher
than the same month a year ago, down from 26.5 per cent in July. And
industrial production is slowing: output in August was 23.4 per cent higher
than a year ago, down down from 25.1 per cent in July.
But monetary policy will have to be kept tight for some months yet before
inflation starts to slow significantly. According to China's Financial News,
consumer prices in the 35 main cities in August were 22.2 per cent higher
than a year ago, slightly down from 23.3 per cent in July but still above
the 17.4 per cent inflation rate in the first half of the year.
Mr Zhu has quite a task if he is to bring inflation under control and avoid
a damaging credit crunch. Managing a price deflation of this magnitude
without over-doing the squeeze is difficult enough in a developed market
economy in which the levers of monetary policy have relatively predictable
effects. But in China's half-reformed economy, with blunt credit quotas the
main policy tool, it is much more difficult.
For it is profitable state companies, not bankrupt property developers, who
will have to repay their loans to enable the banks to satisfy their credit
quotas. The result is first a growing squeeze on corporate profits followed
by a liquidity crisis in the state industrial sector leading to the build-up
of inter-enterprise debts.
The textbook central bank response in a planned economy, as the Russian
central bank is currently demonstrating, is to pump liquidity back into the
banking system to keep the state companies afloat, thus laying the
foundations for the next inflationary boom. Mr Zhu hopes that this time
things will be different, which explains why he is simultaneously trying to
push through structural reforms which will preclude such a wholesale
bail-out of the state sector, free the state banks to lend only to
profitable customers and force unprofitable companies either to be
privatised or to go bankrupt.
What China needs is time, to push through these reforms and thus further
weaken the influence of the state banks and companies. The share of state
companies in total output has, in fact, been falling progressively over the
past 30 years - from more than 90 per cent of total production in the early
1960s to less than 50 per cent today - as the left-hand chart shows. The
need to go further is one reason why the continued inflow of foreign
investment into China is so important, and why a confidence-crushing credit
crunch would be such a setback.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are
currently changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All
trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series
and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting
the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown
in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective
exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted
indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government
and central bank sources.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund has again scaled back its forecasts of
economic growth in industrialised countries, but expects much stronger
activity in the developing world to serve as a locomotive for the world
economy.
IMF forecasts to be published this week project world economic growth in
1993 at 2.2 per cent, the same rate as in its last economic outlook in
April. But the growth forecast for industrialised countries has been revised
down to 1.1 per cent, compared with the 1.7 per cent the IMF expected in
April, and 2.9 per cent a year ago.
The forecast for the developing world, however, has improved to 6.1 per
cent, against 5.1 per cent.
'It shows you where the locomotives now are in the world,' a senior IMF
official said, noting developing countries' imports have been growing at a
rate of 9 to 10 per cent a year for four years in a row.
IMF officials recognise that their economic forecasts have in recent years
proved wildly off target, failing to take adequate account of elements such
as the bursting of the 1980s asset bubble in Japan and the US or the
structural dimension of unemployment in Europe.
While they believe that the world economy is now not far away from the
upswing which at the start of the year they thought would come in the
summer, they warn that nations must draw the lessons of the current
recession in order to be better prepared for the next downturn.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Hopes rising that deal can be saved

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC FOREIGN, agriculture and trade ministers will today try to refine French
demands for a renegotiation of last year's Blair House deal on farm trade
into a package Brussels can feasibly negotiate with Washington, but without
re-opening the original accord.
France's threat to veto Blair House means that the European Commission and
current Belgian presidency of the EC have three priorities for this
extraordinary, potentially stormy, and almost certainly lengthy meeting, due
to be attended by 35 ministers. They must at all costs avoid a vote, prevent
any time-wasting manoeuvres which would wreck chances of meeting the
December 15 deadline for concluding the overall Uruguay Round world trade
reform process, and insist that the Commission retains its mandate to
negotiate with the EC's trading partners without further constraint.
Hopes are rising that several of the French demands, supported by Spain and
Ireland, can be accommodated without reopening Blair House. 'I don't think
there's that much room for manoeuvre, but there is some,' Mr Rene Steichen,
EC farm commissioner, told the FT last Thursday.
France's main objective appears to be to safeguard its food - and
particularly cereals - exports, from Blair House's 21 per cent cut over six
years in the volume of subsidised exports. In addition, Paris will
eventually need to present to French farmers hostile to the accord what
looks like an extensive list of concessions.
The reformed Common Agricultural Policy aims - through big price and
production cuts - to get EC cereals prices down to world level by a 1997
target. If it succeeds, food could be exported without subsidy, and
therefore without reference to the Blair House restraints. Most of France's
demands are aimed at ensuring this target is met.
Politically, however, a strategy to boost competitiveness through price and
production cuts is not something Paris can easily sell to its farmers.
French negotiators will again, therefore, insist that nothing can be agreed
within the world trade negotiations which goes beyond the CAP reform.
The Commission for its part will underline that Blair House protects the CAP
from challenge by its trading partners. The full compensation to EC farmers
for the CAP price cuts are not treated by the deal as subsidies, and it also
contains a 'peace clause' through which signatories would refrain from
attacking each other's farm regimes.
France's robust stand will ensure every effort is made, particularly by its
traditional ally Germany, to try to find a solution. But Germany's own
demands, for further protection for its farmers against a rising D-Mark,
risks additional complications.
Until the August 2 decision to float EC currencies within 15 per cent
fluctuation bands of the exchange rate mechanism, every realignment since
1984 had pushed up farm prices to follow the movement of the strongest
currency. This was designed to protect German farmers, since the chief
revaluing currency was invariably the D-Mark. The German currency thereby
achieved a 'weighting' in the 'green' European currency unit which gives the
farm Ecu a value now 21 per cent greater than the market Ecu. With
realignments now off the agenda, because of the huge fluctuation bands set
on August 2, Bonn wants the mechanism restored to pacify its farmers.
This would require potentially large new EC budget outlays, when the farm
budget is aleady up against its mandatory ceiling. It would also tie French
farm competitiveness to a rising D-Mark, nullifying part of the CAP reform
price cuts, which freed French agriculture from prices set for German
productivity some 20 per cent lower than its own.
Speculation that Paris and Bonn will press jointly for each other's demands
therefore looks shaky, and the UK is leading other northern countries flatly
opposed to breaking the farm budget to satisfy the Germans and sweeten any
eventual Blair House deal for France.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Key senator urges return of Nafta to White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHAIRMAN of the key Senate Finance Committee, Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, yesterday said the North American Free Trade Agreement could be
returned by Congress to the White House for further negotiation, a move
which might effectively kill the pact.
'I am a free trader with free countries,' said Mr Moynihan, whose committee
has jurisdiction over all trade legislation. His reservations, expressed in
an interview on US television yesterday, indicate that the pact could be in
as much trouble in the Senate as in the House, where it is deeply unpopular.
Senator Moynihan is a long-time ally of the labour movement, which is
holding anti-Nafta rallies all over the country.
'The Mexican government is an authoritarian government,' he said. 'They
don't have an independent judiciary. They don't have free elections. They
have lots of laws which they enforce very selectively.'
This raised the question of how much the US should depend on Mexico's
institutions for enforcement of Nafta, he said.
In the hope of pacifying the labour movement, the Clinton administration
negotiated a side agreement to ensure enforcement of Mexico's progressive
labour laws. But the Mexican government refused to commit itself to easing
restrictions on labour unions.
American unions have made the defeat of Nafta their top priority. In the
current atmosphere of job insecurity the trade agreement threatens to become
as divisive an issue as any in recent memory.
Mr David Bergen, a senior presidential adviser, acknowledged Nafta would
lose if voted on today. But 'public opinion is very malleable,' he said.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Gloomy outlook for EC steel
</HEADLINE>

THE EUROPEAN Community's steel industry is benefiting from improved prices
and reduced imports from eastern Europe but is still in a 'precarious
situation,' according to a confidential European Commission report.
'No improvement or even stabilisation in steel demand can be expected in the
short term, nor is an improvement in the macroeconomic climate or in
steel-consuming sectors on the cards,' it says.
The 'working document' will be reviewed by EC industry ministers at their
meeting in Brussels tomorrow, according to Reuters.
The document provides a gloomy backdrop to the meeting, which will discuss
the progress of the Commission-backed plan to restructure the industry.
It confirms reports from the big steel producers, which say that demand for
steel is still falling in Germany, Europe's biggest market. The only big
market where steel demand is rising is the UK.
The Commission's document says a major deterioration in sales on the EC
market had only partly and temporarily been offset by an increase in
exports, especially to China.
It estimates that crude steel production in the EC will reach 125m tonnes in
1993, down about 10 per cent from 1991. 'The financial results of the
undertakings will therefore be disappointing and in many cases they will
make a loss in 1993,' it says.
However, prices are up about 10 per cent from the beginning of 1993, partly
because of reduced imports. Steel producers have argued that prices still
have to rise further to recoup falls of as much as 30 per cent since 1990.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Farmers make sure French government gets message

MR CLAUDE CARRE was yesterday back on his farm in Gatelles some 100km from
Paris, weary but satisfied.
He was weary after spending the past four days helping to orchestrate
Co-ordination Rurale's 'blockade' of the French capital. But he was
satisfied that although the campaign only resulted in marginal disruption -
'we never wanted to lay siege to Paris,' says Mr Carre - the French
government yesterday restated its threat to veto Europe's farm deal with the
US if European Community ministers meeting in Brussels today show no
willingness to revise the deal's terms.
If any one organisation is responsible for pushing France to the brink of a
veto, it is Co-ordination Rurale, says Mr Carre, who is the movement's
deputy secretary general. Formed in 1991 in protest at what it saw as the
passiveness of other French farm unions in opposing farm reform in the EC as
well as in Gatt, CR has spread its membership to 75 of France's 96
departments.
The government continues to give CR the cold shoulder, partly because of its
occasionally violent tactics and partly in deference to the mainstream FNSEA
union which fears CR eating away at its membership. For his part, Mr Carre
says the FNSEA is the government's lackey and the FNSEA's nationwide
demonstration, planned for today, will just be the equivalent of 'taking tea
with the local (government) prefect'.
Mr Carre is quite clear that, if France fails to get satisfaction from its
EC partners today, it should veto the so-called Blair House with the US. But
what if, as may well happen for reasons of Euro-procedure, there is no
motion to attach a veto to today? Mr Carre and many others in France are
puzzled by this possibility, having been led by their government to believe
that today's Brussels meeting was a showdown.
'If that happens, France should leave its EC chair empty,' Mr Carre
concludes.
Despite years of support from the unreformed Common Agricultural Policy his
village of Gatelles is now left with no shops and nine farms among a
population of 180. Yet, these broad wheatlands around Chartres are the
Kansas of Europe, and those who farm them ought to be Europe's best equipped
to compete with the most competitive in the rest of the world.
True, says Mr Carre, in the sense that the average wheat yield in his
department of Eure et Loir is 75 quintals a hectare. This is triple the
average US yield. But so, adds Mr Carre, are French investment in
fertiliser, interest rates and social welfare charges. 'We can't produce at
world prices, with French social charges,' he insists.
Taking out the accounts ledger of the 250 ha cereal spread he farms with his
two sons, Mr Carre estimates his charges for the coming year at around
FFr8,300 (Pounds 945) per hectare, for which he will probably get a return
of FFr6,000-6,500 per hectare (because of the EC's cereal price cut),
compared to FFr9,300 last year.
By far, the biggest charge - a total of FFr 488,000 - is what he will have
to pay Credit Agricole on his borrowings of around FFr5m.
He admits that if he and others in France's naturally-blessed wheat belt had
not long ago been enticed by high CAP support prices into heavy investment
and borrowing, they could have become less indebted, less intensive and
equally competitive farmers. But that would require running the film of
history backwards. 'It's a bit late for that,' says Mr Carre. And in the
meantime, France has become the world's second largest farm exporter, a
perch it does not want to lose.
