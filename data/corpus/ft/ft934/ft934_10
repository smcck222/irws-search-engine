FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (2): Controls are likely to be
tightened - Regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN

<TEXT>
It is one of the ironies of the UK Financial Services Act that the most
sweeping legislation in the industry's history should have overlooked one of
the riskiest businesses - custody.
The shock which struck the financial community when it realised the ease
with which the late Robert Maxwell stole more than Pounds 400m from pension
schemes he controlled has since been translated into a wide-ranging review
of how custody is treated.
Before the Maxwell affair, custody - the safe-keeping of securities on
behalf of investors - had been overlooked by regulators probably because it
had been an event-free activity. Not only had there never been any loss to
investors as a result of the failure of a custodian, but its activities are
little understood by the general public and regulators probably were unsure
even what questions they ought to be asking about safeguards.
Since then, the Securities and Investments Board has been goaded into
action. In August, it produced a 103-page Discussion Paper raising 65
separate questions about the matter, ranging from whether custody should be
an authorisable activity under the FSA to whether custodians should be
responsible for sub-custodians they appoint. It also asks what the role of
auditors should be and whether regulation of nominee companies should be
tightened.
Although the deadline for comment has passed, the SIB has yet to distil the
responses from the leading industry trade associations and market
participants before deciding how to proceed. Far from limiting itself to
some of the narrow risk matters raised by the Maxwell affair, the paper
leaves open the possibility of far-reaching changes to the custody business
in Britain - and, by extension, overseas.
The central issue addressed in the paper is whether those wishing to offer
custodial services should be required to seek specific authorisation to do
so - a move which would require an act of Parliament to amend the FSA.
Authorisation, the SIB notes, would require not only a set of rules but a
monitoring agency capable of ensuring that they were followed and imposing
penalties or ordering corrective action where they were not.
For its part, the SIB said in its paper that it was minded not to go down
that route. Privately, the Treasury has said it wishes to avoid re-writing
the FSA in connection with the more pressing matters of retail and wholesale
market regulation, and it is difficult to imagine it would willingly make an
exception for custody. SIB officials point out that most custody operations
are carried out by banks which are regulated by the Bank of England.
Non-bank custody operations are regulated usually as part of a firm
regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority. Thus, there is very
little of the custody business which escapes the regulatory net.
That point, however, has not sat comfortably with one of the leading trade
organisations, the Institutional Fund Managers Association. 'While most
custodians are regulated by the Bank of England, they are regulated with a
fairly light touch,' said Mr Julian Lefanu of IFMA. Moreover, he said, there
are some custodians whose activities fall between the two stools of banking
and financial services and 'it is the clients that need the comfort of
knowing that their assets are protected', he said.
If the pensions industry is to set up a compensation scheme with losses
through fraud or theft made up by a levy, pension schemes need to know that
any risk of loss through a custodian is minimised.
Another question the SIB raises is whether there should be minimum capital
adequacy requirements for custodians. Considering that every other aspect of
financial services - including the provision of nothing more than advice -
does carry such a requirement, it is surprising that the safe-keeping of
billions of pounds of other people's money does not.
IFMA takes the view that there is little point in setting 'position risk'
capital adequacy requirements for custodians. 'We would nevertheless support
a minimum capital threshold to ensure that the custodian has the standing to
carry out his duties,' Mr Lefanu said. That way, regulators may rest assured
that custodians have sufficient assets to invest in appropriate record
keeping and information systems to ensure that the job is done properly.
Without minimum investment, even a well meaning and otherwise honest
custodian may inadvertently cause losses to a client by, say, failing to
collect or credit dividends.
But perhaps the most sensitive question raised by the SIB focuses on
custodians and the sub-custodians they appoint. Should a custodian be liable
for losses of his sub-custodian, and if so, how?
Mr Ross Whitehill, vice-president at Morgan Stanley, argues that requiring
such a measure is absurd and impossible for any leading custodian to meet in
any event. First, if the securities are in the name of the client or his
nominee, there is no way any other entity could lay claim to them in the
event of the sub-custodian's bankruptcy. The only risk relates to cash
assets. But in the case of Morgan Stanley, which may have Dollars 55bn in
cash assets with sub-custodians at any one time, how would the bank reflect
its 'guarantee' of those assets? Such a charge well exceeds all Morgan
Stanley's existing capital and could not appear as a charge on its balance
sheet.
That view is widespread in the custodial industry which has reacted with
some alarm to the suggestion in the SIB paper.
Instead, Mr Whitehill argues, the answer is to improve the drafting of
sub-custodial agreements. Morgan Stanley asks its sub-contractors to
guarantee them against wilful mismanagement, non-performance or negligence.
In the event of such activities, Morgan Stanley will make its own clients
whole and seek to recover from the sub-custodian.
'Increasingly, clients do ask for some protection,' he said. Morgan Stanley
carries out six-monthly reviews of all its sub-custodial arrangements to
reassure itself of the safety of its clients' money.
Only through that sort of vigilence, custodians say, can clients be sure
that their assets are safe in a sub-custodian's hands.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (3): Goode ideas lacking - Pension
Funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many custodian banks in the UK were disappointed by the Goode Committee,
which released its report, Pension Law Reform, at the end of September.
Hopes of a flood of new business for independent custodians were dashed.
The Goode Committee, after all, had been appointed to investigate the
appropriate legislative responses to the Pounds 400m raid by Mr Robert
Maxwell on his various group pension schemes, especially that of Mirror
Group Newspapers. One obvious possible recommendation was that assets should
be placed in the care of truly independent custodians who would be charged
with protecting them against all fraudsters, even those who were renegade
company bosses or trustees.
This kind of set-up is the practice in the US under the Erisa legislation.
There is usually a master trustee which has custody of the assets and deals
with a variety of separate investment managers.
In the UK, however, there has been no requirement for separate custody at
all. Trustees can hold the assets directly if they wish. In practice it has
been more common for external investment managers to maintain their own
in-house custody arrangements so that Mercury Asset Management, for
instance, the market leader, will as a matter of course use its parent bank
SG Warburg as its custodian, while Phillips and Drew Fund Management has its
own custody offshoot.
Naturally the Maxwell scandals raised awkward questions about the security
of custody arrangements and many pension funds initiated investigations into
their own situation. For example, Fleming Investment Management says that,
since the Maxwell crisis broke more than 50 of its pension scheme clients
have inspected the custody set-up, which uses the facilities of the parent
bank Robert Fleming. Some clients sent trustees and others sent their
auditors.
But when the Goode Committee looked into the pros and cons of independent
custody it decided that this was a blind alley. One crucial characteristic
of pension funds, it considered, was that assets were always being changed.
'To deposit securities and other assets with a custodian is not like locking
them away in a box to be opened years later when a distribution comes to be
made,' the report asserted. There is a constant flow of instructions in
connection with securities transactions, and moreover schemes may be
involved in stock lending as a matter of routine.
As things stand, custodians are not expected to question the propriety of
instructions so long as they appear to be in order. If fraud is committed by
individuals or a group of people acting within the scope of their apparent
authority, the fact that assets are held by a custodian will not by itself
be a decisive point.
The committee accepted that the intermediation of a custodian may confer
some additional degree of security, but not enough to justify the expense
and complication of imposing a compulsory custodial role. 'Indeed, there is
a danger that the use of custodians may well give the semblance of
protection without the reality,' said the report.
Instead, the Goode Committee confined itself to some lesser observations. It
did suggest, for instance, that trustees had a duty to review their custody
arrangements periodically and satisfy themselves that they were
satisfactory.
The report also discussed the question of the authorisation of custodians.
Oddly, custodians are not necessarily regulated in the UK at present,
although they may be subsidiary operations of businesses which are
regulated, such as banks or investment managers.
In practice, many custodians are therefore subjected to indirect regulation
through the Bank of England, which issues guidance notes on custody to
banks, or through the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, which
imposes detailed rules on regulated fund managers.
At the moment the Securities and Investments Board, the top investment
regulator, which usually delegates through Imro in the area of professional
investment management, is in the process of a formal review of custodians,
including the question of whether they should all be directly authorised.
In the meantime it seems likely the normal UK practice will continue, namely
that most pension fund investment managers are responsible for their own
custody arrangements.
Although the big US custodian banks such as State Street, Chase Manhattan
and Bankers Trust have been making a push for business in the UK, the
structure of the pension fund investment business does not favour the
domination that the independent custodians have achieved in the US.
There, pension plans typically employ a large number - often more than a
dozen - of specialist managers which are often quite small. The role of a
central (or master) custodian is therefore quite important.
In the UK it is still quite rare for pension schemes to have more than about
four managers: most have only one or two. A separate custodian therefore
represents an extra cost and, possibly, extra complexity. This is especially
true because the biggest fund managers have their own proprietary back
office systems, which may not easily link with those of independent
custodians, and moreover they bundle up custody fees with the normal
portfolio management charges.
According to Mr Michael Robarts, director in charge of administration at
Fleming, his firm is willing to deal with outside custodians if the client
desires it. But, he says, 'there will be no reduction in fee'. This is
because of the extra cost involved in adjusting to cope with different
systems.
In the wake of the Goode Report, therefore, it looks as though the idea that
independent custodians might provide an easy answer to the security problem
has been rejected. Any improvements may have to come from closer control of
the way in which instructions are transmitted.
In the circumstances, some in the pensions industry are disappointed that
neither the Goode Committee nor Imro has yet developed ideas in this area.
The aim would be to formalise such questions as signing authority.
Perhaps this would not prevent determined fraudsters, but at least it would
be easier to allocate blame for any losses, and perhaps that might make
those receiving instructions that much more vigilant.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (4): Merged banks branch out -
Profile: ABN AMRO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global custody is a prime example of the synergy that was waiting to be
exploited when the Netherlands's two biggest banks merged in 1990 to create
ABN AMRO, Europe's sixth-largest banking group.
Although both were active in global custody for years before their link-up,
Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank (AMRO) had
distinct and separate strengths.
For example, AMRO brought to the merged group a two-way communications
system for institutional investor clients who are not part of the Swift
network. Today, the legacy of this contribution is reflected by the fact
that ABN AMRO's system is still called 'AMROSS-pc'.
ABN, by contrast, had a far more extensive network of international branches
and offices, including a large presence in the US centred on Chicago and the
La Salle group of banks.
'The merger brought us the benefits of synergy and a bigger base on which to
build our global custody business,' says Mr Ruud van der Horst, executive
vice-president of investment banking and global clients.
Since the merger, ABN AMRO's global custody business has shown sharp rates
of annual increase. Around the time of the merger in late 1990, assets in
custody totalled Fl 194bn (Dollars 102bn). By the end of 1992, that figure
had risen by 36 per cent to Fl 264bn.
Part of this growth is simply a reflection of the rise in world stock
markets, but part of the increase reflects the expansion of ABN AMRO's
client base in global custody.
The bank's bolstered position in custody is due to two factors, according to
Mr Fred Berghout, senior vice-president of global securities services.
On the one hand, the Netherlands has a disproportionately large group of
institutional investors, reflecting the country's propensity for collective
savings through pension funds, pension schemes and insurance companies. 'On
the other hand, the strong Dutch guilder is attracting foreign investors
into guilder investments,' he says.
ABN AMRO plans to use this base to expand its global custody business, but
Mr Berghout emphasises that the bank intends to pursue steady, gradual
growth. The bank will not move into a geographic market until it can provide
proper back-up. At the same time, its expansion of global custody will be
integrated with growth of related services such as asset management, private
banking and foreign exchange, a strategy which Mr Berghout describes as
sending in the 'infantry' and 'cavalry' simultaneously.
ABN AMRO is already well-established in Switzerland and France. Top
priorities for further expansion are the world's leading capital markets,
especially the US and Canada, the UK and Japan.
Additional expansion in the US will be eased by the fact that ABN AMRO is
among the largest and most successful foreign banks in the country, thanks
to a series of acquisitions in and around Chicago since the late 1970s.
In the UK, which accounts for 45 per cent of Europe's market for
institutional investors, ABN AMRO's plans for growth are centred on Hoare
Govett, the British stockbroker acquired from Security Pacific last year.
Besides global custody, Hoare Govett is also central to ABN AMRO's European
ambitions in the entire sphere of international equities, including trading,
corporate finance and equities research.
Mr van der Horst says ABN AMRO is still doing its 'homework' on the UK
market, and a concerted push is not expected before 1995.
The core of ABN AMRO's global custody clients are Dutch institutions such as
pension funds. Many of the country's rich pension funds have said recently
that they would like to step up their purchases of foreign shares, auguring
well for ABN AMRO, which easily leads the global custody market in the
Netherlands.
The bank has sub-custodians in nearly 45 countries, of which nearly one
third are ABN AMRO branches. Like other custodians, ABN AMRO is trying to
step up the coverage of its network in emerging markets.
Dutch pension funds, with a reputation for prudent management and risk
avoidance, are not likely to become swift converts to the new-found
enthusiasm in the investment world for the emerging markets of developing
countries.
'Our expansion in the US is leading us to markets with higher settlement
risks such as the more 'exotic' investment countries in Latin America and
the Far East,' Mr Berghout says, noting that US investors are showing an
interest in these regions.
Though careful in their choice of investments, Dutch institutions are also
becoming more critical of their own performance and seeking higher returns.
This opens up opportunities for selling related services.
Mr van der Horst says that until five or six years ago, securities lending
was something which domestic institutions considered simply 'not done'. That
perception is changing, though growth in securities lending among Dutch
institutions is still well below that of US institutional investors.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (1): A period of adjustment -
Growing competition and increasing client sophistication are placing a
greater burden upon the profitability of custodial services. But changes in
investment patterns are opening up new opportunities for perceptive
custodians

There was a time, within recent memory, when no self-respecting
international banker would have listed global custody as an integral part of
his long-range business strategy.
In 1993, it is difficult to find one who does not, and the glut of services
available to customers world-wide is leading to price competition so intense
that leading bankers are beginning privately to ask why they wished to
pursue the business in the first place.
'In spite of predictions that no new participants would come into the
market, new and rejuvenated ones have done so, and this means that margins
are shrinking,' Ms Jean Pelligrini, vice-president and head of sales at JP
Morgan's securities and trust information services division, says. 'This is
good for the customer but bad for the industry.'
Mr Michael Borkan, vice-president at Bank of New York's global custody
operations, believes the business is passing through a period of flux. 'As
some competitors drop out of the race, others are stepping in to expand the
ranks of global custodians. Those that are leaving have found the technology
costs too expensive, while those that are entering believe the enticing fees
obtainable from global custody offset the expense of state-of-the-art
systems.'
In the UK, non-bank institutions, particularly Morgan Grenfell and S G
Warburg, have begun to compete aggressively for the custody mandates of
investors who are not their own fund management clients. Mr Gordon Lindsey,
head of securities services at S G Warburg, says that in addition to the
Dollars 80bn of assets managed by Mercury Asset Management - the fund
manager 75 per cent owned by Warburg - Pounds 2bn is now that of independent
clients.
Throughout Europe, new entities are bidding for the traditional custody
business of banks. Among these are multinational companies, such as
Euroclear, Cedel and Reuters, all of which already have significant
securities processing capabilities.
Broadly. global custody encompasses the securities transactions processing
activities of investors of all types around the world. It includes not only
the basic master trust business in which securities are held for
safekeeping, but far more sophisticated information and record-keeping
services as well. In recent years, too, global custodians have found ways to
expand the services they offer clients to include foreign exchange, cash
management, handling of corporate actions, dividend repatriation, and other
services requiring sophisticated information systems.
Dramatic changes in the investment patterns of leading institutional
investors have created new demands - and new business opportunities - for
those custodians shrewd enough to see the new trends emerging, and large
enough to have cash to invest in systems capable of servicing them. Central
to these trends is the growing internationalisation of investment.
According to InterSec Research Corp, a London-based research group
specialising in pension fund analysis, in the first six months of 1993 there
was a minor tidal wave of US pension fund money seeking a home abroad.
InterSec, in a piece of unpublished research, concluded that the total
market value of US tax-exempt assets with international and global mandates
rose nearly Dollars 50bn in the first half of 1993 to almost Dollars 200bn.
In 1992, by contrast, overseas assets of US institutions rose by Dollars
30bn. Moreover, the study found that there has been nearly an additional
Dollars 2bn invested in equities in so-called emerging markets.
It is this latter trend which has been exciting global custodians who see
the opportunity to exploit their banking presence in some of the world's
more arcane markets into a new business. Indeed, the emerging markets sector
offers global custodians some of the widest margins available, not only on
master custody but on foreign exchange and cash management services.
Also, global investors are becoming far more adept in their use of
derivatives, with regulators in highly developed markets in the US and
Europe increasingly giving the nod to their use for retail products. Mutual
funds in the US and insurance contracts in the UK could well find
derivatives a mainstream investment tool, with bespoke hedging products such
as swaps, caps, collars and equity derivatives creating new demands upon
custodians.
Meanwhile, other regulatory changes - the product of a growing desire by
banking authorities to minimise systemic risk - are exerting new demands
upon custodians. Mr Borkan notes that the US Federal Reserve Bank plans to
eliminate the so-called daylight overdrafts which have effectively exposed
counterparties to several hours, during which funds have been expended by a
custodian upon a customer's instruction, even though the funds have not been
received from him.
How custodians will respond to the end of this free float remains to be
seen, but it is indicative of the constant demands for improvements in
systems technology which custodians are called upon to implement.
The scale of investment necessary to stay abreast of regulatory and market
changes is unclear, but Mr Robert Binney, business executive at Chase
Manhattan's Global Securities Services, estimates that his bank spends
roughly Dollars 40m per year updating its technology.
But, while client needs are becoming more sophisticated, so is client
awareness of the pricing of the custody product. Mr Ross Whitehill,
vice-president in charge or Morgan Stanley's European custody businesses,
says the basic master custody service has been reduced to a commodity
product, and it is simply not worth his firm's efforts to pursue clients
with few other requirements.
While that service commanded 20 to 25 basis points in fees as recently as
six years ago, banks can no longer charge more than five basis points, and,
depending on what other services the client wants, can be had in some
instances for as little as two basis points.
Partly prompted by the role of US pension fund consultants, leading
institutional investors are taking a close look at the cost components of
their custody charges. The net effect has been a move to unbundle services,
spinning out some of those such as foreign exchange which have proved the
most profitable elements of a custodian's business.
Indeed, a survey last year by management consultants, Booz Allen, found that
no more than 50 to 60 per cent of a custodian's revenues are to be earned in
the headline fee. The remainder comes from forex dealing, cash balances,
stock lending and other services where only a portion of the profits to be
made are passed on to the customer.
In the UK, the National Association of Pension Funds earlier this year
issued a study on fee transparency which highlighted custody fees as those
which are among the most opaque to pension fund clients. Growing concern
among trustees about fees has stimulated the role of the UK pension
consultants who see fertile ground in developing their own custody advisory
services.
'Unbundling is a trend driven by best practice,' according to Mr Binney. 'If
there is a small foreign exchange transaction, say in an emerging market,
the client may regard it as a nuisance deal and be prepared to pay a fee.
But if it is a larger deal, say Dollars 50,000 or more, it is up to the
client to try to get the best forex quote he can.'
Growing competition and increasing client sophistication are clearly placing
an increasing burden upon the profitability of custodial services.
At the same time, rapid changes in investment patterns are opening up new
opportunities for those custodians quick enough to seize the advantage - and
who have the resources to invest in building the kind of systems customers
badly need.

FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property stocks were at the vanguard of the market's surge as new industry
statistics underlined the sector's recent strong performance.
Investment valuations for November in a survey by Richard Ellis, the
property agency, show a rise of 15.6 per cent on a year ago and also the
highest month-on-month increase from October since the index began 13 years
ago.
Land Securities hit a record high, jumping 16 to 783p, MEPC advanced 14 to
560p and British Land, reporting interims today, climbed 6 to 444p.
Conglomerate Hanson gained 6 at 266 1/2 p on news that the US miners unions
had struck a tentative deal following a six-month strike against members of
the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, which represents leading US coal
companies. The strike hit Hanson's Peabody and Eastern Associated
subsidiaries.
Dealers in the banks sector were by no means surprised at the latest
attempts by some marketmakers to push through a widening of spreads in the
sector. Some traders attempted to widen the previous 5p spread between
buying and selling prices in the leading banks to 7p, but the move was
resisted by three of the biggest traders in the sector, SG Warburg, UBS and
Kleinwort Benson. Attempts by some marketmakers to widen dealing spreads in
banks were first made last Friday.
The big UK institutions were said to have refused to deal at the wider
spreads, which reverted to 5p within an hour of the opening. Some
marketmakers have come under increasing pressure in the sector, which has
been among the market's best performing areas this year as provisions
against bad debts have begun to shrink and low interest rates have reduced
lending risks for the banks.
Profits are set to surge ahead, as are dividends, as shown by the recent
profits surge and 25 per cent dividend increase announced by Royal Bank of
Scotland, 6 up at 452p.
The big squeeze in bank shares continued yesterday as marketmakers again bid
prices higher to try to balance their trading books. All of the high street
banks set all-time highs, Abbey National advancing 20 to 480p, TSB 6 to
241p, Barclays 16 to 642p, HSBC 15 to 803p, Lloyds 8 to 654p and National
Westminster 16 to 615p.
Talk that Mr David Michels, chief executive at Stakis, could be linked to a
top job at Ladbroke was said to be one reason for Stakis shares slipping
yesterday.
Analysts said Mr Michels' support of Ladbroke's Hilton hotels arm at a court
case in the US had prompted the speculation. Stakis, which finished 3 adrift
at 59p, was also affected by newspaper reports of property valuations in the
hotel industry. Ladbroke added 6 1/2 at 152p.
Media conglomerate Pearson rose 20 to 595p on hopes that the pricing of
Camco International, its US oil services subsidiary, a majority interest of
which is due to be floated in the US soon, was going well. Analysts said
there were further potential gains from a successful conclusion of the Gatt
world trade talks, particularly in the international copyright. Gatt hopes
also helped Reed International, up 18 at 823p.

FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: CU in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some large composite insurers, always boosted by big share price rises,
which increase the composites' solvency ratios, were further influenced by a
Hoare Govett note on the UK private motor market which favoured Commercial
Union.
CU shares moved ahead 14 to 629p after Hoare told its clients that within
the next three years one of the composites will be compelled to withdraw
from the private UK motor market. Hoare analysts plump for Sun Alliance and,
to a lesser extent, Guardian Royal Exchange. They expect a similar fate to
befall at least one other general insurer.
Hoare said CU has the best UK motor insurance portfolio in the sector and
'will prosper more than in the past'. The broker adopted an increasingly
bearish stance on Sun Alliance, however, telling clients to switch from Sun,
and GRE, into CU. Hoare's recommendation left Sun Alliance one of only a
handful of Footsie stocks to lose ground, finishing 2 lighter at 367p.

FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Textiles suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Courtaulds Textiles, one of the UK's leading textiles companies, saw its
shares plunge 63p in pre-market trading after the company issued a stark
profits warning.
The company said poor trading in Europe would ensure that 1993 profits would
not improve on last year's figure. Analysts cut their forecasts, with BZW
coming down from Pounds 45m to Pounds 37m and SG Warburg now looking for
Pounds 38m.
Mr Laurence Rubin, Warburg's textiles analyst, said: 'I think the company
underestimated the strength of recovery, particularly in France. Another
analyst said: 'This was very bad news and a major surprise. I think the
stock market has reacted quite correctly.' The shares ended the day 54 lower
at 489p.
Rival Coats Viyella fell initially, but it has said Courtaulds Textiles'
problems are specific to the group rather than the industry and the share
price recovered to end a penny firmer at 274p.
However, William Baird fell 15 on the day to close at 242p, while Marks and
Spencer, one of the leading sellers of Courtaulds Textiles' produce, lost 2
1/2 to 451 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 10m shares.

FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Erratic session in Rank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rollercoaster ride in Rank Organisation saw the shares jump wildly
yesterday in response to contrasting reports. The stock opened brightly,
spurred by a heavyweight buy note from Kleinwort Benson which stressed the
group's long term recovery potential and its balance of profit centres.
After jumping some 15p, the bears were alerted by press reports that Xerox,
which co-owns the Rank Xerox subsidiary, had settled a court case in the US
at a cost of Dollars 225m. There was further bad news as Xerox announced
later in the session a Dollars 700m restructuring charge for its fourth
quarter.
However, with little guidance said to be forthcoming from Rank, London
leisure analysts were unsure how much of this would impact on the UK group's
profits, although suggestions of a Pounds 60m hit were being talked down
last night. Having been 20 off at one stage, the stock rallied with the
market and further consideration of the Xerox news to close 10 ahead at 914p
in busy turnover of 2.8m.

FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The December futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index powered ahead yesterday
to approach 3,300 and widen its lead over the underlying equity market,
writes Peter John.
Derivatives rose rapidly after a Pounds 3bn gilts auction exceeded all
expectations and marketmakers fought to cover exposed dealing positions.
Institutions were desperate to buy stocks with yield potential, such as
bank, insurance and utility issues. The marketmakers who sold them were
unable to cover themselves in the equity market and sought solace through
the futures.
That buying pushed the premium to a high of 20 points against an estimated
fair value which, on some valuations, is at a discount to the cash market.
December hit a peak of 3,297 before closing at 3,291, and then strengthened
further in after-hours' trading. Closing volume was high at 16,253 lots.
However, traders were beginning to get nervous, seeing the sharp rise as a
squeeze which could easily turn round and catch the market out. 'There could
be a hell of an opportunity to make profits on the downside - it is just a
question of timing,' said one.
With only seven trading days until the expiry of the December contract,
there is also growing concern over the very high level of open interest, the
number of existing long and short positions. Open interest has to reach zero
by expiry next Friday, and at the close of dealing yesterday it stood around
49,000.
Traded options volume recovered to a healthy 41,535 lots, against 29,697 on
Tuesday. Hanson topped the list of stock options at 2,467.

FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gilts auction boosts equities to new
peak levels - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional buyers flooded back into the London equity market yesterday,
driving the FT-SE 100 Index ahead by just over 40 points to an all-time
closing high. Tumbling bond yields, following the successful outcome of the
auction of Pounds 3bn worth of government securities, provided a fresh boost
to the argument for buying UK equities, and London also joined in the rise
in European bourses that reflected hopes that the Uruguay Round of trade
talks are close to accord.
The Footsie ended at 3,277.4, a gain of 40.1 points, having touched a new
intraday peak of 3,279.5. The lead came, once again, from the stock index
futures, where the December contract challenged the 3,300 mark as both
marketmakers and investors struggled to position themselves ahead of a
fast-rising stock market.
Confidence that UK base rates will be cut again very soon strengthened
following the gilt-edged auction, and was fuelled by similar expectations
across Europe. Traders said that buying of UK equities came from across the
range of global investment centres, and also from domestic funds. One dealer
estimated buying orders to selling orders at 10 to one over the past week.
The stock market closed on a note of optimism as sterling improved and there
were reports that the Governor of the Bank of England had expressed optimism
on prospects for base rates and for domestic inflation.
The rush of buyers increased the pressures on London marketmakers, already
very short of stock in both equity and futures markets. For most of the
session, the futures contract was at a premium of more than 20 points
against, a highly unusual development when the contract has only a short
time left to run.
The most powerful advance came in bank share prices as renewed optimism on
the dividend outlook buttressed views that falling interest rates will work
wonders for loan books. The rest of the financial sector was also in strong
form, as were property stocks. Utility stocks also performed strongly on
expectations of dividend growth.
Store and consumer issues, however, traded less aggressively since base rate
hopes have already been taken into prices.
Blue chip internationals were firmer, with the exception of the oil majors
which struggled to hold on to early gains against the background of
disappointing crude oil prices.
Demand across the full range of the market brought a further advance in the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed 21.9 up at a new peak of 3,589.9. Seaq
volume jumped from 689.7m shares on Tuesday to 821.4m yesterday; on the
session following the Budget Speech, Seaq volume totalled more than 1.2bn
shares. High levels of retail, or customer, business have continued this
week, bringing a value figure of Pounds 1.44bn for Tuesday's session.
Traders identified renewed demand for UK equities by some of the large New
York investment banks and securities houses, which had appeared to back away
slightly from London since the turn of the month.
The following changes to the FT-SE 100 Share Index have been approved by the
FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee. For inclusion; Eastern Electricity,
Scottish Hydro-Electric. For exclusion; Northern Foods, NFC. Details on UK

FT  09 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): New Dow high on selective
late demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks finished on a mixed note yesterday, but blue chip issues followed
Tuesday's record-setting performance with an impressive encore, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 15.65 stronger at
3,734.53, beating the short-lived high of 3,718.88. But the more broadly
based Stan-dard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 0.47 to 466.29. The American SE
composite was up 1.47 at 468.87 but the Nasdaq composite lost 1.46 at
767.89. NYSE volume was heavy at 314.4m shares.
Equities limped through the morning with little sense of direction ahead of
today's producer price data. Tuesday's record closing high could not dispel
the flat mood, nor could the stagnant US Treasury market, where bonds across
the maturity range trod water in relaxed anticipation of Thursday's
inflation data. In late trading the benchmark 30-year issue was barely
higher at 101 5/32 , amid expectations of a modest 0.2 per cent increase in
last month's wholesale prices.
The day's only new economic data, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book summary
of regional conditions, only served to reinforce the impression of strong
growth and low inflation suggested by last week's stream of statistics.
The Dow briefly touched negative territory in the early afternoon, before
spurting ahead in a late burst of buying in a handful of pivotal stocks.
Among the contributing issues, JP Morgan, the US securities house, added
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 72 3/4 after raising its dividend. Eastman Kodak
was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 62 1/2 and Aluminum Co of America gained
Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 72 1/2 .
Airlines were again among the most active stocks. Continental's 'B' stock
was marked down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 after an offering of 7m new
shares at Dollars 20 each.
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, edged ahead Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 150
5/8 on reports of progress in negotiations over a move by its unions to
acquire 60 per cent of the company.
With Comex gold prices on the rise, mining issues were in play. Placer Dome
rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 24 1/2 , while American Barrick climbed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 28 1/8 . On the Amex, Pegasus Gold advanced Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 22 1/2 and Echo Bay Mines was Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars
13 5/8 .
An announcement by Xerox that it would cut about 10 per cent of its
97,500-strong workforce sent the stock Dollars 5 1/4 higher to Dollars 86.
Marriott International added Dollars 2 at Dollars 27 after Wertheim Schroder
upgraded its rating from 'neutral' to 'buy'.
Canada
Toronto finished at a record peak in active trading, boosted by strong gains
among gold and other mining stocks.
The TSE 300 index climbed 42.2 to 4,307.7. Rises led falls by 492 to 336
after volume of 79.1m shares. The golds index jumped 4.9 per cent as the
spot gold price rose USDollars 6.20 an ounce in New York.

FT  09 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Year-end rally resumes in
Frankfurt and Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a successful outcome to the Gatt talks gave senior bourses the
excuse to resume their year-end rally, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was lifted at the outset by the Gatt prospect, and climbed further
on institutional buying. German stock market turnover rose from DM7.6bn to
DM10.4bn as the DAX index closed the official session 32.67, or 1.5 per cent
higher at a new all-time high of 2,148.13.
In the afternoon, dealers and investors seemed to have the bit between their
teeth, and some big speculative positions were taken, some of them in large
companies, as the Ibis indicated DAX put on another 17.82 to 2,165.95 for an
overall gain of 1.8 per cent since the previous post-bourse close.
Big blue chips were in the frame, Siemens rising DM11.90 to DM737.40 on
optimism about the transrapid electromagnetic train project, and hitting
DM746 in the afternoon; Thyssen moved from DM242.50, through DM245.90 to
DM251 on similar grounds.
Telecoms prospects also got excited, Veba touching DM495, up DM14.80 from
the previous day's close on plans to go deeper into the industry, and
Mannesmann rising DM14.40 to DM386.90 overall.
However, profit-taking hit AEG before the sale of its household appliances
unit to Electrolux was confirmed, and the shares fell DM7.90 to DM178.
PARIS strengthened solidly, some analysts giving credit to the the Gatt
talks. The CAC-40 index advanced 29.19 or 1.3 per cent top 2,205.31.
Turnover was good at an estimated FFr4.5bn.
The solid performance of the bond market also contributed to the day's
positive outlook.
However, a different picture emerged from two new indices which were
launched yesterday, the SBF 120 and the SBF 250, both of which showed slight
declines on the day, the former closing at 1,494.20 and the latter at
1,429.34.
The new indices, compiled by the Societe des Bourses Francaises, are
computed at present only for the market's opening and closing, although the
SBF 120, comprising some 80 per cent of the market's capitalisation compared
to the CAC's 56 per cent, will become continuous from March 1994.
Among the day's gains, Generale des Eaux put on FFr97 to FFr2,728 after a US
broker was reported to have reiterated its buy recommendation.
ZURICH returned to its record-setting ways after Tuesday's consolidation as
strength in the franc prompted speculation that the Swiss National Bank
would act shortly to cut the discount rate, perhaps as soon as this Friday
when it maps out strategy for the next 12 months.
The SMI index rose 9.0 to an all-time high of 2,843.8, after an intraday
peak of 2,854.7.
Registered shares in Sandoz, a recent laggard, rose SFr85 to SFr3,935 for a
cumulative three day rise of 4.7 per cent. The shares were supported by a
warrant issue and hopes of higher sales in Japan. News that Sandoz had sold
a subsidiary of its chemicals division was welcomed by analysts as evidence
that the group planned to concentrate on the higher margin biological side
of its business.
A SFr24, or 3.1 per cent jump in Swissair to SFr794 was attributed to its
latest traffic figures. SMH shed SFr16 to SFr1,038 after a bank noted that
sales of Swiss plastic watches was slowing.
AMSTERDAM built solidly on its early gains, although analysts remained
largely mystified by rises in certain stocks, including Heineken, up Fl 4.20
at Fl 212.10.
The CBS Tendency index rose 1.0 to 140.8 in turnover estimated at Fl 1.4bn.
Other underperformers in the market also put on a good showing, with DSM
rising Fl 4.10 to Fl 106.40 and Akzo Fl 1.30 to Fl 184.90.
STOCKHOLM was mixed with Ericsson B shares SKr8 lower at SKr356 as US
investors became sellers of the stock for the second time in recent weeks.
The Affarsvarlden index picked up 2.4 to 1,359.2. Volvo's B added SKr14 to
SKr475 on renewed foreign demand while the Trelleborg firmed SKr2.50 to
SKr73, attracting interest on rising metals prices.
BRUSSELS saw a late burst of Bel-20 basket-buying take equities to a
slightly higher finish, the Bel-20 closing 3.32 higher at 1,433.77, with
turnover a solid BFr2.2bn.
ISTANBUL picked up 3.2 per cent as bargain hunters returned after Tuesday's
3.6 per cent fall. The composite index added 553.6 to 17,935.6.

FT  09 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2.3% as
political, economic worries grow

Increasing worries over the political and economic outlook left share prices
substantially lower on the day. But they closed well above their worst after
comments by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, indicating
concern over the recent drop in share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225-issue average fell by 2.3 per cent after fluctuating in
technical trading, finishing 395.54 down at 16,507.95, and the Topix index
of all first section stocks weakened 24.07, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,396.54.
The Nikkei looked steady at the opening, registering the day's best level of
16,892.59. It plunged later on arbitrage unwinding ahead of tomorrow's
settlements of December futures and options contracts, hitting a low of
16,216.82.
Index-linked buying towards the end of the session, prompted by rumours of
an imminent discount rate cut and Mr Hosokawa's comment that Japan must take
every possible step to help stock prices, lifted equities, helping the
Nikkei to recoup some of its loss; and in London, later, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index rose 8.80 to 1,145.79.
Volume totalled 270m shares, against 217m. Declines led rises by 831 to 190,
with 137 issues remaining unchanged.
Fears over the delay in the announcement of economic stimulus discouraged
investors. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y19,000 to Y685,000 and East
Japan Railway slipped Y9,000 to Y413,000. Other railway shares were also
weak, with Keisei Electric Railway down Y13 to Y788.
Bank shares were lower on index selling. Industrial Bank of Japan retreated
Y80 to Y2,780 and Fuji Bank lost Y70 at Y1,820. However, Hokkaido Takushoku
Bank gained Y2 at Y482 on bargain hunting. The bank, a main creditor of
Kabuto Decom, a property developer, has met heavy selling recently on the
arrest of the president of the company.
Steel issues lost ground on profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the most active
issue of the day, receded Y8 to Y296 and Kawasaki Steel shed Y7 to Y299.
High-technology blue chips were also weak, with Matsushita Electric
Industrial down Y20 to Y1,410 and Toshiba dipping Y5 to Y641.
Reports that Eisai, a pharmaceutical maker, will conduct final clinical
tests for a cure for Alzheimer's disease pushed the stock up Y30 to Y1,790.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 371.58 to 18,334.21 in volume of 24.4m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, relinquished Y140 at Y6,360.
Roundup
Records continued to be set in the Pacific Rim markets, although
profit-taking also emerged.
HONG KONG ended marginally higher after a day of see-saw trading in which
the Hang Seng index clawed its way back from an early 91-point loss as
investors await the results of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group meeting
which ends today.
The index closed 13.66 higher at a record 9,750.23, after rising a
cumulative 442 points in the previous two days. Turnover fell to HKDollars
6.46bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 9.76bn.
MANILA remained at a record high, fuelled by an overnight rise by PLDT on
Wall Street, but profit-taking pared some of the early gains. The composite
index closed a net 9.92 ahead at 2,518.92 after posting a 46-point gain
within the first 30 minutes of trading.
PLDT advanced 25 pesos to 1,875 pesos, mirroring a Dollars 2 3/8 rise to
Dollars 64 7/8 in New York.
AUSTRALIA moved sharply forward in response to strong commodity prices
coupled with heavy demand for News Corp. The All Ordinaries index added 22.1
at 2,096.0.
SEOUL rebounded strongly after Tuesday's correction. The composite stock
index moved up 13.54 points to 836.71 in heavy turnover of Won1,100bn.
BOMBAY saw hectic buying by foreign investors and speculators in market
leaders push the local index beyond the 3,300-point mark to a new 1993 high,
although profit-taking in kerb deals left prices off their best levels. The
BSE 30 index ended 78.53, or 2.4 per cent, ahead at 3,310.24.
Cadbury India, a 51 per cent-owned subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, of the
UK, rose Rs35, or 12.1 per cent, to Rs325 amid market rumours that Jardine
Fleming plans to buy heavily into the company.
KARACHI broke records amid heavy buying of blue chips as brokers injected a
backlog of orders into the market after two local holidays. The KSE 100
index soared 62.57, or 3.5 per cent, to 1,853.45 in volume of 4.6m.
The rise is attributed to continuing confidence that the government of Ms
Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, has brought badly needed political
stability, writes Farhan Bokhari in Faisalabad. In addition, some companies
involved in the manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, as well as
those in the financial sector, are expected to reveal higher profits than
last year when they announce their results next month.
NEW ZEALAND finished a moderately active session higher amid strong foreign
demand for forestry shares. The NZSE-40 capital index put on 9.69 at
2,097.26.
TAIWAN edged ahead in heavy, volatile trade, and the weighted index firmed
8.51 to 4,692.11 in TDollars 50.52bn turnover.
SINGAPORE gave way to profit-taking in blue chips after Tuesday's record
close, and the Straits Times Industrial index dipped 4.33 to 2,159.21.
KUALA LUMPUR closed easier as profit-taking erased early gains. The
composite index lost 2.46 at 1,060.79, ending a six-day rising streak which
saw the index add 91.15.
BANGKOK edged lower on profit-taking in bank shares in active trade. The SET
index softened 5.64 to 1,436.92 in heavy turnover of Bt23.44bn.

FT  09 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets trend set to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If 1993's explosion of international interest is anything to go by, there is
no reason why next year should not continue the trend of rapid growth in
many of the world's emerging markets.
At a presentation by Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets in London last
week the group's chief investment officer, Mr Arnab Banerji, forecast that
emerging markets were expected to grow faster economically than the OECD for
the foreseeable future.
Baring Securities, in a forward looking strategy document, underlines this
point, noting that 'while the rich industrial countries struggle to achieve
sub-2 per cent real growth rates, the emerging economies regularly clock in
with 5 per cent or even 10 per cent annual expansion'.
It is hardly surprising then, says Baring, that in 1993 an estimated Dollars
25bn was invested in the Asian markets alone by western institutions,
representing growth of some 150 per cent over 1992. In this context, Mr
Banerji confidently forecasts strong growth in a number of regions for 1994:
top of the list are India and Mexico, followed by Argentina, Colombia,
Taiwan and Korea.
The case for Mexico sits squarely on the back of the recent Nafta agreement.
F &amp; C estimates GDP growth of some 4 per cent next year. Baring sees the
market gaining some 59 per cent during 1994, based on a combination of lower
interest rates, higher earnings growth and a stock market rerating. India is
highlighted by F &amp; C as having the potential to take off next year, in spite
of a fairly lacklustre performance in 1993. Positive factors include
consumer-led economic recovery and falling inflation.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Markets Report: FFr back in narrow band
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc breached its old floor in the European exchange rate
mechanism to trade in its former narrow band against the D-Mark for the
first time since August 2, writes Conner Middelmann.
After opening around FFr3.440 to the D-Mark, the franc burst through its
former ERM floor at FFr3.4305. It reached an intraday high of FFr3.423
before ending at FFr3.424, up from Tuesday's FFr3.440 close.
Before the virtual suspension of the ERM at the end of July, most currencies
in the system were allowed to trade within 2.25 per cent of their central
parities, with the D-Mark's fluctuation ceiling at FFr3.4305. Since August
2, most currencies can fluctuate by up to 15 per cent on each side of their
central rates.
The franc was boosted by hopes that the ongoing Gatt world trade talks would
be concluded before the December 15 deadline. It was further underpinned by
international buying of French stocks and bonds and switching out of German
and into French assets.
While the long end of the French yield curve rallied sharply, gains at the
short end were limited by the belief that the Bank of France is unlikely to
start easing rates more aggressively in the near term, in spite of the
currency's recent appreciation. That was reflected by the French March
three-month interest rate (Pibor) future, which rose only 0.04 point to
93.51 on moderate volume.
The franc is widely expected to hold on to its gains and is set to test
technical resistance at FFr3.4230 and FFr3.4180. However, today's
publication of Bank of France foreign currency reserve figures for the week
ending December 2 may put a temporary halt to the franc's recent ascent.
'If there is no indication that the Bank of France has taken the opportunity
to rebuild its reserves (amid recent currency strength), that could damp
sentiment a bit' by raising prospects for more central bank franc sales,
said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS.
The French currency also remains vulnerable to any last-minute complications
in the Gatt negotiations.
The D-Mark weakened against most European currencies as international
investors shifted some funds into neighbouring markets.
Throughout this year the D-Mark has attracted huge foreign inflows on the
back of Germany's safe-haven status and the Bundesbank's reluctance to cut
interest rates rapidly. But 'German rates are coming down now and a lot of
the capital that went into Germany is starting to come out', noted Mr Robin
Hubbard, chief economist at Paribas Capital Markets.
Also dampening the German currency was continued softness in the German call
money rate, which slipped to around 6.07 per cent, from about 6.15 per cent
on Tuesday, after the Bundebsank added a net DM2bn at its allocation of
14-day securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 6 per cent.
Although Italy, Spain and Portugal were closed for national holidays, their
currencies continued to strengthen against the D-Mark. The Italian lira rose
to L979.2 to the D-Mark, from L983.1 late on Tuesday. The Spanish peseta
climbed to Pta81.76, from Pta81.93, and the Portuguese escudo edged up to
Es101.7, from Es101.9 on Tuesday.
Among the ERM's core currencies, the Danish krone and Belgian franc also
appreciated further after Tuesday's rate cuts in both countries. The krone
climbed to DKr3.915 per D-Mark, from Tuesday's DKr3.933 close. The Belgian
franc firmed to BFr20.82, from BFr20.83 on Tuesday.
Sterling firmed slightly against the D-Mark, buoyed partly by the successful
auction of Pounds 3bn of 6.75 per cent gilts. The pound hit a high of
DM2.5560 before slipping back to finish at DM2.5500, up from DM2.5450 on
Tuesday.
In the money market, the Bank of England forecast an initial shortage of
Pounds 1.95bn, which was later revised to Pounds 1.9bn. In the course of its
market operations, it purchased Pounds 1.231bn of bills in the early
operation, followed by Pounds 355m and Pounds 290m in later rounds.
The US dollar was the only major currency to ease against the D-Mark,
finishing at DM1.7050, after Tuesday's DM1.7055 close. In after-hours'
London trading it slipped further to DM1.7020, but ended in New York at
DM1.7090.
In spite of recent economic releases indicating a US recovery, inflationary
pressures remain subdued and the recent fall in crude oil prices is
reinforcing the low-inflation outlook, easing the likelihood of imminent
Federal Reserve tightening and keeping a lid on the currency.
'The idea of US tightening has been pushed on the back burner for now',
supporting US long bond yields and pressuring the currency, said Mr Michael
Burke, economist at Citibank in London. Traders will be closely eyeing
producer price data on Thursday and consumer prices on Friday for further
clues on the US inflation outlook.
Elsewhere, the dollar firmed against the Japanese yen on reports that US
Federal Reserve governor Wayne Angell said at a private briefing in London
that Japan should target a rate of Y120 to the dollar to stimulate domestic
demand. The dollar hit a high of Y109.15, though it slipped back in the
course of the day to close at Y108.60, up from Y107.60 on Tuesday. It ended
in New York at Y108.90.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian miners in Sardinian
gold project

<TEXT>
Two small Australian gold-mining companies yesterday secured a 70 per cent
interest in a joint venture company that hopes to produce gold commercially
in Sardinia, the Mediterranean island, by 1995.
No gold-mining facility has ever been developed in Sardinia, although the
island was mined in Roman times for copper and lead.
Gemcor, however, whose shares are listed in both London and Australia, and
General Gold, in which Rothschild Australia holds a controlling interest,
said that a six-month feasibility study was under way and that, if this was
favourable, they hoped to begin production by early-1995.
The initial annual production target is 500,000 tonnes of ore, and mining
will be centred at Furtei, 35km north of Cagliari, Sardinia's capital.
The project will be developed by a joint venture company, to be called
Sardinia Gold Mining. Gemcor and General Gold will buy their respective 35
per cent interests in SGM from Progemisa, a local quasi-government
organisation which was set up to develop resource-based opportunities in
Sardinia. According to the Australian partners, Progemisa has already been
involved in ceramics and crystal ventures in the region. Gemcor and General
Gold will pay ADollars 2.3m each for their SGM interests, and Progemisa will
continue to hold the remaining 30 per cent stake.
All three partners will then contribute around ADollars 5m to fund the
development programme. In addition, they plan to seek further project
funding - perhaps to the tune of ADollars 6m - from either the Italian
government or through European regional assistance programmes. The total
initial cost of the project is estimated at ADollars 18m, and the balance
being funded by bank loans.
Gold exploration in Sardinia began in the late-1980s, and a programme of
drill holes has suggested four principal resources, at Furtei and also to
the north of the island. The chairman of Gemcor, Mr Geoff Cohen, said
yesterday that early drilling at Furtei had suggested oxide resources of
between 1.5m and 2m tonnes at a grade of 2 to 2.5 grammes a tonne.
According to Mr Barry Bolitho, from the Resource Service Group mining
consultancy, these resources 'appear to be the cap of the epithermal systems
and cover widespread gold sulphide mineralisation.
'RSG has concluded that the current resources at Furtei contain between
304,000 and 377,000 ounces depending on the upper cut,' he said.
General Gold and Gemcor, via an associate company, are already partners in
the Mt Monger gold project in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil on the slide as Opec chief
rules out 'miracle'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil market's tentative rally was brought to an abrupt halt yesterday
after it was warned not to look to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries for a 'miracle solution' to the oversupply that was weighing down
prices.
'If others wait for Opec to have a miracle solution, I don't think we have
it,' Mr Abdullah al-Attiyah of Qatar, president of the oil producers' group,
told reporters after informal talks in Damascus with other Opec ministers,
including Mr Hisham Nazer of Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter.
He also suggested that it was time for non-Opec exporters to shoulder their
share of the burden of supporting oil prices. Opec could not be the world's
'swing producer' of oil and make way for others to take its market share, he
said.
Mr al-Attiyah's comments appeared to have extinguished any lingering hopes
that Opec producers might yet rally round to bolster prices by cutting the
organisation's production ceiling from the 24.52m barrels a day set in
September and left unchanged after last month's ministerial meeting.
On the European spot market Tuesday's 11 cents rise in the January delivery
price of Brent blend, the North Sea marker crude, was quickly wiped out, and
the price slumped 60 cents to a fresh five-year low of Dollars 13.27 a
barrel before buyers were attracted into the market. In late trading January
Brent was quoted at Dollars 13.63 a barrel, down 25 cents on balance.
Also contributing to the bearish mood were American Petroleum Institute
figures published overnight showing a 5m-barrel increase US crude oil
stocks. And yesterday the Paris-based International Energy Agency said
October demand in member countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development fell by 500,000 b/d over the past month,
against the normal seasonal trend. The decline was mainly in European gasoil
(heating oil) deliveries.
The Opec president's statement in Damascus signalled that 'the cartel is
pushing hard for a serious effort by non-Opec producers to accept the
responsibility for oil output restraint', says London trade house GNI in the
latest issue of its Oil Graphical Supplement, published today.
'Some countries are already indicating their willingness to join forces with
the cartel,' GNI says, 'but the question is: How low do prices need to fall
before North Sea producers agree to cut output?'
Although it says most analysts believe a protracted period with prices below
Dollars 5 a barrel would be needed for production in the North Sea to be
shut down, GNI suggests that a degree of co-operation may be seen much
sooner - 'but even that would probably require a fall in price below Dollars
10 a barrel (for Brent crude)'.
Following the Opec ministers failure to reduce the output ceiling 'the oil
market now has to cope with a perpetuation of the excess stocks situation',
GNI says.
'While stock levels may not look excessive on a historical basis, the
general view that Opec will not do anything to tighten supply this winter
means that oil refiners can reduce contingency reserves to a bare minimum.
The additional prospect of Iraq's return to the world market, now a virtual
certainty by the end of 1994, means that it will be difficult for the cartel
to raise prices for the next two years.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US technical analysts foresee
further falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US technical analysts said last night that the New York Mercantile Exchange
crude oil contract's six-month downtrend remained intact and that a safety
net would not arrest the fall until about Dollars 13 a barrel, Dollars 1.40
below the five-year low reached in early trading, reports Reuter from New
York.
'In order to establish a short-term bottom, we need a settlement above
Dollars 15.08 on the spot crude,' said Mr Henry Marchell, technical analyst
at Lehman Brothers.
If crude can hold support at Dollars 14-Dollars 14.25 then prices will
likely trade sideways to higher, but still in the context of a bear market,
for two to three weeks, he added. His downside target was Dollars 12.80 if
support at Dollars 14 failed.
'It's still a bear market,' said Mr Bill Billings, director of Nymex trading
at Phillips Petroleum. 'I think it's at the bottom of a weekly channel but
if it trades below these levels, I see projections to Dollars 12.87 and
Dollars 9.10.' He said crude had fallen to his initial downside targets,
based on the summertime price activity, but prices were still vulnerable.
The steep price drop had led many analysts to believe a sharp technical
correction was needed to alleviate the oversold situation. But they conceded
that in many cases the momentum indicators were irrelevant, similar to a
overbought condition before the Gulf War when prices were high for several
months.
Nymex crude has fallen from Dollars 21 a barrel in May, a 31 per cent drop.
Support also existed, traders said, at a gap on the weekly charts from 1988
at Dollars 14.25-Dollars 13.99 a barrel. The 1988 low was Dollars 12.28.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver market surges to Dollars
5 an ounce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The silver price surged above the USDollars 5-a-troy-ounce mark for the
first time in four months yesterday, dragging gold and platinum in its wake.
At the London close the cash price stood at 500.5 cents an ounce, the
15-cent rise on the day extending its advance over the past six trading days
to 56 cents.
Gold was up Dollars 6.95 at Dollars 383.25 an ounce, also a four-month high,
while platinum gained a comparatively modest Dollars 3.30 to Dollars 380.20
an ounce.
Dealers said silver was continuing to attract keen interest from US
investment funds as falling oil prices raised hopes of a further easing of
inflationary pressure.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland in London, explained
that low inflation and the perceived upturn in the US economy were bullish
for silver, principally an industrial metal, but bearish for gold, still
widely regarded as a haven for funds in times of economic difficulty.
Platinum, though also an industrial metal, was benefitting less than silver
because of its heavy reliance on consumption in Japan, where economic
problems were deepening, Mr Smith said.
Underlying the stronger tone in the precious metals markets, he added, was
the development of 'cash anxiety' among investors as interest rates fell.
Lower rates also made it cheaper to 'have a bet' on markets that were widely
believed to have already seen their lows.
'It has been encountering tremendous interest from the funds,' Ms Rhona
O'Connell, analyst at brokers T. Hoare and Company, told the Reuter news
agency. 'And its low unit price as a metal makes it even more attractive
than gold.' She said that the funds had begun to take an extra interest in
silver about a month ago, at a time when physical purchases by Saudi Arabia
were very strong.
Silver was being used there as a relatively cheap method of hedging against
a possible devaluation of the riyal, she explained.
Analysts also pointed out that silver shipments to India had been very
strong throughout this year, following the easing of restrictions on
imports.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ivory Coast concern underpins
cocoa prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa prices moved higher yesterday as the market remained perturbed about a
possible power struggle in the Ivory Coast - the world's biggest producer -
following the death of president Felix Houphouet-Boigny on Tuesday. The
price for the second position futures contract at the London Commodity
Exchange rose by Pounds 8 a tonne to Pounds 1,050 a tonne.
Reports that the republic could have problems meeting its December sales
commitments despite the resumption of normal working also supported cocoa
prices. 'It underlines the fact that any civil or political difficulties in
a power struggle could make things worse,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, at GNI,
the London commodities house.
The speaker of the Ivory Coast parliament yesterday declared himself
president, but the prime minister, who is backed by the army claimed this
was not constitutional.
Cocoa prices are expected to remain high until the succession in the Ivory
Coast becomes apparent. The market has been rising on expectations of a
shortfall in this year's crop as consumption continues to increase.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead smelter to close because
of low prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mount Isa Mines, the Queensland-based metals operation that is part of the
Brisbane-based MIM group, yesterday announced that it was closing down the
smaller of its two lead smelters because of low metal prices.
The company said that there was now insufficient feed from the Mount Isa
mine to utilise fully its conventional smelter and the Isasmelt plant, which
employs newer technology.
Earlier this year, MIM reduced zinc-lead ore production from the Mount Isa
and nearby Hilton mines to 85 per cent of the increased capacity of the
mines. However, the lead smelters were able to maintain output by feeding
off stockpiles of concentrate. These have now been exhausted.
As a result, the Isasmelt smelter, which had achieved its planned capacity
of 60,000 tonnes a year, will close down for an indefinite period. The
remaining plant will produce a rate of 3,300 tonnes a week. The company said
that it was aiming for total annual lead production of about 180,000 tonnes,
compared with just over 206,000 tonnes in 1992-93.
Mount Isa Mines declined to say how much closing down the smelter would
cost, but said that the 40 people employed there would be offered jobs in
other parts of the organisation.
Signet Engineering, a Perth-based engineering company, and the West
Australian's government Gold Corporation have won a contract to establish a
new gold and silver refinery near Chengdu, in south-west China.
The contract was negotiated with the China Banknote Printing and Minting
Corporation, and announced yesterday by Mr Richard Court, the Western
Australian premier. The two organisation will provide technology, equipment
and staff training for the plant over the next 18 months.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Successful auction gives further boost to
UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's successful auction of UK government bonds gave the
market a further boost, with long-dated prices closing up a half to
three-quarters of a point.
The Bank sold Pounds 3bn of 6 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2004 taking
the size of the issue to Pounds 6.25bn. The lowest accepted price was
101.26, yielding 6.51 per cent, while the highest was 101.29, yielding 6.50
per cent.
The cover, or ratio of bids to offers, was much higher than expected at 2.19
times, reflecting strong demand for the issue, which will take over as the
new liquid 10-year benchmark next year.
'There was enough demand out there for the Bank to sell Pounds 6bn of
stock,' exclaimed one dealer. The Bank announced a further Pounds 1.2bn in
tap issues in the afternoon, available for dealing from today. Dealers do
not expect this to halt the market's momentum and predict that prices will
remain firm.
The tap stocks include Pounds 400m of 6 per cent stock due 1999; Pounds 400m
of 8 per cent due 2013; Pounds 200m of 4 5/8 per cent index-linked gilts due
1998; and Pounds 200m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked due 2024.
Dealers noted strong demand from domestic and overseas investors as well as
from proprietary traders.
The US Treasury market drifted higher as traders awaiting today's November
producer price data. In late trading, the 30-year bond was up 1/32 at 101
5/32 , yielding 6.159 per cent and the two-year note was 1/16 ahead at 100
3/16 , to yield 4.133 per cent.
With the report on wholesale prices due out this morning, activity was
listless for a second straight session.
The lack of direction stemmed in part from the conviction that the data will
provide a favourable reading on inflation, with a 0.2 per cent uptick
generally forecast.
That optimism was supported by a sense that it would take very bad news
indeed to rattle the market, in view of its response to last week's strong
employment figures and to recent veiled warnings on inflation by Federal
Reserve governors.
Prices ebbed until midday, when the Fed's Beige Book summary of regional
economic conditions was released. As expected, it presented no obstacles for
bonds, painting another picture of low inflation and moderate growth.
On the announcement, the market began to inch forward, crossing into
positive territory in mid-afternoon.
The strength of the French franc, combined with optimism about the progress
being made on the Gatt talks, helped push French government bond yields
sharply lower across much of the yield curve.
The franc returned to its former narrow ERM trading range for the first time
since the summer currency tensions. Bonds rallied and the Matif December
futures contract ended up 0.60 at 125.12.
French bonds outperformed their German counterparts, with the 10-year yield
spread narrowing to 8 basis points, from 16 points on Tuesday and 22 points
last week.
Dealers said the recent disappointing economic news - lower than expected
third-quarter growth and a big rise in bankruptcies - together with the
franc's strength, ought to encourage an interest rate cut, although this was
not reflected in yesterday's smallish move in the Pibor contract.
German government bonds rallied late in the day, encouraged by the rise in
the other main European markets. The main focus was the sale of the 6 per
cent bund due 2016, sold at average yield of 6.24 per cent, or 41 basis
points above the 10-year benchmark.
The Bundesbank said it had accepted DM4.363bn in bids for the 6 per cent 22
1/2 -year bonds. All bids at 97.06 and above were accepted and the average
yield was 6.24 per cent. Also, DM1.637bn in bonds were allocated to the
central bank for market intervention purposes.
The Dutch government bond market closed higher, helped by continued strong
demand for the new 10-year state bond. Sales of the 5.75 per cent bond due
2004 amounted to Fl 11bn at an average yield of 5.82 per cent.
Elsewhere in Europe, Belgian government bonds rallied, helped by the
strength of the currency, with the spread over German 10-year bonds
narrowing from 91 basis points to 85 basis points.

Indo-China warrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg has launched an issue of 'Indo-China' warrants on a basket of
seven Asian stocks designed to give investors exposure to the expanding
economy of Vietnam.
All seven companies have a large investment in or substantial trade with
Vietnam, although none are based there.
The companies are Accor Asia Pacific, an Australian- based hotel management
company; Singapore-based Asia Pacific Breweries, which has a brewery in
Vietnam; Fraser &amp; Neave which, among other interests, runs the Coca-Cola
franchise in Vietnam; Liang Court Holdings, a Singapore-based property
company with several projects in Vietnam; Luks Industrial, the Hong
Kong-listed company which has invested some Dollars 80m in projects in
Vietnam, and Meiwa Trading, part of the Mitsubishi group.
The warrants are structured in this way because Vietnamese stocks are not
available to foreign investors. In addition, all the companies have a broad
exposure to south-east Asia, so the warrants may perform well, even if the
Vietnamese market does not live up to expectations.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: UK banks intend to increase
lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks operating in the UK have grown in confidence following the recovery in
their earnings and plan to lend more to businesses over the next 12 months,
a survey* of 175 UK and foreign banks has found.
The survey by the Association of Corporate Treasurers and the Bank
Relationship Consultancy found that over half the banks were already
planning to increase their loan books, and 70 per cent intended to do so
within 12 months.
The publication of the survey follows a fall in margins on loans this year
to large corporations considered the equivalent of US investment grade.
Banks have been trying to increase their low risk lending.
About a third of banks surveyed believed margins were increasing in
corporate lending as a whole, and half expected them to remain the same.
About half the banks expect to see a reduction in margins within 12 months.
Mr Gerald Leahy, director general of the association, said the switch in
bank attitudes was encouraging, given that one bank executive had predicted
at the beginning of the year that banks would be reluctant to lend.
Mr Leahy said the remaining question was whether banks would be willing to
lend to established medium-sized companies, although there was evidence that
they were starting to seek high returns on more risky loans.
The survey found that manufacturing, other banks and utilities were the
industrial sectors banks favoured most for lending, while real estate,
construction and leisure remained out of favour.

The Republic of Argentina's widely-expected Dollars 750m global bond
offering dominated a busy day of new issuance in the international bond
market yesterday.
Joint lead managers Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers said that a good
portion of Argentina's 10-year deal had been pre-placed as a result of an
international roadshow which finished on Monday in New York.
Although demand for the bonds was reported to be widespread, a large
proportion is likely to flow into the hands of US investors, who have a
bullish perception of Argentina's credit.
The sovereign borrower is currently rated B1 by Moody's and BB - by Standard
&amp; Poor's. Both these ratings are speculative grade but there is a view in
the market that Argentina could be awarded an investment grade rating within
a couple of years.
Yesterday's deal, which could be the last significant international bond
offering of the year, further extends the range of maturities available in
Argentine paper. Prior to its first global bond offering, Argentina's
longest maturity was seven years.
The bonds are scheduled to be priced today to yield between 280 and 285
basis points over US Treasuries. The scale of demand raised hopes that the
bonds would be priced at the tighter end of the range.
Elsewhere, activity in the Euroyen sector picked up as the Kingdom of Sweden
and LKB Baden-Wurttemberg took advantage of arbitrage opportunities in the
10-year area of the yield curve.
Sweden raised Y50bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds priced to yield
16 basis points over the No 157 Japanese government bond, the current
10-year benchmark.
Syndicate managers said that Sweden's bonds looked expensive when compared
with LKB's Y40bn 10-year issue, which offered investors a yield spread of 20
basis points over JGBs.
LKB is rated triple-A by both Moody's and S&amp;P while Sweden is rated Aa2 by
Moody's and AA plus by S&amp;P.
An official at Yamaichi, which arranged the Sweden deal, said that the
spread on the bonds was justified by their zero risk weighting, as opposed
to the 20 per cent risk weighting on LKB's bonds, and also by their greater
liquidity. In addition, he said that many investors regarded the Kingdom as
an improving sovereign credit.
When Sweden's bonds were freed to trade, they slipped to 99.70 bid from an
issue price of par and the spread widened slightly to 18 basis points over
JGBs.
By contrast, LKB's issue, the proceeds of which were swapped into floating
D-Marks, was not freed to trade by late yesterday.
Syndicate managers expect more issuance in the Euroyen sector in the near
future as borrowers take advantage of the low interest rates in Japan.
The Republic of Finland is expected to launch a Y45bn offering of five-year
Eurobonds today, via Daiwa, and Salomon Brothers is likely to launch a
Pounds 100m, 10-year Eurobond offering for itself priced to yield between
125 and 135 basis points over 10-year gilts.

<TEXT>
Litton Industries' oil services subsidiary is to pay Dollars 558m to buy
back a block of its own shares as part of a series of measures to shape it
as a free-standing company.
Litton said its Western Atlas subsidiary will pay Dollars 358m in cash and
Dollars 200m in seven-year notes to buy the 29.5 per cent of the
subsidiary's shares held by Dresser, another oil services company.
Western Atlas, which derives 60 per cent of its annual Dollars 2bn sales
from oil services and the rest from industrial automation, is expected to be
spun off before the end of the year. Litton shareholders will receive one
share in the new company for each Litton share they own.
Litton also said it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 172m in the
current quarter to reflect the accelerated depreciation of some of Western
Atlas' assets. The subsidiary specialises in the use of information
technology in exploration and drilling operations and demand for the newest
technology had been stronger than expected, forcing the accelerated
write-downs of older equipment.
Mr Alton Brann, president and chief executive, said the purchase from
Dresser would allow both Litton and Dresser to concentrate their investments
on their core businesses.
Mr John Murphy, chairman and chief executive of Dresser, said the deal would
give his company 'greater liquidity and flexibility'. Dresser, which said it
would record a Dollars 150m after-tax profit on the sale, is in the process
of completing an all-share takeover of another oil services company, Baroid,
in a deal currently valued at Dollars 750m.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Henderson issues shares to pay
debt

<TEXT>
Henderson Investment, the majority-controlled investment arm of Henderson
Land, has issued HKDollars 2bn (USDollars 259m) worth of shares to pay part
of the HKDollars 3.3bn debt it raised to buy an interest in Miramar Hotel
and Investment earlier in the year.
The shares were placed at HKDollars 6.90, a discount of around 3.5 per cent
to Tuesday's closing price. A total of 291m was issued, equal to 12.8 per
cent of the company's existing capital.
The placement - originally set at HKDollars 1.5bn - was immediately
supplemented with a further HKDollars 503.7m to satisfy excess demand.
Mr William Wong, company secretary, said the cash would be used to reduce
loans arising from the company's acquisition of 34.8 per cent in Miramar in
July. Henderson emerged as a white knight when the hotel was the subject of
a hostile takeover by Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific.
Mr Wong said that it was a good time to raise cash, with the local
stockmarket hitting record highs. The latest cash call by the Henderson
group follows two bond issues by Henderson Land, which owns 72.2 per cent of
Henderson Investments.
The parent company raised USDollars 460m in Euroconvertibles and USDollars
300m in Eurobonds this year. The former are to convert into shares in the
company's China property interests, which it plans to spin off in a separate
listing.
This week's placement is the third largest on the Hong Kong exchange this
year, excluding those linked to new listings. Chinese conglomerate Citic
Pacific raised HKDollars 7.17bn in January and Hutchison Whampoa, the hong
whose interests span container terminals, supermarkets and
telecommunications, made a HKDollars 4.57bn cash call in May.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Rembrandt paints a broader
picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rembrandt Group, the South African tobacco-based conglomerate, performed in
line with market expectations to record a 16.6 per cent increase in net
income to R530.8m (Dollars 157.8) in the six months to September, compared
with R455.2m a year earlier.
The results are notable for the increased level of disclosure in the income
statement compared with previous years, when the group had been notoriously
shy in its disclosure. Rembrandt is controlled by the Cape-based Rupert
family, which also controls Richemont, the Swiss based tobacco and luxury
goods group.
For the first time, a turnover figure is disclosed, showing an increase of
9.6 per cent to R2.22bn. There is no indication, however, of how much of
this comes from the group's valuable tobacco interests, which normally
contribute about 40 per cent of bottom line earnings.
The results also break new ground in that pre-tax income is broken down
between operating income and dividend income. Operating income rose by 7.7
per cent to R532.5m and dividend income by 9.8 per cent to R133.9m.
Operating income includes the group's tobacco interests, where analysts
estimate pre-tax profits grew by between 5 and 8 per cent, and Huntcor, a
holding company for Robertsons, a food company, the TSB sugar group, the
Rainbow poultry group and Rembrandt's timber investments. The biggest change
was the fall in Rainbow's losses, which were R77m in the year to March.
Dividend income comes from investments in mining (Gencor, Gold Fields and
Trans-Hex), banking (principally ABSA, the country's largest bank), and
assorted industrial investments, including a stake in the Total oil group.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Japan learns the American Way -
Banks are taking a new approach to bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, suggested this week that
the country's banks could learn from the US experience of dealing decisively
with bad loans, he was conceding that the Japanese Way has not worked.
The Japanese Way was to sit on bad loans for a decade or more. It came with
the confidence that Japanese banks were incapable of failing, and encouraged
the idea that the 11 leading commercial banks were all in exactly the same
shape, walking the same line at roughly the same pace.
Mr Mieno's statement highlights a remarkable change in thinking in Japan
over the past year. Bankers had laughed at the thought of copying the US
method of taking a big hit, clearing the balance sheet and starting afresh.
A finance ministry official insisted early last year that 'you will never
see that kind of thing here'.
Japanese banks will not suddenly swallow their bad loans whole, but Mr
Mieno's statements indicate that further deregulation is needed in the
financial markets to speed the process. He has previously suggested that
both the strong and the weak banks should be more subject to markets and
less to the whims of the finance ministry.
The banks' sense of urgency in dealing with their bad loans has been
heightened by the weakness of stock prices, which slipped another 2.3 per
cent yesterday. When stock prices fall, so do the banks' unrealised gains on
equities, which have been seen as their buffer against bad loans.
Banks are also nervous because they are noticing a change in the structure
of their non-performing loans. The bubble of the late 1980s is generally
seen as the cause of the burden, but another layer of bad loans is appearing
and will push their totals far higher than envisaged.
Bankruptcy figures collected by Teikoku Data Bank, a credit research
company, suggest that a record 63 per cent of the 1,258 corporate failures
in October were caused by the recession. Banks had expected that their
non-performing loan totals would peak as the bubble worked its way out of
the system, but the recession is adding to their woes.
The banks have also wasted opportunities to deal with their non-performing
loans, which at the 21 leading institutions rose 7.7 per cent to Y13,800bn
(Dollars 128bn) in the first half to September. This narrowly defined figure
does not reveal the full extent of exposure, widely estimated to be
Y30,000bn.
Falling interest rates over the past two fiscal years increased banks' core
profits, but the banks only assaulted the mountain of loans this year. In
the six months just ended, core profits at the 11 largest banks slipped 10.6
per cent, and the weak demand for new loans and an official discount rate at
a record low of 1.75 per cent do not create much margin for improvement.
To cope with the burden, Mr Mieno suggested that Japan's financial markets
would need to be further liberalised to enable banks to securitise their
non-performing loans. His concern was that the banks have become too
risk-averse and could worsen the recession by refusing to provide fresh
finance to companies in need.
'The many functions of the financial markets, particularly the transfer of
risk, played a major part in the recovery of US (banking) companies. We must
examine if there is room to use those functions in Japan's financial
system,' Mr Mieno said.
The Bank of Japan has already told the finance ministry that securitisation
is needed, and the ministry formed a committee in late November to examine
the establishment of a secondary market for bad loans. But the first report
is not due until March, and the ministry is said to be irritated that the
bank is taking the lead.
'The ministry people don't like following the bank's idea. They have been
very slow to respond,' a Japanese banker said.
The finance ministry is central to the Japanese Way of dealing with bad
loans, providing guidelines on how much the banks should write-off and
encouraging them to walk at roughly the same pace. The Bank of Japan would
prefer that stronger banks deal with their problem loans more quickly.
Interim results and non-performing loans announced last month highlighted
the differences in the banks' health. Mitsubishi Bank, the strongest of
Japan's banks, has non-performing loans equivalent to 1.9 per cent of its
total loans, while the figure was 5.38 per cent at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank,
perceived to be one of the more exposed banks.
If the ministry remains reluctant to allow securitisation, another
possibility is the establishment of a government-backed land buying agency.
Members of Japan's governing coalition suggested this week that the agency
could buy property collateral held by the banks, either using the land for
government buildings or reselling it when the market improves.
This would be more effective than the banks' own Co-operative Credit
Purchasing Company, which assesses the collateral on non-performing loans
and buys the loan credit, enabling the seller bank to write-off the loss.
The CCPC uses the banks' money to buy their own loans and is more a response
to tough tax laws than the vehicle which will move the mountain of bad
loans.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Premier Group interim earnings
up 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Premier Group, one of South Africa's leading food companies, overcame
recessionary trading conditions to record an 11 per cent increase in
attributable earnings to R109.3m (Dollars 32.5m) in the six months to
October, against R98.1m a year earlier.
Earnings per share rose to 132 cents from 119 cents and the dividend was
increased to 40 cents per share from 36 cents. Mr Peter Wrighton, chairman,
said full-year results would depend on trading during the Christmas and
Easter periods and the extent of disruption in the run-up to next April's
elections.
He added, however, that the group was 'optimistic about the future and
cautiously confident that 1994 will see major breakthroughs . . . heralding
a new era of economic growth'.
On the trading side, turnover rose by 26 per cent to R7.17bn, including
United Pharmaceutical Distributors and Bonnita. If these are excluded, and
like compared with like, turnover rose by only 6 per cent.
This is lower than the overall inflation rate in the country (though food
inflation has recently sunk as low as 2.4 per cent) and indicates the
severity of the economic recession.
Trading profit rose by 19 per cent to R288.4m but net interest paid rose
substantially to R40.4m from R21.4m owing to the consolidation of UPD and
Bonnita and expansion of the group. Total borrowings rose to R747m from
R279.7m.
Mr Wrighton said Premier Food and retail store Clicks had underperformed,
but Metro Cash and Carry and Premier Pharmaceuticals performed well.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Strong demand for Credito
Italiano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The public offer for the 64 per cent stake in Credito Italiano held by IRI,
the Italian state holding company, was closed early yesterday after being
over-subscribed six times.
The strong response by institutional and private investors will be seen as a
lift to Italy's privatisation plans that have been slow to materialise.
Credito is the first large public sale of state assets and success is
important for the momentum of the privatisation programme at a time of
political uncertainty.
The offer of L2,075 per ordinary share was launched on Monday at a 9.6 per
cent discount, with a sweetener of a 1-for-10 bonus share issue in three
years for those retaining their original stake.
'The huge demand from Credito's 800 branches and the 96 banks in the
consortium backing the issue have helped accelerate the timescale for the
completion of the operation,' the bank said yesterday.
At the close of business on Tuesday, over 295,000 orders had been placed for
2.9bn shares, roughly half coming from Credito branches. The bank said that
when included with institutional demand more than 5bn shares had been
requested against the 840m placed by IRI.
Mr Romano Prodi, the head of IRI, said: 'Italy has really replaced deeds
with words. Italian savers and institutional investors have understood the
importance of an enthusiastic response to the first big privatisation,
ensuring the success of the offer well ahead of schedule and by a heavy
over-subscription.'
The offer was to close at the end of the week and raise L1,830bn (Dollars
1.1bn) for IRI.
The discount was lower than that offered by the French government for BNP
and Spain's Argentaria. However, a brief but intense advertising campaign
encouraging Italians to switch their attention from Treasury bills (Bots) to
risk investment on the stock exchange appears to have worked.

A US judge ruled yesterday that Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency, would
not have to turn over to creditors of Pan Am, the defunct US airline,
information the agency had gathered about a bid in 1992 to fund a
reorganisation of Pan Am by rival carrier Delta Air Lines.
Lawyers representing Pan Am's creditors had issued a subpoena to Standard &amp;
Poor's demanding it hand over the information, which they said was needed
for a lawsuit Pan Am had filed against Delta for withdrawing from the
reorganisation plan.
Standard &amp; Poor's compiled the information on Delta from meetings,
correspondence and other communications with the airline, and had intended
to use it to evaluate how Delta would be affected by its funding of a
planned reorganisation of Pan Am.
Yesterday's decision overturns an earlier ruling by a bankruptcy court that
had compelled Standard &amp; Poor's to give the information to lawyers of Pan
Am's creditors. That decision was made on the grounds that the ratings
agency was not a news organisation gathering the information for purposes of
journalism, and therefore not protected by the right to free speech
guaranteed in the US constitution.
However, district court judge Ms Loretta Preska of Manhattan ruled that
Standard &amp; Poor's was entitled to the constitutional protections enjoyed by
news organisations.

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation auction of Petroquimica Uniao, the Brazilian petrochemical
company, has been cancelled because less than 7 per cent of the shares on
offer were bought.
The last time a privatisation auction was cancelled was in 1991, for Enasa,
a small river transportation company.
The PQU auction had been postponed five times and there are doubts whether
the company will be offered for sale again under the present administration,
which leaves office in early 1995.
The government valued the company at Dollars 559m.
The cancellation was expected after Monday's auction when only 3.07m shares
of the 50m on offer were bought.
In a second session on Tuesday, only 378,000 more shares were bought and the
auction was declared invalid by the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange.
PQU's main prospective buyer, a consortium of petrochemical-related
companies including Union Carbide and Shell Brasil, decided not to take part
because of a dispute with the government over a new pricing formula for
petrochemical naphtha, PQU's main raw material.
The government's proposed formula, which it has still not officially
announced, will link naphtha prices to a basket of imported crude oils and
imported naphtha.
The cancellation leaves PQU controlled by Petroquisa, a subsidiary of
Petrobras, the government-owned oil company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation closed up about 9 per cent at
ADollars 10.90 on Wednesday after the group said it had withdrawn its plan
to issue shares with super voting rights.
It claimed that the lengthening timetable for necessary approvals for the
shares had become commercially unrealistic.
More than 4m News Corp shares changed hands on Wednesday and the
announcement, together with a strong trend in metal prices, was thought
responsible for a rise in the Australian stock market.
The Australian Investment Managers' Group, which represents most fund
management groups in the region, hailed News's backdown as a victory for the
one share, one vote principle.
In a letter to the Australian stock exchange (ASX), the media and film
group's lawyers noted the earliest date on which the super shares could be
issued - assuming permission was granted - was June 1994, eight months after
the scheme was mooted.
'Unfortunately, the uncertainty and substantial lead times now involved . .
. are not consistent with the needs faced by News Corp,' they said.
Had the scheme gone ahead, News would probably have been invulnerable to
takeover, and the share price increase reflected the restoration of this
possibility.
However, some analysts speculated that Mr Murdoch had deals or joint venture
arrangements in the pipeline and had found an alternative way of structuring
these, so that his 33 per cent family interest in News's equity would not be
diluted.
The super share plan, announced by Mr Murdoch at a News annual meeting in
October, caused a storm of controversy in Australia where share structures
involving differential voting rights are not permitted.
It involved issuing the new shares with multiple voting rights to existing
shareholders on a pro rata basis, which critics claimed would have allowed
Mr Murdoch to establish an entrenched control position.
He could, for example, have sold some of his ordinary shares, bought more
super voters, and pushed his interest up from 33 per cent to over 40 per
cent for no net outlay.
News, however, always claimed the plan was devised to facilitate strategic
deals, although no details were supplied.
It had hoped for a provisional decision from the Australian stock exchange,
over whether it would change its listing rules to accommodate the scheme, in
November.
According to the lawyers' letter, that date shifted to December, a timescale
News continued to 'knit in with'.
Last week, talks between the attorney-general and the ASX led to a much
longer consultative process, and News faced six more months of uncertainty.
As a result, its directors, meeting in London on Tuesday, decided to
withdraw the scheme. Yesterday, the ASX expressed sympathy for News's
predicament.
'The time frame was blowing out quite a bit, and that's something the
exchange regrets,' said Mr Ray Schoer, head of the companies' division.
In spite of News's withdrawal, the ASX said it would continue to assess the
merits of differential voting rights, although its inquiry may proceed in a
more leisurely fashion.
The ASX said it had received comments from international exchanges -
including London and New York - and felt there was good sense in
establishing where different countries stood on this issue, before specific
proposals were presented again.
There had been fears that News would simply have moved its listing to New
York had the ASX refused to moderate its listing rules - although the stance
of the London and New York markets on differential voting rights is less
than clear-cut.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Merck executive to head Upjohn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Zabriskie, executive vice-president and head of manufacturing at the
US drugs group Merck, is leaving the company to take over as chairman and
chief executive of Upjohn, a chief rival.
The appointment ends the search for a new Upjohn chief executive that began
last April, when the previous chairman and chief executive, Mr Theodore
Cooper, died of cancer.
The company said Mr Ley Smith, Upjohn chief operating officer, would
continue to serve as interim chief executive until the 54-year-old Mr
Zabriskie assumed his duties in the new year.
Mr Zabriskie said he was sad to leave Merck after 28 years, but that the
'opportunity to lead a company in my own right became an irresistible
challenge'.
Mr Joseph Riccardo, an analyst with the Wall Street broking house Bear
Stearns, hailed Upjohn's choice. 'John Zabriskie is a seasoned
pharmaceuticals executive who had a very good career at Merck. He is a good
manager and leader and will be a valuable asset to Upjohn.'
Mr Zabriskie's main challenge at Upjohn will be to steer the company through
what could be a difficult transition.
Although it has promising products under development, Upjohn faces the
expiration of US patents on several of its leading drugs; new legislation
affecting the tax charge for its Puerto Rican manufacturing facilities; and
a healthcare environment that President Clinton's planned reforms have
turned increasingly hostile.
The departure of Mr Zabriskie, meanwhile, clouds the issue of who will
succeed Mr Roy Vagelos as chairman and chief executive of the world's
largest drugs group when he retires next year.
Mr Richard Markham, Merck's former chief operating officer, was seen as heir
apparent until he resigned in July.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: YPF plans Dollars 1.25bn
investment programme

<TEXT>
YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, plans to invest Dollars 1.25bn next
year to increase output, modernise production capacity and upgrade its
retail network.
It announced an Dollars 850m bond programme, the largest of its kind by an
Argentine company.
The company plans to invest Dollars 650m to increase production by 20 per
cent in 1994. Output is 380,000 b/d, and YPF aims to produce 450,000 b/d by
1995. It said much of the increased production would be exported to Chile
through a trans-Andean pipeline to be inaugurated next year.
Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president, said the company would invest Dollars
300m in exploration to lift reserves. A further Dollars 100m would be used
to upgrade operations to meet tougher environmental standards as part of a
Dollars 500m five-year plan.
The remaining Dollars 200m would be used to expand and modernise refinery
capacity and retail network.
YPF was partially privatised in June when the government sold 45 per cent of
the company for Dollars 3.04bn.
The investment programme is to be financed from cashflow and debt. In the
nine months to September, YPF reported net income of Dollars 394m, against
Dollars 145m in the same period of 1992.
Mr Cedric Bridger, vice-president, said YPF would launch Dollars 850m-worth
of bonds, to be spearheaded early next year by a Dollars 350m fixed rate,
10-year Yankee bond programme. Mr Bridger said the Yankee bonds, to be
placed by CS First Boston, would be used to retire Dollars 200m-worth of
costly local and World Bank debt and replenish working capital.
He said pricing would be decided after the government had placed Dollars
750m-worth of Global bonds today. YPF hopes to achieve similar or better
terms for its bonds.
The Yankee bonds will be followed by a Dollars 500m medium-term global note
programme.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, the world's biggest car maker, yesterday announced that all
its media-buying activities - with an estimated annual spend approaching
Dollars 1bn a year - were to be consolidated under the umbrella of
Interpublic, the world's second largest group of advertising agencies.
At present GM's media buying is split between several agencies. Two of them
 -Lintas: Worldwide and McCann-Erickson - are Interpublic subsidiaries. The
two biggest losers from the new arrangement are believed to be Leo Burnett
and D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles.
Two units will be formed within Interpublic to look after the GM account,
one of them will deal with television buying and the other print buying.
The new national broadcast unit will be headed by Mr Marc Goldstein,
currently executive vice-president and director of national broadcast media
and planning at Lintas: USA.
The print buying unit will be headed by Ms Karen Ritchie, presently senior
vice-president and director of media services for McCann-Erickson Detroit.
Until a few years ago each GM division handled its own media buying, but in
1986 the group started consolidating this activity in the search for greater
efficiency.
However, GM said divisions would still independently employ advertising
agencies to create and develop campaigns for GM products.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: ITT to spin off forestry unit to
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT is to spin off its large forest products subsidiary, ITT Rayonier, to
shareholders in a further move to simplify the US conglomerate.
Rayonier, acquired by ITT in 1968, has annual sales of about Dollars 1bn. It
controls about 1.5m acres of timber resources and operates three pulp and
two lumber mills.
The US conglomerate plans to distribute in February one share of Rayonier
common stock for every four shares of ITT common, and one share of Rayonier
for every 3.1595 shares of ITT series N convertible stock.
The new company will have about 30m shares outstanding and expects to be
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
ITT will retain no interest in the business.
The move will eliminate the group's exposure to a highly cyclical, capital
intensive industry which is suffering from depressed international paper and
pulp prices.
Fitch Investors Service, the credit agency, noted while affirming ITT's
senior debt rating that Rayonier accounted for 12 per cent of ITT's
consolidated capital expenditure and 14 per cent of debt while only
generating 8 per cent of consolidated operating profit.
Mr Rand Araskog, ITT chairman, said that 'after detailed analysis, that
included senior Rayonier management, we concluded that Rayonier's financial
and operational profile and capital expenditure requirements could best be
served by an independent, publicly traded company'.
Other important initiatives by ITT over the past year include refocusing its
consumer finance business, and expansion of its automotive components
business through the Dollars 400m acquisition of a General Motors
subsid-iary.
In the first nine months of this year, Rayonier reported income of Dollars
112m on sales of Dollars 719m, up from Dollars 102m on sales of Dollars 717m
in the same period of last year.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: US aims to recycle 50% of its
paper by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US paper industry said yesterday it wanted to recover for recycling
about 50 per cent of all the paper Americans use in the year 2000.
It currently stands at 40 per cent.
The goal was announced as the American Forest &amp; Paper Association, an
industry umbrella body, released a survey showing that US pulp, paper and
paperboard manufacturing capacity will grow slowly over the next three
years. However, it did show there would be a much faster expansion of
recycling capacity.
In 1990, the paper industry set a goal of recovering 40 per cent of paper by
1995, but it said yesterday it had reached this target two years early.
Mr Red Cavaney, president of the Forest &amp; Paper Association, said that 'in
1986 twice as much paper was being landfilled as recovered for recycling.
'Today, for the first time ever, Americans recover more paper for recycling
and re-use than they send to landfills.'
He added that a 50 per cent recovery rate, which would be a large challenge
to reach and appeared about the maximum possible, was unprecedented in a
country as large and sparsely populated as the US.
Achieving it would put the country ahead of Europe and on a par with Japan,
which had achieved a rate of 50 per cent to 51 per cent for the past decade.
The industry's capacity survey shows growth expected to average just 1.9 per
cent a year through to 1996, well below the previous 10-year average of 2.3
per cent.
It will bring total paper and paperboard capacity to an estimated 96.3m
annual tons in 1996.
Growth in domestic wood pulp capacity is expected to be even lower, at only
0.6 per cent a year.
However, recycling capacity is expected to grow at an annual rate of 6.8 per
cent.

part of holding

<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals and chemicals group, plans to raise
CDollars 125m (USDollars 94.5m) through a public offering of part of its
stake in Metall Mining, its Toronto-based international mining subsidiary.
The offering will cut Metallgesellschaft's stake in Metall to 50.1 per cent
from about 60 per cent.
The 11.6m shares up for sale are part of a block of 15.9m which Metall
recently issued to the German parent in exchange for Metallgesellschaft's
European copper smelting assets. The rest of the Metall block has been sold
in a private transaction to Minorco, the South African-controlled mining
group.
A public offering, originally scheduled for October, was cancelled due to
tumbling copper prices. However, share prices of mining companies on the
Toronto stock exchange have surged in the past week or two. 'The sentiment
has changed,' one corporate finance specialist said.
The Metall shares will be offered at CDollars 10.75 each, the same price
mooted for the earlier issue. The sale is being underwritten by a group of
securities dealers led by Gordon Capital and Burns Fry of Toronto.
Metall's share price gained 37 cents to CDollars 11 before yesterday's
announcement.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pernod Ricard, the French drinks group, yesterday announced it would swap
one of its Irish whiskey brands for a Canadian whisky owned by Allied-Lyons
of the UK.
The French group said the exchange of Tullamore Dew for Royal Canadian would
allow it to expand its range of whiskies. It currently owns several Irish
whiskeys, including Jamesons and Bushmills; Scotch whiskies such as Abelour;
and a bourbon, Wild Turkey. However it does not have a Canadian whisky
brand.
The deal will also give Allied-Lyons its first Irish whiskey. 'It is a niche
premium brand which does well in international duty free,' said the UK
group. 'It is a good addition to our portfolio.'
The deal involves only the distribution of the whiskies. Pernod's
subsidiary, Irish Distillers, will continue to produce Tullamore Dew, while
Allied-Lyons will produce Royal Canadian. The Canadian whisky brand is
currently distributed by Hiram Walker, a subsidiary of the UK group.
Pernod said it would also receive payment for Tullamore Dew since it was
more profitable than Royal Canadian. However it declined to disclose the
amount.
Pernod's whisky business is its second-largest division, in terms of sales,
after its aperitif drink. The company said whisky was one of the fastest
growing segments of the French drinks market, although demand remained
depressed in international markets.
L'Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurance group, announced
yesterday that the advisory banks for its privatisation were to be Banque
Lazard, Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Worms, Reuter reports from
Paris.
The UAP flotation is likely to go ahead after the sale of Elf Aquitaine,
scheduled for early 1994.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Matsushita Electric to move
6,000 staff in restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Matsushita Electric yesterday announced a big restructuring in which it
plans to transfer 6,000 employees from administrative jobs to those directly
related to production, sales and new business development.
Matsushita said 30 per cent of its administrative workforce, or about 20,000
employees, would be transferred out of their current jobs during the next
three years. They will go to sales and new business development.
At a year-end gathering with the press yesterday, Mr Yoichi Morishita,
president, said the restructuring was essential to revitalise the company in
the face of a severe economic climate.
Under the restructuring, to be implemented in February, the functions and
structure of the company's headquarters in Osaka will also be revamped.
Development divisions will be restructured to find and develop new
technologies more efficiently.
The move by the world's largest consumer electronics group is aimed at
trimming its administrative operations and using its workforce more
effectively.
It comes as the consumer electronics industry faces one of the worst
downturns in its history, compounded by growing pressures to move a larger
part of manufacturing overseas to cope with the sharp rise of the yen.
Matsushita's restructuring plan also highlights the difficulty the group is
having in coming up with innovative products to stimulate sluggish consumer
demand.
While a large number of Japanese companies are struggling to adapt their
corporate structures to a tougher new era, Matsushita, in particular, has
been widely criticised for being bloated and bureaucratic. The company
employs 90,000 people in Japan and 250,000 worldwide.
Earlier this year, Mr Akio Tanii suddenly resigned as president following a
financial scandal. The event was seen by many in the industry as stemming
from Matsushita's excessively large and complex organisational structure.
Profits have also been poor. In the year ended March, Matsushita reported a
54 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, to Y168.4bn (Dollars 1.6bn), the
second year of a sharp decline.
Following a cool summer, which hit sales of air conditioning equipment, the
economy has remained flat.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Xerox to cut workforce by 10%
over three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Xerox, the US document processing company, is to cut its worldwide workforce
by more than 10 per cent, or 10,000 jobs, over the next two to three years.
It will take a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of about Dollars 700m to
cover the restructuring.
It will also take a Dollars 154m charge in the quarter to cover the
settlement of a 1992 anti-trust lawsuit over sales of spare parts for
high-volume copiers and printers.
The restructuring is the latest in a series of moves by Mr Paul Allaire,
chairman, to shake up Xerox's culture and improve productivity at a time of
intensifying global competition.
While its products generally have a good market reputation, it has suffered
a chequered profits record in recent quarters, because of sluggish growth in
some of its most important global markets and an unexpectedly protracted
reorganisation of its sales force. Mr Allaire said yesterday the
restructuring in the document processing division was 'not a function of any
change in the current business environment, but rather it accelerates
numerous productivity initiatives that have been under careful consideration
for some time'.
The aim was to increase productivity, lower the cost base, be more
responsive to customers, and improve financial results.
The shake-up will involve the closure and consolidation of some facilities
and the streamlining of the organisational structure, including reduced
layers of management.
The company is also considering a plan to 'outsource' some of its operations
to outside vendors.
The job cuts will come through normal attrition, redundancies and some
controlled, voluntary programmes. About half the cuts will be implemented
next year.
The anti-trust court case involved complaints by customers and independent
service organisations that Xerox had refused to give the service companies
access to parts and software, allowing the company to overcharge for
equipment, parts and service.
Under the settlement, Xerox has agreed to sell parts to the service
providers, and will give discounts of Dollars 225m to plaintiffs for
part-payment on future purchases of company products.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Banks mop up an oil spillage -
Why Metallgesellschaft has a futures problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Friday, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft,
paid a visit to the twin towers of Deutsche Bank, just down the road from
the loss-making conglomerate's own headquarters in the centre of Frankfurt.
At 8am, Mr Schimmelbusch, together with his finance director and one other
senior executive, had an audience with Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank
main board director responsible for corporate finance and chairman of
Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board.
It seems likely Mr Schimmelbusch then alerted Mr Schmitz to potential
liquidity problems arising from the group's oil trading activities in the
US, and requested new credit lines to stave off a possible cash crisis
within the group's US operation, MG Corp.
The difficulties were sparked by a sharp fall in the oil price in recent
months. This has given rise to the need for Metallgesellschaft to finance
so-called 'margin calls' - cash payouts - to cover part of the risk on oil
futures.
Senior executives from Metallgesellschaft were obliged to skip the
head-office party later that day and enter a round of negotiations with
Deutsche and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks which both happen to
be significantshareholders in the metals, mining and industrial
conglomerate.
The negotiations bore fruit around lunch-time on Monday, when
Metallgesellschaft put out a one-paragraph statement saying it had secured
additional lines of credit. However, news of the talks had already broken in
that morning's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper: the
statement could not prevent a large sell-off of the company's shares. They
ended the day down 12 per cent.
The scale of the share-price reaction reflected worries about the underlying
financial stability of the group. Metallgesellschaft has been badly hit by
recession in Germany and the impact of cheap metal imports from the former
eastern bloc.
Last month, Metallgesellschaft announced a loss of DM347m (Dollars 204.1m)
for the year ended September, and said it would pass the dividend. Following
this, the stock market clearly judged the latest risk as a potential straw
to break the camel's back.
But was the share price reaction justified? According to Mr Hilmar Kopper,
Deutsche Bank chief executive, it was not. He said it was not a question of
existence-threatening risks at Metallgesellschaft, but rather of a
short-term liquidity problem caused by a technicality.
'There has been too much excitement,' he said. 'We need to be more relaxed
about this.'
The New York-based MG Corp has built up a substantial business supplying
physical oil and oil-related products such as diesel, gasoline and heating
oil. As part of normal business practice, these contracts are hedged with a
variety of instruments to neutralise the group's exposure in the event of
sharp price movements.
The oil futures contract, however, has been running against MG Corp: when
the oil price falls, contract-holders are obliged to make a margin call with
the Nymex futures exchange. This is designed to smooth out the impact of an
adverse change in prices. The oil price has dropped from Dollars 21 a barrel
in May to less than Dollars 14 now.
For MG Corp, the need to find the cash imposes a liquidity strain, despite
the fact that the company's risk is covered by its contract to sell physical
oil at a future date. The risk enters a new order of magnitude only when the
original contract to sell gasoline at a given price goes awry.
In its brief statement earlier this week, Metallgesellschaft gave no hint of
this, saying only that it had paid all calls to date but needed new
borrowing facilities to cover the possibility that the oil price will fall
further. Metallgesellschaft made it clear yesterday it would publish further
information next week.
The stockmarket, for one, appears to be giving the group the benefit of the
doubt - the shares closed DM12 up at DM360 yesterday.

mine

<TEXT>
Eastern Germany's highly-regulated utilities industry is set to be prised
open after an Anglo-American consortium yesterday completed the purchase of
one of the region's largest brown coal mines.
PowerGen of the UK, and NRG and Morrison-Knudsen of the US yesterday
acquired Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlenwerke (Mibrag) from the Treuhand
privatisation agency.
The consortium will invest more than DM1.3bn (Dollars 765m) between now and
the year 2004. It has agreed to guarantee 2,100 jobs until the end of the
decade in the three mines, two briquette plants, and a small generating
plant which it has acquired. The remainder of the Mibrag complex, employing
about 3,600, will be hived off from the consortium and placed under a
separate company.
Before German unification, Mibrag, which straddles the eastern states of
Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, employed more than 55,000 people.
The consortium will target the investments primarily on modernising the
mines and introducing the environmental technology required to reduce
sharply the sulphuric oxide content of brown coal, a soft coal widely used
in energy-production in eastern Germany.
Mr David Petersen, president of NRG, said Mibrag would produce about about
20m tonnes a year.
Although energy consumption had fallen sharply in eastern Germany because of
the decline of the region's manufacturing base and growing competition from
the gas sector, the consortium has secured coal delivery contracts. Mr
Petersen said these would guarantee the economic viability of Mibrag.
Mibrag's coal will be delivered locally to the 1,600-MW power plant at
Lippendorf, owned by Veag, eastern Germany's main utility company; to Meag,
a regional utility group; and to Schkopau, an 800-MW power plant. Schkopau
is being built by VKR, the electricity arm of PreussenElektra, the large
German utility company.
The consortium has managed to secure a 44 per cent stake in Schkopau and
will sign the agreement tomorrow. Mr Petersen said the consortium's
acquisition of Mibrag and Schkopau was a 'milestone in the participation in
the German energy industry. This will mean a more open and competitive
industry.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Allders meets flotation forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allders, the department store and tax and duty-free retailer, has fulfilled
the forecasts made in its flotation prospectus.
The group, which went public last month, made a pro-forma pre-tax profit of
Pounds 13.3m in the year to September 30, compared to its forecast of Pounds
13.2m.
The shares closed yesterday at 191p, down 1p on the day but ahead of the
170p flotation price.
Lord Prior, chairman, said consumer confidence was still fragile. However,
he was confident the current year would see the benefit of new stores opened
in 1992 and 1993, and new tax and duty free outlets. He said 'with our
financial position now established, we are well placed to secure future
growth'.
Allders learnt last Friday that the Canadian government was cancelling the
redevelopment and privatisation of Toronto airport, which would have given
Allders the right to operate shops in terminals 1 and 2. Allders is hoping
for compensation for the preparation work it has done.
Actual pre-tax profit was Pounds 6.36m (loss Pounds 3.44m), after an
interest charge of Pounds 8.85m (Pounds 10.6m), which would have been Pounds
7m lower had the group had the Pounds 75m cash raised through the flotation
at the start of the year. The group had been heavily borrowed because of its
management buy-out in 1989.
Group sales rose 16.4 per cent to Pounds 685.5m and operating profits were
Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 15.2m), including associates of Pounds 3.26m (Pounds
2.24m) and before exceptional costs of Pounds 7.99m (Pounds 8.08m) which
related to rent on an unused property.
Pro-forma fully diluted earnings per share were 13.9p, against an estimate
of 13.7p. The group said at the time of the float that it would not pay a
dividend in respect of 1992-93, but if it had been quoted throughout the
year would have paid a total of 6.1p.
Department store sales were up 10.6 per cent to Pounds 286.6m, with the
increase due to new stores. Operating profits in this division rose 21 per
cent to Pounds 12m, but this included a Pounds 1.2m benefit from a 53rd
trading week. The duty free shopping division increased sales 21 per cent to
Pounds 398.9m. Operating profits nearly doubled to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds
6.7m).

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Asprey Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asprey, the up-market jewellery retailer which also owns Garrard and Mappin
&amp; Webb, increased pre-tax profits by Pounds 1m to Pounds 12.2m in the half
year to September 30.
The rise was achieved, the company said, in spite of persistent difficult
trading conditions.
In July, Sears, the retail group, sold its 25 per cent stake in the company,
and Asprey shares moved from the USM to the Official List. Yesterday the
shares rose by 2p to 315p.
Sales rose 45 per cent to Pounds 87.4m (Pounds 60.2m) but margins were under
pressure. Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, said that now 'the richer the
person is the more he wants value for money.' Valued, high-spending
customers were asking for and getting discounts.
Sales at Asprey rose by more than 30 per cent, at Garrard by 18 per cent and
Mappin &amp; Webb by 24 per cent.
The group benefited from a full six months' contribution from Watches of
Switzerland, acquired in June 1992, and three months from Les Ambassadeurs,
the Swiss chain, bought on July 1. Mr Attallah said losses at Asprey's New
York shop were lower.
Since July, Asprey had acquired Ronald A Lee (Fine Arts), a specialist
antique clock dealer, for Pounds 300,000 and Tomasz Starweski, a dress
designer, for Pounds 120,000.
Following the Les Ambassadeurs deal, net interest receivable fell from about
Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 300,000.
Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 8.04p (6.97p), and the interim
dividend is lifted by 14 per cent from 1.1p to 1.25p.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hopes launched of uplift in tanker shipping
 -Events which point to the end of a 20-year bear market in new shipbuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attracting new money into tanker shipping has been a difficult task in
recent years. The banks had their fingers badly burned, while equity finance
has been hard to come by.
But there are signs of a change. The past six months have seen a rash of
equity issues which some analysts believe may herald the first significant
uplift in the tanker and bulk shipping market for two decades.
More than Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) of new equity has been raised by means
of rights issues and share placings to finance spending on new and
second-hand vessels.
'We are seeing the end of a 20-year bear market in new shipbuilding,'
predicts Mr Mark McVicar, shipping analyst at NatWest Securities.
At the same time, family-owned shipping companies are taking the opportunity
to restructure their businesses to make them more transparent, and hence
more attractive to the institutional investor.
Recent equity issues have included:
Bona Shipholding. Established as a private company last year to own and
operate the tanker and product fleet of Leif Hoegh, a Norwegian shipping
group, Bona is raising Dollars 120m and seeking an Oslo listing. Its shares
will also be traded in London and the US after the offer closes on December
16. The effect will be to reduce Leif Hoegh's stake from 76 to about 42 per
cent. London &amp; Overseas Freighters. Lofs, a London-listed company controlled
by the Kulukundis family, has placed Dollars 75m of new shares and obtained
a listing on the US Nasdaq market. This reduces the Kulukundis holding from
85 to 24 per cent and gives the company greater exposure to US investors.
First Olsen Tankers. This company was set up to take over most of the
midsize - 100,000 to 150,000 dwt - tanker interests of the Norwegian
shipping group Fred Olsen &amp; Co. It completed a Dollars 105m share offering
last month. The deal left Fred Olsen and associates with an unchanged 45 per
cent of the shares, but brought in new institutional shareholders and
created a more tax-efficient structure.
Other recent developments have included the listing in Oslo last June of
Smedvig Tankships via a Dollars 138m offering, a Dollars 53m share issue by
Benor Tankers, a Bermuda-registered operator of product carriers and a
Dollars 61m rights issue by the Swedish ICB Shipping.
The amounts of equity being raised are tiny compared with the billions which
will be needed to renew the world tanker fleet over the next few years.
Together they would buy just five new supertankers. But they are seen by
shipping analysts as a hopeful sign of revival in the tanker sector.
Underlying this flurry of stock market activity is the expectation of a rise
in the charter rates for tankers and bulk carriers. Rates for a reasonably
modern super-tanker are about Dollars 14,000 a day. Some analysts hope for
an improvement in rates in the new year. On this will depend whether there
are any more equity issues.
Expectations of an upturn in rates are based on forecasts of economic
recovery and an upturn in demand for oil. They also hinge on the end of the
chronic overcapacity in tankers, which has depressed earnings for the past
two decades.
This overcapacity dates from the early 1970s, when new tankers were leaving
the shipyards in record numbers. New tanker construction doubled in 1973 and
again in 1974 before peaking at more than 35m dwt in 1975, just when the oil
crisis cut off demand for capacity.
Except for a short upward blip in market rates before the US-led attack on
Iraq during the Gulf war, when large amounts of oil were pumped out of the
Gulf and stored in tankers, the market has been dogged by excess capacity.
But many of these tankers built in the early 1970s are approaching their
fourth five-year survey, which can be a costly event. 'After 20 years you
have to replace a lot of steel,' says Mr Matthew Stainer, shipping analyst
at Schroder Securities.
'Charter rates have been so low that a lot of tonnage has not been well
maintained. Over the next five years half of the tanker fleet will move past
its 20th birthday.'
This ageing of the fleet has coincided with the introduction of tough
environmental controls by the US government and the International Maritime
Organisation. The US regulations will force shipowners to modernise their
fleets or face the prospect of being barred from American waters.
The main threat hanging over shipowners is the US Oil Pollution Act of 1990,
introduced in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster off the coast of Alaska,
and other recent oil spills. Some provisions of the act will not work
through until well into the next century, but others, such as the
requirement for new tankers to have double hulls, have taken immediate
effect.
The tough liability imposed on shipowners by the OPA has persuaded some
tanker operators to restructure their shipping holdings, reducing their
direct stakes. The aim is to ensure that liability for a spill stops with
the tanker subsidiary and cannot be enforced on the parent company. 'They
want to reduce their catastrophe risk,' comments Mr Frans Hoyer, transport
analyst with SG Warburg Securities.
But the restructuring of the shipowners' holdings also reflects their desire
to create corporate structures more acceptable to investors.
'Investors want clean structures which will be acceptable to the major stock
exchanges,' comments Mr Stainer. 'They don't want conflicts of interest with
remote management companies or promoters' fees.'
Investors do not want a return to the late 1980s, which saw the launch of a
number of closed-end shipping investment funds. Many of these funds charged
management fees and often took a stake of up to 30 per cent in any capital
appreciation of the vessels involved. 'This left a bad taste,' said Mr
McVicar. More importantly, many investors lost money.
The shipping industry is still dominated by private owners, but analysts
believe that recent fund-raisings reflect a shift towards putting ships into
publicly owned companies. Even some of the famously secretive Greek
shipowning families are moving in this direction.
But there are limits to this trend. Making a profit from shipowning can
still depend more on a feel for the market - spotting when to buy or sell a
vessel or an entire fleet - than on shaving 10 per cent off running costs by
better management.
And for all the excitement generated by the analysts' graphs of supply and
demand, the sector is still notoriously dependent on the unexpected. A large
oil spill or political upset in the Middle East could throw out all the
clever calculations.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BTP improves 29% to Pounds 13m - Advance
assisted by three month contribution from MTM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the specialist chemical company which bought most of the assets of the
ailing MTM group for Pounds 106.7m in June, yesterday reported a 29 per cent
increase in interim profits reflecting the acquisition and organic growth.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 13m in the six months to September 30
from Pounds 10.1m in the year-ago period. Turnover jumped 32 per cent to
Pounds 130.7m (Pounds 99m).
Earnings per share improved 12 per cent to 7.04p (6.26p) and the interim
dividend is lifted to 3.45p (3.25p).
BTP's share price closed 6p higher at 292p.
The MTM operations, part of the group for three months in the first half,
contributed Pounds 19.8m to turnover and Pounds 2.15m to operating profits
which grew to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 10.3m). Excluding the seven MTM
businesses, all of which were profitable in the first half, operating
profits rose by 17.4 per cent.
Before the acquisition, two of MTM's businesses, one in the UK and one in
the US, had been losing about Pounds 2.5m a year. Mr Frank Buckley,
chairman, said the profit turnround had been achieved by discontinuing
lossmaking products and raising prices.
Following the acquisition BTP is now reporting fin-ancial details on four
sectors.
The largest of these, adhesives and textile coatings, reported sharply lower
operating profits of Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 3.8m), reflecting recession in
continental Europe, on turnover which expanded to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds
39.5m).
The performance chemicals division reported profits of Pounds 3.29m (Pounds
2.36m) on turnover of Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 15.6m). Excluding the MTM
operations profits improved by 11 per cent. The biocides and fine chemicals
division also showed strong growth with profits up at Pounds 4.43m (Pounds
1.99m) on turnover of Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 17.7m.).
The non-chemicals industrial division reported operating profits of Pounds
3.41m (Pounds 1.89m) on increased turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 26.2m)
helped by particularly strong growth in its safety harness business
reflecting tighter safety legislation in the US.
Net interest payments totalled Pounds 906,000 in the first half compared
with receipts of Pounds 75,000 in the year-ago period. The group ended
September with net borrowings of Pounds 33.8m against net borrowings of
Pounds 2m at the end of March.
Commenting on prospects Mr Buckley said, 'While we retain a cautious outlook
in the uncertain economic climate which prevails in a number of our markets,
we continue to view the future with confidence.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Countryside bounces back into the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Countryside Properties, one of south-east England's biggest housebuilders,
bounced back into the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.74m for the 12
months to September 30.
During the previous year the group incurred an Pounds 11.7m pre-tax loss,
after making exceptional provisions of Pounds 14.8m to compensate for
falling property values.
Mr Alan Cherry, chairman, said the improvement in house buyers' confidence
had been sustained following the Pounds 16.8m rights issue in May.
The profits increase, however, was lower than analysts had expected and the
shares slipped by 8p yesterday to 141p. This compared with the rights issue
price of 106p.
As expected the final dividend is maintained at 2.7p, making an unchanged
total of 4.11p, covered by earnings per share of 5.9p (losses of 16.6p).
The number of homes built by Countryside in the period jumped from 751 to
1,295. Almost 70 per cent of production was sold to housing associations or
similar social housing organisations.
Government finance for grants to housing associations is to be reduced in
1994-95. Associations would seek to maintain building programmes by pursuing
better value for money from experienced builders, Mr Cherry said.
Housing had made a Pounds 6m profit, compared with a Pounds 4.7m loss. The
number of private sector sales had risen from 282 to 393. Sales by value had
risen by 49 per cent.
Lower interest rates had made the initial cost of buying a home the cheapest
'for almost 20 years.'
The decision to phase out mortgage tax relief, also announced in the budget,
had been anticipated and was unlikely to have an adverse effect on the
gradual recovery in the housing market, said Mr Cherry.
The company was launching a range of low-cost houses to meet growing demand
from first time buyers.
The commercial property division also returned to the black, with profits of
Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 861,000 deficit). Property investment reduced its
annual loss from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 1.3m.
COMMENT
Feelings among analysts were very mixed following Countryside's results.
Disappointment that profits were not higher was seized on by critics as
further confirmation that the company never quite delivers all that it
promises. There was also concern at the extent of Countryside's housing
association sales in an increasingly competitive market. On the other hand
the group's large landbank will stand it in good stead as the private
housing market recovers. Profits from private house sales could easily
double this year. The sale of the group's property investment portfolio
would also dramatically improve the balance sheet, where gearing is
currently 100 per cent. Profits of Pounds 9.5m would put the group on a
prospective p/e of 13, which still looks cheap given the quality of the
landbank; but there are doubters.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone loss nearly halved at
Pounds 11.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McCarthy &amp; Stone, Britain's biggest builder of retirement homes, yesterday
reported a reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 11.2m
during the 12 months to the end of August.
The company added that for the first time in three years it had earned an
operating profit before interest, of Pounds 5.6m.
The reduced loss was assisted by a fall in exceptional provisions from
Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 7.8m to cover the cost of running down Quadrant, the
group's French business, and reorganising the UK business.
The company has substantially reduced the amount of working capital tied up
in stocks.
It has also gained an improvement in margins as prices have risen and the
need for sales incentives reduced as conditions in the housing market have
improved.
'Prices currently are running about 11 per cent higher than during the
corresponding period last year when the market was at a low ebb following
sterling's withdrawal from the ERM,' said Mr John McCarthy, chairman.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 73.7m to Pounds 71.1m. The group would be
seeking shareholders' approval to set off a cumulative deficit of Pounds 6m
against its share premium account. That would bring forward the date at
which it could resume ordinary and preference share dividends when
profitability improved, said Mr McCarthy.
The sale of the company's Peverel management company since the year end for
Pounds 30.7m had enabled it to reduce its borrowings to about Pounds 20m,
equivalent to about 30 per cent of shareholders funds.
Mr McCarthy said that the company was now well placed to take advantage of a
market which would grow substantially as the number of elderly people
reaching retirement age increased.

FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Power Corp cuts loss to IPounds
4.47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lower exceptional costs enabled Power Corporation, the Irish property group,
to cut its interim pre-tax loss from IPounds 75.2m to IPounds 4.47m (Pounds
4.24m).
For the six months to September 30 there was a IPounds 1.4m exceptional
charge for debt restructuring, against Pounds 72.7m costs relating to
property revaluations and putting the Trocadero Group into administrative
receivership.
Total income, including rents from all properties, amounted to IPounds
7.13m, against IPounds 5.87m.
Three months ago the company announced a IPounds 102.8m loss for the 1992-93
financial year, having taken a IPounds 97m exceptional charge on its
Trocadero Centre and Island Site developments in London and property
write-downs.
Mr Robin Power, chairman, said that in the period under review operating
expenses had been reduced substantially.
No disposals were made in the six months' period from the group's IPounds
85m portfolio of properties held for resale. In the present half sales
totalling IPounds 6.2m have been completed 'at satisfactory prices'.
The sale of its main asset, the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, is now more
likely to proceed as planned following the abandoning of plans by the Los
Angeles Unified School District to purchase compulsorily the site.
The refinancing of the San Francisco Centre has taken longer than planned,
the company said, although Mr Power said 'substantial progress' has been
made.
Losses per share came out at 3.84p (64.68p).

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Framlington Russian fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YURI BENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Framlington, the London-based investment manager, is launching the first
ever quoted Russian investment fund. Lord Howe, the former foreign
secretary, will be its chairman.
Its portfolio will consist mainly of stakes in small to medium-sized joint
ventures between Russian and western companies. It has already targeted six
such ventures in food processing, high technology such as space and
electronics, and consumer goods such as textiles.
Other investments are likely in companies which service the Russian oil and
mining industries. The fund will buy stakes averaging 20 per cent, worth
typically between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 4m.
Up to Dollars 75m (Pounds 50.3m) of the fund's shares will be placed with
institutions in the UK, continental Europe and North America. Subscriptions
to the closed-end, Luxembourg-regulated fund will close in mid-December
prior to share listing in Luxembourg and London.
The minimum stake is Dollars 100,000. The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is taking a Dollars 16m slice, and the International Finance
Corp is expected to take Dollars 8m.
Mr Connell Gallagher, Framlington's Russian investment analyst, forecasts
that the value of the fund's investments will grow by more than 30 per cent
a year over 10 years.
As well as political and economic risks, the prospectus warns institutions
that the fund's investments may be illiquid due to the lack of an
established Russian securities market. This may make it hard for the fund to
realise its full net asset value.
Mr Boris Jordan, Credit Suisse First Boston's Moscow-based director, says
the main risk of investing in Russia is the absence of a proper legal system
to protect shareholders' rights.
However, CSFB is positive about the fund's prospects: 'Russia is one of the
world's largest emerging economies,' says Mr Jordan. 'The sectors targeted
by the fund will be quite heavily invested over the next year, and most of
the interesting opportunities will quickly disappear.' Brokers to the fund
are Smith New Court, Bank Austria, and CCF Elysees Bourse, a division of
Credit Commercial de France, the French bank which is Framlington's majority
shareholder.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sage growth continues with rise to Pounds
9.66m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sage Group closed up 31p at 475p as the Newcastle-based accounting
software and stationery supplier continued an unbroken run of growth in
turnover, pre-tax profits and earnings per share since going public in 1989.
The City was relieved that Sage made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.66m, 9 per
cent ahead of last year's Pounds 8.85m and only Pounds 1.2m under
expectations, after a profits warning in July.
Turnover rose 51 per cent to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 27.3m), split between the
UK (Pounds 22.1m), the US (Pounds 14.3m) and France (Pounds 4.9m).
Earnings per share increased by 5 per cent to 32.5p (30.9p) while a final
dividend of 6.6p lifts the total to 9.92p (9.02p).
Despite acquisitions costing Pounds 5.8m, year-end cash balances were Pounds
4.2m, compared with Pounds 7.2m last time.
Mr David Goldman, chairman, said that the group had taken action to deal
with problems in several parts of the business in a generally unhelpful
year: 'Current trading trends indicate that Sage should see continuing
growth and an improvement in profitability this year'.
Sage specialises in accounting software for medium-sized and smaller
businesses. It has recently entered the important but low margin SoHo -
small office, home office - sector with a version of its Sterling accounting
system.
Mr Goldman noted: 'Maintenance income amounted to Pounds 7.8m, an increase
of 41 per cent over the previous year with one in five of our registered
users opting to buy ongoing support services from the group'.
COMMENT
Sage has a hard won reputation for sound, undramatic management but it has
had its work cut out to cope with problems in its US acquisitions DacEasy
and Remote Control International. It has also had to accelerate the
migration of its existing products from the DOS operating system to Windows,
Microsoft's graphical interface. It now seems to have solved distribution
problems for DacEasy in the US - which had caused a 'bloodbath' according to
Mr Kevin Howe, DacEasy chief executive - continued the development of RCI's
Telemagic telephone marketing system and launched Windows versions of the
critical programs. Analysts were mollified by the speed with which Sage
tackled these problems and are looking for Pounds 12.5m in pre-tax profits
next year. The shares still look undervalued compared to the sector and
should be set to advance further.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Blick improves 10% to Pounds 9.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blick, the communications systems and time products company which acquired
Time and Security for Pounds 57.6m in October, yesterday reported full year
pre-tax profits slightly ahead of forecasts made at the time of its rights
issue to partly fund the deal.
Pre-tax profits increased by 9.7 per cent to Pounds 9.41m in the year to
September 30, compared with profits of Pounds 8.58m.
Earnings per share increased by 4.1 per cent to 27.06p (26p) and the final
dividend is increased to 6.9p (6.2p), making a total for the year of 10.2p
(9.2p).
Nevertheless, Blick's shares closed down 5p at 440p.
Turnover increased by a relatively modest 6.4 per cent to Pounds 32.8m
(Pounds 30.9m), including Pounds 1.93m attributable to acquisitions.
Public address systems turnover growth was particularly strong, as were
exports which grew by 24 per cent.
However, Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director, said the overall turnover
figure masked strong growth in rental income which increased by 16.5 per
cent to Pounds 15.8m and more than offset a slight decline in outright
sales.
The group is emphasising rentals as its preferred growth route. At the end
of September its gross future rentals under contract totalled Pounds 87m but
the Time and Security acquisition is expected to almost double this to
Pounds 167m.
Operating profit rose by 12.3 per cent to Pounds 8.89m (Pounds 7.92m)
including Pounds 57,000 from acquisitions.
The improved operating profits came despite modest but unquantified
restructuring costs, mainly related to the group's time division.
Net interest receipts fell from Pounds 664,000 to Pounds 517,000, mainly
reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on the group's cash bal-ances
which stood at Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 7.35m) at the end of September.
As foreshadowed in October, in order to finance the Time and Security
acquisition the group used not only its own cash surplus and the proceeds of
the Pounds 20m rights issue, but also put in place Pounds 40m of bank loans
and guarantee facilities.
As a result the group is geared for the first time since its flotation in
1986.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Vacant space behind 19% decline at In Shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Shops, the retail and office centres operator, saw profits dip 19 per
cent to Pounds 735,000 pre-tax in its first half to September 30, against
Pounds 903,000.
During the first half, Millbank, which with its chain of Job Lot stores was
acquired last August, contributed Pounds 1.64m to total turnover of Pounds
14.3m. Turnover of continuing operations was marginally higher at Pounds
11m.
The high level of vacant space in In Shops' centres caused profits to drop,
but recently there has been some improvement, opening the way to higher
profits in the second half.
The Birmingham-based group sold Executive Centres, its lossmaking chain of
serviced offices, shortly after the period-end for a nominal Pounds 1 to the
Fuchs family, which had been involved in the business before its acquisition
by In Shops.
The disposal appears in the accounts as a loss of Pounds 5.04m which is more
than offset by a provision of Pounds 5.52m set up in the previous year.
The disposal, combined with Millbank, has repositioned In Shops as a retail
specialist. Next month Job Lot will expand from the north into the Midlands
and south of England.
Earnings per share on continuing activities were 1.25p, against 1.7p.
The interim dividend, up from 0.66p to 0.7p, is being paid on capital
enlarged by the share sale to pay for Millbank.

Feedback, the USM-quoted designer and maker of electronic, electrical and

340,600 to Pounds 267,900 for the six months to September 30.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 4.47m (Pounds 4.53m), reflecting continued
uncertainties in the domestic industrial market, Mr John Westcott, chairman,
said.
Feedback Instruments improved its performance while Feedback Data remained
in profit, Mr Westcott said. However, the US operation continued to be
affected by tight state budgets and incurred a loss in the period.
An interim dividend of 0.5p is declared from earnings of 2.13p (2.41p) per

As an indication of their expectations for the full 12 months they are
lifting the interim dividend from 0.6p to 0.7p. Fully diluted earnings per

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sycamore in restructuring talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sycamore Holdings has called an extraordinary meeting on January 28 to
consider steps to deal with the deterioration in the group's assets.
Directors said that the value of net assets had fallen to less than half of
the company's called up share capital. This had been caused by a substantial
deterioration in the trading position of Ashworth Living and Warwill, they
added.
The Warwill factory was closed in August and assets subsequently sold, while
Ashworth Living had been totally restructured, directors said.
On the basis of the new business strategy, the board is in discussions with
its bankers for a capital reconstruction. The board said that it hoped to be
in a position to put the proposals to shareholders in the near future.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Shaftesbury consolidates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shaftesbury, the property group, consolidated its return to profit in the 12
months to September 30 with Pounds 1.01m before tax, against a restated loss
of Pounds 5.29m.
The latest result followed a Pounds 344,000 pre-tax profit in the first
half, against a Pounds 1.27m loss.
The year saw completion of the disposal of the development portfolio and the
conclusion of trading activities of associated companies.
The pre-tax loss for the year to end-September 1992 was restated to reflect
a Pounds 616,000 increase in provisions related to associated undertakings.
Mr Peter Levy, chairman, said he believed the company had embarked on 'a
period of growth.' The Pounds 20.8m raised in August via a placing had
enabled Shaftesbury to exploit investment opportunities.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Prospect falls slightly to Pounds 4.02m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospect Industries, which provides specialist engineering services to the
power generating and process industries, yesterday reported pre-tax profits
down from Pounds 4.44m to Pounds 4.02m for the year to end-September.
The outcome was struck after a Pounds 283,000 charge relating to an abortive
acquisition and a Pounds 713,000 loss arising from disposals and was struck
on increased turnover of Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 52.5m) - including Pounds
594,000 (Pounds 6.69m) from discontinued operations. Comparatives have been
restated to comply with FRS 3.
At the operating level, profits from continuing operations showed an advance
from Pounds 4.78m to Pounds 5.42m.
The interest charge fell from Pounds 588,000 to Pounds 366,000 and tax took
Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.26m). The proposed final dividend of 0.525p (0.5p)
makes a total of 0.8p (0.75p) and comes from fully diluted earnings of 1.12p
(1.95p) per share.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 5.5m and Pounds 6m,
putting the shares on a prospective multiple of about 10.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Taking a laid-back attitude to marketing -
Airsprung Furniture turns in 8% increase to Pounds 2.5m despite 'fierce
competition'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airsprung Furniture, the UK's second-largest bed manufacturer, lifted
pre-tax profits by 8 per cent from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds 2.5m in the half
year to September 30.
Turnover grew by 15 per cent to Pounds 33m with operating profit rising to
Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 2.2m).
Earnings per share improved to 6.41p (5.91p) and the interim dividend is
increased to 1.7p (1.575p).
Mr John Pierce, chief executive, said: 'There has been some of the fiercest
com-petition we have seen for some while, with no help from the economy and
everybody slugging away for market share.'
Since the start of the recession, and despite the weakness of the housing
market, rising sales have resulted in an increase in the company's workforce
from 1,200 to 1,550 over the year.
After Silentnight, Airsprung sells the most beds in Britain, with about 15
per cent of the Pounds 350m market. Its relative anonymity, compared with
Silentnight and smaller companies such as Relyon, is a consequence of its
strategy to let the retailer do the marketing.
'We don't believe in branding - it is the retailer who controls what the
customer buys,' said Mr Michael Coppel, joint chairman. 'We divert all
marketing and support to the retailer. Brand imaging would cost us Pounds 2m
a year and someone has to pay for it.'
The strategy avoids an expensive advertising contest, which would not
increase the overall market. Beds are a 'distress purchase' - nobody buys
one until it is essential.
Despite severe competition at the quality end of the market, Airsprung's
bedding sales were up by 12 per cent in the half-year. But profits suffered
in the upholstery division - which accounts for nearly a third of group
sales - because of squeezed margins and bad debts. There was a profits
improvement in the smaller pine furniture division.
Airsprung, with its origins dating to the 19th century, is still 42 per cent
owned by the family of Mr John Yates, grandson of the founder, but has only
had a full listing since 1991.
In management changes this summer, Mr Coppel became joint chairman, with Mr
Yates and Mr Pierce succeeding Mr Coppel as chief executive.
Mr Mark Hudson, small companies analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said:
'It is not run as a family fiefdom; it is run as a very professional public
company.'
The company, based on a 28-acre freehold site in its home town of
Trowbridge, Wiltshire, has expanded in recent years by acquisitions of such
businesses as Duckers, the pine furniture maker, and Gimson &amp; Slater and
Bymacks, the upholsterers.
The subsidiaries are given as much autonomy as possible. Mr Coppel said: 'We
won't buy a company if it doesn't have good management - which we retain.'
'The subsidiary management is like the board management - very conscious of
costs, quality and servicing the customer and, if you get all that right,
you've got a very successful company. '
As part of the control of costs, staff are trained to have at least two
skills, so that if work is slack in one area they can transfer to another.
Stocks of finished goods are not held, but made to order, with MFI supplied
with its own-label beds in nine days. This year, Pounds 1m has been spent on
a distribution centre at Trowbridge.
Given that there can be no rapid increase in the bedding market, Airsprung
seeks to grow by improving market share and further acquisitions.
It wants to be less dependent upon bedding and expand its upholstery and
pine divisions, although upholstery is vulnerable to the low-cost of entry
into the market.
'It is a constant battle which has a depressing effect on prices,' Mr Pierce
said.
The manufacture and retailing of beds and furniture is, however, undergoing
a similar restructuring to the food industry, favouring larger companies
with national distribution.
'The industry dynamic is towards the players who can deal in volume and can
make the capital investment that is required to be cost efficient,' Mr
Hudson said.
'The small companies will increasingly become niche players supplying niche
retailers.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Trading warning clips 4p from Avon Rubber
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Avon Rubber slipped back in a buoyant market yesterday as the
group warned of a toughening trading environment in spite of an 18 per cent
increase in annual pre-tax profits.
The shares closed 4p down at 484p.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to October 2 rose from Pounds 9.4m to
Pounds 11m. Sales were 14 per cent higher at Pounds 265.7m.
Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive, said that in spite of an 'excellent
perfor-mance' from the main tyres division, recession in con-tinental Europe
was likely to affect trading in the current year.
'We are going to be hard pushed to make another gain,' he said. Vehicle
output on the Continent was estimated to have fallen by about 20 per cent.
The tyre division increased operating profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 6.4m
on sales just 5 per cent higher at Pounds 82.7m. The current year had begun
somewhat 'slower than we had hoped', said Mr Mitchard.
The downturn in the European vehicle industry had hit the components
division which nevertheless managed to increase operating profits by 13 per
cent to Pounds 3.9m. Sales were 26 per cent higher at Pounds 99.8m.
The technical products business, which includes Avon's defence related
products, had 'fired on all cylinders', said Mr Mitchard, resulting in a 9
per cent increase in profits to Pounds 5m. Sales were 17 per cent higher at
Pounds 70.3m.
Cadillac, based in the US, had been held back by a squeeze on prices from
General Motors, one of its main customers. The group had lost about Dollars
2m (Pounds 1.3m) in busi-ness, as a result. However, sales were 10 per cent
higher in dollar terms, said Mr Mitchard, due to greater demand from US
vehicle manufacturers.
The inflatables business, which returned a loss of Pounds 403,000 against a
profit of Pounds 25,000 last time, continued to be difficult. It was
uncertain whether this would remain a core business for Avon, he said.
The final dividend was maintained at 11.5p for a total of 16.5p (16.5p). The
5 per cent rise in earnings to 30p was held back by the Pounds 22m rights
issue in May.

11% increase

<TEXT>
United Drug, the Irish pharmaceutical distributor, reported an 11 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 3.44m (Pounds 3.3m) on turnover up 79
per cent to IPounds 136m for the year ending September 30.
The result included a first-time contribution from Alchem, Northern
Ireland's largest pharmaceutical distributor, which was bought for IPounds
5.16m a year ago in a 13-for-8 share swap offer, which brokers anticipated
would result in a combined turnover of about IPounds 110m and a pre-tax
profit of IPounds 4m for a full year.
Mr Jerry Liston, chief executive, said turmoil in the Irish financial
markets in the last quarter of 1992 'contributed to a general lack of
consumer confidence . . . and impacted on the slack trading conditions
experienced in our consumer products division.'
He said that government restraints on healthcare spending, reduction in
pharmaceutical prices which became effective in August 1993, and a 'highly
competitive marketplace' also affected the result. Net interest charges were
IPounds 888,000, but following a rights issue last June, the group 'returned
to a positive net cash position at year-end.'
Diluted earnings were 16.54p (17.2p) and a final dividend of 4.8p makes a
total of 7p (6.7p).

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Mansfield Brewery advances 12%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mansfield Brewery yesterday fought off the effects of a wet summer and
recession to report a 12 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from
Pounds 6.65m to Pounds 7.47m.
Sir David White, chairman, said the group had benefited from tight cost
controls and a widening distribution base for its quality brands.
Sales for the six months to September 25 fell from Pounds 60.8m to Pounds
60m, with the sharpest fall in volumes of lower margin packaged beers. These
declined by 10.7 per cent. While the regional draught beer market was
estimated to have fallen by 5.4 per cent in the first half, Mansfield saw
comparable sales decline by just 1.8 per cent, Sir David said.
There was strong growth in the sales of its own brands, such as Riding
Bitter which increased volumes by 7 per cent, and Old Bailey Strong Bitter,
up 22 per cent. Mansfield Bitter fell by 2.9 per cent.
Operating profits, which rose from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 9.9m, had been held
back by discounting. This had been necessary to maintain sales to the free
trade, which increased by 2.3 per cent, Sir David said.
Mansfield spent Pounds 6.2m to purchase four new outlets and four sites.
This had been financed out of cash flow. In spite of this expenditure,
Mansfield still managed to reduce its net debt of Pounds 63.2m to Pounds
57.9m, for gearing of 39 per cent.
The interim dividend is increased 14 per cent to 1.25p (1p). Earnings were
12 per cent higher at 8.04p against 7.2p.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Food side boost for Greenalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hordes of hungry drinkers helped Greenalls, the pubs and hotels company, to
increase annual pre-tax profits by 19 per cent before exceptionals to Pounds
68.3m.
Sales were 13 per cent ahead at Pounds 596m for the year to September 24.
Pre-tax profits, after exceptional charges of Pounds 15m in 1992, rose by 61
per cent.
Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman, said the 25 per cent increase in food sales to
pub customers had helped the group to return 'a solid performance in what
has not been an easy market'.
Beer consumption was still under pressure, he said, with sales 3.3 per cent
lower than last year.
Devenish, the 550-strong pubs chain acquired for Pounds 214m in July,
contributed Pounds 18.5m in sales and Pounds 4.8m in operating profit. Mr
Thomas said he was confident that the integration benefits highlighted at
the time of the acquisition would be more than achieved.
All divisions, with the exception of the fruit machines and drinks business,
improved during the year. Drinks and leisure had been hit by a 'very
difficult first half for soft drinks,' Mr Thomas said. However, trading had
stabilised in the second half.
The pubs division, excluding Devenish, showed a 6 per cent increase in
operating profit to Pounds 50.3m on sales just 2.3 per cent higher at Pounds
190.2m.
The branded pub restaurant and lodge business increased by 19 per cent at
the operating level to Pounds 10m.
Greenalls' hotels division benefited from improved occupancy rates of 67 per
cent, against 60 per cent last year, and a return to profit in the US.
Occupancy had been improved at the expense of average room prices, however,
which fell from Pounds 48 to Pounds 43.
The off-licence division was held back by redundancy charges and stiffer
competition from supermarket chains. Off-licences showed a marginal 0.6 per
cent improvement in operating profits to Pounds 4.5m.
The group took a Pounds 77m write-down against its revaluation reserve to
cover its hotels and pubs. Mr Thomas said that in the light of recent
controversy surrounding hotel valuations, the company had decided to examine
the portfolio 'fairly carefully'.
The final dividend is increased to 7.28p for a total 5 per cent higher at
12.36p. Earnings were 59 per cent higher at 28.55p, although just 4 per cent
higher to 28.46p before exceptionals.
COMMENT
Investors who felt Greenalls had paid what was politely called 'a full
price' for Devenish will be pleased at the better than expected progress so
far. The group has also shown unexpected resilience in non-pubs businesses.
Nevertheless, even Greenalls is making cautionary noises about the immediate
outlook for beer consumption and it is uncertain just how much more can be
taken out of the already lean Devenish. The hotels business is also likely
to be a late cycle developer. Forecasts are for about Pounds 84m, with a
prospective p/e of 14 times. Although the shares are sitting at a small
discount to the market, it might still be early days.

The Irish stock market was taken by surprise yesterday with a IPounds 57.8m
(Pounds 55m) cash call from Anglo Irish Bank Corporation, the Dublin-based
banking group.
The rights issue of 121.7m shares on a 1-for-1 basis at 50p has been
underwritten by AIB Capital Markets and Paribas Capital Markets. The shares
closed down 6p at 56p.
The company intends to maintain the present level of dividend on the
enlarged share capital 'in the absence of unforeseen circumstances'.
Mr Sean Fitzpatrick, chief executive, said the reason for the issue was
'strategic rather than transactional, to move the bank up to a different
league'.
He added: 'No acquisitions are intended or targeted at this particular
moment.'
The increased market capitalisation would put it in the top 15 stocks traded
on the Irish stock exchange, he said, 'which will be good for liquidity'. As
institutions focused more on the larger, more liquid stocks 'there is a
danger if we are not up there that our shares could practically stop trading
in a few years' time'.
The money raised will be used as leverage to raise a similar amount in
second-tier capital over the next two years. Two thirds will be applied to
new lending in the Irish market, the remainder in the UK.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the bank had no plans to diversify either
geographically, or out of the niche middle-market and professional sectors,
but would build market share through organic growth and the purchase of loan
books.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fife chairman accuses dissident
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hostile struggle for control of Fife Indmar was stepped up yesterday
when Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman of the Scottish engineering and distribution
company, accused rebel shareholders of publishing misleading information.
Mr Hepburn, who is fighting moves to unseat him, said a dissident circular
sent to shareholders exaggerated the group's pre-tax losses and gearing, and
criticised boardroom pay rises 'mischievously'.
Rejecting the circular, he said claims that Charles Carpenter, a Fife
subsidiary, had incurred accumulated losses of Pounds 1.2m in the two years
to December 31 1992, were inflated by Pounds 905,000.
Gearing in 1991, meanwhile, was 83 per cent and not 93 per cent as alleged,
he added.
He also told shareholders that criticism of directors' payments - which rose
from Pounds 87,000 in 1988 to Pounds 255,000 last year - was unjustified
because they were linked to group performance.
The rebel allegations were made by Mr Charles McDonald, a current director,
and Mr Guido Crolla, a Scottish businessman, who together control 10.4 per
cent of the company. They aim to oust Mr Hepburn and fellow director Mr
Michael Munro at an extraordinary meeting next week and become chairman and
managing director respectively.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Airtours acquires Tradewinds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours, the UK's second largest holiday tour operator after Thomson, has
acquired one of the UK's leading long-haul brand names.
Tradewinds has been acquired from International Travel Connections, a
privately-owned company based in Chester, for Pounds 250,000 cash.
Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, said the acquisition provided a
new opportunity to offer exotic holidays to long-haul destinations.
The new product would appeal to a segment of the market not presently
covered by Airtours.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Overseas growth behind rise to Pounds 2.7m
at Courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth overseas helped Courts, the retail furnisher, report pre-tax
profits ahead 43 per cent at Pounds 2.72m for the half year to September 26,
against Pounds 1.9m, writes Nigel Clark.
The result was struck after a charge to deferred profit of Pounds 769,000,
compared with a credit of Pounds 1.4m. The turnround was the result of
increased overseas activity and represented the payments to date on hire
purchase sales.
Turnover rose 26 per cent to Pounds 105.8m with a 9 per cent rise in the UK
and 46 per cent overseas. Favourable exchange rates accounted for 24 per
cent of the overseas growth.
Earnings advanced to 3.94p (1.23p) and the interim dividend is 2p (1.83p).
Trading in the UK showed a slight improvement although the south of England,
where most of the group's stores are situated, was still suffering from
recession.
Overseas, the principle increases in turnover were seen in Singapore,
Mauritius, Malaysia, Barbados and Jamaica. In November a share placing and
sale by its Singapore offshoot raised Pounds 21.5m and cut Courts' holding
to 58.5 per cent.

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Strong NFC looks confident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the transport group which yesterday launched a Pounds 263m rights
issue, said that it was too early to make a forecast of the outcome for
1994, but said it viewed the future with confidence.
Pre-tax profits increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 104.9m in the year to
October 2 on turnover ahead 10 per cent to Pounds 1.9bn. NFC said growth in
its core businesses of Exel Logistics, BRS, Allied, Pickfords and Merchants
was more impressive, with turnover up 16 per cent and operating profits
ahead 35 per cent.
Allied, Pickfords and Merchants were more affected by economic conditions
and weak housing markets than the other two businesses, but made steady
progress with operating profit up 24 per cent at Pounds 28.8m.
Operations in the US and mainland Europe benefited from the devaluation of
sterling and the effect of acquisitions in previous years. Devaluation
boosted turnover by Pounds 116.3m and operating profit by Pounds 5.6m. The
net pen-sion credit increased by Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 19.9m and redundancy
costs were reduced from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 9.9m.
Exceptional items included Pounds 50m profit from the sale of the waste
management activities; an adjustment to the profit on the disposal in the
previous year of Pickfords Travel of Pounds 1.5m, and a profit of Pounds
3.3m on the disposal of properties.
These were offset by a provision of Pounds 45m for the reorganisation of
continuing operations.
Lynx, the parcels operation, incurred an operating loss of Pounds 10.1m
following problems with the start-up of a new hub at Nuneaton. The group
said a new management team had managed to reduce the rate of loss, but the
company was not yet profitable.
Mr Peter Sherlock, NFC's chief executive, said the group would continue to
pursue appropriate corrective action and to examine all options to address
the situation - including disposal.
Earnings per share under FRS 3 rose 33 per cent to 15.9p (11.9p).
Excluding exceptionals, earnings rose by 22 per cent to 13.1p (10.7p). A
final dividend of 2.6p gives a total for the year of 7p (6.55p), a rise of 7
per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMC Industries is exercising its option to subscribe for 6.95m shares at 7p
in International Communication &amp; Data, the marketing services company. The
move has triggered a mandatory 9 1/2 p a share offer for ICD.
IMC, the USM-quoted soft drinks and leisure group, will have a 10.8 per cent
stake following the exercise. The company and its supporters hold a total of
28.27 per cent as well as warrants to subscribe for a further 1.38m shares.
The offer is deliberately pitched low and IMC said it did not wish to gain

FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Changes to FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following notice was issued yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices
Committee.
The Committee today approved the quarterly changes to the UK Series of the
FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices, to be made on Monday, December 20 1993.
FT-SE 100
For inclusion: Eastern Electricity, Scottish Hydro-Electric.
For exclusion: Northern Foods, NFC.
FT-SE Mid 250 and FT-SE Actuaries 350
For inclusion: Gartmore, London Insurance Market, DFS Furniture, Heywood
Williams, EFM Dragon, Frogmore Estates, Murray Smaller Markets.
For exclusion: Tiphook, Micro Focus, Babcock International, Betterware,
Shanks &amp; McEwan, Taunton Cider, Phote-Me International.
Companies promoted from the FT-SE Mid 250 to the FT-SE 100 will be replaced
in the FT-SE Mid 250 by those companies excluded from the FT-SE 100.
Companies excluded from the FT-SE Mid 250/FT-SE Actuaries 350 will be
included in the FT-SE SmallCap.
The Committee also approved the inclusion of the following new issues in the
FT-SE SmallCap and the All-Share with effect from December 20 1993:
Carpetright, Crockfords, Field Group, Phonelink, RJB Mining.
The next quarterly review will be held on March 9 1994.
The Committee has now completed its consideration of the future treatment of
enhanced scrip dividends (ESDs).
As from December 31 1993, the ESD will be split into two components; the
value of the gross cash dividend will be treated as income and an adjustment
will be made to the capital index to reflect the difference between the
gross cash dividend and the ESD.
This will mean that the capital index will fall on the ex dividend date to
reflect the value of only the gross cash dividend.

FT  09 DEC 93 / AEG acts to move out of the red

<TEXT>
AEG is to sell its household appliances business to Electrolux of Sweden in
a radical shake-out designed to return the loss-making Daimler-Benz
subsidiary to the break-even point in 1995.
Other projects outlined by AEG yesterday include joint ventures with General
Electric of the US, a new structure for its railways operations,
collaboration deals, and the disposal of 'fringe' businesses in lighting and
meters.
Mr Georg Stockl, AEG chairman, said the changes would reduce turnover from
DM11bn (Pounds 4.3bn) last year to DM9.3bn, and the payroll from 60,000 to
48,000. The company would be known as AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie.
Mr Stockl gave no details of the price expected for the appliances business,
in which Electrolux already has a 10 per cent stake, but said the Swedish
group had agreed to keep open the company's three German factories.
The deal would give Electrolux an estimated 35 per cent of the German white
goods market, compared with 20 per cent, and would increase its share of the
European market from 25 per cent to some 30 per cent.
Completion of the deal depends on approval by the European Commission
competition office. However, the group does not foresee regulatory problems,
partly because most of its sales in Germany are generated through an
intermediary which is free to choose a different supplier. Early signals
suggest the authorities are satisfied that there is enough heavyweight
competition, such as Whirlpool and Bosch-Siemens.
Mr Stockl said a letter of intent had been signed with GE for the US group
to take a majority stake in AEG's low voltage switchgear business. GE was
also to manage a joint venture embracing both companies' interests in drives
automation.
AEG is known to be seeking a partner for its loss-making DM1.5bn-a-year
railways business. Further savings are expected from intra-group deals under
which AEG is to take full control of Daimler's micro-electronics business.
The changes at AEG are part of the rationalisation of Daimler-Benz,
Germany's biggest industrial concern. Its Deutsche-Aerospace (Dasa)
subsidiary, for instance, recently announced the closure of six German sites
and warned of further cuts.

FT  09 DEC 93 / NFC to raise Pounds 263m in first rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the UK-based transport and logistics group, yesterday launched a Pounds
263m rights issue - the first since the group was privatised by an employee
buy-out in 1982.
After the issue, NFC will have net cash of Pounds 89.4m - a turnround from
gearing of 53 per cent. It plans to expand its distribution and house-moving
businesses internationally.
The rights issue reflects NFC's unusual share structure. About 45 per cent
of the company's shares are in private hands and 85 per cent of the group's
32,000 employees are shareholders.
The 1-for-4 issue is priced at 195p and NFC's shares closed 13p higher at
247p. Small shareholders who do not wish to take up their rights will be
offered 14p per new share to which they are entitled by BZW, which is
underwriting the issue.
Mr Peter Sherlock, NFC's new chief executive, said the issue would increase
the number of shares available to institutional investors, but he stressed
he did not want to lose NFC's distinctive culture - which includes an annual
meeting attended by more than 1,000 shareholders.
He said: 'It is much easier to articulate a philosophy of enhancing
shareholder value if 85 per cent of the employees are shareholders. But we
must not let it act as a restraint on the business, which employees also
understand.'
Current employees - who constitute 14 per cent of the share register - have
double voting rights, but only so long as their total stake is more than 10
per cent. Even if no employees take up their rights, their share of the
register would only fall to 11 per cent, so there is no immediate threat to
their special position, but it is clearly on the way out.
The 14p per new share being offered to investors with fewer than 150,000
shares is the midpoint between the rights issue price and the theoretical
ex-rights price, based on Tuesday's closing price of 234p, minus the
grossed-up dividend for which the new shares do not rank. BZW will
underwrite 62 per cent of the shares at 195p and the 38 per cent held by
smaller shareholders at the higher price of 209p. Cazenove and UBS are joint

FT  09 DEC 93 / Barbarians waiting at the gate: The importance of the
Paramount case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for entertainment group
Paramount Communications could be decided in a hearing which opens today in
the Delaware Supreme Court. Just as important is the precedent the ruling
will set for other US bids.
The case is the most significant since the landmark Time-Warner judgment
four years ago. At its heart is a controversial issue: what are a board's
obligations to shareholders during a takeover battle? In particular, what
right does it have to ignore or obstruct a hostile offer in favour of a
lower priced friendly takeover, which directors maintain is better for the
company long-term?
US boards have been allowed by law to build up a panoply of defensive
mechanisms to frustrate bids. This is in contrast with the UK, where
takeovers are fought on an essentially level playing field with shareholders
holding the whip hand.
The Delaware Supreme Court will consider Paramount's appeal against a recent
judgment by the state's chancery court. Judge Jack Jacobs blocked the
proposed Dollars 9.5bn friendly takeover of Paramount by Viacom - the cable
television company - on the grounds that Paramount's board had not
adequately considered a higher hostile offer from QVC Network, a television
home shopping group.
He also threw out a special 'lock-up' agreement under which Paramount gave
Viacom the right to buy its shares at Dollars 69.14 each - the price of the
original takeover agreement - if the company were sold to a higher bidder.
He said the lock-ups, worth some Dollars 400m, were unprecedented and would
discourage other bidders.
If the Supreme Court upholds the chancery court's judgment, victory in the
Paramount battle will go to the highest bidder. If it accepts Paramount's
appeal, QVC will probably be forced to bow out, leaving Viacom the victor.
Whatever the ruling, it will affect US takeover conduct which is largely
determined by legal precedents set in the courts of Delaware. The tiny state
has set itself up as a congenial home for business and many leading
companies are incorporated there.
A legal touchstone for a board's duties in a takeover battle is the Delaware
Supreme Court's 1985 judgment in the contest for cosmetics group Revlon. The
court said that when it became clear to Revlon's board that the company was
going to be sold, 'the directors' role changed from defenders of the
corporate bastion to auctioneers charged with getting the best price for
stockholders'.
In 1989, however, the court upheld the right of the board of Time Inc, the
publishing group, to reject a hostile offer from Paramount in favour of a
lower priced friendly one from Warner Brothers. The reasoning was that it
was the 'business judgment' of Time's directors that a merger with Warner
would be in the company's long-term strategic interests. 'Directors are not
obliged to abandon a deliberately conceived corporate plan for short-term
shareholder profits unless there is clearly no basis to sustain the
corporate strategy,' the court said.
That ruling, which surprised much of the legal profession, gave corporate
boards a powerful weapon against hostile bids, and it contributed to the
demise of the takeover wave of the 1980s.
The Paramount case, the first big US takeover battle for several years,
provides Delaware with the opportunity to cast a fresh eye over its
Time-Warner ruling.
If Judge Jacobs' decision is upheld, it will limit the scope of the 1989
verdict and put a degree of power in shareholders' hands. He ruled that
Paramount's deal with Viacom triggered 'Revlon duties' to put the company up
for auction. By failing to give proper consideration to QVC's offer, the
Paramount board had breached its obligations to investors.
Why is Paramount's position different from Time's? According to Judge
Jacobs, because the takeover involves not a merger but the sale of
Paramount. Control of the group will pass to Mr Sumner Redstone, the
chairman of Viacom, who owns 85 per cent of his company's voting stock. The
deal therefore represents the last chance for shareholders to obtain a
premium for control.
Paramount will argue that if the judgment stands, a company with a
controlling stockholder like Mr Redstone can never enter a strategic merger
with a publicly controlled company - except through an auction based on
short-term stock market valuations. The new ruling, it argues, also
'eviscerates the business judgment of directors' and discourages boards from
developing strategic plans.
Critics of Delaware's Time-Warner judgment argue that the takeover rules
should always allow investors to sell their shares to the highest bidder.
The more cynical maintain that part of the motivation was Delaware's desire
to keep the chairmen of American companies sweet.
The court faces a delicate balancing act in the Paramount case. On the one
hand, it will not want to antagonise boards and undermine its credibility by
stepping back from the Time-Warner ruling. On the other, it will be aware
that corporate power is shifting from boards to aggressive institutional
investors, who abominate anti-takeover devices and are still smarting from
the Time-Warner case.

FT  09 DEC 93 / East Midlands adds to surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity companies in England and Wales saw a second day of
strong share price growth after East Midlands Electricity unveiled a 19 per
cent dividend increase on the back of pre-tax profits up 13 per cent at
Pounds 64m.
Helped by an announcement that it was splitting the role of chief executive
and chairman, East Midlands was among the main beneficiaries. Its shares
rose 15p to 631p. Other gains were Manweb, up 17p at 716p, and Norweb, up
15p at 703p.
East Midlands pushed up its interim dividend from 5.72p to 6.8p. The rise
was slightly less than the 20 per cent bestowed by two other regional
companies, but analysts saw scope for East Midlands to match others for the
full year.
Mr Norman Askew, recruited from TI in July 1992, will become chief executive
from April, replacing Mr John Harris in that role. Mr Harris will remain
executive chairman. His dual role has been one reason why the company's
shares have been among the least favoured in the sector.
Apart from East Midlands, only two regional electricity companies, Northern
and Norweb, have chairmen who are also chief executive. Immediately after
privatisation three years ago the role was combined in virtually all
regional companies.
East Midlands' pre-tax profits of Pounds 64m in the six months to September
30 compare with Pounds 56.5m last time, restated to reflect new coal
contracts which are weighted towards the second half of the year.
Turnover was Pounds 666.2m, against Pounds 681.5m, and earnings per share
22p, up from 18.9p.
East Midlands said it was on target to reduce costs in the core electricity
business by Pounds 15m a year. The programme, costing Pounds 8m to
implement, involves cutting 500 jobs, leaving it with 4,100 against about
4,850 at privatisation. The reduction in the current year is about 300.
Mr Harris said the cost cutting would give the company a strong position to
enter negotiations with the industry regulator in the forthcoming
distribution business review. 'We will do as well as anyone because of our
cost base,' he said.
Of the non-core activities, Ambassador in security made standstill profits
of Pounds 900,000, and WJ Furse in lightning protection was 26 per cent up.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Warning from Courtaulds Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Courtaulds Textiles fell 10 per cent yesterday after the UK group
warned that pre-tax profits for the year about to end would be below market
expectations.
The announcement was an unwelcome swansong from Mr Martin Taylor, the
youthful chairman of Courtaulds Textiles, who next month starts his new role
as chief executive of Barclays, the UK's largest bank. However, Mr Taylor,
41, who was head-hunted for the Barclays job partly because of his skill at
dealing with the press and City analysts, denied feeling any embarrassment
about giving the profits warning only three weeks before his departure. 'I'd
rather handle it than leave it to my colleagues.'
Courtaulds Textiles said it was unlikely profits for the year to December 31
would match last year's Pounds 39m. Analysts, who had cut their estimates to
Pounds 41m-Pounds 43m after lower than expected interim profits of Pounds
13.7m, yesterday trimmed their full-year forecasts to about Pounds 37m. The
shares closed 54p lower at 489p.
The group had reported difficult conditions in continental Europe in
September. It said yesterday that trading had deteriorated further in
October and November.
Mr Taylor said: 'In the UK, although there has been some recovery, the level
of early autumn activity has not been maintained.'
A particular problem was caused by a new factory near Derby in which the
group had invested Pounds 10m to make Aristoc stockings. Teething problems
prevented the plant reaching full capacity, so it lost sales and profits in
the peak pre-Christmas manufacturing period.
Mr Taylor was worried about the outlook for continental Europe, which last
year accounted for 18 per cent of sales: 'We made no money in Europe in the
first half and we are not going to make any in the second.'
Two thirds of group profits were usually made in the second half. Only when
management accounts for November were produced last week did the size of the
shortfall became clear.
The board was still expecting to recommend an increase in the final
dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Assessing the fall-out from the personal pensions fiasco is no easy matter.
But the extent of poor sales practice now uncovered by the SIB must nudge
the potential for compensation claims considerably higher. Companies which
sell mainly with-profits policies have some protection even if guilty of
malpractice, since the life fund should carry most of the cost. If
compensation payments eat too far into the fund, though, the authorities
could easily demand that shareholders accept more of the pain. Big sellers
of unit-linked policies such as Abbey Life and Allied Dunbar would be more
exposed, but only if their salesmen have been guilty of giving bad advice.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies paying dividend increases of 20 per cent are either privatised or
throw-backs to the 1980s. Unfortunately for lucky regional electricity
company shareholders, this year's interim largesse will be tempered by the
final payment and total dividend increases are unlikely to be more than 15
per cent. Still, that leaves REC investors with little to grumble about.
Even the companies accept that their current profitability cannot last and
will be curbed by the current regulatory review. A once and for all cut in
electricity prices, as well as a tightening of the price cap seem likely.
While that could cut profits by more than 20 per cent, the RECs would still
have positive cash flow. With cover still high and net cash in the bank,
paying handsomely progressive dividends is thus little problem. Indeed, the
RECs' over-capitalisation argues for more drastic action. One possibility
would be to demerge rather than sell the National Grid. Putting its capital
and dividend streams directly into REC shareholders' hands would certainly
unlock value. After that, a wholesale capital restructuring to regear
balance sheets and return cash would be preferable to squandering money
chasing wild geese in the manner of the water companies.

FT  09 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What an embarrassment. Just as Mr Martin Taylor tidies his desk to bustle
off to Barclays he feels obliged to issue a profits warning at Courtaulds
Textiles, knocking 10 per cent off its shares. Problems commissioning a new
Aristoc hosiery factory, a further downward lurch in French demand and the
slowing pace of the UK recovery have made a mockery of the upbeat noises
coming from the company three months ago. How much of the shortfall was
caused by a slippage of grip resulting from management changes is hard to
gauge. But the principal factor was the familiar tale of an
operationally-geared company suffering a disproportionate profits hit
whenever sales disappoint. The fourth quarter is critical, since it normally
accounts for 40 per cent of profits. Worries about the budget may have
unsettled buyers of luxurious lingerie.
Insofar as Courtaulds Textiles' recovery has been postponed a year, the
scale of the stock market's reaction seems reasonable. But, at least, it was
commendably swift in releasing the bad news through a formal statement. If
other companies are similarly disappointed at the gradient of recovery and
unnerved by heady share ratings, it is to hoped they have the courage to
follow suit.

FT  09 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the most optimistic expectations were confounded by the reception
accorded to yesterday's gilt auction. Last minute US demand was cited as one
factor but, whatever the reason, cover of 2.19 times and the concentration
of bids around the average accepted yield of 6.51 per cent indicates strong
underlying demand. Without that, the market would certainly have reacted
badly to yesterday afternoon's Pounds 1.2bn tap stock announcement.
It looks therefore as though international investors are moving quickly to
reassess gilts after last week's budget. The UK is, after all, one of the
few industrial countries which can offer a background of low inflation, some
economic recovery, declining short term rates and a sharply falling
government borrowing requirement. That might give gilts some immunity from
any further setbacks in the US bond market.
Yesterday's taps will further reduce new issue volume next year and add to
the prospect of shortage on which the market thrives. Yet there is limited
headroom for yields to fall. The shortest dated paper is already trading
below 5 per cent. The market could become impatient if the next rate cut is
delayed. And it still requires an act of faith to lend 25-year money to the
UK government at just 6.7 per cent.

FT  09 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: NFC travels hopefully
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC's first rights issue brings it further into line with convention. The
company's policy of giving a best view of profits for the coming year has
already been abandoned, for fear of litigation if the forecast was missed.
It is a fair bet that the tradition of employee share ownership will now
take a knock. The employee shareholding could fall to 11 per cent as a
result of the rights issue, only a shade above the level at which employees
lose special voting rights.
Still, BZW's offer to buy small shareholders' rights should minimise the
embarrassment of asking employees for cash in such difficult times. With
shareholders' funds of only Pounds 300m supporting sales of almost Pounds
2bn, NFC has long looked in need of additional equity. Gearing of 53 per
cent before the issue does not look especially high, but that excludes a
growing portfolio of operating leases. Goodwill write-offs arising from
acquisitions would have quickly eaten into such a modest equity base. With
capital expenditure rising and restructuring costs starting to bite, cash
flow was also inadequate to make inroads into debt.
Whether NFC will earn a decent return on new investment is less certain. A
Pounds 10m loss in parcels last year, following a fundamental
reorganisation, is a blot on the management copy-book. By focusing on
logistics NFC is edging away from such commodity businesses. Even in
specialist markets, though, margins are likely to remain under pressure.
With the rights issue now in the open NFC's shares have room to rise, but
only if the management spends wisely.

FT  09 DEC 93 / NatWest aims for worldwide smart card scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank unveiled an electronic 'smart card' yesterday
which it hopes customers will eventually use instead of cash.
They will be able to load the Mondex card with money from cash dispensers,
or telephones.
NatWest, which has established a joint venture with Midland Bank and British
Telecom to launch the card in the UK, wants retailers to install
card-reading machines which would allow people to use Mondex for even tiny
transactions.
The card, which has a computer chip embedded in it, can hold a maximum of
five separate currencies at a time. NatWest is now trying to recruit
partners in up to 30 countries to establish Mondex internationally.
Mondex will be simpler to use in shops than credit or debit cards because
purchases will not be individually authorised. The bank hopes people will be
attracted by not having to carry change around.
It will allow consumers to transfer cash to and from bank accounts and cards
using cash dispensers, or phones with card readers. They will also be able
to swap money between their cards using electronic 'wallets'.
It will be tested by about 30,000 consumers in Swindon, Wiltshire, in
mid-1995 after BT adjusts phones in the area. NatWest said it expected the
system to spread in international banking markets in the next 15 years.
Mondex differs from smart card projects in Denmark and France in not
requiring buyers to enter a Pin code number to authorise purchases. Cards
can be electronically 'locked' to block use, but can be used like cash if
unlocked.
The move comes amid growing competition to establish a global smart card
standard. Visa and Mastercard, the credit card companies, disclosed this
week they would work together to form a common standard by next year. Many
banks view smart cards as successors to credit and debit cards.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Delors and Major head for clash on EU growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, was heading last
night for a bitter clash with Mr John Major, the prime minister, on the eve
of this week's European summit which is billed as the launching pad for a
drive towards higher growth and employment in Europe.
A senior Downing Street aide accused Mr Delors of a 'cynical and transparent
ploy' in delaying completion of his white paper on growth, competitiveness
and employment until just before tomorrow's summit in Brussels.
Other Whitehall officials described the bulk of the report as 'irrelevant'
and attacked plans for substantial EU spending on roads, rail and
telecommunications, to be funded partly through the floating of new
'Brussels bonds'.
In a pained response last night, European Commission officials said the UK
government had overlooked the white paper's shift in favour of labour market
deregulation as a means of tackling mass unemployment in Europe, expected to
rise to nearly 20m next year.
At a news conference yesterday, Mr Delors called for lower employment costs,
a scaling-back of minimum wage legislation for unskilled workers and a
slowdown in Brussels-led social policy legislation. 'We have to see if the
time is right to adopt a minimal rights approach again. If you set the
minimum too low, we come to social dumping; but if you set it too high you
price people out of work,' he said.
Mr Delors said the need to restore competitiveness and growth was a top
priority for creating new jobs. He ruled out fiscal incentives to promote
worksharing, while not excluding them as a temporary measure among
individual companies.
Mr Delors's remarks appeared aimed at blunting criticism from
deregulation-minded countries such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
The white paper is expected to be the centrepiece of the two-day European
summit, but Mr Delors, more ebullient than usual, made clear that he intends
to reopen other contentious issues about the pace of European integration.
In remarks likely to alarm both the British and the Germans, he called for a
stronger role for the European Monetary Institute in the co-ordination of
monetary policies and the management of the exchange rate mechanism. Stage
one of Emu - aimed at greater convergence among member states' economies -
had been a 'failure', he said.
Although British criticism of the white paper has largely been discounted in
Brussels, Mr Delors' aides are concerned that other countries - notably
Germany - may join the UK in opposing spending of up to Ecu20bn (Pounds
15.2bn) a year on transnational networks in transport, telecoms, energy and
the environment, most of which is already in the EU budget.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Partial victory in US trade talks claimed by Balladur
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, yesterday declared a partial
victory in trade talks with the US, and said he would put any overall Gatt
accord before parliament early next week in a vote that he seems confident
of winning.
'We have emerged from our isolation without conceding anything essential,'
he told cheering deputies from his conservative coalition. Opposition
Socialists and farm union leaders complained, however, of a cave-in.
Agriculture 'is no longer an obstacle' to agreement because Europe's deal
with the US this week was 'satisfactory in a great deal more than half' of
it, he said. His most positive statement to date on Gatt helped push the
franc back through its former European exchange rate floor of FFr3.4305 to
the D-Mark, which France was forced to abandon in August.
Mr Balladur, however, is keeping up pressure on his European Union partners
to compensate France for what it failed to get from the US. 'I hope for a
Gatt agreement, but I cannot give you the certainty of one,' he told French
deputies. He said the next three days, covering the EU summit starting in
Brussels on Friday, 'will be decisive'.
Mr Balladur rang Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, on Tuesday night and
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, yesterday morning to lobby them
on French demands for tougher European protection against unfair trade and
for more money to compensate farmers.
Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister who also holds the key political job of
secretary-general of Mr Balladur's RPR Gaullist party, warned that the EU
might have to increase the farm share of its budget, a move sure to be
resisted by Britain and the Netherlands.
Meanwhile, US and EU negotiators in Geneva began a series of bilateral
meetings explaining details of the US-EU deal to other countries involved in
the Uruguay Round of international trade talks. Gatt officials moved to
finalise texts for a global trade accord that has until now been blocked by
US-EU disagreements.
Mr Germain Denis, who chairs the Gatt committee drawing up a global market
access deal, briefed a group of less than 20 countries on a final package
that he hopes to table before all 116 countries in the Round this morning.
With a tariff-cutting market access deal close to settlement, negotiators
moved on to the outstanding disputed issues - mainly efforts to open up
financial services markets, and controversial US proposals enabling tax
discrimination against foreign companies.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Balladur claims partial victory in US trade talks: French
prime minister turns pressure on EU

<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, yesterday declared a partial
victory in trade talks with the US, and said he would put any overall Gatt
accord before parliament early next week in a vote that he seems confident
of winning.
'We have emerged from our isolation without conceding anything essential,'
he told cheering deputies from his conservative coalition. Opposition
Socialists and farm union leaders complained, however, of a cave-in.
Agriculture 'is no longer an obstacle' to agreement because Europe's deal
with the US this week was 'satisfactory in a great deal more than half' of
it, he said. His most positive statement to date on Gatt helped push the
franc back through its former European exchange rate floor of FFr3.4305 to
the D-Mark, which France was forced to abandon in August.
Mr Balladur, however, is keeping up pressure on his European Union partners
to compensate France for what it failed to get from the US. 'I hope for a
Gatt agreement, but I cannot give you the certainty of one,' he told French
deputies. He said the next three days, covering the EU summit starting in
Brussels on Friday, 'will be decisive'.
Mr Balladur rang Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, on Tuesday night and
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, yesterday morning to lobby them
on French demands for tougher European protection against unfair trade and
for more money to compensate farmers.
Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister who also holds the key political job of
secretary-general of Mr Balladur's RPR Gaullist party, warned that the EU
might have to increase the farm share of its budget, a move sure to be
resisted by Britain and the Netherlands.
By maintaining his tough stance to the end, Mr Balladur seems likely to
carry with him most of his ruling coalition which has an overwhelming
majority in the National Assembly. He has virtually ensured this by making
next week's vote an issue of confidence in the government.
French farm unions, however, remained unconvinced by what they called
yesterday 'the so-called advances' on agriculture. The CNJA young farmers'
union warned its members might take to the streets again.
Meanwhile, US and EU negotiators in Geneva began a series of bilateral
meetings explaining details of the US-EU deal to other countries involved in
the Uruguay Round of international trade talks. Gatt officials moved to
finalise texts for a global trade accord that has until now been blocked by

FT  09 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Papering over the cracks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Why this white paper?' asks European Commission president Jacques Delors
and his co-authors on its very first page. 'Why indeed?' might well be the
murmured reply of certain European finance ministers. But Mr Delors' paper -
long, wordy and lacking in detailed prescription though it may be - is a
worthwhile contribution, at least to the unemployment debate. It does not
quite succeed in providing the European 'vision thing' that Mr Delors was
looking for. But that is the politicians' job, not the Commission's.
The white paper's opening question is, in fact, satisfactorily answered on
the first page. It is primarily a document about labour markets and, in
particular, the failure of a myriad national solutions either to cut
long-term unemployment or (not the same thing) revive employment growth. Not
that the Commission claims to offer a worked-out solution. But, in its
definition of the problem, its dismissal of easy solutions and its
aspirational model for the future, the white paper makes a lot of sense.
First the diagnosis. Employment growth in Europe, the Commission confirms,
has been slower than in other regions of the world because of
government-erected barriers to hiring labour. Meanwhile unemployment has
stayed high through the economic cycle because investment has been
insufficient, while regulations have prevented the cost of unskilled labour
falling in the face of technological change and external competition.
Politically untenable
The paper is encouragingly quick to dismiss miracle cures. Protectionism, a
dash for inflationary growth, a generalised cut in working hours, a drastic
cut in wages and social protection to east Asian levels - all these
non-solutions are thankfully dismissed. Nor is US-style deregulation alone
enough. Sluggish productivity growth, accompanied by falling real wages and
rising unskilled male joblessness, seems both politically untenable and
economically short-sighted.
The better approach, the white paper argues, is to remove obstacles to job
creation, thereby raising the employment intensity of growth, while boosting
the sustainable growth rate by raising investment in physical and human
capital.
Yet the white paper, while providing an impressive framework for analysis of
Europe's labour market problems, ducks the difficult issues. The Commission
is right to argue that high non-wage labour costs, especially at the lower
end of the wage distribution, are important obstacles to employment
creation. But there is little mention of the employment effects of
Spanish-style levels of incumbent worker protection. Is there a workable
balance between deregulation and employee protection? A dilemma ducked.
Dilemma dodged
The paper also rightly points out that wages must grow more slowly than
productivity if profits and investment are to rise. Britain's failure to
control its wage inflation in the 1980s demonstrates that decentralisation
is not a guaranteed solution. But centralised tripartite bargaining has
clearly undermined employment flexibility in many countries. How can this
tension between micro-flexibility and macro-co-ordination be resolved?
Another dilemma dodged.
On the need for funds for private investment, the paper seems to bite the
bullet. Only the public sector can be relied on to free up savings for
investment, it says, so fiscal deficits must be cut now in order to generate
surpluses when growth accelerates. But it also says that governments must
pursue expensive expansions of education and training, and maybe provide
more non-wage income support for the unskilled. But do offsetting cuts in
public spending imply a rethinking of welfare priorities? Again, the paper
is silent.
The commission, however, can hardly be criticised for failing to find
solutions which have eluded European policymakers for over a decade. In so
far as progress can be made in dealing with unemployment, it will involve
further, specific actions at the national level - Europe may have a single
market in goods, but it does not have a single labour market. The role of
Brussels is to identify best practice and to encourage individual
governments to make the right choices. This white paper is a start.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Personal View: Flexibility is a friend of the jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most important issues facing the European Union and its political
leaders are growth and unemployment. There are 19m people unemployed in the
EU, and the figure is rising fast.
International comparisons of job creation speak for themselves. North
America has created about 36m jobs since 1973 and Japan 12m, mostly in the
private sector. The EU has created fewer than 8m jobs in the same period,
most of them in the public sector. This has added to the tax/borrowing
burden, which in many countries is increasingly seen as insupportable.
There is a high degree of agreement among EU member states about the cause
of Europe's unemployment problems. Increasingly they recognise that, while
the recession has an effect, there are more deep-seated structural problems
in Europe's labour markets: a lack of flexibility in the operation of labour
markets, partly as a result of excessive or misdirected regulation; high
labour costs, particularly social contributions; inadequate incentives to
work; and a lack of the skills, among significant parts of the labour force,
needed to compete in a fast-changing world.
What needs to be done? Recovery from the recession is important. All
countries must have sustainable and non-inflationary economic and fiscal
policies. We must continue to develop and maintain free trade and more open
markets. We must create an environment which encourages enterprise and
innovation.
But we need to do more than this. We must try to remedy those labour market
deficiencies which are making it increasingly difficult to create jobs in
Europe, and against which employers are protesting.
To help economies compete, labour markets must act as an aid to growth,
increasing competitiveness and the creation of jobs, rather than as a
barrier. Otherwise, we may suffer from 'jobless growth' - and the gap
between the employed and the unemployed will widen.
There is no one blueprint. Different countries have different problems, such
as high labour costs, insupportable levels of social protection, and
excessively rigid legislation in the labour market.
We in Britain have pursued our own course over recent years to tackle labour
market rigidities through deregulation, and revisions of the legal
framework. We have seen a significant growth in self-employment and
part-time work as employers and individuals have taken advantage of our
progress. But we still do not match the best in Europe in our workforce's
skills.
In emphasising the desirability of greater flexibility and diversity in
labour markets, there is one lie I should like to nail. There is no question
of abandoning systems of social protection. Nor do we want to compete with
the third world on wages. Our competitive edge must come in terms of the
skills and abilities of our people, higher productivity and the quality of
the goods and services we offer. But we must still ensure that European pay
and cost levels and over-rigid rules do not undermine competitiveness.
Most of the necessary action is for individual member states. However, there
is a role for the EU, too. We fully accept the need for action in areas such
as health and safety, free movement of labour, and the promotion of growth
and jobs through the structural funds.
The problem we have had in the past is that European Union social and
employment legislation was rarely introduced with sufficient regard to its
effect on competitiveness and jobs, and in some cases it had serious adverse
effects.
This is why I have proposed that all social legislation, existing and
planned, should be subjected to a 'competitiveness audit', through which
there would be rigorous analysis of its effects in terms of growth,
competitiveness and jobs.
There are no easy answers. We cannot spend our way out of the problem. There
are no billions of pounds or Ecus to be spared, except at the cost of
crowding out the private sector. There are no magic, uniform solutions such
as sharing out the available jobs.
It makes good sense to develop new and more flexible working patterns.
Work-sharing may be feasible at company level as a voluntary, negotiated
short-term adjustment, but imposed at a national or EU level it would result
in costs and rigidities which would endanger the productivity and dynamism
on which more jobs depend.
Our task is to increase jobs, growth and prosperity, not to settle for what
we have and share it out. We have a chance to strike the right balance for
the future in the debates at the European heads of government summit, which
starts tomorrow, and in the months that follow. That is an opportunity which
must not be missed.

Spare a tear for the directors who waved goodbye to their company cars last
year. An Institute of Directors and Reward Group survey on director's pay
discloses that the number of directors with company cars is down this year
to 63 per cent from last year's 79 per cent.
As those who dream of Direct Line salaries kiss goodbyes to their
four-wheeled friends, they can perhaps take comfort from the fact that some
standards are not falling; the Jaguar is still the director's favourite,
followed by Mercedes.

Little wonder some Afrikaners show signs of deep paranoia. First their
language, Afrikaans, loses pride of place as joint official language with
English; under the new order there are now 11 official languages.
Then some wine estates ceased using Afrikaans on their labels, much to the
anguish of the Afrikaans newspaper Beeld, which actually ran an editorial on
the matter. Now South African Breweries - which accounts for 98 per cent of
malt beer sales - and the local bottler of Coca-Cola have decided to drop
Afrikaans from their cans. This will allow a redesign which should lower
production costs by 2 cents a can.
Coke's view is that with 11 official languages it made sense to choose one.
SAB's logic is that it's moving into exports, and who reads Afrikaans
overseas?

So what does Sir Peter Thompson, Britain's leading disciple of wider share
ownership, make of the latest developments at his old company, NFC?
Yesterday's Pounds 263m rights issue means that NFC is even closer to losing
its status as one of the few companies where the employees have some control
over events.
When Observer finally caught up with Sir Peter, en route to the annual
dinner of his current hobby horse ProShare, he was reluctant to pass
judgment. He had not seen the announcement and insisted that he was 'no
longer the keeper of NFC's soul'.
However, he expressed some sadness at the steady dilution of the NFC
employees' shareholding. 'It is something I fought very hard for,' says Sir
Peter, who now admits that it is very hard to resist commercial pressures
when a company is floated on the stock market. He didn't sound quite so
dispirited when he brought NFC to market in 1989.

The Sainsbury supermarket clan always has been a broad church but the Sunday
trading vote has opened up an embarrassing rift between David Sainsbury, the

director of Sainsbury for over 20 years.
Tim is on the side of the Keep Sunday Special brigade and was planning to
vote against the Shopping Hours Reform Council compromise backed by cousin
David and other big supermarket chains. He's mightily concerned about the
disruption to family life and small shops caused by Sunday trading. Although
it is 10 years since he left the board, Tim's father, a former chairman,
remains one of the joint presidents. Ironically, the spin doctor behind SHRC
is Des Wilson, former Liberal Democrat campaign organiser. His parliamentary
ambitions ended when he was defeated by Tim Sainsbury at the 1973 election.

Three guesses who is Russia's most famous floating voter? On an extended
international jaunt - including London yesterday - Mikhail Gorbachev told
Observer his lips are sealed as far as Sunday's election is concerned. Only
when he gets back home on Friday will he make up his mind where his vote is
going.
Mind you, the last non-elected president of the Soviet Union knows who he
won't vote for: Boris Yeltsin. 'I do know that I won't vote for Russia's
Choice (the reformist bloc backed by nemesis Boris Yeltsin). I will not vote
for hardline communists and I will not vote for the extremists.'
So if he doesn't fancy Yeltsin or the 'extremists', who is left?
Gorbachev is considering only three options: the centrist Civic Union, the
Democratic Party of Russia, and cautious reformists led by Grigory
Yavlinsky.
But given Gorbachev's low standing among Russian voters, probably all
political parties are happy with his non-endorsement.

FT  09 DEC 93 / A brief encounter, now line is engaged: The Franco-German
telecoms pact was prompted by growing global competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition unleashed by the erosion of state monopolies is a primary
driving force in Europe's telecommunications industry. It was the main
influence behind the alliance of the French and German public
telecommunications operators, launched on Tuesday.
To exploit emerging markets, telecoms partnerships are being forged across
the world. Afraid for their markets, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom
have joined forces to keep such rivals at bay - particularly the alliance
unveiled in June between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second
largest US telecoms operator.
A pact between the US telecoms giant AT&amp;T and several Asia-Pacific
operators, agreed shortly before BT's, also concentrated French and German
minds. AT&amp;T is not necessarily hostile: it needs a European partner and is
currently in talks with the French and German companies about whether they
might fill that role. But the prospect of a global AT&amp;T increased the
pressure on them to form a joint venture before concluding any deal with the
Americans.
Technological advance, increasing the range of sophisticated network and
multimedia services that operators can offer, is a second force behind
recent alliances. The Franco-German link-up, teaming two public network
operators, is of the more conservative variety. In the US, today's fashion
is for 'multimedia' alliances between telecoms operators and entertainment,
cable and computing companies. In the past few months alone there have been
deals between US West and Time Warner, Bell Atlantic and TCI, and
Southwestern Bell and Cox Enterprises.
The heart of the Franco-German alliance is an Ecu1bn (Pounds 760m) company
whose job will be to build a European 'backbone' network offering
multinational companies enhanced services, including private networks that
cross borders.
The size of the market for such 'one stop' services is unclear. Mr Marcel
Roulet, France Telecom's chairman, says the new company is aiming at the
leading 600 or so multinationals. BT talked of 'thousands' of possible
clients at the launch of its MCI venture, which plans to offer similar
services to the Franco-German alliance.
But only a handful of multinationals have yet shown much interest in
patronising 'one-stop' shops. And with an increasingly competitive world
telecoms market, the margins in the business are unlikely to be high. A
recent survey by the UK's Telecommunications Managers Association showed
that 94 per cent of 439 large companies - including many of Mr Roulet's 600
 -had decided against contracting out their telecoms requirements.
However, undue concentration on the immediate prospects for the partnerships
would be a mistake. Business from multinationals can be expected to grow as
the new alliances succeed in developing and customising advanced services
over their dedicated networks.
Moreover, multinationals are only the first target of the alliances. By 1998
European operators will be forced into head-to-head competition for basic
'voice' traffic using public networks - the medium for most of today's
telecoms traffic. Mr Gregory Staple, a US analyst, estimates that the volume
of international 'voice' traffic carried over the world's public networks
will increase from 42bn minutes last year to 60bn in 1995, so the market at
stake is considerable.
Significantly, all the services to be offered by the Franco-German alliance
are in markets already liberalised by the European Union. Only one existing
deregulated market has been excluded - mobile communications; and at the
launch of the alliance Mr Roulet stressed the potential for future
collaboration in that field.
Once teething problems are overcome, the alliance is likely to move into
other telecoms markets as they are deregulated by the Commission. As Mr
Jacques Champeaux, leader of the negotiations for France Telecom, put it:
'Growth depends upon the evolution of regulation.'
The implication is stark: when Europe's public networks are opened to
competition in 1998, the French and Germans may seek to merge some or all of
their basic voice services.
Given their size, that would create not just a European, but a global giant.
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are, respectively, the world's second
and third largest carriers of international telecoms traffic. In 1992 their
combined traffic base was marginally behind that of AT&amp;T and more than three
times that of BT, which ranks fourth. With economic revival in eastern
Germany and the French and German operators' ambitions in eastern European,
their relative position is likely to strengthen further.
Nonetheless, it was perceptions of mutual weakness as much as of strength
that drove Mr Roulet and Mr Helmut Ricke, his Deutsche Telekom counterpart,
into each other's arms.
In a speech to an FT conference this week, Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman,
said the modern national telecoms operator had to be a 'complex hybrid',
with strong public service obligations at home, but acting as a predator
abroad.
BT, privatised for nearly a decade and operating in Europe's most liberal
market, is indeed a predator, eager to exploit opportunities elsewhere in
Europe. But the Franco-German deal shows that Europe's state-owned
monopolies are learning fast.
The courtship was remarkably short, starting immediately after BT and MCI
announced their Dollars 5.3bn deal. As a Deutsche Telekom executive says:
'Of course we had to get in the same game, and fast.'
It is not just the threat of international competition and technological
change which are obliging them to do so. All of Europe's state operators
already face growing pressure in their home markets. Over the last year both
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have been shaken by the success of newly
licensed rival mobile phone operators competing against their mobile
subsidiaries.
The liberalisation of data and private networks looks set to pose a similar
threat. Mannesmann, the main competitor to Deutsche Telekom in the German
mobile phone market, last month launched a consortium with RWE, the
energy-based conglomerate, and Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, to
offer fixed-wire services to corporate clients. The consortium's ambitions
are likely to expand in line with liberalisation.
Mr Roulet and Mr Ricke also face obstacles as they try to implement the
restructuring of their companies necessary to make the alliance a success.
The present legal status of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom prohibits
the companies even from swapping equity, something they are keen to do to
underpin their marriage.
Mr Ricke's priority is privatisation. Although the German government and
Social Democrat opposition party have reached a tentative agreement on a
privatisation plan, its progress is glacial. 'There is no definitive
political consensus to create a private company - only a vague willingness,'
says Mr Ricke.
Privatisation is not on the agenda for France Telecom. Even plans to
transform the operator into a state-owned company with share capital, which
would facilitate international partnerships, are being delayed by strong
opposition.
Legislation to change France Telecom's legal status was due to be introduced
into the French parliament next spring. But the planned reforms drew
protests from trade unions, afraid that the change would mean job losses and
cost-cutting measures, and would be a prelude to privatisation. A one-day
strike in October was supported by about three-quarters of France Telecom's
employees, forcing the government to extend negotiations.
Even the alliance with Deutsche Telekom appears too much for some of the
French operator's unions. The Confederation Generale du Travail, the
communist-led union, said it represented a step towards privatisation and
should be rejected. The union is planning to call another strike for
December 14.
BT's reaction to the Franco-German alliance was to call for the introduction
of 'voice' competition before 1998, and for the early liberalisation of the
market for telecommunications infrastructure, which would enable operators
to build their own networks. But given their problems, Mr Roulet and Mr
Ricke can see no virtue in accelerating the pace of liberalisation - with or
without an alliance.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Re-inventing US banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Federal Reserve set out to recapitalise the US banking system after
the collapse of the 1980s credit boom, few foresaw that a by-product of this
policy would be the transformation of the structure of the banking industry.
There lies the irony in Mellon Bank's proposed acquisition of the Dreyfus
mutual fund management group, which could prove a significant landmark in
the development of US banking if it goes ahead as planned.
The Dollars 1.85bn (Pounds 1.2bn) share swap announced this week is a
logical response to the erosion of the deposit base of the commercial
banking system and the flight of money into mutual funds, which has resulted
from the Fed's management of interest rates.
With short rates well below long bond rates, US banks have made large
profits by borrowing cheaply from depositors to invest in higher-yielding
government IOUs. Yet there has been a longer-term cost. Since short rates
yield next to nothing in real terms, depositors have fled the banking system
for potentially higher returns in bond and equity funds.
The Fed, admittedly, has done no more than to accelerate a trend that was
already well under way. But the shrinkage in the banks' core businesses has
been astonishing.
The US household sector's holdings of bank deposits and money market funds
have fallen from 50 per cent of total discretionary savings in 1975 to
little more than 30 per cent today. Mutual funds have been the chief
gainers. On present trends their assets, which are equivalent to about 80
per cent of bank assets, could leapfrog the deposit base of the banking
system by mid-decade.
More creditworthy
This process has coincided with the much-publicised loss of lending business
resulting from the third world debt crisis. Since the early 1980s, large
companies have borrowed more cheaply from the markets because they are more
creditworthy than their own bankers.
Any flattening in the yield curve, whereby short-term rates move upwards to
narrow the gap against long rates, might put a damper on the outflow of
deposits from the banks. But the erosion of the banks' deposit base is a
deep-seated trend. The banks' response has in large part been to promote
their own in-house mutual funds. Yet this piecemeal approach is desperately
slow in the face of the tidal outflow. Hence Mellon's ambitious moves -
first, to acquire the Boston Company private banking and mutual fund group
last year, and now to pitch for Dreyfus.
Novel form
The attraction is not merely that former bank depositors are recaptured
under another guise. The mutual funds have also been busily underwriting new
issues in the equity and bond markets, thereby giving the banks an
alternative way of extracting fee income from the corporations that no
longer borrow from the banking system. The result, as the economist David
Hale of Kemper Financial Services has pointed out, is that the US is moving
to its own novel form of mutual fund-based universal banking.
Such a system is not without risks. Many former bank depositors mistakenly
believe that their investment in bank-managed mutual funds carries a
government guarantee. Others have yet to recognise that they can lose much
of their capital if markets plunge. Yet with more risk falling on
individuals rather than financial intermediaries, the financial system
itself is unquestionably more robust.
A further remarkable irony is that, by helping drive deposits out of the
banking system into mutual funds, the Fed has almost accidentally helped
create precisely the banking structure that many experts and legislators had
wanted to bring about by other, more cumbersome means: a two-tier system
where only very low-yielding deposits enjoy the luxury of government-backed
deposit insurance, while higher-yielding assets are unprotected. Moral
hazard, which cost the US so dear in the savings and loans fiasco, is thus
discreetly being reduced to more manageable proportions. This outcome, which
is none the worse for being so unexpected, should be heartily welcomed, even
if there is some transitional pain for investors along the way.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The two-way switch in world economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most valuable guess about the impact of the Uruguay agreement is the one
made by Gatt's own secretariat: that it will add nearly Dollars 750bn to
world merchandise trade by around the year 2005. This is apart from the
benefit to trade in services which no one seems able to quantify.
The trade gain should be equivalent to an increase of 12 per cent, compared
with what that trade might otherwise have been. Although speculative, the
estimate is less unreliable than the attempts to translate the gain into
changes in economic welfare, which is what the headline figures - which
politicians quote without understanding - mostly try to do.
For the moment, a Gatt agreement's most important effect will be on
confidence. It will be a green light to firms hesitating about investment
projects which depend upon products crossing national frontiers. It will
also stop the damage that a blow to confidence would inflict on a sluggish
world economy.
The hope in the longer run must be, however, that it will restore some
impetus to world trade. The need for this is shown in the accompanying table
prepared by an Oxford economist, Peter Sinclair, in an article unfortunately
buried at the end of the Autumn 1993 Oxford Review of Economic Policy
(published by Oxford University Press).
In the table, export values have been deflated by a general price index to
put them into real terms. The usual practice of deflating them by export
prices is misleading as makers of traded products tend to experience faster
productivity increases than other businesses; as a consequence their goods
rise less in price.
The table shows that, until about 1980, it was the rule that world trade
grew a great deal faster than output. But in the subsequent decade that rule
was reversed and trade grew less than output in all the members of the Group
of Seven, except France and Germany. The general conclusion applies even if
oil is taken out of the figures or if intra-EC trade is excluded.
Sinclair attributes a great deal of the lost trade dynamism to policy. The
gaps between Gatt rounds have grown larger. It is now, for instance, 20
years since the Tokyo Round was concluded. Since then agricultural
protection has been increased; there are more non-tariff barriers; and some
regional groups like the EC may have diverted trade from inter-continental
channels.
The author also puts some of the blame on so-called new trade theories among
academics. These suggest that, when firms have market power, countries may
gain by intervening on their behalf. I suspect these theories have been
taken up only as rationalisations by administrations heavily lobbied by
producers. Sinclair tackles these theories head-on and shows that, even
under the assumed trading conditions, there may actually be gains from freer
trade.
Meanwhile, warnings keep landing on my desk from analysts who believe that
the next European upturn will be even more disappointing for jobs than the
upturn of the 1980s, and will put even more pressure on the pay of less
skilled workers. In some versions, the threat looks like a return visit of
the 'yellow peril' from the east which so terrified Europeans and Americans
at the beginning of the 20th century.
There is, indeed, a profound two-way change taking place in the world
economy which is most convincingly summarised - without any yellow peril
nonsense - by Richard Brown and DeAnne Julius in the first 1993
prize-winning essay in the Amex Bank Review, also published by Oxford
University Press.
One change is a big shift in the geographical centre of gravity away from
the traditionally rich countries that make up the 24-nation OECD. The shift
has been disguised by the habit of comparing GDP at current exchange rates,
which undervalue the output of the hitherto less-advanced countries. On the
conventional basis, the combined GDP of the OECD countries is 2.7 times as
high as that of the rest of the world. But, using estimates based on
purchasing power parity instead, it is only 1.1 times as high.
The other associated change is a steep decline in the share of manufacturing
in total employment in the OECD countries. In the US, the manufacturing
share peaked as early as 1920. Countries such as Germany - which is a real
outlier with a manufacturing share of 32 per cent - face a really steep
decline in this sector. The authors expect the manufacturing proportion to
reach 10 per cent or less in most OECD countries within the next 30 years.
In so doing, it will be following the path of decline traced by agriculture
over the past 50 years.
The authors see nothing horrifying in these trends. Service workers are not
just 16-year-olds flipping hamburgers at McDonald's. Managers, sales
personnel, brain surgeons and bankers are all in the service sector. A
recent survey in Manchester found that employees in the leisure and media
sectors were the highest paid and those in manufacturing the lowest. Because
of the difficulty of measuring service output, the rate of inflation in this
sector is exaggerated and its productivity growth greatly understated.
Manufacturing companies in the west will face competing options. They can
continue to compete on cost if they switch production to developing
countries. Or they can seek high value-added niches with a big service
component. Either way there will be a shift of employment to services. It
does not take great genius to predict great pressure to subsidise or protect
the manufacturing sector. But, the authors remark, it would be 'a critical
mistake to yield. The agricultural experience shows that such a reaction
would be costly and ultimately fruitless.'
They would prefer western governments to concentrate on promoting free trade
in services and still greater freedom for international investment. They
make the conventional plea for European and American governments to 'focus
on people' and upgrade and broaden education and training to improve
performance in the newer sectors. But 'in the traditional areas of
industrial policy and direct support to industry, we are asking politicians
to do what they find most difficult: nothing]'
There is, however, more to say. A problem is created by the rapidly
increasing differentials in earnings between high- and low-paid workers.
While this has been most evident in the US and Britain, the protection
offered by continental institutions of the Social Chapter kind is crumbling.
Many parts of the welfare state are being trimmed in Sweden; and, further
south, nationwide wage agreements and minimum wages are being seen as
obstacles to employment.
International studies, such as those summarised in the 1993 OECD Review of
Industrial Policy, suggest that technological change has hitherto been more
important in creating these labour market pressures than either
Reagan-Thatcher policies or international trade pressures. But whatever may
have happened in the past, it is likely that imports from developing or
former communist countries will in future depress the market-clearing levels
of pay among the least skilled or least adaptable groups.
If trade opens up the prospect of increasing the national income, the losses
of particular groups are a distributional problem and cannot be shrugged off
by references to training.
The challenge is to find non-vindictive ways of redistributing income
towards the losers; it is to find methods of redistribution that do not
assume that all income belongs to the state; it is to find methods of
redistribution which do not destroy the gains from trade and technology,
while compensating those who would otherwise lose out from change. The
statement of the problem - which is still far from recognised - comes before
the answers.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Japan's nuclear recycling programme
nears goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T MATSUNAGA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to express my comments on your collection of letters
entitled 'Thorp: surplus in dispute' (November 23).
Consumption of fossil energy is causing worldwide environmental problems and
drying up energy resources. Petroleum is expected to run out around the
middle of the 21st century. Nuclear energy is one of the most promising
alternatives. However, uranium is also limited.
At this moment reasonably assured resources of uranium are only about 2.32m
tonnes, which will be consumed in between 30 and 40 years under current
demand, with the direct disposal of spent fuel. Uranium with direct disposal
cannot be a major energy resource for the 21st century.
Utilisation rates of uranium can be considerably increased by using
plutonium in light water reactors as MOX fuel. Furthermore, about 60 times
the utilisation rate of uranium can be achieved by recycling it in
fast-breeder reactors.
Plutonium utilisation systems, mainly in fast-breeder reactors, require high
standard technologies and a long development period. We have been doing our
best to realise plutonium utilisation since it became the basis of our
nuclear energy policy in the early 1960s. In this process, we executed
reprocessing contracts with British Nuclear Fuels prior to our construction
of a commercial reprocessing facility in Japan.
A forecast of supply and demand for plutonium in Japan issued by the
advisory committee of the Atomic Energy Commission in August 1991 foresees
that by around 2010, overseas and domestic (under construction) reprocessing
facilities will extract from Japanese spent fuels approximately 85 tonnes of
plutonium, all of which will be consumed as fuels for fast-breeder reactors,
advanced thermal reactors and light water reactors. Although there are some
minor changes in programmes, they will never affect Japan's plutonium
utilisation policy.
Furthermore, we have enough capacity to consume plutonium in Japan. For
example, the above forecast indicates that we will consume about 50 tonnes
of plutonium in our light water reactors, which is only 10 per cent of the
fuel consumed at the 44 operating reactors (about 37GW in capacity) at the
moment. Seven more light water reactors (about 7.9GW in capacity) are now
under construction.
Our reprocessing contracts with BNFL provide for the return of the waste
arising from reprocessing of our fuels and we shall honour the contracts. A
repository for domestic low-level waste has already begun operation and a
storage facility for returned high-level waste is now being constructed. We
see no difficulty in preparing storage places for intermediate and low-level
wastes once the quantity of those wastes is known.
Japanese electric power companies have been endeavouring to establish
nuclear fuel recycled with the fast-breeder reactors as a core technology.
We are approaching our goal step by step.

The Story of Charles Steward Parnell and
Irish Nationalism
By Robert Kee
Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 20, 659 pages
Charles Stewart Parnell was either nervous about covering his tracks or a
master of cool detachment. From a hotel in Paris - just as British prime
minister William Gladstone appeared on the brink of embracing Home Rule for
Ireland - the Irish nationalist leader wrote three letters to his secret
lover, Mrs Katharine O'Shea.
They were, says Robert Kee in his biography of Parnell, matter-of-fact;
obsessed with 'his cold, his vest and the taking of Turkish baths'. Yet
Parnell was in an 'extraordinary' situation. On temporary release from
prison for his nephew's funeral in 1882, 'he had, only a few days before,
been reunited for a day and a night with the woman he loved so passionately
that it seemed at times as if nothing else would ever be of importance to
him again'. Their two-month-old child, whom he had just seen for the first
time, was desperately ill and might die while he was away.
More than a century later, such self-confidence and ability to look beyond
the immediate political fray is sorely needed, as Albert Reynolds and John
Major, the Irish and British prime ministers, discuss the future of the six
counties that make up Northern Ireland.
Parnell's great achievement was to give the majority of Irish people a sense
of unity and purposefulness that eventually propelled the larger portion of
the country towards independence. But his story is one of tragedy - for him
personally, when his career crashed amid the scandal of his affair with Mrs
O'Shea, and for Ireland, because never was the time more propitious for a
relatively peaceful resolution of the Irish 'problem' than in the 1880s.
Parnell's legacy was an intensified defensiveness among northern Ireland
Protestants - few of whom were nationalists - that has scarcely diminished,
and the mobilisation of supporters of Ulster's union with the UK.
Nationalists now are split between supporters of IRA paramilitaries and of
constitutional politics; between those who overtly want unification and
those, particularly in the south, who regard it as financially and
politically impossible.
Parnell's strategy was two-pronged. First, he built up an Irish Home Rule
party at Westminster that, because of its size and expertise in
obstructionist tactics, had to be heard by Liberal and Tory governments.
Second, he knitted the strands of Irish nationalism. He acquiesced to the
violent tactics of Fenian extremists but without explicitly supporting them.
He combined land reform and nationalist movements and often fudged the
meaning of 'home rule' - whether it meant an Irish parliament subordinate to
Westminster or a clean break with the UK. He was imprisoned by the British
as part of their efforts to maintain order.
Admittedly Parnell's task in respect of Ulster was easier than that of his
modern counterparts. Though there were riots in Belfast in protest at
possible home rule, the nine counties then comprising the province were less
overwhelmingly unionist. And there were 400,000 Protestants living elsewhere
in Ireland - including Parnell himself - which strengthened the argument for
treating Ireland as a whole.
Nevertheless, Parnell's career was a balancing act requiring considerable
astuteness. A setback was the murder by nationalist extremists of the chief
secretary to Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, and his under-secretary, T H
Burke, in Dublin's Phoenix Park soon after Parnell's return from Paris. The
revulsion in Britain delayed debate on home rule.
But just as Major recently denied talking to the IRA while contacts were
continuing, Parnell had a channel of private communication with Gladstone
via Mrs O'Shea, who wrote copious letters to Downing Street.
A more serious problem than the killings was his private life. Kee's book
tests carefully many of the myths surrounding Parnell and Mrs O'Shea. (Did a
rose really fall from her bodice for him to rescue on their first meeting?
Kee is not convinced. Certainly she was never called 'Kitty' by friends, as
many suppose.) But he does not disappoint, providing a racy account of
flights via fire escapes and the circumstantial evidence to suggest that her
husband - Captain William O'Shea, also an Irish nationalist MP - knew for
many years of the relationship. Kee's description of Parnell is of a
character bordering on the improbable: incredibly he despised the colour
green, used in nationalist emblems.
Such was Parnell's affection for Mrs O'Shea, believes Kee, that he was eager
for a deal with Gladstone so he could retire to Eltham, south London, where
she lived near her elderly Aunt Ben, who was not allowed to know of the
affair lest she should cut off her niece from a rich inheritance.
When Captain O'Shea divorced his wife after Aunt Ben's death, all these
deceptions could no longer be maintained. Parnell misjudged the scale of
outrage, particularly in predominantly Catholic Ireland, and underestimated
his own fallibility as a politician. In the tense months that followed, his
party split and the momentum behind its cause was lost. A year later Parnell
died of a coronary thrombosis.
Where Kee fails is in providing an assessment of Parnell's place in Irish
history. Even without his sudden downfall, the course of events might have
been little changed. Opposition to home rule in the Commons and Lords was
deep-seated. Parnell seemed prepared to accept an Irish parliament with
limited powers that would have been unacceptable to many Irish. Thirty years
and much bloodshed followed before the Irish free state was established.
Northern Ireland is still gripped by near civil war. There never seems an
ideal time for the Irish to determine their fate peacefully.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Help BT to compete abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER HAIN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Like most other commentators, your editorial (Euro Telecom Alliances,
December 8) on the Franco-German telecoms alliance, missed the key strategic
point for Britain.
This is whether a British company will be one of the big four or five
operators in international telecommunications - effectively that means
whether BT will, since it alone has the necessary critical mass.
That objective should be the driving one for telecommunications policy. It
would have enormous benefits for British industry at large, enabling a
pace-setting role in the fast- growing area of information technology, which
will be so vital to our future economic growth.
The problem is that, as in so many areas of industry, this government does
not have a telecommunications policy. Its stance is to leave it to the
invisible hand of market forces. So much so, that competitors to BT are
positively favoured (for example being allowed to carry the highly lucrative
combination of telephony and entertainment which BT is not).
As part of this, American carriers such as AT&amp;T, Sprint and the regional
Bells are virtually being incited by the government to clean up the British
market, while BT does not have reciprocal entry rights to the US market.
Similarly, in Europe, the link between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and
possibly AT&amp;T is going ahead while BT has its hands tied behind its back,
fighting off rigged competition in its backyard.
Our concern should be to put Britain where it once was (as inventors of
fibre optics for instance) in the leadership of international
telecommunications. The government's position is typically short-sighted. If
its current non-policy persists, British industry will once again lose out.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Indexation alteration iniquitous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Clarke's proposed change to the indexation of the cost of
investments which are sold at a loss (or small profit) is a nonsense, if not
iniquitous.
In the case of an investor with, let us say, a net chargeable gain of Pounds
10,000, made up of a profit of Pounds 15,000 and a loss of Pounds 5,000, why
should he be allowed to increase the cost of the profitable investment but
not that of the unprofitable one? Wherein lieth the difference, pray?
Being a pessimist by nature, I don't suppose he can be persuaded to change
his mind, but might I suggest to him that at the very least, the book cost
of all investments held at November 30 1993 should be revalued to the
November RPI level, whether they are eventually sold at a profit or a loss?
This would eliminate the element of retrospectivity in his proposal, which
is thoroughly unfair, particularly to those who may have held an investment
for many years.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Private finance before London bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANCISCO L BORGES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a US market leader in insuring municipal bonds, my company would
endorse the comments made in your leader 'A mega-bond of London' (November
29) that the issue of bonds secured by future revenue streams could be the
answer to the capital's transport infrastructure problems.
However, our experience suggests that government should recognise that in
most cases public finance up front would be required to attract private
investors. Bond finance could come in after one to three years of operation
when a track record of revenue streams and a credit-rating for the issuing
body had been established.
A reasonable number of 'live' projects are required to develop a senior bond
market for long-term debt. Therefore the announcements in the chancellor's
Budget on the development of the private finance initiative are a welcome
step in the right direction, although a firm foundation for the ground-rules
now needs to be established.

ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES (PG)
Barry Sonnenfeld
AMERICAN HEART (15)
Martin Bell
THE SECRET ADVENTURES OF TOM THUMB (12)
Dave Borthwick
OZU SEASON
Christmas] We recognise it from the blood-dimmed tide of non-Christmassy
film fare that washes up on our shores each year from Hollywood. Thanks to
the time lag in US-UK release patterns, what the Americans get at Halloween
we British get at Yuletide. We leave the front door looking for joy and
jollity; we reach the cinema to be greeted by strangely-dressed persons
shrieking 'Trick or treat?'
Addams Family Values is no treat and could well be investigated under
charges of trickery. Soon after seeing the film I looked up the word
'comedy' in a dictionary. It says (Shorter OED), 'A light and amusing
stage-play' - or by extension film - 'with a happy conclusion to its plot.'
Even allowing for licensed exceptions to this such as black comedy and
horror comedy, what do we make of a movie that dons floor-length Gothic
garb, assembles a cast of overactive, in-your-face ghouls, cracks one
unfunny gag after another and deploys an interminable series of
near-homicidal set pieces.
These range from a gold-digging black-widow nanny (Joan Cusack), out to
ensnare and then snuff out Uncle Fester, to the two children, her charges,
who keep trying to murder their new baby brother. (Just what we in Britain
need: a comedy about infanticidal pre-teeners.)
I confess I hated the first Addams film even though millions, to judge by
box-office receipts, did not. I suspect it won its audiences, like
Ghostbusters before it, by jumping on them from a great height. Large with
OTT acting, special effects and subtlety-bypass decor, these movies come
down on the viewer like collapsing scenery. You have to laugh: either you
are too dazed to do anything else or you feel that more scenery will be
dropped on you if you do not.
What astonishes us about Addams Family Values is that it did not attract a
script doctor during pre-production. The film does not know when to stop,
has little idea of how to begin, and moves forward by a process of 'Quick,
who's got the next gimmick?' jolts and nudges.
Paul Rudnik's script and Barry Sonnenfeld's direction take the over-obvious
and then rake it with spotlights. It is not enough for 'Thing', the
dismembered hand, to put in the odd surprise appearance on someone's
shoulder. He must dance, somersault and skateboard. It is not enough for
Gomez and Morticia to do a slinky-camp tango in a cellar restaurant. They
must stomp, somersault and literally set the place on fire. Oh the sadness
of such frenzy. Good spoof Gothic, as the late Mr Vincent Price taught us,
needs as much subtlety and poetry as good True Gothic.
Santa Claus should give the cast, crew and director a free pass to an
aesthetic detox clinic. Talented troupers like Anjelica Huston and Raul
Julia can then get the whole series and its spell out of their system and
return to making good grown-up films or even good children's films. Did you
ever see Miss Huston in The Witches or Prizzi's Honour? They are both on TV
over Christmas: save your Addams admission money.
Or alternatively give it to the Actors In Crisis fund. Another example this
week is Jeff Bridges, starring in another un-Christmassy film called
American Heart. Shoulder-long hair, industrial-strength chin stubble and
viva-Zapata moustache announce 'character'; just as a funny accent and
portly gait announced 'character' in Bridges's last role, the killer in The
Vanishing. These are the signs of a man passing from his handsome lead
heyday into that grim half-world where Tinseltown no longer offers
easy-option starring roles. So the actor starts exercising hitherto unused
acting muscles in a bid to re-qualify as a serious thespian.
British ex-documentarist Martin Bell here places a fiction filter over the
clear-eyed camera-sense he brought to his raw, moving portrait of Seattle
low life, Streetwise.
Staying in Seattle but swapping the documentary for drama a these, he and
writer Peter Silverman push ex-convict Jeff Bridges into a DIY
rehabilitation programme involving manual labour (window-cleaning), dreams
of flight to Alaska, love (Lucinda Jenney) and coping with a
mother-deprived, crime-prone teenage son (Edward Furlong).
For a lost hero searching for himself, this is a busy programme. But then
movies like this have their shopping lists of Important Themes, and we the
audience must sit in the trolley while the director wheels us from shelf to
shelf.
We are never caught up in the expedition and, like many shopping trips, this
one ends in tears at the check-out counter. Plots collide, tempers fray and
the film's makers find they have not brought enough pay-offs to cover all
the goods. (How does the wounded hero make it to the ferry? What will he and
his son do in Alaska?) As for the film's star, one wishes there were a Santa
in the store. Old Cottonwool could pull Mr Bridges out from the queue, dust
him down and tell him to drop the over anxious chameleonism and go back to
being, at least in part, himself.
For your next Christmas treat welcome to The Secret Adventures Of Tom Thumb.
This does for the well-loved fable . . . well, let us just say that it does
for the well-loved fable. Wielding blood, shadows, nasty insects,
hypodermics and pixilated movement - even the humans in this
claymation-plus-live-action film move in eerie stop-motion - the Bristol
animation team 'bolexbrothers' create a fairy tale from hell.
But allowing for cries of seasonal dismay, this is oddly impressive. Once
again a Halloween movie, this time homemade, has hit the screens a month
late. And the redfaced BBC might prefer that it had not hit them at all.
Having funded the project, Auntie then shelved it in horror until the film
got loose and started to win festival prizes. With its blend of Sci-Fi and
lower-depths squalor, with its foetus-like hero moving through landscapes
wriggling with the surreal, it packs a horrible, fascinating punch: as if
Hieronymus Bosch had taken over Jackanory.
To calm yourself down, you might visit the Yasujiro Ozu season at London's
Renoir. Six cooling masterworks from the Japanese director of Tokyo Story,
Late Spring and An Autumn Afternoon. Things do not so much 'happen' in Ozu
films as exist in a state of suspended dramatic animation. The human
heartbeat is there, but anyone used to Addams Family films had better take a
stethoscope. It beats as much in the scenes of plain domestic realism
(Kitchen Sink goes Buddhist) as in the occasional flurry of high drama like
a dropped rice bowl, a visit from Granny, a bad school report. These films
will do for Christmas, especially if you like your Christmases peaceful.
Less, in the hands of a master, is so much more.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: A superb 'Iolanta' - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the orchestral funding fiasco rebounds on the Arts Council, the Royal
Philharmonic, least favoured of the three orchestras under review, has
boldly announced its new RPO Maryinsky-Kirov Series, under the artistic
directorship of the Kirov's dynamic young chief, Valery Gergiev.
Designed as a celebration of the cultural richness of St Petersburg, past
and present, the series will have among its many attractions the concert
performances of Russian operas little-known in the West; western music
associated with the city, and works by contemporary Russian composers.
Singers and instrumentalists will appear in a parallel recital series.
The venture was launched at the Royal Albert Hall on Monday night with a
deeply moving account of Tchaikovsky's last opera, the one-act Iolanta
(1892). Nobody who heard this performance will ever again dismiss Iolanta.
It is a fragile, achingly poignant piece in a category of its own, full of
music of rapt beauty. The awakening - and cure - through love of Princess
Iolanta, blind from birth, must have had allegorical significance for the
tormented composer; equally, optimistic Russians today might find a parallel
in their own recent artistic liberation.
As we have come to expect, Gergiev went straight to the heart of the piece:
the woodwind introduction, problematic to some ears, emerged fluidly
sculpted. Throughout the evening every detail was in place, yet the music
remained spontaneous and unfolded freely.
This vocal feast assembled 10 Kirov singers on the platform. Galina
Gorchakova, enchanting in the title role, caught in her shining soprano all
the maidenly innocence. The suitors Robert (Sergey Leiferkus) and Vaudemont
(Gegam Grigorian) - Covent Garden's Onegin and Lensky in the summer -
established lively dialogue rare in concert performances. Leiferkus,
mellifluous as always, focused every word, and Grigorian sang ardently: his
tenor, strong in the Imperial Russian mould, poured out golden tone, filling
the cavernous hall at the climax of his aria.
Bulat Minzhilkiev's imposing bass strode nobly through the arching phrases
of the King's aria; the rich-voiced mezzo Larissa Dyadkova sang warmly as
Iolanta's nurse Martha. Though the Kirov is above all a great ensemble
company, it is hard to resist singling out the smaller roles: Tatyana
Kravtsova and Olga Korzhenskaya, as Iolanta's friends Brigitte and Laura,
blended beautifully in their lullaby. Each singer (and the London Choral
Society, doing their best with the Russian) gave full meaning to the text -
which is just as well, since although almost half the programme book was
devoted to a translation, the house lights were, perversely, turned down.
A memorable evening: Iolanta features in Gergiev's recording plans for the
Philips Kirov Edition, and is now impatiently awaited.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Jane Eyre' as Bronte puppet - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the many great novels of the 19th century, Jane Eyre is one of the few
that stands out like a myth. The austere, unpretty, uncompromising governess
Jane Eyre and her haunted employer Rochester with his hidden past: these two
are archetypes for all time. As I watched Fay Weldon's stage adaptation,
currently at the Playhouse, I realised how much Charlotte Bronte's novel had
influenced others - Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, of course; and, more
subtly, Henry James's Turn of the Screw. Come to think of it, Jane Eyre is
even a forereunner of the Diana-and-Charles story: innocent teenage girl
involved in educating the young is irresistibly drawn to moody mysterious
hero with guilty secret; on the brink of marrying him, she stumbles on the
secret other woman in his life . . .
As long as it focuses on the changing relationship of Jane and Rochester
this adaptation has plenty going for it. Neither Alexandra Mathie (Jane) nor
Tim Pigott-Smith (Rochester) is ideal - she is too self-consciously pious,
with a bad attack of nobility about the nostrils; he too much the angry lout
 -but the story of their surprising attraction is alive. And Fay Weldon's
script is at its most sensitive, intelligent and faithful while it keeps
them in its sights.
Elsewhere, however, this is a dire and coarse evening. Weldon has had the
idea of telling Jane's early life, not directly as in the novel, but
obliquely: (a) Jane narrates it to her pupil, Adele (b) Adele helps to act
it out, holding up a 'Jane Eyre' doll and ventriloquising her lines. The
core of the novel lies in the unrepentant first-person account of Jane's
anger as a child; Weldon has boiled this away. Later, she reduces the St
John Rivers episode to its most melodramatic and sexist ingredients. This
novel deals with the fine and brave feelings that make its heroine unusual -
a kind of rebel; but Weldon has so cheapened everything that we are
surprised that Jane is as polite as she is.
More silly yet, Weldon keeps bringing on the Brontes themselves to comment
on the story to one another. OK, yes, we do think of all the Brontes at
Haworth whenever we pick up one of their books - but we forget them once we
start reading. Jane Eyre in particular is an all-absorbing world. Not so
here: Weldon even puts lines from the book into the Brontes' mouths. Thus it
is not Jane Eyre but Anne Bronte who speaks the great lines 'Women feel just
as men feel . . . they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a
stagnation . . .' In context, this actually robs the words of their true
feminist impact; and the whole device weakens Jane by making her look like a
Bronte puppet.
Most of the supporting players take several roles. Thus Jane Campion plays
Emily Bronte, Mrs Rochester, Blanche Ingram, Celine, Mrs Reed and Miss
Scratchard; and she is perfectly dreadful in all of them - crude,
exaggerated, superficial. Almost everyone onstage keeps reminding you that
they are Actors Acting. This production comes to us from Theatr Clwyd and
Thorndike Theatre Productions, and is directed by Helena Kaut-Howson, who
must take responsibility for all this. The ludicrously melodramatic music
would grace a Hammer Horror production. There are elements of Gothick horror
and of feminist protest in Jane Eyre, but they are worked into a texture
more romantically poetic, more morally subtle, and more emotionally poignant
than Weldon &amp; Co. know how to handle.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: 'The Good Natur'd Man' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Orange Tree in Richmond is the pleasantest of London's admirable array
of small theatres. Whereas the Gate and the Bush tend to specialise in
passionate intensity, the Orange Tree has a lighter touch. And so it is with
The Good Natur'd Man which makes a natural complement to the same author's
She Stoops to Conquer, still running in the West End.
Oliver Goldsmith wrote The Good Natur'd Man around 1767, about five years
before She Stoops. The former is not nearly as funny nor as mature as the
latter, but it is still, in parts, a very elegant piece of writing and what
the two pieces have in common is an abundance of good nature. This is not
incompatible with satire: it simply illustrates the point that you do not
have to shout in order to be heard.
The Good Natur'd Man should really be called The Good Natur'd Woman. For the
male hero, aptly named Honeywood, carries good nature to the point of
naivete and beyond. There is a splendid female by the name of Miss Richland
who bails him out.
Played here by Claire Rushbrook, Miss Richland has all the desirable
attributes: looks, sense, money and good nature to boot. It is not the
largest part in the play, but it is the key. Ms Rushbrook (a name that might
have been invented by Goldsmith) never shows off, not even stooping to
effortless superiority. She just stands there, holds the ground, and is
superb.
The plot is hard to follow, even when you have done your homework. A subplot
about a potential elopement to Scotland is unnecessary except to give the
play a decent length. A man called Croaker seems impossible in the written
script, but in practice, given a sprightly performance by Will Knightley, he
is a distinctly recognisable figure who simply changes his mind with each
new piece of hearsay.
Some of the dialogue is delightful. Croaker had a friend named Dick Doleful
who 'before he made away with himself used to say 'Croaker rhymes with
joker', so we used to laugh'. Mrs Croaker, by contrast, is a woman described
as 'all laughs and no jokes'. Clearly there are tensions beneath the
surface.
There is also some tenderness, as when the good natur'd man and Miss
Richland talk about how they first met at the French Ambassador's. Honeywood
asked the plainest woman in the room to dance because he felt sorry for her:
Miss Richland noticed and danced with him the next night. Some social
comment, too: catch a passing reference to a man called Lord Neverout, who
might be still with us today.
Anthony Cornish who produced the piece in New York last year, directs. Here,
it is an example of the fringe playing to near perfection.
Orange Tree, Richmond until January 29. (081) 940 3633

Today's programme in BBC2's admirable series Human Rights, Human Wrongs is
presented by American playwright Arthur Miller. He declares that freedom of
information is the touchstone of all the freedoms enshrined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, but points out that imprisonment is now being
replaced by violence, 'censorship by the bullet', as the favoured means used
by repressive governments to silence writers and reporters (8.20).
Episode 1 of ITV's series Hollywood Women, which looked from the hype as
though it was going to be just a good excuse for eyeing lots of gorgeous
bodies, turned out to be both better and worse than that. Worse in that it
was edited into insultingly brief soundbites, better in that it had a
perfectly serious point to make about plastic surgery and the obsession with
eternal youth. Today's programme (9.00) is about women and the casting
couch.
Channel 4's documentary series The Plague looks at the formation of Aids
pressure groups and the reactions of government bodies (9.00).

FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Punchbag' and 'Jamais Vu'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Punchbag, a new play by Robert Llewellyn, is set in a women's self-defence
class. The Hampstead stage is given over to the gym in Julian McGowan's neat
design, with encouraging slogans - Assess; React; Terminate - around the
walls.
We, the audience, are the students, and a strangely passive lot, too,
unmoved by the extraordinary courtship routines taken place around us. They
involve instructor Lloyd, his side-kick Peter, who, as the 'punchbag',
spends most of the play dressed like a plastic ladybird in protective
clothing, and two of the women honing up their defence skills, spikey Jane
and soft Polly.
It is billed as a 'physical comedy', and there can be no complaints about
the physical as the four actors fling themselves across the stage with
frightening force and agility at Glen Walford's direction. The laughs come
if you enjoy seeing women kick men in the groin; there is little doubt who
the winners are here.
Robert Llewellyn's play bears similarities to those Victorian moral tales
which were expected to pep up the poor. In the first act we learn why women
must be physically prepared to ward off fallen man; in the second, why there
is little good in getting the body in shape if morals remain lax. At the end
comes the sanctimonious punch line - to be really acceptable men must learn
to say no.
The characters are lightly sketched but the acting is so lively that you can
forget the sermon and enjoy the fights. Sophie Heyman is excellent as the
girl who likes to say yes; Buffy Davis is credible as the susceptible nice
one, as is Eamonn Walker as the black leader burdened with sex appeal and
Andy Serkis, as the wimp.
*
Ken Campbell walks on to the stage of the Vaudeville clutching the Evening
Standard Comedy of the Year award. 'You can make your own mind up now', he
says, placing it alongside the models of Munch's 'Scream' and a sexually
erect Pacific Islander which comprise the minimalist set for his one man
monologue, Jamais Vu.
But can you make up your own mind? Over the next 2 1/2 hours Campbell makes
the mind a very confusing place. His own embarks from Gant's Hill Library on
a surreal journey, embracing John Birt clones, the Duke of Edinburgh and the
inhabitants of Tanna, who regard the Duke as a God.
On the way he befriends oddballs, from a drop out barrister happy in
cardboard city to a resident of the Uxbridge Secure Unit, and he takes
seriously their unreliable contributions to his convoluted ramble.
Campbell is not for me. His comic personality is too close to the crazies he
picks up to be relaxing. He is spot on at reproducing the scientific jargon
which drives on their fantasies, but this is disturbing rather than witty.
Sometimes, as in his imaginative conversations with Richard Eyre, director
of the National Theatre (where Jamais Vu started) he sounds like Frankie
Howerd on speed; sometimes he descends to desperate clowning, attaching sink
plungers to his bald head.
Campbell has a sympathetic personality and there is the occasional sharp
one-liner. But he expects much of the audience in forcing it to linger so
long to discover whether he can tie his imaginative meanderings into a
coherent climax.

FT  09 DEC 93 / People: Capel's management gets a shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Smedley, head of James Capel's European operations, is stepping down
as part of a management shake-up at the top of the London stockbroking arm
of HSBC Holdings, Britain's biggest bank.
Smedley, 42, who joined Capel in 1979, has spent most of his career on the
international side. He opened Capel's New York office in 1984 and has been
chairman of James Capel Europe since 1989.
He said yesterday he was resigning from the firm because he felt he had
completed his strategic task.
When he took charge of Capel's Continental European operations it was ranked
number eight in the Extel rankings. It is now second only to S G Warburg.
Although the parting is described as 'amicable' it is understood that Capel
is keen to modernise the management of a side of its business which has not
always lived up to expectations in terms of profitability.
Lin Moran, the head of European research, and Angus McNeilage, European
sales chief, will take over Smedley's responsibilities.
However, the exodus of old James Capel hands is not all one way.
Philip Gray, 45, who began his City career as a European equity analyst with
Capel in 1972, is rejoining his old firm as head of James Capel Asia,
covering Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul
and Taipei. After leaving Capel he spent 15 years as a fund manager with
with GT Management. He is chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Investment
Analysts and was responsible for launching GT's emerging market funds.
Along with Moran, Gray is one of a dozen new directors of a much expanded
board of James Capel Holdings, parent of James Capel &amp; Co.
Other members of the new board include David Gray, head of UK research; John
Green, head of corporate broking; and Peter Maynard, head of James Capel
Inc. The board of James Capel &amp; Co has also more than doubled in size with
the appointment of 16 new directors.

FT  09 DEC 93 / People: Highland fling for former Premier Brands man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Tourist Board has appointed Derek Reid, right, once a prominent
figure in the UK food industry, to become its new chief executive. He takes
over in mid-January when Tom Band, who came from a civil service background,
retires.
Reid, 49, an Aberdonian by birth, spent his early career with
Cadbury-Schweppes, becoming managing director of Cadbury-Typhoo and then
managing director of the group's foods and tea business. In 1986 he was
founding member of Premier Brands, which bought out Cadbury-Typhoo. In 1989
Premier Brands was sold to Hillsdown Holdings but Reid stayed on until 1990
to smoothe the transition.
He then returned to Scotland, becoming a director of A I Welders in
Inverness, a buyout from the engineers Verson International. He also bought
Farleyer House, an upmarket Perthshire hotel.
His return to full-time executive life - 'I feel pretty young and energetic'
 -comes at a crucial time for the STB. Not only has Scottish tourism been
flagging in the recession, but the STB is to be completely restructured.
It will lose to the local enterprise companies its role of giving financial
aid to tourism development and will concentrate on marketing. It will also,
on government orders, re-locate a large part of its operations from
Edinburgh to Inverness, something which a good number of seasoned tourist
industry people think a rather bizarre idea.
Reid is not the first person from a private sector background to supervise
the STB, but he is the only one with recent experience of running a Highland
hotel - and a good number of such hotels have recently ended in
receivership.
Reid's answer to the problem, which applies to Scottish tourism in general,
is to be much more innovative. He started a bistro in the hotel and opened
his doors to children. Farleyer House, from which he will resign as a
director, should make a small profit next year.

The British Wool Marketing Board has appointed Ian Hartley to take over as
managing director when Maurice Grass retires in January.
Hartley takes over at a crucial time for the wool board; this year British
farmers lost government subisidies provided for wool production  - and at a
time of depressed world prices.
Hartley has been deputy managing director of the wool board since 1991 after
joining it in 1986 as commercial director of wool growers.
The wool board handles all British fleece wool - around 50m kg a year -
worth Pounds 35m.

FT  09 DEC 93 / People: Switched on at East Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Time was when the route to the top in the electricity sector was a lifetime
of work in the industry. The appointment yesterday of Norman Askew as chief
executive at East Midlands electricity is the latest in a series of
appointments at regional electricity companies, or recs, which show how
times have changed since privatisation.
Other recent external recruits to senior rec posts include John Devaney, now
chief executive at Eastern Electricity but formerly of the US motor
industry, and Andrew Walker who is to succeed David Jones as chief executive
of Swalec.
Like Walker, Askew came from TI, where he was in charge of the aerospace
division. Unlike him, however, he served a year-long apprenticeship before
winning the chief executive's job which he takes up in April. He was
appointed managing director last July.
Askew's elevation follows the decision by John Harris to relinquish the role
of combined chief executive and chairman. Harris will remain executive
chairman.
In stepping up the management ladder, Askew, 51, will assume responsibility
for finance and corporate affairs in addition to his current roles.
Following the decision by Mike Carus to retire as finance director, the
company is expecting to appoint a replacement to report to Askew shortly.
Meanwhile Askew is completing a shake-up of executive responsiblities
following the move earlier this year to rationalise the company's 13 cost
centres into seven profit centres and to cut Pounds 15m of costs annually.
The reorganisation of the company also includes cutting out several tiers of
management.
'This does not in itself save huge amounts of costs, but it is terribly
important in terms of liberalising the business and letting people loose,'
says Askew.
The company also announced that three associate directors are taking early
retirement. They are Stan Errington, (personnel), Graeme Myring
(engineering) and Mike Fisher (marketing).

FT  09 DEC 93 / Technology: Cars that can save your life - Protection in
road accidents is now a selling point, as Andrew Fisher reports in a series
on transport safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's cars are safer than ever, but this is not true of all drivers. Bad
driving causes most accidents, not faulty design. The seasonal pile-ups on
European motorways at times of bad weather and low visibility happen because
people drive too fast and too close together.
But safer cars can increase the chances of survival, however carelessly
people drive on highways, town roads or country lanes. Although accident
rates have decreased in many countries, despite steady growth in traffic,
the number of deaths is still high - some 154,000 a year worldwide,
including 50,000 in the EU, 47,000 in the US and 13,000 in Japan. Global
injuries exceed 5m.
As a result, safety features in cars have achieved a greater prominence than
ever in motor companies' design and marketing policies. Television
advertisements are just as likely to show how tough and manoeuvrable cars
are as to parade their performance and glamour.
Figures from the German motor industry association show that human factors
account for 90 per cent of accidents resulting in injury; the other causes
are mainly poor weather, bad roads, and faulty vehicles and maintenance.
Thus the main intention behind the emphasis on safety technology is to save
people from the consequences of their own and others' bad driving.
Car buyers seem more willing to pay extra for safety as new features are
developed. 'It is obvious that manufacturers now see safety as a sellable
item,' says Ken Barnes, head of engineering at Britain's Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Sweden's Volvo used to be alone in highlighting its models' safety
qualities. Now, its rivals vie to do the same. Technological advances have
made available a wide range of sophisticated braking, suspension,
structural, and body protection systems for today's cars.
'People used to say 'safety doesn't sell',' adds Malcolm Thomas, overseeing
the introduction of Ford Motor's Mondeo mid-range family and company car in
the US after managing its launch in Europe. 'Twenty years ago, those in the
industry wondered how you could get people to pay extra for safety.' There
is still a limit to how much car buyers will pay. But manufacturers are now
far more alert to changing customer perceptions - airbags, for example, are
increasingly seen as essential in new cars, especially in the US - as well
as to legislative trends.
Safety is now an important part of companies' competitive strategy.
'Manufacturers are leapfrogging each other,' says Gary Suthurst, an
automotive consultant at the Cranfield Impact Centre. 'Safety will continue
to increase as a prime marketing strategy, mainly due to competitive and
consumer pressure rather than legislative moves.'
When designing the Mondeo, Ford decided to integrate safety into the overall
construction from the start. It drew up safety guidelines for its engineers.
'The idea was to get away from being reactive to safety legislation and to
be pro-active,' adds Thomas.
It took into account likely changes in the law that would affect the car not
only when it was introduced but well into its life. Among the standard
features on the Mondeo are steering wheel airbags, anti-lock braking systems
(ABS), seat-belt grabbers and pretensioners using sensors to reduce slack on
impact, and seats with 'anti-submarine' ramps to stop them sliding forward
in a crash.
For its side-impact bars - another feature that companies are marketing more
and more in new vehicles - Ford went to Sweden for special boron steel which
has very high-tensile strength. 'Previously,' says Thomas, 'we might have
gone for mild or high-strength steel tubes.'
Side-impact bars were originally developed in the US, where many accidents
involve pick-up trucks. Not all experts believe they are necessarily suited
to European conditions, in which collisions mostly occur between vehicles of
similar size. In fact, says Suthurst, stiff impact bars can harm passengers,
especially in four-door cars with a rigid upright in the middle.
The question of side impact has gained increasing attention in recent years.
At present, European regulations specify only the need for cars to be tested
for full frontal impact. But most accidents involve some form of angled
collision.
Auto Motor und Sport, the German motor magazine, caused a furore when it
started testing cars by crashing only one side into a concrete block.
Instead of the force being evenly absorbed by the protective struts at the
front of the car, these were distorted. Passengers were thus at greater risk
than the frontal tests had indicated.
Such so-called offset tests are now being studied in Europe for possible
introduction, using angled barriers with anti-slide devices to reproduce
typical accident conditions. However, useful as they are, tests cannot
guarantee cars' safety in widely varying conditions.
'Often, companies know how to make cars better than the law requires,' says
Majid Sadeghi, managing director of the Cranfield centre (part of Cranfield
Institute of Technology). Tests have to be repeatable and can give only a
simplified version of road conditions.
For several years, the big car companies have used supercomputers to
simulate crash conditions and speed up design work on safety features. Ford
made intensive use of these to build the Mondeo and ensure it could be
adapted for North America and other markets.
'You can strip away all the elements of the car in a computer model,' says
John Charles, safety supervisor at Ford's UK research unit in Essex. 'You
can test all the components and materials for stresses and strains.' This
cuts down on the number of controlled crashes that car companies need to do,
saving time and money.
'On a computer, you can simulate different types of occupant,' explains Udo
Westfal, director of safety at the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association in Brussels. 'Instead of using dummies, you can vary the size of
the occupant. It's a very advanced way of developing a safe product without
using an infinite number of cars.'
For US tests, the dummy's acceleration has to be measured. (In European
tests, only the steering wheel's movement is recorded.) 'Most serious impact
occurs in the first 20 to 40 milliseconds,' says Aruna Tilakasiri, a
computer applications engineer at Ford in Essex. 'So we show the result up
to 50 milliseconds.' Computers also show how airbags absorb the impact of
crashes at different speeds.
In an accident, a person's body weight can move at a pressure of up to 50
times gravity in a frontal impact. Safety belts are designed to absorb these
huge forces. For further protection, Audi, the up-market subsidiary of
Germany's Volkswagen group, has developed the procon-ten (programmed
contraction and tension) system using steel cables to pull the steering
wheel away from the driver.
As more companies offer airbags, mainly for drivers as extra protection
against steering wheel injuries, buyers have yet another feature to weigh up
in the cost-safety equation. While some top-of-the-range manufacturers such
as Mercedes-Benz already provide airbags in all their cars, these are now
becoming common on smaller models.
'This is a big step forward and it is being initiated not by legislation but
by competition,' says Westfal. Not all experts are convinced of the value of
airbags, arguing that their popularity in the US reflects the fact that
drivers are less keen on wearing seat-belts than in Europe.
However, Jurgen Gerstenmeier, a development manager at Robert Bosch, the
German automotive equipment maker, says airbags could help prevent injuries
in 68 per cent of accidents; use of driver airbags in all cars could cut
yearly deaths by 50,000. Even side airbags are being worked on. Too many
safety features, though, could prove too costly for most drivers - it would
be simpler, and cheaper, if they drove slower and more safely.
The series concludes next week with a look at marine safety.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Technology: Prometheus unbound - A look at progress in
Europe's traffic technology project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prometheus, say supporters, is alive and well and will prove it in Paris
next October when the EU's leading indigenous vehicle makers and close
associates in electronics and components will demonstrate, for the first
time in three years, their progress under one of the region's biggest
collaborative research programmes.
Prometheus stands, in this case, not for the ill-fated thief of fire from
the gods, but Programme for a European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and
Unprecedented Safety. The Paris exposition will show more of the wide
variety of technology - some of it in vehicles which can be driven - which
has been developed since Prometheus first began in 1986. It ranges from
systems allowing drivers to 'see' through dark and fog, to
ultra-sophisticated route guidance and congestion avoidance systems.
The research and development engineers and scientists engaged in Prometheus
have, by agreement, worked mostly behind closed doors since the first
display of the technology's potential in Turin in late 1991. That was
largely to convince technocrats from both Brussels and individual
governments that funding of Prometheus to the tune of some Ecu90m (Pounds
69m) a year was worthwhile.
Renewed funding commitments are required from the end of next year and
industry participants say progress is such that refusal will be difficult.
If Prometheus achieves its goals, the EU's 50,000 road deaths a year will be
halved and transport efficiency, measured by traffic flows, increased by a
third by 2010.
The October exhibition will also be used to announce the next phase of
Prometheus - and potentially its most significant in terms of the
technology's availability both to drivers and within the transport
infrastructure. This is because the bulk of the technology is unlikely to be
made commercially available before the end of the decade.
This will be later than first hoped when Prometheus was beginning in the
late 1980s, but nevertheless is not surprising given the inevitable delays
and complications of developing such technologies from basic concepts. For
the momentum of Prometheus to be sustained, say the 20 industry
participants, not only must the EU be prepared to continue funding -
although two-thirds of the project is already financed by the industries
involved - but governments and Brussels must make greater progress in
defining a co-ordinated transport strategy for Europe.
'Prometheus certainly cannot solve all the transport and traffic problems on
its own; technical measures must be accompanied by social concepts that
allow the reduction of traffic peaks, improve traffic efficiency and reduce
the need for mobility. That includes more flexible shop hours as well as
spreading working hours,' warns a strategy document on the direction of
Prometheus from the end of this year.
A few technologies are already starting to move away from the Prometheus
programme, which is seen as strictly non-competitive, collaborative
research, towards commercialisation.
These include basic vision enhancement, through the use of ultra-violet
light in headlamps and fluorescent road markings, and an emergency call
system based on the GSM satellite communications network. Field trials of
the ultra-violet system have begun in Sweden, where it has been mainly
developed by Volvo and Saab. Similarly, the emergency call system was being
tested throughout last year. It allows for the automatic location by
emergency services of a crashed vehicle.
The location system illustrates the way in which Prometheus technology can
overlap as it can form part of other systems such as satellite-based fleet
management and automatic route guidance.
If a final format can be agreed, the system could be in use by 1995.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Classroom exports -
UK boarding schools are attracting more foreign pupils with vigorous
marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Pipers' Corner School. 15 miles from Heathrow,' proclaimed a banner at a
recent exhibition of UK independent schools. It was by no means the only one
enthusiastically touting its convenience for international travellers.
The recession, and its impact on wealthy parents' salaries, has given UK
boarding schools a stressful few years, and last year saw a sharp,
headline-grabbing fall of 6 per cent in the total number of boarders at UK
schools.
But the same survey showed that their success as exporters had improved
noticeably, with a rise in foreign pupils of 3.9 per cent.
Boarding schools have always provided a home for the children of British
expatriates, but they are now increasingly selling their wares to
foreigners.
Starting from a base in areas of strong British influence, notably Hong Kong
and Singapore, schools are now recruiting heavily from the other emerging
economies of the Pacific - despite competition from Australia and the US -
and are even beginning to penetrate Europe and the Middle East.
Last year, the number of new recruits from Hong Kong increased from 458 to
506, while the remainder of East Asia saw an increase from 391 to 441. The
number of new Europeans rose from 568 to 605.
Apart from extensive and ambitious trips to drum up custom, schools are also
tailoring the courses they offer to include internationally recognised
qualifications and lessons in English as a second language.
Free transport between airport and school is provided each term for the
pupils, and marketing material is slickly produced in several languages.
Foreigners come for differing reasons, which the Independent Schools
Information Service (Isis) is careful to analyse. According to John Towey,
of Isis, British schools are now recapturing ground previously lost to
Australia.
Schools there appealed to Asian parents because fees tended to be lower, and
transport costs were less prohibitive. Parents these days are usually making
a hard-headed investment rather than looking for any 'snob' value carried by
Britain's public schools.
An important attraction of British schools is the route they offer into
British higher education. Parents in Hong Kong, Taiwan or Malaysia are
increasingly keen for the career advantages this can offer.
Towey also notes a sharp change in attitude in the last three or four years.
Parents now want close details of exactly who is going to care for their
child, and some guarantee of a stable background.
Getting the message across, however, is time-consuming and expensive.
Parents are widely dispersed, and need close attention from school
representatives before they will commit their children to a journey around
the world.
An ever-growing number of school development officers have therefore
resorted to lengthy trips to East Asia. Many schools use the co-ordinated
marketing offered by Isis, which arranges international exhibitions and
fairs in these areas. But increasingly, head teachers are travelling in
person.
Not only the more eye-catching public schools are looking east. St Aubyn's,
a Sussex prep school with around only 115 pupils, still felt it worthwhile
to send its headmaster on a tour of Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong this
year.
It is a traditional cosy prep school, but still uses high-quality marketing
aids. Julian James, St Aubyn's headmaster, took copies of the school video,
featuring a voice-over by television presenter Chris Serle, and ringing
endorsements from the former heads of Radley and Harrow.
The message is clear - truly ambitious parents can improve their son's
chances of a place at a public school by placing him at a prep school first.
Statistics on the number of boys moving on to Eton and Winchester were also
readily available.
However, James found that parents were most keen just to find a stable
environment for their children. The other vital point was academic quality -
the Chinese, in particular, were anxious that their children would be worked
hard, and that they would go on to good public schools and universities.
However, he did find one note of caution for schools which are boosting
foreign recruitment - many parents were keen that most of their sons'
companions would be English. As a result, St Aubyn's is limiting its
non-English intake to 10 per cent.
Cultural differences can make negotiations more difficult. Richard Pearce,
admissions director for the International School of London, has compiled a
glossary of what parents really mean by the questions they ask. For example:
'We have heard that your school is the best in England' could mean 'Prestige
is important in our country and there are few prestigious schools,' or it
might just be an attempt to be polite.
Another common question is: 'Is your school recognised by the ministry of
education?' Pearce interprets this as a statement that certificates matter
more than general education, and that in the home country some, or all,
private schools are of dubious quality.
Tactics for attracting students from Europe are different. The opportunity
to improve English is important, while A-levels, attractive to children from
East Asia hoping to go to an English university, are less popular.
Schools keen on signing up students from Europe are starting to offer the
International Baccalaureate, which is recognised in several countries, as an
alternative course.
Sevenoaks School in Kent introduced the IB 10 years ago, and is now truly
international, with 30 nationalities represented in its student body.
Malvern College in Worcestershire is also now offering the IB, and has been
rewarded with a sharp increase in applications from Germany. Many schools
now see a limited future for A-levels and the move towards the IB is likely
to continue.
Other independent schools are trying to build links with the former
communist bloc countries. Uppingham School, in Leicestershire, now has a
full-time European liaison officer, and offers scholarships to eastern
Europeans. The aim, apart from helping the countries in their hour of need,
is to build links with their future decision-makers.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bright spots in a
cloudy forecast - The outlook for global advertising growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outlook for global advertising is not as bright as it looked six months
ago, according to the latest advertising expenditure forecasts from Zenith,
the UK-based Saatchi and Saatchi media-buying company, published this week*.
Expectations of growth for 1994 have been cut to 5.5 per cent, compared with
the 6.2 per cent Zenith was hoping for when it last reported in July.
Similarly, forecasts for 1995 have been reduced to 6.5 per cent from 7.3 per
cent.
Zenith's six-monthly forecasts - which now predict a 4 per cent global
increase for 1993 - are among the most closely studied in the advertising
industry.
The scaling back of its expectations can chiefly be attributed to
deteriorations in the US and Japanese advertising markets. Figures for
Europe have remained stable, with the UK and France showing gradual
improvement.
The global figures also disguise areas of the world in which exceptionally
high growth is expected. Top of the league is China, where growth of nearly
72 per cent is expected over the next three years.
Rate increases in China continue at what Zenith calls a 'staggering pace' as
media owners cash in on heavy demand from overseas advertisers seeking to
reach the country's 1.2bn consumers. The report says that rates for foreign
advertisers are significantly higher than for Chinese companies. Demand
outstrips supply in advertising space and airtime.
In Greece, the only European country to be included in the report's top 10
countries for growth, television is the main focus of attention. New
licences were allocated this summer to six national operators - about 145
channels have been broadcasting illegally in the country for the past six
years. Daily newspapers have seen a decline in circulation, while magazines
have been strong. The increasing popularity of 'drivetime' radio has
prompted a continuing rise in radio's share of advertising revenue.
Moves have been made by the Thai government towards liberalising television,
which should augur well for spending in that area. The introduction of VAT
on advertising in Thailand last year did not have a big effect on
advertising spending, with two of the fastest-growing sectors being leisure
and transport. Thai Rat, the largest daily newspaper, continues to grow.
'Advertising demand for the title is enormous with advertisers being
allocated on average half of the advertising space requested,' says Zenith.
In the Philippines power cuts have darkened Manila for between four and nine
hours every day since 1991. In spite of this, television continues to claim
65 per cent of advertising expenditure and its share is forecast to continue
rising over the next three years.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why 3i catches the
eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This autumn's launch of a series of newspaper advertisements by 3i
(Investors in Industry) continues the tradition of colourful advertising
established by Britain's largest venture capital company in the early 1980s.
The first in the five-strong series, devised by J. Walter Thompson, showed
brightly coloured offices and factories - to represent the medium-sized
company sector - surrounded by the grim blacked-out skyscrapers of big
business.
The darker tone of this series reflects the tougher economic climate, says
Chris Woodward, 3i marketing director. 3i has long had a reputation for
innovation in an otherwise dull financial advertising sector, although its
ads have been criticised as lacking in gravitas. But, says Woodward, you
must grab the reader's attention.
British financial advertising may be old-fashioned, but in Germany, where 3i
has also established a market presence, it is Jurassic. So if anyone could
be expected to dismiss 3i's ads as lightweight it would be the German
entrepreneur or manager. But even in Germany response has been favourable,
says Woodward.
In the early days, 3i's ads featuring a pastel-wash 'eye' logo were striking
but little thought went into communicating what the company did - equity and
long-term loan finance for small and medium-sized firms. In recent years
advertising has focused more tightly on the 3i message and reaching the
right people. The latest campaign targets managers in the UK's 10,000
medium-sized businesses, a sector which 3i expects to grow rapidly.
In 3i's most recent managers survey, 200 were asked who they would approach
to start, grow or buy a business - 60 per cent mentioned 3i.
This figure compares with just 8 per cent in 1983 and is higher than for any
of the banks, says Woodward.
That is not surprising, given 3i's established position in the venture
market and the number of competing high street banks, but, claims Woodward,
it does show that 3i has established a brand for middle businesses, creating
a positive feeling among potential customers.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Accountancy Column: Dons learn that 'freedom' has a bottom
line - The often troubled relationship between the accountancy establishment
and academia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Censorship and academic accounting might seem rather unusual bedfellows, but
events in the last few weeks have provided a new focus on the tensions that
can be placed on dons when the world outside intersects with university
life.
Indications of the latest stresses came in two parliamentary early day
motions tabled at the start of this month by Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP
for Great Grimsby and accountancy profession scourge.
Nine MPs have signed a motion expressing doubts about the degree of
democracy exercised by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants
(ACCA). And 11 have signed a second, deploring attempts by the accountancy
profession to infringe academic freedom.
It began with a letter in May to the ACCA from Mr Prem Sikka, Mr Mitchell's
academic adviser from the University of East London. He questioned the
voting procedures used in ACCA's elections earlier this year, in which he
unsuccessfully stood as a candidate. The subsequent correspondence is now
half an inch thick.
Most significantly, the ACCA wrote to Sikka's vice chancellor in August
asking whether his institution endorsed these views. Sikka saw this as an
attempt to quash his opinions through pressure from above.
After many more exchanges, the ACCA apologised to Sikka in November for any
'embarrassment'. It added that it was now considering reforms to its
bye-laws - some of which address his concerns.
Mr Anthony Booth, director of professional standards at the ACCA, says if
there was institutional endorsement of Mr Sikka's views, the association may
have considered cancelling its long-standing accreditation of its courses at
the university which is 'based on trust'.
Sikka's concerns may be overplayed, but they highlight the stresses under
which academics - particularly those with controversial views - can be
placed. Other episodes concerning freedom of speech have long bubbled away
in the world of academia. But in the normally gossipy world of the common
room and conference circuit, people tend to clam up when they are asked for
examples.
An exception is David Cooper, now shielded by the relative safety of a post
at the University of Alberta in Canada. While Price Waterhouse professor of
accounting at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology (Umist) in 1984, at the time of the miners' strike, he published
an article in Accountancy magazine alleging 'misinformation' in the National
Coal Board's assessments of the financial viability of its coal mines.
That led to indignation from a member of the board, and triggered a review
of the editorial practices of Accountancy. Cooper says he also received a
phone call from Richard Wilkes, a partner at Price Waterhouse, which had
been appointed sequesters to the National Union of Mineworkers. 'He screamed
at me about causing the firm severe embarrassment and how could we bite the
hand that fed us and how PW would continue to fund the chair over his dead
body,' he recalls.
Mr Wilkes, now retired from PW, says: 'I did have words. It was an
irritation. We were just concerned that he didn't start impinging on our
activities. We were trying to keep a low profile.' After intervention from
other senior Umist officials, PW continued to fund the chair.
Another maverick don is Paul Barnes, Touche Ross reader in corporate finance
and accounting at Nottingham University. 'I was sued for libel over my PhD
thesis and I have never looked back since,' he says.
His comments on the Britannia Building Society brought proceedings which
remained a threat for two years. It also kindled a continuing research
interest in building societies, and the persistent ire of Mr Mark Boleat,
until recently director-general of the Building Societies Association.
Last year Barnes wrote a piece in Accountancy on building societies, which
triggered a highly-critical letter - copied to the senior partner of Touche
 -from Boleat. Barnes believes this damaged his reputation. It certainly
could not have helped him at a time when he was applying for a professorship
 -which he did not get.
Academics tell other stories anonymously: a vice-chancellor with business
connections who prevented the appointment to a named chair of a left-wing
lecturer; pressure from a group of accountants sponsoring a chair to
influence the selection; a young researcher threatened with a writ by a
group in the City when his findings proved critical of them.
Nor is the problem unique to the UK. Abe Briloff, emeritus professor of
accounting at Baruch College in New York, faced a defamation suit brought
against him in 1976 by Saul Steinberg, the corporate raider and head of
Reliance Group, after writing a critical article in Barron's magazine.
Some academics are less concerned by the pressures sponsorship presents  -
though most acknowledge that it does not leave them unaffected. One example
is Christopher Nobes, now Coopers &amp; Lybrand professor of accounting at
Reading University, who previously arranged endowed chairs at the University
of Strathclyde from both Touche Ross and Ernst &amp; Whinney. His contract
includes regular work for Coopers.
'In the days when firms were desperately short of graduate applicants and
had quite a lot of money, a few thousands of pounds here or there to
influence students was regarded as a worthwhile element in the recruitment
budget,' he says to explain the level of support. 'I believe in all cases
apart from mine, the firm has given money and then not really exercised any
influence over the appointment. The academic might occasionally go in for
lunch.
'Maybe sometimes a professor might feel constrained from saying things
because they are worried about what the firm or its clients might think, or
the professor doesn't like what the firm says,' suggests Nobes.
'I have sometimes not done things because of my link with Coopers. I have
never said something I don't believe. Sometimes I have not said things I do
believe. That is merely being responsible.'
He says that if he was asked to comment on the poor accounting policies of a
company, he would first ask whether it was a Coopers' client - and if so, he
would refuse.
'I don't see it as a problem. It is the inevitable result of something which
brings large benefits. I get much more informed on things and in effect I
have to sign the official secrets act.'
Even Paul Barnes, whose endowment was originally provided by Spicer &amp;
Oppenheim before it merged with Touche, says: 'I did feel constrained at one
time when the press were giving Spicers a bad time over its audit of Barlow
Clowes.' He wanted to intervene to defend the firm, but felt he would be
criticised as biased if he did.
Two years ago, he wrote a piece mischievously suggesting that the poor
research rating of accountancy in British universities reflected the lack of
independence of its funding.
More seriously, he argues that freedom of speech is hardly the prime concern
for most accounting academics because they are too focused on abstract
topics. 'Academics are too busy counting the number of angels on a pinhead
to even recognise the existence of, say, creative accounting,' he says.
Tony Steele, Ernst &amp; Young professor at Warwick University, who was himself
embroiled in legal action over current cost accounting in the mid-1980s,
adds: 'The real issue isn't pressure on academics because their work is so
relevant, but how we can get them to be less self-indulgent and more
relevant.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / November truck sales 26% higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK sales of new trucks were 26.5 per cent higher last month than in November
last year as the recovery in demand for heavy commercial vehicles gathered
pace.
Registrations of new commercial vehicles rose 6.3 per cent in November
year-on-year, the third consecutive monthly increase.
Commercial vehicle sales remained depressed in the first half of the year.
Yet in the past two months demand from the small-business and
local-distribution sector has increased, with rising registrations of medium
and heavy vans.
The first signs of recovery came from the heavy-truck market late last year,
as hauliers started to replace ageing fleets. Registrations of heavy trucks
(above 15 tonnes) last month were 37 per cent higher than a year before.
The UK is virtually the only truck market in west Europe in which demand is
growing. UK truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) have
risen by 15.5 per cent in the first 11 months.
Truck sales across west Europe are forecast to plunge more than 20 per cent
in the full year, the fourth successive annual decline.
European truckmakers are concentrating intense marketing efforts on the UK,
as they are hit by declining demand elsewhere. Both MAN of Germany and
Scania of Sweden have increased their truck sales in the UK by more than 50
per cent this year. Volvo and Mercedes-Benz have achieved rises of nearly 30
per cent.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Strikes shift to service sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strikes in the UK are becoming increasingly concentrated in the service
sector, and especially public services, the latest government study shows.
The international comparison of strike activity, published in yesterday's
Employment Gazette, a Department of Employment publication, shows that in
the UK the strike rate in the service sector was more than twice that in
traditionally strike-prone sectors such as mining and manufacturing.
Mr Derek Bird, author of the report, says: 'The data suggest that there may
have been some form of behavioural change with respect to strike activity in
the traditionally strike-prone sectors.'
He shows that the UK strike rate for the five years 1988-92 was 75 per cent
lower than in the previous five-year period. That is a bigger reduction than
every other OECD country except Denmark and far better than the OECD median
of a 32 per cent reduction.
Between 1983 and last year the countries showing the highest strike rates
were Greece, Spain and Italy. Countries recording few days lost per employee
included Switzerland, Austria and Japan.
The UK's strike rate has been below the European Union average in each of
the past 10 years with the exception of 1984.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Report says five per cent of employers use teleworkers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five per cent of employers use teleworkers, and half of those employ some
form of home-based worker, says a Department of Employment report on 1,000
organisations, Lisa Wood writes.
The report says the idea that teleworking is spreading steadily is 'open to
doubt'. It says: 'There is a shifting population of schemes which come and
go in response to changing individual and corporate requirements.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / National one-day stoppage in public services proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A one-day strike in the public sector, probably on April 11, has been
proposed by the NUCPS civil service union, David Goodhart writes. The move
may win support from the Trades Union Congress's public services committee
early next month.
The executive of Unison, the 1.5m-strong public service union, is this
weekend expected to back the strike call. In spite of reservations from some
other unions, such as the GMB general union, Unison's backing could be
enough to swing TUC support behind the day.
The strike would be a quasi-political protest against government policy on
pay, jobs, market testing and privatisation throughout the public sector. It
might therefore be ruled unlawful even if proper strike ballots were
conducted.
Opponents of strike action such as Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the
GMB, say the government would relish a legal and industrial conflict with
the unions in the run-up to the local elections in May, and would seek to
associate Labour authorities with the disruption.
Opponents of action also say that if the day of action succeeded, it would
present the wrong image of trade unionism at a time when unions are trying
to persuade their members to retain 'check-off' - the automatic deduction of
union dues by employers.
'I fear the movement is about to sleep-walk into a disaster,' said one
official.
Supporters of strike action say there is no other way to effectively express
the anger of members. They point to the relative success of the day of
action against market testing by civil servants on November 5.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, is unlikely to be enthusiastic about
action but will lead it if this is what unions want.
Unions will try to minimise inconvenience to the public, although the rail
unions are likely to join in. Emergency services will be excluded.

FT  09 DEC 93 / OFT to probe used cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Used-car dealers are to be investigated by the Office of Fair Trading
following a big rise in the number of complaints about second-hand cars.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday that
the inquiry would focus on the Motor Code of Practice, a voluntary code
operated by the Retail Motor Industry Federation and the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Complaints about second-hand cars have risen from 51,000 in 1988 to 64,000
last year. Half concerned defects and about a third misleading statements.
The federation, whose 12,500 members represent the bulk of the franchised
retail motor trade, last night promised full co-operation with the inquiry
on ways of improving the working of the code.
It also called for the government to consider licensing all motor traders.
Doing so could help bring under control what it described as thousands of
'Arthur Daley' garages outside the membership of either the SMMT or the
federation.
Mr Geoff Dossetter of the federation, while acknowledging the existence of
some offenders in the 'official' trade, insisted that the vast majority of
complaints were made against the unfranchised 'lower end' of the motor
trade.
The code was last changed in 1990 from requiring pre-sale inspection of
second-hand cars against a checklist, to a system of after-sale inspection
and the use of warranties.
Sir Bryan said the rise in complaints suggested this change might be causing
confusion among dealers. But it was also possible that general knowledge
about the application of the code was poor.
The inquiry would concentrate on finding ways of remedying the code's
defects, he said.
Mr Stephen Locke, Consumers' Association director of policy, said the
inquiry was very welcome, if long overdue. 'Consumers have been hoodwinked,
misled and conned for too long,' he said.
There were many areas of concern, the most serious being the practice of
'clocking' and the handling of write-offs. The Consumers' Association looked
forward to playing a constructive part in the inquiry to ensure a better
deal for consumers, he said.
Sir Bryan expressed concern that consumers were paying too much for new cars
because of huge discounts given to commercial fleet buyers, and that their
servicing costs had been pushed up because of the relative insensitivity to
price of company car owners.
The federation said it had long shared Sir Bryan's concerns about new cars.
According to Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers
Association, which forms part of the federation, such discounts add as much
as Pounds 1,000 to the cost of new cars bought through dealers. Discounts
can be up to 40 per cent on sales of 200,000 or more new cars a year sold
directly by manufacturers.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Student loan admin condemned
</HEADLINE>

The administrative costs of student loans are diverting public funds paid to
universities for educational purposes, a report by the Commons public
accounts committee said yesterday.
Student loans were introduced in 1990 and are administered by the Student
Loans Company, a government body.
The committee reported that universities found the average cost of
processing loan applications was about Pounds 7, while the company only paid
institutions Pounds 4 for each loan processed.
It said: 'We are concerned that the company's current level of payments to
higher education institutions may be insufficient to cover the
administration costs that they incur and this could cause funds provided for
educational purposes to be used on the administration of student loans.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, described the finding as 'quite
unacceptable', and said: 'This situation will only get worse following the
Budget cuts in student grants.'
The committee noted that it was not official government policy to encourage
students to take out loans, and it questioned the amount spent on
advertising the scheme in 1990, saying that students should have been aware
of the scheme from other sources.
Planning assumptions that 80 per cent of eligible students would take out
the maximum loan had been inaccurate, as only 28 per cent did so in the
first year. The committee was 'concerned that these assumptions led to the
company's incurring higher administration and accommodation costs than
turned out to be necessary'.
Total entry to universities still lags behind most of the country's
international competitors in spite of the recent expansion in student
numbers, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development showed yesterday.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals warned that the British
could become the 'village idiots of Europe' if expansion did not continue.
Using 1991 figures, the latest available, the OECD said 28 per cent of the
UK's 18-year-olds had entered 'tertiary' education, a category that includes
specialist colleges as well as universities. The total entry to higher
education has risen this year to 31 per cent.
Switzerland had a lower figure, with 27 per cent, but several other nations
sent a much larger proportion of young people to university. The US had the
highest proportion (65 per cent), Japan had 53 per cent, Australia 52 per
cent, and Germany 45 per cent.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Cash squeeze 'leaves roads falling apart'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 4,000 miles of Britain's A-roads need urgent structural repairs
because of spending limits imposed on councils, the British Road Federation
said yesterday.
Councils face serious difficulties in maintaining and improving the 215,000
miles of roads for which they are responsible, and a Pounds 191m cut in
local road funding in last week's Budget will further reduce spending, the
federation warned.
Spending on structural maintenance between 1987-88 and 1991-92 fell by 13
per cent in real terms in England, 25 per cent in Wales and nearly 30 per
cent in the large cities, the federation added.
'Britain's local roads are falling apart,' said Mr Richard Diment, director.
'Nearly 20 per cent of local authority A-roads need major repair now. The
potholes and ruts we will see in a few years' time will make today's seem
insignificant unless urgent action is taken.'
Traffic on council-run A-roads has risen 56 per cent during the past 10
years while local road traffic has risen by 34 per cent.
Councils sought government approval to spend Pounds 1.8bn on roads in
1993-94, but were allowed only Pounds 1.1bn.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Sunday shopping campaigners rejoice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Supporters of Sunday opening were jubilant after last night's vote in the
Commons to allow all shops to open for at least six hours.
Baroness Jay, chairman of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which proposed
the partial deregulation option, said the vote 'reflected the wishes of the
majority of the people'. She added: 'It provides for a good, sound and
popular law.'
Mr David Quarmby, joint managing director of J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest
superstore chain, said: 'The main people who will benefit from this are the
millions of people who already shop on Sundays and will be able to go on
doing so.'
Asda, the UK's fourth-largest food superstore group, said it was pleased
that the vote had produced a 'clear-cut decision'. The company said it
already opened about 150 of its 200 stores on Sundays, which had become the
third busiest day of the week.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, executive director of Kingfisher, parent company of B&amp;Q,
Superdrug, Woolworth and Comet, said he was 'delighted that parliament has
reflected the feeling of the country'. The option chosen was 'practical,
workable and provides a permanent solution'.
Workers' groups also welcomed the decision. Ms Julie Trussler, chairwoman of
the National Association of Sunday Shopworkers, which has campaigned for the
right to work on Sundays, said the vote would 'safeguard the jobs of 140,000
Sunday shopworkers'.
But Usdaw, the largest shopworkers' union, which switched support at the
last minute from the Keep Sunday Special Campaign to the option which was
adopted, warned its support was 'crucially linked to the worker protection
element'. It added: 'We will now be fighting hard to ensure our members are
protected against exploitation, and critically, get double-time payments for
working on Sunday.'
The Consumers' Association said it was 'partially pleased' with the vote, as
it had supported total deregulation. Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director,
predicted that parliament would have to return to the issue in a few years'
time 'when people realise that total deregulation is really the only
complete answer'.
The vote was a bitter disappointment for those who had campaigned to limit
Sunday opening, warning that even partial deregulation would destroy the
unique character of Sundays.
Mr Michael Schluter, director of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign, said MPs
had been victims of 'a huge deception', as the provisions on worker
protection in the bill were inadequate and unworkable.
The campaign would be 'exploring all the avenues we can use to lessen the
impact of the bill on the most vulnerable sectors of society', including
shopworkers, small shopkeepers, and those on low incomes living near city
centres.
Marks and Spencer, one of the UK's leading retailers and the driving force
behind Retailers for Shops Act Reform, which joined forces with the Keep
Sunday Special Campaign to support limited opening, said it could 'now get
to work knowing there is a solution, even though it is not the one we
favoured'.
The clothing and food chain said it would now be forced to open some stores
on Sundays to avoid losing market share, but would wait for the bill to
receive royal assent next year.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Minford attacks revival package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Patrick Minford, the Liverpool University monetarist economist and
one of the government's 'seven wise men', has attacked plans for spending
Pounds 630m of European Union money to reconstruct the Merseyside economy,
Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
He says the plans could make the region worse off by training workers for
jobs that do not exist, so equipping them to migrate elsewhere in Britain
with marketable skills.
Merseyside, after final negotiations, is expected to receive the money over
six years from next spring. This follows its designation at the last EU
summit as one of Europe's poorest areas, qualifying it for Objective 1
status for EU funding.
Prof Minford and his colleague Mr Peter Stoney say in their twice-yearly
regional economic review that large sections of private industry were
excluded from the preparation of the government's final bid document for the
money. They attack the document's over-emphasis on training, for which 47
per cent of the money is being earmarked.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Roads 'falling apart' as cash limits tighten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 4,000 miles of Britain's A-roads need urgent structural repairs
because of spending limits imposed on councils, the British Road Federation
said yesterday.
Councils face serious difficulties in maintaining and improving the 215,000
miles of roads for which they are responsible, and a Pounds 191m cut in
local road funding in last week's Budget will further reduce spending, the
federation warned.
Spending on structural maintenance between 1987-88 and 1991-92 fell by 13

'Nearly 20 per cent of local authority A-roads need major repair now. The
potholes and ruts we will see in a few years' time will make today's seem
insignificant unless urgent action is taken.' Traffic on council-run A-roads
has risen 56 per cent during the past 10 years while local road traffic has
risen by 34 per cent. Of the 571 local bypass schemes planned, 220 have
fallen behind schedule.
Councils sought government approval to spend Pounds 1.8bn on roads in
1993-94, but were allowed only Pounds 1.1bn. Local roads make up 95 per cent
of Britain's total road network and carry 68 per cent of all road traffic.
A failure to spend on local roads could limit the effectiveness of Britain's
strategic road network and reduce the benefits of increased motorway and
trunk-road spending, the federation warned.
In the longer term, it said, reorganisation of local government would reduce
the size of transport authorities and weaken their ability to promote
important transport improvements.
Over the past decade the length of road that has been strengthened or
undergone significant repair has fallen by 27 per cent, from 1,139 miles in
1982 to 766 miles last year.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Finance house seeks Monktonhall mine stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Monktonhall colliery, the deep mine near Edinburgh which is
leased from British Coal by a miners' consortium, may now depend on
negotiations with Waverley Mining Finance, a quoted mining finance house,
James Buxton writes.
Mr Willie McLucas, investment manager for Edinburgh-based Waverley, is
negotiating a 49 per cent stake in Monktonhall Mineworkers, in which 167
miners have each invested Pounds 10,000.
Last month the miners overwhelmingly rejected a takeover offer from RJB
Mining under which each would have received Pounds 1,000 for his shares.
They had been warned that if they refused RJB's offer the company was likely
to go into liquidation, failing an alternative offer.
RJB Mining had planned to invest Pounds 3m to make the mine profitable,
though it is believed that a smaller investment would also be effective.
A deal might involve Monktonhall Mineworkers issuing new shares to Waverley,
entailing dilution of the miners' stakes. Waverley would also hope to secure
finance from the Department of Trade and Industry and from Lothian Regional
Council, as RJB Mining had intended.
Waverley, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 4.25m, has mainly
invested in mining ventures in the US and Australia.

Most directors are practising the pay restraint they expect of their
employees, says a report published today.
Company directors received pay increases averaging 3 per cent in the 12
months to October, says the survey, published by the Reward Group and the
Institute of Directors.
The annual survey of 5,000 directors, the biggest of its kind, found 55 per
cent received rises of less than 3 per cent with less than a quarter
receiving no increase and 2 per cent taking a cut.

The government's push for wider and deeper share ownership in the UK shows
only modest success, according to a survey for the Treasury.
The NOP survey shows that 10m people, or 22 per cent of adults, own shares,
compared with 21.5 per cent in December last year. At the peak in 1991 there
were 11m shareholders in the UK compared with only 3m in 1979, before the

FT  09 DEC 93 / Register aimed at foreign ships
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for an open register of British shipping to tempt international
shipowners to base their operations in London have been put to the
government this week by the Baltic Exchange.
A key attraction of the register would be less stringent rules on the use of
UK officers. It is designed to attract foreign shipowners to the UK and to
persuade UK shipowners using offshore shipping registers to resume flying
the UK flag.
Many shipowners have switched to flags of convenience in recent years
because of the costs of maintaining UK crews and meeting the conditions of
the existing UK mainland register.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Radical academic to review auditing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to appoint as head of an independent review of audit
monitoring an academic with views radically opposed to the government's
belief in self-regulation, Andrew Jack writes.
The selection of Professor Peter Moizer, professor of accounting at the
University of Leeds, as a result of an open competition is expected to be
announced in a parliamentary answer in the next few days.
The review will focus on the degree of monitoring and supervision carried
out by the self-regulatory bodies for auditors. Its conclusions are expected
to be submitted early next year.
Prof Moizer co-wrote a study sponsored by the research board of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last year. It called
for an independent regulatory agency to oversee the fees and practices of
audit firms, an extension of auditors' responsibilities beyond existing
shareholders and the need for auditors to detect material fraud. The review
will examine such topics as how frequently regulators visit the country's
14,000 registered auditors and the nature of their inspections.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Sellafield deaths put at 200 worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 200 people worldwide may die in the long term as a result of cancer
caused by radioactive discharges from Sellafield, a government nuclear
advisory committee has told the Department of the Environment.
The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee says in a letter to
environment minister Mr Tim Yeo that the Thorp reprocessing plant, which is
waiting for a licence to start operation, could be responsible for a fifth
of this total.
The letter, dated November 5, has been leaked to Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure group.
The letter emphasises that the projection covers tens of thousands of years,
and that individual deaths cannot be predicted. It says the dose to the
world's population from the discharges is tiny - only 0.03 per cent of the
dose from background radiation.
The significance of the letter is that it partly supports Greenpeace's claim
that radioactive discharges from Sellafield will cause deaths - but also
that it describes Greenpeace's use of such statistics as 'misleading'.
Greenpeace's claim of an increase in deaths has been part of its campaign
against the Thorp plant.
A government decision on whether to license the Pounds 2.8bn plant, which
has taken 10 years to build, is expected imminently. The environment
department said yesterday: 'We asked RWMAC for their opinion and their views
will be taken into account.'
UK Nirex, the government's Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive,
which has been given the task of finding a site to store nuclear waste, said
yesterday that it would apply early next year for planning permission for a
deep underground laboratory near Sellafield.
The laboratory would explore whether a store could be built safely in the
rocks at that site.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Clash of Titans draws the crowds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher's appear-ance before the Scott inquiry was billed as a
constitutional battle of the Titans.
In the blue corner, immaculately turned out in a dark green tailored suit
and double rope of pearls, was the first British ex-premier to appear before
a public judicial inquiry.
Facing her, in the grey corner, were Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, wearing a
loud houndstooth black and white check jacket, and Lord Justice Scott, a
picture of judicial gravitas in half glasses and double breasted suit.
Their goal was to wrestle from her whether sales of military equipment by UK
companies to Iraq during the late 1980s, in apparent contravention of stated
government policy, were made with or without her knowledge and approval.
The arena was Number 1 Buckingham Gate, once a seedy hotel, now refurbished
as a slightly vulgar government office, with brass chandeliers and wood
panelling.
For the first time since the inquiry began six months ago, it was packed.
Most of the crowd were journalists, who had queued since 7.30am to secure
places.
When the contest began at 10am, Lady Thatcher appeared tired and defensive.
Ms Baxendale - whom Lady Thatcher insisted on calling 'Miss' in a slightly
deprecating tone - was enthusiastic and rigorously analytical - qualities
which have terrified the officials and ministers she has already examined.
But appearances were deceptive. Lady Thatcher had carefully studied the 76
pages of questions the judge sent her a month ago. She parried every attack
and on one occasion congratulated herself for providing a convincing reply
to the one question she had not 'spotted' in advance.
Her overall strategy was simple. The most hands-on prime minister in recent
history argued that she never got involved in the detailed application of
the arms sales policy.
Lord Scott looked at her quizzically when she repeatedly said that she
concerned herself with 'policy-making', never with 'detailed
administration'. But he had no evidence to the contrary.
In six-and-a-half hours of cross-examination, only five substantive
questions were put, which can be summarised as follows:
Baxendale: Why was there a gap of a year between the formulation of a new
policy banning sales of arms to both Iran and Iraq in late 1984 and its
disclosure to parliament in October 1985?
Thatcher: Don't know.
Baxendale: Should parliament have been told earlier? Thatcher: That might
have been preferable because it would have saved me a lot of this bother.
Baxendale: After the Gulf war ended, official policy appears to have been
changed so that sales of some military equipment to Iraq was now permitted.
Is that so and why was parliament told that the 1985 policy was still being
followed?
Thatcher: On the one hand, I was not told of a change of policy. On the
other, it seems to me - from my subsequent examination of government
documents - that although there may appear to have been a change in policy,
in fact there was a change in circumstances leading to a 'modicum of
flexibility' in the implementation of the existing policy.
Baxendale: Were you informed about sales of machine tools, which have
military applications, by the engineering company Matrix Churchill?
Thatcher: No.
Baxendale: Why were you and other ministers unaware of information gathered
by the intelligence services that the engineering company Matrix Churchill
was selling to Iraq equipment with a military use?
Thatcher: The system did not work properly.
Baxendale: Were you aware of warnings from the intelligence services that
sales of military equipment to Jordan were being diverted to Iraq?
Thatcher: No.
By four o'clock Ms Baxendale was looking tired and had lost her customary
eloquence. Lady Thatcher was positively buoyant. When told there was to be a
short break, she looked annoyed. 'I do hope we go on till we finish,' she
challenged. Ms Baxendale may have met her match.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Cards may be 'smart', but are they attractive?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank has been demonstrating in a mocked-up sitting room
the 'smart card' which it hopes to establish as a global substitute for
cash.
The phone on which cash can be transferred to the card sits by a bookshelf
containing Enid Blyton's Mysteries and a book called Great Disasters.
For the moment, the prospects of smart cards remain a mystery. Whether the
Mondex card will become a disaster or a triumph for NatWest depends on the
reaction of about 30,000 consumers and 1,000 retailers in Swindon. Their
reaction in a pilot run with British Telecommunications in 1995 will
determine its future.
The Mondex vision is compelling, both for consumers and for banks which
spend increasing amounts on handling cash. NatWest hopes that consumers will
adjust to a world in which they load cards with cash from phones and
electronic terminals in up to 30 currencies, and use the cards as cash
tokens.
The heart of the system is a computer chip which sits on a plastic card and
can store electronic value in up to five currencies. The holder can load the
card from a bank cash machine, a retailer's terminal, or from a telephone
with a card reader which may cost about Dollars 200 (Pounds 134).
Once the cash is transferred from the holder's account to the card it can be
spent at any retail outlet which has the right card reader. There is no
personal identification number (PIN), so someone who drops the card in the
street can easily lose the whole amount, just like losing cash.
Security is provided by the ability to 'lock' the card so that it cannot be
used. This 'locking' can also be done on a plastic 'wallet' with its own
internal chip which two Japanese electronics companies have built for
NatWest. This can also be used to transfer money from one card to another.
Users will be able to check the balance on the card by using a reader built
into a keyring (pictured right).
Yet Mondex is fraught with risks. Older people may not like carrying around
a card which a thief can use like cash unless it has been electronically
'locked'. Equally, NatWest and its partner Midland may not make a return on
a large capital investment if other banks simply set up competing smart-card
systems.
The heart of the appeal for banks is twofold. First, they may remove cash
from the enormously expensive clearing systems which operate in all
developed countries. The cost of cash transmission in the UK clearing system
alone has been estimated at Pounds 2bn a year.
Second, they may establish a form of payment which is suited to a wider
range of consumers and retail outlets than credit and debit cards. Such
cards are limited to creditworthy consumers who can be trusted not to
overspend, but the Mondex system simply provides a limited amount of cash.
Mr Tim Jones, the NatWest executive who thought of the idea, said: 'There is
a much broader opportunity than with credit and debit because anyone can
hold cash.' He said the technology suited cash-based outlets such as taxis,
fast-food stores and small retailers well.
The bank emphasises the use for families which could hand out set sums to
children using the electronic wallet. But it argues strongly against the
notion that it is simply an electronic card for feckless folk without access
to credit.
The hardest task will be to persuade consumers of the benefit. The ability
to load cash from home may appeal. The easy access to foreign currency is
also convenient. But a lot may depend on the bank's eventual pricing
strategy.
Having to buy equipment to participate in a card-based system when cash
accounts are free might not hold much appeal. But NatWest will have to make
it attractive enough to establish the brand clearly.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Insurers to challenge US verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers, including syndicates at Lloyd's of London, are to appeal against a
Dollars 386.4m (Pounds 259.3m) punitive damages award made earlier this week
by a Los Angeles jury in a product liability case.
A Los Angeles state court awarded the damages to two subsidiaries of Amoco
Corporation, the Chicago-based energy company, in what is one of the largest
jury awards seen in the US this year.
The award provides a reminder of the scale of the London insurance market's
potential exposure to liability claims in the US.
Lloyd's syndicates have already set aside hundreds of millions of dollars in
reserves to pay claims resulting from asbestosis damage and pollution.
These 'long-tail' claims - frequently affecting those policies originally
underwritten up to 50 years ago - have contributed significantly to Lloyd's
losses, which have amounted to Pounds 6.5bn over the past five years.
In the Los Angeles case Amoco claimed that the insurers had wrongfully
refused to pay for the defence and settlement of product liability lawsuits
arising from the manufacture of irrigation and sewer pipes by an Amoco
subsidiary in the 1970s.
The punitive damages award follows a Dollars 39m compensatory damages award
to Amoco on December 3.
About 90 insurers, including insolvent subsidiaries of London United
Investments as well as an estimated 50 Lloyd's syndicates, are affected by
the award.
Insurers described the court's verdict, which followed a five-week trial and
more than four weeks of deliberations, as 'astonishing'.

FT  09 DEC 93 / OFT rejects newspaper distribution complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission will today reject complaints that
national newspaper distribution is a monopoly that acts against the public
interest.
In the latest of a series of investigations going back to 1976 the
commission has decided that newspaper distributors such as WH Smith, John
Menzies and Surridge Dawson operate an efficient service that gets the
largest number of newspapers to the public at a reasonable cost.
After looking at the industry for more than a year the commission has come
up with only one significant recommendation for change - that newsagents
should be allowed to 'sub-retail' newspapers to others.
Some newsagents sell on papers to others and split the discount. This is
seen as a 'pirate' operation and discouraged by the distributors.
The commission decided that some sub-retailing on a 'sensible' and local
basis would act as a safety valve for those who wanted to sell papers but
could not get supplies.
One of the main pressures for change has come from small convenience and
grocery stores, which want to sell papers but have generally been refused
supplies on the grounds that they are in areas already served by newsagents.
VG Distributors, the independent high-street grocery chain, told the
commission inquiry that the market was 'rigged' and that fixed newspaper
distribution territories, often operating on an exclusive franchise basis,
should be dismantled.
VG said it was campaigning on behalf of more than 40,000 convenience stores
which could not get newspapers even though, they argued, newsagents were
increasingly entering the grocery sector by selling items such as milk,
bread and baked beans.
A number of ideas which would have opened up the newspaper retail market
more fully to outsiders were rejected.
Professor Samuel Eilon, a member of the commission panel, suggested a system
of 'minimum list values' - setting a guaranteed minimum of copies that would
go to non-traditional outlets with the Office of Fair Trading increasing the
total each year. The idea was rejected by the majority.
Proposals for a cash-and-carry scheme, allowing prospective sellers of
newspapers to pick up copies direct from wholesalers at their own expense,
were also rejected.
Newspaper distribution was first referred to the commission in 1976 and its
report two years later found that a complex monopoly did exist, but that it
was not against the public interest to limit the number of retailers.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Radical academic to review auditing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to appoint as head of an independent review of audit
monitoring an academic with views radically opposed to its own belief in
self-regulation.
The selection of Professor Peter Moizer, professor of accounting at the
University of Leeds, as a result of an open competition is expected to be
announced in a parliamentary answer in the next few days.
The review will focus on the degree of monitoring and supervision carried
out by the self-regulatory bodies for auditors. Its conclusions are expected
to be submitted early next year.
Prof Moizer co-authored a study sponsored by the research board of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last year. It called
for an independent regulatory agency to oversee the fees and practices of
audit firms, an extension of auditors' responsibilities beyond existing
shareholders and the need for auditors to detect material fraud.
The review will examine such topics as how frequently regulators visit the
country's 14,000 registered auditors, and the nature of their inspections.
It will consider the first two annual reports submitted to the Department of
Trade and Industry from the two regulatory bodies: the joint monitoring
unit, which represents the three chartered accountancy bodies, and the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.
The department last night refused to confirm Prof Moizer's appointment, but
when asked whether it was aware of his views, it said: 'We are well aware of
his recent publications.'
It added: 'The sort of person we will be looking for to provide an
independent view is someone who would have a thorough knowledge of audit
legislation and the regulatory regime.
'We want someone with an independent and critical outlook who will do a
thoroughly professional job.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Japanese ambassador in plea on British managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hiroshi Kitamura, Japan's ambassador to Britain, yesterday dropped some
of the diplomatic reserve which would normally be expected of him to offer
some highly personal thoughts on British managers and Britain's role in
Europe.
During two assignments spanning six years in the UK, Mr Kitamura said he had
noticed that although top managers in manufacturing industry were of high
calibre, many were by training lawyers, financiers and accountants.
In his opinion, the views of engineers and scientists should carry proper
weight when companies decided on long-term strategies and development of new
products. 'In order to combine science with technology, and technology with
innovation, it is important to promote people to top management with a
thorough understanding of technology.'
Mr Kitamura, speaking at the heart of British management, the Institute of
Directors in London, did not confine himself to top managers. He had
detected 'something of a shortfall in middle management'.
This was of concern because this level was responsible for ensuring
production line efficiency and product quality. 'The development of human
resources in this stratum of management is surely of critical importance in
boosting corporate competitiveness,' the ambassador said.
On a more positive note, he said Britain was the 'trail blazer' for an open
trading Europe, leading its European partners in the direction of a united
Europe along pragmatic lines.
This had benefited all countries, including Japan. Britain's continued
central role in Europe would heighten the attractiveness of Britain for
Japanese companies already operating in the UK.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Salomon follows trend in paying big bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank which recorded the highest ever
profits of a Wall Street firm in the second quarter of the year, has
followed the lead of Goldman Sachs in awarding unusually high bonuses to
London staff.
The bonuses are believed to be below the level set by Goldman last month.
'They are not in the Goldman league,' said one Salomon insider.
Yet most executives are said to have at least doubled their salaries through
the bonus payments, which were announced individually to staff this week.
It emerged last week that Goldman is paying 70 London-based executives,
including 26 partners, Dollars 1m or more each; partners are to receive a
minimum of Dollars 5m in total remuneration this year.
The high level of awards at Goldman has boosted expectations in the City,
with many dealers citing Dollars 100,000 as a yardstick. Top performers at
Salomon are believed to have exceeded the Dollars 1m mark.
Mr Stephen Posford, chief executive of Salomon Brothers' London operation,
is rumoured to have been particularly well rewarded for London's strong
third-quarter performance, which helped make up for a loss-making position
taken by the proprietary trading desk in New York.
Salomon said it would not comment on these matters.
Goldman Sachs is widely viewed as the top bonus payer in the investment
banking business, partly as a result of its partnership structure.
Both Goldman and Salomon are also strong in proprietary trading - taking
views on markets using the banks' own capital - which generates large
profits, resulting in big bonuses.
Other high payers are Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, which do not
announce bonus awards until next month.

Nacods, the pit deputies union, yesterday failed in a High Court attempt to
block the introduction of new mining safety regulations.
Lord Justice Simon Brown, sitting with Mr Justice Morland, ruled that the
court lacked jurisdiction to hear the challenge.
Nacods had accused the government of bringing in measures which threaten the
standards of safety in the coal mining industry. Counsel for the union said
expert views on safety the government had relied on were 'shot through with
errors of law and fact'.

The government's push for wider and deeper share ownership in the UK shows
only modest success, according to a survey for the Treasury.
The NOP survey shows that 10m people, or 22 per cent of adults, own shares,
compared with 21.5 per cent in December last year. At the peak in 1991 there
were 11m shareholders in the UK compared with only 3m in 1979, before the
wave of privatisations started.
The survey was based on interviews with 7,592 adults.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Treasury confident about recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic recovery looks set to continue with inflationary pressures
staying muted, according to the UK Treasury's latest monthly monetary
report.
The document, prepared for yesterday's monthly discussion of monetary
conditions between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George,
the governor of the Bank of England, notes that 'recent monthly indicators
confirm the picture of recovery continuing'. It adds that UK producer price
inflation 'suggests inflationary pressures remain subdued'.
Although the 40-page report does not discuss policy, avoids analysis and is
generally little more than a description of all the money, inflation and
activity indicators published over the past month, it strikes one or two
upbeat notes.
It judges that the trend in retail sales, as measured by the Central
Statistical Office and the Confederation of British Industry, 'remains
firmly upward'. Its overall view of the CBI's monthly industrial trends
survey is that it implies 'total demand is holding up well following
significant improvements earlier in the year'.
It warns that official statistics showing that manufacturing output in
volume terms was broadly flat in the third quarter might be 'slightly
distorted' by the introduction of the European Union's Intrastat figures for
export prices. These are used to construct the manufacturing output index.
The report notes that the fall in the annual rate of underlying inflation,
as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments, to
2.8 per cent in October from 3.3 per cent in September, has fully reversed
the autumn rises from the summer's 25-year low. 'Most significantly, food
and petrol prices fell between September and October having risen over the
same period last year'. It adds that the fall in food prices preceded the
latest announcements of price reductions by large supermarkets.
The report points to only a very slight increase in producer price inflation
between September and October, although it says 'anecdotal evidence suggests
some businesses are still waiting for markets to strengthen before passing
on input-related costs'.

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday voiced growing confidence that
they would agree before Christmas a joint declaration designed to persuade
the IRA to give up its campaign of violence.
But on the eve of the second meeting within a week between Mr John Major,
the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier,
officials conceded that Dublin's demand for a new all-Ireland convention was
a crucial stumbling block.
In London officials said they were confident that the proposed declaration -
likely to be finalised at a third meeting between the two leaders next week
 -would include firm guarantees for the unionist majority in Northern
Ireland.
Those guarantees would centre on Dublin's recognition that any change in the
province's status could be achieved only by consent and a commitment to drop
its constitutional claim to the north.
It is understood that Britain has agreed to recognise the legitimacy and
validity of the nationalist aspiration of Irish unity and to repeat publicly
the offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations if they end violence. Mr
Major may also reaffirm that he has no strategic interest in maintaining
Northern Ireland as part of the union, and signal a willingness to accept
separate referenda in the north and south on any political settlement.
But the British side has rejected as unacceptable to unionists the
establishment of an all-Ireland convention.
Yesterday Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, defined the key issues
for a total cessation of violence as 'sovereignty, self-determination for
the people of Ireland, and the role of the British government in assisting
in a process of national reconciliation'.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Bank governor defines scope on rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England will have up to a month to decide the timing of future
changes in interest rates, Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, said
yesterday.
Mr George said in evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service
committee that the new arrangement was a 'helpful' step towards monetary
stability. Under the new system, announced last month, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, will decide on shifts in borrowing rates, leaving the Bank
to control the timing.
Mr George said the Treasury's projection of 2.5 per cent growth in gross
domestic product next year was 'plausible'. Although he held out little hope
for a large increase in house prices, he said the number of people whose
houses were worth less than the mortgages used to buy them had come down by
about 'a third' this year.
He broadly agreed with a study this week from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
saying that 26 per cent of homes bought between 1988 and 1991 were worth
less than the mortgages on them, with this proportion having risen from 21
per cent a year ago.
Behind this, however, was a sharp rise in the numbers late last year and a
fall this year.
Sketching out the latitude available to the Bank over the dates of monetary
policy shifts, he said this would encourage perceptions in markets that
economic rather than political events were the main driving forces.
MPs also questioned Mr George about the way in which he and the chancellor
would discuss changes in interest rates. Mr George said any new government
views on these matters would be conveyed at the normal monthly meeting
between the two. After this the chancellor 'would expect it (the change) to
happen by the time we next met'.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Bar's monopoly ended: Solicitors in private practice win
right to appear in higher courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barristers' 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts was broken
yesterday when solicitors in private practice won their battle for wider
rights to present cases.
The decision by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, and England's four most
senior judges to approve the Law Society's application for wider advocacy
rights means solicitors could be appearing in higher courts by next spring.
At present they can only appear in magistrates' and county courts.
The government legislated more than two years ago to give solicitors the
right to appear in the higher courts, but the issue has been deadlocked by
resistance from the Bar and judges.
Mr Rodger Pannone, the Law Society's president, said it was delighted with
the decision. 'Clients will no longer be forced to employ a separate lawyer
for higher court advocacy,' he said.
The society said it was disappointed that Lord Mackay and the judges had
deferred their decision on wider advocacy rights for solicitors working in
the Crown Prosecution Service, the government legal service, and in
commerce, finance and industry.
Although the society's application included employed solicitors, the judges
felt unable to decide because of incomplete advice from the Lord
Chancellor's advisory committee.
The committee said it could not advise on whether employed lawyers should be
given the right to appear in criminal trials until the 1990 Courts and Legal
Services Act had been changed to restrict the amount of advocacy work done
by Crown Prosecution Service and government lawyers. Lord Mackay has ruled
out changes to the act and asked it to look again at the issue.
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, said she was pleased
that the lord chancellor had not ruled out extending rights to Crown
Prosecution Service lawyers. They would continue to push for extended
rights, she said.
The decision was welcomed by many City law firms, which have been gearing up
for advocacy work in the High Court.
Solicitors who have the necessary experience in advocacy, either as
part-time judges or who have earlier practised as barristers, will be able
to appear in the High Court almost immediately. But most will have to
complete two Law Society training courses and it could be 1995 before they
qualify to appear in the crown court, High Court, Appeal Court, or before
the Lords.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Political Notebook: Peace at Christmas?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new Anglo-Irish declaration by Christmas. Yes. But, peace by Christmas.
Who knows?
Such is the assessment of an informed insider in Mr John Major's government
on the precarious search for a settlement in Northern Ireland. The judgment
is a more interesting than it looks.
For a start it would have been hard to imagine only a few weeks ago that a
senior minister would be talking even about the possibility of an end to 25
years of IRA terrorism.
Now, for all the embarrassment which followed the disclosure of Britain's
clandestine contacts with Sinn Fein, ministers are still taking seriously
the prospect that the IRA may be about to throw in the towel.
All sorts of people in Whitehall are talking about how the IRA's middle-aged
leadership has been shaken by the unthinking brutality of the latest wave of
loyalist terrorism. It despairs at the future facing its children.
Others assert with confidence that if the IRA's council called an end to
violence, any renegade units would be dealt with. The IRA, we are told, has
a disciplined command structure and central control of all its main arms
dumps.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is more optimistic still. He
believes a form of words which pays a little more than lip-service to the
aspirations of Irish nationalism will persuade the gunmen to emerge from the
shadows.
He was furious when he discovered that Mr Major had been in continuous
dialogue with Sinn Fein for most of this year and, probably, for a great
deal longer.
But the squall has passed. Mr Reynolds, according to British intelligence,
has had his own contacts with the republican leadership.
So the two leaders have been going line-by-line through the draft of their
proposed joint declaration. By the end of last week's meeting about
two-thirds of a document running to three or four pages in total had been
agreed.
The difficult bits were left for this week's second meeting in Brussels and,
perhaps, for a third in London next week. But further progress has been made
during talks among officials.
The sticking points have been well-rehearsed. The main one centres on
finding language to reconcile the nationalist demand for Irish
self-determination with the British guarantee of the unionist veto in the
north.
Mr Reynolds wants provision in the joint statement that any permanent
political settlement would be subject to concurrent referenda in the south
and north.
He wants also an all-Ireland convention to give form to the south's
legitimate interest in the affairs of the north.
That, along with British recognition of the legitimacy or validity of unity
(Mr Major has baulked at 'value'), would represent a nod in Sinn Fein's
direction.
For his part Mr Major will get an unequivocal Irish commitment to the
'consent' principle in Northern Ireland: de facto recognition of the
unionist veto over any constitutional change.
Mr Reynolds is also ready to include a pledge that part of a longer-term
political settlement would be the removal from its constitution of the
republic's legal claim to Northern Ireland.
If that - along with another offer to Sinn Fein to join negotiations once it
had renounced violence - represents the structure of the eventual joint
statement, there is still plenty of argument to come.
In Anglo-Irish relations the devil is in the language. Words such as
self-determination or joint authority are loaded with sinister implications
for the unionists. Mr Major can do nothing without at least tacit support
from them.
Mr Major has told Mr Reynolds he is prepared to reaffirm Britain's studied
neutrality over the ultimate future of the province.
The lesson of recent weeks is that the exasperation of the British people
with Northern Ireland has provided the prime minister with an opportunity to
take more risks with unionist opinion than most of his predecessors.
But some things - words such as self-determination and a permanent
all-Ireland convention are among them - move too far in the direction of the
nationalists. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, has told
Mr Major he will not have it.
So different words and phrases will have to be found. By the end of the
process - probably next week - there will be plenty of rhetorical
contortions to allow Dublin to say it has met the aspirations of the
nationalists and London to say it has safeguarded unionist opinion.
There is danger though in such dilution. Sinn Fein and the IRA may conclude
there is no incentive to join negotiations.
In addition, the message to unionists may be sufficiently disconcerting to
prompt a further upsurge in loyalist terrorism. Sadly, declarations offer no
guarantee of peace.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Labour announces tax and employment offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday announced a tax and employment offensive designed to
increase pressure on the Conservatives in the run-up to local and Euro-pean
elections, David Owen writes.
The campaign will aim partly at maximising the expected adverse public
reaction to recently-announced tax increases, some of which will begin to
take their toll from April - a month before local government elections and
two months ahead of European elections.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, told his parliamentary colleagues that the
Budget was 'unravelling by the hour'.
He predicted that when employees received their payslips next April their
'anger' would create 'an immense political reaction against the government'.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Progress on Ulster near: Dublin's demand for an all-Ireland
convention remains a crucial hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday voiced growing confidence that
they would agree before Christmas a joint declaration designed to persuade
the IRA to give up its campaign of violence in Northern Ireland.
But on the eve of the second meeting within a week between Mr John Major,
the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, officials conceded that Dublin's demand for a new all-Ireland
convention was a crucial stumbling block.
In London officials said they were confident that the proposed declaration -
likely to be finalised at a third meeting between the two leaders next week
 -would include firm guarantees for the unionist majority in Northern
Ireland.
Those guarantees would centre on explicit recognition by Dublin that any
change in the province's status could be achieved only by consent and a
commitment by the Republic to drop its constitutional claim to the north.
It is understood that Britain has agreed to recognise the legitimacy and
validity of the nationalist aspiration of Irish unity and to repeat publicly
the offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations in return for an end to
violence.
Mr Major may also reaffirm that his government has no strategic interest in
maintaining Northern Ireland as part of the union, and signal its
willingness to accept separate referenda in the north and south on any
political settlement.
But the British side has rejected as unacceptable to the unionist parties
the establishment of an all-Ireland convention and is resisting Dublin's
demands to acknowledge publicly the right of self-determination across
Ireland.
The uncertain reaction of the IRA to any declaration was underlined by Mr
Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein.
At a party meeting in Belfast yesterday he defined the key issues for a
total cessation of violence as 'sovereignty, self-determination for the
people of Ireland, and the role of the British government in assisting in a
process of national reconciliation'.
He said Sinn Fein's involvement in political talks 'is not the main issue at
this time'.
He said the republican movement was not about to surrender, but added: 'We
have taken risks and are prepared to take further risks to achieve a lasting
peace . . . The opportunity for peace presented by the Irish peace
initiative remains intact if it is seized and built upon and if Dublin puts
the onus on Britain to deliver'.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Sellafield cancer deaths put at 200 worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 200 people worldwide may die in the long term as a result of cancer
caused by radioactive discharges from Sellafield, a government nuclear
advisory committee has told the Department of the Environment.
The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee says in a letter to
environment minister Mr Tim Yeo that the Thorp reprocessing plant, which is
waiting for a licence to start operation, could be responsible for a fifth
of this total. The letter, dated November 5, has been leaked to Greenpeace,
the environmental pressure group.
The letter emphasises that the projection covers tens of thousands of years,
and that individual deaths cannot be predicted. It says the dose to the
world's population from the discharges is tiny - only 0.03 per cent of the
dose from background radiation.
The significance of the letter is that it partly supports Greenpeace's claim
that radioactive discharges from Sellafield will cause deaths - but also
that it describes Greenpeace's use of such statistics as 'misleading'.
Greenpeace's claim of an increase in deaths has been part of its campaign
against the Thorp plant. In October 600 Greenpeace volunteers stopped
traffic in Whitehall by lying down to represent deaths from Sellafield.
A government decision on whether to license the Pounds 2.8bn plant, which
has taken 10 years to build, is expected imminently. The environment
department said yesterday: 'We asked RWMAC for their opinion and their views
will be taken into account.'
The committee's letter says that the calculation of notional deaths from
radioactivity exposure 'carries with it no certainty, and it is incorrect to
state that '600 people will die'.'
Greenpeace's estimates are different from the committee's partly because it
has based them on the discharge limits set by the pollution inspectorate,
while the committee has used emissions data from the National Radiological
Protection Board.
UK Nirex, the government's Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive,
which has been given the task of finding a site to store nuclear waste, said
yesterday that it would apply early next year for planning permission for a
deep underground laboratory near Sellafield.
The laboratory would explore whether a store could be built safely in the
rocks at that site. Geological mapping of the site 'has made significant
progress' over the past year, it said, 'and results continue to show that
the site holds good promise as a suitable location'.
The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee has expressed scepticism
about the geological suitability of Sellafield.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The council tax has been a successful replacement for the poll tax, the
Audit Commission says today, but there is still room for improvement.
It says 54 per cent of England's budgeted council tax had been collected by
the beginning of September, compared with only 50 per cent of budgeted poll
tax by the same point last year.
However, some councils had collected twice as much of their council tax as
others, while there were a few councils where more than a fifth of taxpayers
had paid nothing.
It also found that some councils had backlogs of correspondence and benefit
claims, while many authorities had been slow to begin chasing late payers.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Classical music sales fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of classical music albums have fallen sharply in recent years,
according to figures in the Policy Studies Institute's yearly Cultural
Trends, published today.
Trade deliveries of classical albums totalled 12.35m last year, 26 per cent
less than the 16.688m despatched in 1990. Classical albums made up only 9.2
per cent of deliveries last year - after two years at over 10 per cent.
The new issue of Cultural Trends underlines the virtual disappearance of
vinyl LPs. In 1985, half the deliveries to the retail trade (excluding
singles) were LPs. By last year that had fallen to just 3.9 per cent. In the
same period, deliveries of CDs rose from 6.6 per cent to 62.2 per cent.
Cassettes fell from 43.8 per cent to 33.9 per cent.
Expenditure on recorded music has been hit by the recession, falling from
Pounds 1.27bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.243bn last year, in spite of the high
price of CDs. Spending on hardware has dropped in line, from Pounds 942m to
Pounds 895m.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman convicted of fraud over the
company's 1986 takeover of Distillers, has won the first round of his
attempt to use European law to challenge his prosecution, John Mason writes.
The European Commission on Human Rights has ruled that Mr Saunders has a
partially admissible case.
Mr Saunders is claiming he was denied a fair hearing at his trial because
the prosecution used evidence against him which was gained from his
interviews with Department of Trade and Industry inspectors.
During these interviews he was compelled to answer questions. He claims the
use of transcripts during his trial therefore infringed provisions in the
European Convention on Human Rights which protects against
self-incrimination.

FT  09 DEC 93 / What to do if you think you have suffered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many people are so bewildered by the world of pensions that it is not
surprising some will be led astray by bad advice. But how can consumers tell
whether they have been wrongly advised?
There are two basic situations where employees could have been persuaded to
switch to a personal pension from a company one. The first is when they have
left a company's employment. Their choice lies between leaving their
benefits in the employer's scheme, transferring the benefit to the new
employer, or switching into one of two types of personal pension.
Mr Mailesh Shah, senior consultant at actuaries William M. Mercer, said that
those who switch to a personal pension should understand that they have
given up a defined level of benefit to earn a pension which will be governed
by the level of investment return. In other words, they have taken a risk to
get a higher pension. Anyone who feels that the risk was not explained to
them might have a case for complaint.
The more serious problems, however, are likely to occur where employees have
been persuaded to opt out of their existing employer's scheme, and
contribute instead to a personal pension. In such cases they may be giving
up a number of benefits. For example, the employer will often be making
contributions, and there will be death-in-service and spouse's benefits.
Opting out can be worthwhile, but existing employees are likely to be better
off with their company pension.
Mr John Cole of financial advisers Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, said that there
were two warning signs which should cause consumers to worry. 'If the person
who made the sale took no interest in your personal position, or did not ask
about the benefits in your company scheme, alarm bells ought to sound.'
What should you do if you believe that you have been wrongly sold a personal
pension? The first step will be to return to the person who sold you the
policy.
If you bought your pension from a member of Lautro, the life assurance and
unit trust regulator, your next step if you are not satisfied is to write to
the compliance officer of the company concerned - the person who sold you
the pension should have given you a card indicating the body of which he or
she was a member.
Should you be unhappy with the response of the company, your next step is to
contact the pensions ombudsman at 11 Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB. It
might also be worth notifying Lautro at Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street,
London WC1A 1PT.
If you bought your pension from a member of Fimbra, the regulator for
financial intermediaries, your first step is to contact the independent
financial adviser concerned. If you are still not satisfied, you should
write to the Complaints Department, Fimbra, Hertsmere House, Hertsmere Road,
London E14. The investor can take the dispute to an arbitrator, whose award
is binding.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Uncertainty surrounds who will be liable for compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The SIB review of personal pensions is expected to lead to several hundred
million pounds in compensation for those who transferred out of occupational
pension schemes into less good personal plans.
The only consolation for the life insurers, perhaps, is the fact that their
leading competitors, the banks, were no better and will also be liable for
compensation claims.
Already there are signs of a big row breaking out between the insurance
companies and the independent financial advisers who account for roughly 20
per cent of all insurance and pensions sales. These IFAs are either
self-employed or employees of a larger chain and act only as an agent for
the life company, not as an employee.
Mr Nick Dumbreck, partner in the insurance practice at consulting actuaries
R. Watson and Son, said: 'The law of agency is operating here. It is on the
life company's side. It is the IFA's job to decide which policy to sell.'
Other life insurers heavily dependent on the IFA market were more
circumspect, saying they would have to study the matter. Privately, they
concede that because they are dependent on the IFAs to sell their products
in the future, they may have to contribute to the costs of IFAs past
mistakes.
Mr Dumbreck notes that IFAs are required to have professional indemnity
insurance which may cover compensation costs. However, if the indemnity
cover was not enough, the IFA would have to declare itself insolvent and all
claims would then become claims on the Investors' Compensation Scheme.
Regulators are circumspect about how they can force life insurers to make
good on improperly sold policies. Yet they privately emphasise the right of
the self-regulatory bodies to withdraw authorisation to sell pensions from
companies and individual sales agents.
Meanwhile, questions remain about whether the government will be asked to
pay some of the compensation. After all, it touted personal pensions with
great enthusiasm, saying they offered the twin virtues of flexibility and a
sense of individual ownership. 'The life companies were handed the personal
pensions bonanza on a plate by the government,' said Mr Dumbreck.
But even if every insurance company and bank agreed to pay compensation
where appropriate, it remains to be decided whether shareholders or
policyholders would foot the bill.
Mr Stewart Ritchie, pensions director at Scottish Equitable, said: 'In a
mutual life insurance company, by definition all funds are policyholders'
funds.' Thus, mutual companies are certain to have to dip into reserves in
order to pay any claims necessary.
Mr Dumbreck said that the reserves of most mutuals are sufficient to cushion
any likely claim without forcing the curtailment of bonuses paid to other
policyholders.
But where a life insurance company is owned by shareholders the question is
more problematic.
Mr Philip Scott, general manager of Norwich Union, said: 'When you are
talking about a salesforce owned by the company where that sales force is
there to earn profits for shareholders, it seems to me that shareholders
should pay the costs.'
The question of whether policyholders or shareholders bear the cost is not
an issue for so-called unit-linked companies which sell 'units' in a pooled
fund and extract charges based on each unit plus specified general charges.
In unit-linked companies, which include all four of the UK clearing banks,
the costs can only be borne by shareholders.
The extent to which the banks will be liable is unclear.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Regulations fix pension sales method
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The selling of personal pensions is a highly regulated business.
Firms which sell private pensions must first be authorised by one of the
self-regulating organisations which monitor the retail financial services
industry. Sales agents must be 'fit and proper', a term which, among other
things, generally excludes bankrupts.
Sales agents are expected to be trained to understand the products they sell
and the population for which they might be suitable. Financial services
rules bar them from trying to sell unsuitable policies. Insurance companies
have had to pay substantial sums in compensation to people who bought
inappropriate plans.
Sales agents can be directly employed by a provider, or be a tied agent who,
although not employed directly, sells one provider's products exclusively,
or an independent financial adviser, who sells the best products of a group
of providers.
Direct and tied sales agents do not operate unsupervised, at least in
theory. Insurance companies are responsible for monitoring the activities of
their sales staff and ensuring that they comply with all regulations.
Independent financial advisers, on the other hand, may be monitored if they
are employed by a large chain. The only check on individual firms is
monitoring by Fimbra, the self-regulating body for the industry.
In making sales pitches agents must first identify themselves, stating
whether they are independent or tied to one company. They must then conduct
a 'fact find' of an individual's financial situation and current and future
needs. Any thorough review would require sales agents to ask about existing
pension arrangements.
These fact finds - or the lack of them - have most troubled regulators. It
is believed that up to 80 per cent of the pension transfer files examined
had too little information about clients and their former schemes for agents
to be able to make a suitable recommendation.
In completing a fact find to assess a potential transfer from an employer's
scheme the sales agent would have to ask for details of its benefits, the
contribution levels of both the employee and the employer, and the scope for
so-called discretionary benefits which allow trustees to give more generous
pensions than those formally described in the trust deed. The agent would
also need to know the number of years the individual had been a member of
the scheme, the number of years to retirement and plans for any job changes.
The sales agent would have to compute the pension benefits received under
the employer's scheme and compare them with those expected from a personal
pension.
Only after this procedure could a sales agent offer best advice about
pensions transfers and make a proposal to sell a specific policy.
Individuals want personal pensions for a variety of reasons, of course, but
the sales agent must advise clients exactly what they might be giving up.

FT  09 DEC 93 / BR seeks private finance for electrification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Network SouthEast is talking with regional electricity companies and
National Grid over the provision of finance to electrify large parts of its
track in advance of the privatisation of British Rail.
The project is designed to open the network to private finance for the first
time. It will be one of the first big tasks for Railtrack when it takes over
the running of the rail infrastructure next April.
Under the discussions taking place the regional electricity companies would
pass on the costs of electrifying track to the operators of the trains,
which could come in the form of higher electricity bills.
Network SouthEast has also decided to put out to tender the design and
building of new signalling in parts of Kent. The three companies interested
in the contract are GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, ABB
Transportation, formerly known as Brel, and Westinghouse Brake and Signal,
part of BTR, the UK conglomerate. The company chosen to build the signalling
may be offered long-term maintenance agreements.
Mr John Nelson, Network SouthEast managing director, said he believed there
was a 'window of opportunity' for the private sector in both electrification
and the signalling of large parts of the BR network.
Many Network SouthEast lines are not electrified - such as Oxted to Uckfield
and Ashford to Hastings - while the system of electrification in many other
parts of the network was installed more than 40 years ago.
Mr Nelson said the need to involve the private sector was underlined by the
fact that it would cost between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m annually to
replace parts of the infrastructure which need updating.
Network SouthEast has already invited the regional electricity companies to
tender for the contract to electrify different parts of the track.
The company or consortia chosen would be expected to build the feeder
stations, transformers and switchgear necessary to electrify lines. The
Department of Transport and the Treasury are being kept informed of the
talks.
Network SouthEast recently won a year-long battle for new trains to be
financed under an innovative Pounds 150m leasing deal. Under this the
private sector - in this case ABB - is responsible for financing, building
and maintaining the trains, and accepts the risks in the 'residual value' of
the equipment after the lease ends.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Prudential chief takes firm line on payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading pension providers do not intend to provide compensation to people
sold their products wrongly by independent financial advisers if Mr Mick
Newmarch, Prudential chief executive, is any guide.
Mr Newmarch emphasises his commitment to recompensing the 'handful' of
people who have suffered after poor advice from the company's direct sales
force to transfer out of occupational schemes and buy Prudential pensions.
However, he is clear that his company is not responsible for independent
advisers' actions.
The Prudential is the UK's largest life insurer and one of the largest
pension providers, with 850,000 pension holders and Pounds 65bn of assets
under management. It has sold most of its pension products through its own
direct sales force of about 8,000, with little business through
independents.
'An (independent financial adviser) is sorting products from a whole variety
of providers on the basis of his view of the best advice for his customer,'
he said. 'If my contract is the best in his eyes and he chooses to use it,
that's presumably good. If he misuses it, I can't be held responsible for
that, can I?'
The Prudential's exposure to this area of business is limited. It has some
45,000 personal pension holders transferred from occupational schemes since
1988, out of a market of between 400,000 and 500,000.
Yet scale does depend on perspective. Mr Paul Trickett, the head of pensions
in the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, said some Pounds 58m had been
transferred to the Prudential from that scheme since 1988.
Mr Newmarch is unapologetic about the legitimate argument for personal
pensions as well as proud of the Prudential's own record in training,
procedures and setting standards for its sales force. The Prudential says
the number of cases investigated for wrong advice so far has been about 100
at most.
Even so, he recognises that the damage to people's perception of the
industry could still affect his company.
'If the whole industry is being held as not properly organised and taking
advantage of people's ignorance and innocence and so on, then at some point
nobody escapes that general proposition,' he said.
But he underlined that responsibility did not rest with the industry alone.
Those such as the trustees of occupational schemes and schemes' consulting
actuaries also had duties to provide proper information to aid decisions to
transfer out of an occupational scheme.
'The responsibility in all this is a very complex series of interrelated
events,' he said. On the basis that most of the life industry tried to
behave properly, 'then where things go awry it is for a whole variety of
complex reasons'.
'At the margin - I hope it's the margin - some companies have been
uncontrolled in taking advantage of what they saw as a market opportunity,
and the regulator's job is to stop that.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Cancer 'not high' in N-test veterans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Servicemen who took part in British nuclear weapon tests in the South
Pacific during the 1950s are not suffering an excess of cancer, says a study
to be published tomorrow.
The report by the National Radiological Protection Board and Imperial Cancer
Research Fund is a follow-up to a controversial study of 22,000 bomb test
veterans, published in 1988. It had found more leukaemia cases among men who
had witnessed the open-air explosions than among a control group of
servicemen who were not present, although overall death rates in the two
groups were similar.
The new study, supervised by Sir Richard Doll, concludes that the excess of
leukaemia was a statistical artefact.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Rogue brokers targeted in US: The securities industry's need
to enforce its rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although it has been enjoying three consecutive years of record-breaking
profits, the US securities industry thinks it may be developing an image
problem.
Last week, critical comments about sales practices of unscrupulous
stockbrokers by a senior Securities and Exchange Commission official touched
off a vigorous debate about whether the industry needs to do more to police
its broking force and weed out those who break the rules.
Mr Carter Beese, an SEC commissioner, set the ball rolling last Thursday
when he told the Securities Industry Association's annual conference in
Florida that if the industry did not do a better job of tackling what he
called 'rogue brokers', Congress might decide to draw up tough new laws to
discipline brokers and their firms.
Mr Beese was referring to those who boost commission income by selling
securities and other products to clients who do not need them, and by
recommending unnecessary buying and selling of stocks within clients'
portfolios: the practice of 'churning'.
Mr Arthur Levitt, recently appointed chairman of the SEC, told
representatives last week that tackling unscrupulous brokers and punishing
executives who fail to supervise them properly would be a priority of his
term at the agency.
Mr John Dingell, a powerful member of the House of Representatives, has
called on the industry to introduce a 'three strikes and you're out' policy
under which those who have faced multiple customer complaints would be
permanently barred from the business.
Mr Dingell's proposal is a response to the industry's poor record at
removing rogue brokers. Although those who abuse the rules and their clients
are routinely fired by their employers, they often turn up at another firm.
This is because most firms get rid of troublesome employees without a formal
internal review for fraud or violation of industry rules. Managements fear
that if they take official action against brokers, they will become enmeshed
in long and expensive legal battles.
Although the debate about brokers' behaviour has suddenly intensified, there
is no evidence that industry standards are slipping. According to the
National Association of Securities Dealers, until the end of October less
than 1 per cent of the country's 463,000 registered brokers were the subject
of a customer complaint to the NASD, and only 0.1 per cent were either
suspended or permanently barred because of their actions.
So why all the fuss now? First, recent publicity surrounding a few cases
involving unscrupulous brokers has heightened the public's concern about
standards of integrity. In particular, the case of Prudential Securities,
which will have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation to
thousands of investors who in the 1980s were sold limited partnerships that
quickly went sour, has attracted a lot of attention.
Second, while rogue brokers have been been around for centuries, the flood
of new money over the past two years into stocks and bonds has raised fears
that a few may be exploiting first-time investors with little knowledge or
experience of investing.
Although the facts support the securities firms' view that only a handful of
brokers have been breaking the rules, any service industry is sensitive to
the issue of declining standards.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Colosio plays up role of Mexican democrat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling
party, is to invite independent observers to evaluate next year's election,
allow external auditing of the country's electoral roll and periodically
publish his campaign finances.
The proposals formed the central part of a speech delivered last night, in
which Mr Colosio accepted the presidential nomination from the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party. Mr Colosio promised a 'democratic
transformation' of Mexico, a much stronger pledge than ever made by outgoing
President Carlos Salinas.
The overwhelming favourite to win next year's election, he also outlined his
economic and social programme for the next six years should he be elected
president.
While underlining his commitment to low inflation and sound public finances,
he described a more activist industrial and social policy than pursued by Mr
Salinas.
The PRI has been in power for more than six decades, and many of the
electoral victories, including that which brought Mr Salinas to power, have
been marred by charges of fraud and ballot-rigging.
Mr Colosio's democratic proposals seem part of campaign to assure the public
his party can win cleanly. He promised that 'the PRI does not need nor want
a single vote outside the margin of the law'.
In response to those who attack the excessive power of the Mexican
president, he called for a reform of Mexico's government which would
strengthen Congress, improve the system of justice, and expand human rights.
Reducing poverty would be his government's top priority. 'The most important
commitment of my government would be to better the lot of those who have
least,' he said.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Brazil's 'if' plan to beat inflation: A pledge reminiscent
of an alcoholic's promise to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As with alcoholics who keep promising to quit, Brazil's latest pledge to
kick its inflationary habit was greeted with equanimity by a country which
has seen six previous attempts fail in the last seven years.
Within hours of finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's announcement
of his fiscal stabilisation programme, it became known as the se plan
because of the number of occurences of the Portuguese word for 'if'.
Despite initial scepticism, however, the programme has won support from the
government's coalition partners and a cautious backing from business groups.
These and other leaders agree the package is the last chance to tackle
inflation, running at more than 2,000 per cent a year, before the
government's term runs out.
They also agree that if the package fails, with presidential and
congressional elections in November, there is a serious threat of
hyper-inflation in the second half of next year.
Mr Cardoso's package involves three phases to be implemented over several
months. The final stage, introducing a new currency, may not be ready before
the government's term ends.
The most important element, and a pre-requisite for the others, is a set of
fiscal reforms designed to balance next year's budget, otherwise likely to
show a deficit of Dollars 22.2bn. This would be equivalent to 20 per cent of
projected expenditure. In the past the deficit has been highly inflationary
because the government has financed it by issuing short-term securities at
high interest rates.
The budget and related measures need approval from congress, which is
expected to reach a decision before the new year. If it is approved, the
government will introduce a new index which, instead of measuring historical
inflation as do current indexes, would be adjusted daily by the central bank
in line with the devaluation of the currency.
Wages and many important prices in Brazil are linked to the inflation
indices. By introducing this new index, economists say, the government would
be able to influence inflation by slowing the depreciation of the currency
through foreign exchange market intervention using foreign reserves that
currently exceed Dollars 20bn.
In time, the index could be linked to the US dollar or a basket of
currencies. At this point, the government would have de facto abandoned
indexation, since the currency would by definition not depreciate.
Furthermore, the index would become the unit of exchange and would replace
the existing currency, the cruzeiro real.
'You would have a very sharp fall in inflation and, with the fundamentals in
place, this fall will be sustainable,' says Mr Winston Fritsch, economic
policy secretary.
The package has some important advantages over its predecessors. For one, it
concentrates on the budget deficit instead of relying on 'tricks', such as
price freezes, which have worked for only a few months.
A constitutional revision under way in congress may also help.
Constitutional changes, some of which will not come into effect until 1995,
would allow the federal government to regain control of spending which has
been devolved to other levels of government in recent years. With more
control over the allocation of its resources, the government would have less
excuse to run deficits.
Mr Roberto Macedo, a former economic policy secretary, says Brazil is still
not ready to make the cuts and sacrifices Mr Cardoso is seeking. 'He's going
in the right direction, but the problem, as always, is in the political
dimension.'
Opposition is likely to come from congress on two fronts. A proposed 5 per
cent increase in federal taxes will be unpopular. More important, Mr Cardoso
plans to divert 15 per cent of money the federal government transfers to
states and municipalities to an emergency social fund.
The proposal has antagonised several powerful state governors, who have
patron-client relations with congressional deputies. Mr Orion Herter Cabral,
finance secretary of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, doubts Mr
Cardoso's plan will work. 'The governors won't give up the money,' he says.
Another worry is the paralysis in congress as a result of corruption
hearings involving more than 30 politicians.
But Mr Cardoso hopes congress's problems, and its discredited public image,
offer him an advantage. By placing responsibility for the programme on
congressional approval he is betting congress will not run the risk of being
blamed for its failure.
Even with congressional support, the package faces problems. Probably the
most difficult to quantify is the role of President Itamar Franco. Although
so far supportive of his finance minister, the president is famously erratic
and has a populist view of economics. He is thought to have pressed Mr
Cardoso to introduce a price freeze or some similar 'magic' measure. If
inflation increases in the next few months, as is possible in January for
technical reasons, such pressures may re-emerge.
Problems also lie ahead on salary policy. Salaries for public sector and
many private sector employees are re-adjusted by reference to indices
measuring past rates of inflation. Moving to the new index will either
require persuading employees to take a real pay cut, or allowing past
inflation to seep into the new index.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Texas relents in row over gay rights and investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a furious local debate pitting jobs against 'family values,' a county
in Texas has reversed a decision taken last week and decided to offer
incentives to Apple Computer to attract a new investment.
At issue was Apple's policy of offering health benefits to homosexual
employees.
Last week the five-member board of commissioners for Williamson county, just
north of Austin, the state capital, voted 3-2 against giving the company
nearly Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in tax breaks in order to secure an
investment providing up to 1,500 new jobs.
Apple promptly threatened to look out of state for a location, bringing
Governor Ann Richards, up for re-election next year, vigorously into the
fray on its behalf. The company, which has held a lease option on the land
in Williamson County for some years, said it had been besieged by offers
from other Texas counties.
On Tuesday the commissioners reconsidered and decided in favour, also by a
3-2 margin, of a different deal amounting to the reimbursement of costs to
develop the 128 acre site, worth approximately the same amount. The company
said it was satisfied.
The saga had made Georgetown, the county seat, briefly the centre of
national attention, with rallies organised for TV cameras both by gay rights
activists and the religious right. The commissioner who reversed his vote on
Tuesday insisted he still opposed Apple's policies and argued that the new
decision did not amount to public funding.

FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Struggle on dumping rules nears climax -
US demands have caused consternation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Uruguay Round dispute over US demands to dilute the force of
multilateral restraints on anti-dumping rules is expected to reach a climax
tomorrow. Trade officials will try to rank the issues and arrange
confidential meetings between the US and the 14 countries most exercised by
the proposed changes.
The US aroused consternation last week by tabling a 25-page document
detailing 11 proposed amendments to the Round's anti-dumping text. After
signals earlier this week that the US and European Union had settled
long-standing disagreements on market access, the row over anti-dumping has
emerged as one of the last and most testing issues blocking a final Uruguay
Round deal.
Mr Jeff Garten, newly appointed US commerce department undersecretary
responsible for anti-dumping negotiations, returns to Geneva today aware
that Gatt intermediaries face a Saturday deadline to find a settlement.
Failure beyond then could force Gatt officials to draft their own
compromise, potentially angering all concerned.
Mr Garten currently argues all 11 amendments must be accommodated in the
Uruguay Round text. Other negotiators are reluctantly bowing to the
necessity of accommodating at least a few - perhaps five or six. The
amendments range from efforts to ensure easy defence against 'dumped' goods
exported through third countries, to a bid for US trade unions to have the
power to mount dumping actions.
One calls for abandonment of a current proposal to force a 'sunset' on
dumping actions after they have been in force for five years. Trading
partners are concerned that over 10 per cent of the US's 300 outstanding
dumping duties have been in place more than 20 years.
All 11 proposals are seen as heresy by many US trading partners, who view
most anti-dumping actions as specious, exploited by powerful protectionist
lobbies.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: Changes in the Dunkel draft on
anti-dumping are the number one priority for US trade officials in the
Round, Mr Garten said yesterday. Even a few changes would not be enough to
get a Gatt deal signed by President Clinton.
Mr Garten said the US was 'isolated' in this position because of a mistaken
perception that the laws were a barrier to the US market - when they affect
less than 2 per cent of imports - and that they were inconsistently
administered. In bilateral meetings he is likely to promise personally to
ensure 'maximum consistency' in enforcing US laws.

FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Hopes rise for pact on aircraft subsidies
</HEADLINE>

Trade officials in Geneva yesterday expressed optimism that US-European
Union differences over subsidies for civil aircraft could be resolved before
the December 15 deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
Following the failure of Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir
Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart, to settle the issue in Brussels earlier
this week, the negotiations have been handed back to Gatt's civil aircraft
committee. This committee is trying to 'multilateralise' last year's US-EU
bilateral deal on state support for the European Airbus.
'There is a deal there, I'm convinced of that, and with the political will,
it can be done now,' said Mr Mikael Lindstrom, the committee's Swedish
chairman, who sees his role as an indep-endent and neutral arbiter.
Mr Kantor and Sir Leon said on Tuesday that they came close to agreement in
Brussels, and officials confirmed yesterday that neither side regards the
issue as a 'round-breaker'.
However, the EU in particular is keen to wrap up a revised Gatt code on
civil aircraft which would provide more flexibility for aircraft subsidies
than the general subsidies agreement proposed in the Uruguay Round talks.
In an effort to break the deadlock, Mr Lindstrom last month produced a
revised aircraft code based on a modified version of the general subsidies
accord, which all sides have accepted as a platform for negotiation. After
discussions yesterday with US and EU negotiators, Mr Lindstrom plans to
circulate a revised text later this week.
The main sticking points between the US and EU are: the level of aircraft
subsidies above which there is a presumption of unfair trading practices;
which types of subsidy should be subject to ceilings; whether subsidies
subject to ceilings should be protected from challenge by competitors; and
the EU's demand that past subsidies be exempted from anti-subsidy suits.
Under the bilateral US-EU agreement, the EU agreed to cap assistance to the
four-nation Airbus consortium at 33 per cent of development spending, but
this applies only to large civil aircraft and to the EU's royalty-based
subsidy system.
The Gatt civil aircraft code, which has 22 signatories, applies to all
aircraft and components, and to all forms of subsidies.
In the draft general subsidies accord, the subsidy threshold for presumption
of 'serious prejudice' is 5 per cent of sales, a figure the EU wants raised.

Israel has invited six international energy construction companies to bid
for contracts to build natural gas-fired electricity generation facilities.
The move is part of Israel's strategy to convert power generation to natural
gas once supply contracts are signed with Qatar and Egypt. Both Arab states
have officially denied Israeli claims that advanced agreements have been
drawn up, but Mr Moshe Shahal, Israel's energy minister, said again this
week the Qatar deal would be signed before the end of the month.
The energy ministry said yesterday the six companies - SRI of the US,
Bateman of South Africa, Arthur D Little and British Gas from the UK,
Sofregas of France and Tractebel from Belgium - have also been asked to bid
on the transmission of natural gas to Israel.
The companies are required to consider three separate potential supply
routes - transportation of liquid natural gas by ship either to a
Mediterranean port or to Eilat on the Red Sea. The third option is to bring
natural gas by pipeline from Egypt. The energy ministry said the bids should
be completed within a month.

Trade policymakers this week bowed to environmentalist demands for the
Uruguay Round to address directly potential clashes between environmental
and free trade priorities.
A confidential draft proposal for a work programme to identify links between
trade measures and environmental priorities, and to recommend how
multilateral trade rules should be modified, has been tabled by European
Union, Indian and Brazilian negotiators. Recommendations would be adopted at
a ministerial conference in April next year, convened to ratify the Uruguay
Round agreement.
The proposal marks a significant shift for Gatt negotiators, who had
insisted environmental issues be tackled once the Uruguay Round deal was
completed. It falls short of demands from the US, Switzerland and some
Nordic countries for the trade deal, due to be completed next week, to
include a firm commitment to setting up a Gatt committee on trade and
environment.
The US yesterday remained firmly opposed to the compromise, but seemed
isolated. Officials acknowledged developing-country worries about
industrial-country environmental policies being used as trade weapons.
US calls for environmental lobby groups to be able to submit briefs in trade
disputes, or observe or comment in dispute panels, continue to be resisted.
Most Gatt members argue governments should be the only bodies with direct
access to Gatt disputes.
As a compromise, Gatt suggests non-confidential summaries of submissions to
Gatt panels be made available to lobbyists, with the panels able to appoint
expert groups for technical advice. Among US environmental lobbyists
arriving in Geneva, Mr Jim Marston of the Environmental Defence Fund said:
'The question is, what assurance will we have that these recommendations
will be incorporated into Gatt. We are trying to be flexible, but need more
hard assurances'.
The confidential draft, approved on Tuesday by all developing countries
involved, notes: 'There should not be any policy contradiction between
upholding and safeguarding an open, non-discriminatory and equitable
multilateral trading system, and acting for the protection of the
environment and promotion of sustainable development'.
While calling for closer co-ordination between trade and environmental
policies, the proposal warns against exceeding the competence of Gatt, which
is limited to trade policies and 'those trade-related aspects of environment
policies which may result in significant trade effects'.

FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: EU will need telecoms watchdog, says top
official
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A European telecommunications regulator will be needed to underpin the
liberalisation of the European Union's telecoms market, Mr Michel
Carpentier, the head of the EU's telecommunications directorate, warned
yester-day.
Referring to the 1998 deadline for the introduction of competition for
'voice' services over the EU's public networks, he stressed that 'mechanisms
to handle problems of a Community-wide nature will be needed.'
The Commission was anxious to respect the principle of subsidiarity, leaving
as much as possible to national governments and regulators, said Mr
Carpentier, addressing the FT's world telecommunications conference.
However, 'issues such as the resolution of inter-connection disputes between
telecommunications organisations in different member states and the mutual
recognition of licences cannot by their nature be handled by one member
state or one regulator acting alone.'
The issue of mutual recognition of licences is likely to be particularly
difficult to resolve. US regional Bell companies are licensed to operate
cable networks in the UK and AT&amp;T has a licence application pending in
London.
Mr Carpentier said there was a clear 'infrastructure gap' for corporate
communications on the continent, which would 'rapidly close if the
possibility for alternative infrastructure existed.'
He said most EU states had 'little enthusiasm' for an early introduction of
competition in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure, a policy
strongly advocated by the UK government.
Mr Carpentier described the alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom, announced this week, as an 'unsurprising' reaction to deregulation
and the growth of an international market for telecommunications
out-sourcing.
Mr James Quello, a senior commissioner at the US Federal Communications
Commission, said the rise of 'multimedia' alliances between
telecommunications, cable, entertainment and computing companies posed stark
challenges to regulatory authorities.
'At a time of rapidly changing technology and markets, the regulator should
not handicap service provision by establishing artificially restrictive
parameters.'
Mr Michael Gale, managing director of Hong Kong Telecom, estimated the
Asia-Pacific region would need about 200m new phone lines in the next decade
 -equivalent to nearly 10 BT networks.
He said they would be paid for partly from supplier credits and own
resources, but would rely heavily on equity investment by western operators.

FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Enron in agreement with India on power
station

Enron Power of the US has reached agreement with the Indian national and
provincial governments on a controversial Rs29bn (Pounds 622m) power station
to be built near Bombay.
Enron and the Maharashtra state government in western India yesterday signed
an agreement under which the Maharashtra state electricity board will buy
power from Enron's 695MW gas-fired plant, which will be constructed at
Dhabol on the coast.
The successful completion of talks with Enron will come as a relief to the
Indian authorities in their quest to attract foreign investment into the
power sector and into India generally.
The project has attracted much attention; a failure in negotiations might
have discouraged other potential investors.
Dhabol is the second big power station project for which a power purchase
agreement has been signed after the government last year invited private
investors into the state-dominated generating industry to help ease India's
chronic electricity shortages.
National Power, the UK generator, and the UK-based Hinduja trading family
last month signed a similar pact for a 1,000MW plant with the authorities in
the southern state of Andrha Pradesh.
In each case, the power purchase agreements are being supported by payment
guarantees from the state and, indirectly, from the central government, a
key condition sought by foreign investors who have otherwise been loth to
invest in schemes involving the heavily indebted state electricity
distribution boards.
Enron originally envisaged a much larger scheme, a 2,000MW plant fuelled by
liquid natural gas imported from Qatar.
The company impressed the Indian authorities with its determination to press
ahead rapidly with the project, pursuing its negotiations very vigorously.
But the project ran into criticism from, among others, the World Bank, which
was concerned about the cost, the reliance on imported fuel, and about
doubts whether Maharashtra, which is relatively well served with power
plants, really needed such a large new station.
Enron now plans to build the giant plant in two stages: a 695MW plant to be
completed by 1997, and a 1,320MW extension, which has yet to be approved by
the state electricity board, and is planned to be finished by late 1998.

<TEXT>
Developing countries which stand to lose from a Uruguay Round trade
agreement, among them many impoverished African nations, should be
compensated with extra aid, trade preferences and debt relief, according to
Christian Aid, a church-sponsored aid agency.
Mr Peter Madden, the charity's trade policy adviser, yesterday called for
negotiation of side agreements to the Round accord which would cushion the
potential losses for some developing countries, mostly poor food importers.
'It is not right that the losers - overwhelmingly the poorest countries of
the world - should bear the costs of the agreement which brings so many
benefits to others,' he said at the launch of Winners and Losers, a report
detailing the Round's impact on developing countries.
A recent study by the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development put the overall income gain from the Round at
an annual Dollars 213bn by 2002, but this conceals a loss for Africa of
Dollars 2.6bn. Other losers include Indonesia, some Mediterranean states and
Caribbean nations.
Christian Aid notes that 'unequivocal losers' fall into four overlapping
categories:
African, Caribbean and Pacific nations which get trade preferences under the
European Union's Lome convention. The value of these preferences will fall
as tariffs are lowered to all, squeezing access to the EU market.
Net food-importers who will face higher prices for farm products, at least
in the short term, as EU and US agricultural export subsidies are cut. Over
100 of the world's 132 developing countries are net food importers,
reflecting the extent to which huge farm subsidies in the west have put
Third World farmers out of business.
Exporters of cocoa and coffee, prices of which are predicted to fall.
Countries lacking the capital, knowledge and technology to exploit new
trading opportunities.
Mr Madden, the report's co-author, said the 116 nations taking part in the
Round should negotiate compensating side agreements before the accord is
formally signed next April. These should cover compensation for lost
markets, help to meet higher food prices, assistance with the costs of
complying with new fair trade rules, and debt relief.
The Uruguay Round package includes a draft ministerial declaration on the
problems of net food importers, which refers to the possibility of
additional food aid and IMF and World Bank loans for countries in
difficulties. But Mr Madden said the language was vague and more specific
commitments were needed.

liberalisation

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rafael Caldera, victor in Venezuela's presidential election on Sunday, is
expected to consider measures to revise the free trade policy of the
government of former President Carlos Andres Perez.
Economic advisers to Mr Caldera indicated this week they were examining ways
of overturning aspects of the trade liberalisation, in order to encourage
development of Venezuelan industry.
One adviser, Mr Rafael Kries, was quoted yesterday in the Economia Hoy
newspaper as describing the Perez trade policy as 'unconditional and
indiscriminate'. A return to protection would not be indiscriminate, he
said, and there were 'para-tariff mechanisms' that Venezuela could use to
help industry.
Mr Caldera said this week he was sympathetic to hemispheric trade
integration, and that the North American Free Trade Agreement between the
US, Canada and Mexico was a 'very interesting idea'. Venezuela has been
mentioned by US officials as a possible Nafta candidate.
But Mr Caldera - scheduled to begin his five-year term in February - also
said: 'I doubt very much whether we'll arrive at the point that we'll be
able to join Nafta in the next five years.'
Businessmen said this week Venezuela's obligations under Gatt and its
economic integration agreements under the Andean Pact and the Group of Three
 -which brings Venezuela together with Colombia and Mexico - would limit the
new government's freedom of action to increase protectionism. The Andean
Pact has agreed on a four-level common external tariff with a maximum of 20
per cent.
Mr Pedro Vallenilla, president of the Venezuelan paper producer, Venepal,
which forms part of the Mendoza group of companies, said the Andean pact
meant the common external tariff 'cannot be changed unilaterally by
Venezuela'.
The Andean Pact groups Venezuela with Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru,
but Peru's membership has been temporarily suspended. There have been
concerns Mr Caldera's strong nationalist streak could increase tensions with
Colombia over the disputed Gulf of Venezuela.
The interim government of Mr Ramon Velasquez has already implemented several
measures to protect agriculture, and there is pressure for protection from
other industries - notably textiles and shoes.

Israel's Histadrut labour movement has decided to go ahead with a one-day
nationwide public-sector strike today which could paralyse the country,
despite a government promise to freeze its privatisation programme for up to
four weeks pending further talks with unions, Julian Ozanne writes from
Jerusalem.
The move came as a restructuring plan for the financially-troubled Israel
Aircraft Industries, Israel's largest employer, was agreed, which should
release hundred of millions of dollars of government aid in a rescue
package.
Up to 100,000 workers in government-owned companies, including electricity,
telephone and water, state-controlled radio and TV, and postal and airport
services have been asked to obey the strike call.
But later, a Tel Aviv court ruled that postal and airport workers were
forbidden to take part. The unions want greater involvement in privatisation
plans.

Sir Edward Heath, the former UK prime minister, travelled to Baghdad
yesterday to try to secure the release of three Britons jailed in Iraq,
raising hopes that they may be freed by the end of the week.
The prisoners, Mr Michael Wainwright, 42, Mr Paul Ride, 33, and Mr Simon
Dunn, 23, are being held in the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad where they
are serving sentences of 10, seven and eight years respectively.
A British diplomat in Amman said: 'There's a good chance' the three may be
released by Friday. Mr Wainwright and Mr Ride have been in jail for over a
year, while Mr Dunn was arrested six months ago. All were charged with
entering Iraq illegally.
Sir Edward, who has British government backing in the mission, was asked to
travel to Baghdad on behalf of the prisoners' families. He made a similar
mission in October 1990, three months before the Gulf War, when he won the
release of western hostages held at strategic sites in Iraq.
British officials said his current trip was discussed by Sir David Hannay,
Britain's envoy to the UN, and Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister,
in New York last month. Iraq has until now linked the prisoners' release
with Britain's unfreezing of Iraqi assets in the UK, but London has refused
to comply. Diplomats in Amman stressed 'no deal had been done'.
Last month Baghdad freed Mr Kenneth Beaty, 45, an American, after US Senator
David Boren visited Iraq. He was the sixth foreigner President Saddam
Hussein had freed in less than two months. Five westerners, including the
three Britons, a Frenchman and a German, remain in jail.

<TEXT>
Nigeria's external debt arrears have reached Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) and
are expected to rise substantially as weak international oil prices hit the
country's main export, western creditors and bankers warned yesterday.
Nigeria's most serious economic crisis since independence has deepened since
last month's removal of Chief Ernest Shonekan, the civilian leader of the
military-backed government, and the fall in the price of Nigeria's Bonny
Light crude from a peak Dollars 20 a barrel in early March to the present
Dollars 14. The 1993 budget was based on Dollars 17.50 a barrel.
The new government, led by Gen Sani Abacha, former defence minister, is
split over economic policy, making it hard to agree on the 1994 budget, due
to be presented on January 1. Mr Kalu Kalu, new minister of finance, has
argued for the budget deficit to be cut, white-elephant projects to be
cancelled, and foreign exchange deregulated to allow market rate to be set
for the naira, paving the way for a deal with the International Monetary
Fund.
Others, led by Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the government, want more state
control and regulation. They want the naira revalued to N15 per dollar (it
fetches over N40 on the parallel market) and strengthened by cutting
spending.
Nigerian private-sector leaders told Gen Abacha yesterday the economy was
'so sick that shock treatment is needed in the 1994 budget before economic
recovery and growth can begin'. They outlined conditions to halt capital
flight and attract private investment: a balanced budget, low inflation, a
stable currency, fuel prices near international levels, tax cuts, reduced
bureaucracy, and agreement on a medium-term programme with the IMF leading
to external debt relief.
Gen Abacha acknowledged mismanagement of the economy by previous regimes but
did not outline his own prescription.

The US said yesterday it would not object to a slight slippage in next
Monday's deadline for the beginning of an Israeli troop withdrawal from the
occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho if the Palestine
Liberation Organisation agreed.
The move came as Israel prepared to make symbolic gestures next Monday and
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, sent reinforcements to the West Bank,
bringing the number of Israeli troops in the occupied territories to 14,000
after an upsurge of Arab-Jewish bloodshed.
An extremist faction of the PLO claimed responsibility for shooting and
wounding an Israeli settler in Bethlehem which it said it carried out to
mark the sixth anniversary of the Palestinian uprising and to confirm the
continued armed struggle against the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said in Cairo yesterday the US
would accept a delay in implementing the peace agreement if both sides
agreed but he urged Israel and the Palestinians to press ahead as quickly as
possible. 'The sooner that they can begin the actual implementation, the
more progress that will be made and the less the likelihood of violence,' he
said after meeting President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
Israel and the PLO exchanged draft protocols in Cairo yesterday but have yet
to agree vital issues like the size of the Jericho area, who should control
border crossings and whether there will be a customs union between Israel
and the Palestinian economy.
Despite the failure to reach a final agreement Israeli officials said they
would take important symbolic measures next Monday including some troop
deployment out of Palestinian areas in Gaza and the release of up to 2,000
Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners. Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr
Rabin are expected to agree on the measures at a meeting in Cairo on Sunday.
In a move to calm increasingly violent and vocal settlers, Mr Rabin
yesterday revealed the details of Israel's military presence in the occupied
territories - normally a closely guarded secret. Mr Rabin described the
deployment as tremendous and said there were four times as many soldiers in
the territories than on the Lebanese border.
But in a warning to both Israeli and Palestinian extremists seeking to
disrupt the peace process, Mr Rabin said: 'Nothing will deter the government
and me from our determination to continue along the path we opened to
implement the agreement.'
In Bonn, Mr Arafat urged German industrialists to invest in infrastructure
development in the Palestinian economy. Mr Arafat, who has been on a two-day
visit to Germany, is due to fly to Spain today where he will meet Mr Shimon
Peres, Israel's foreign minister. Both men, together with Mr Rabin, were
yesterday nominated for the 1994 Nobel Peace prize by German
parliamentarians.

FT  09 DEC 93 / London urged to reverse policy on HK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Percy Cradock, Britain's former chief negotiator on Hong Kong, yesterday
bitterly attacked the decision of Mr Chris Patten, the territory's governor,
to proceed with electoral reform legislation without agreement from Beijing.
He told the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee in London that the
breakdown of talks with Beijing would create a lasting confrontation. The
situation was 'a tragedy for Hong Kong,' for which the policy of the British
and Hong Kong governments since last year was largely responsible.
Sir Percy, former ambassador to Beijing and foreign affairs adviser to Mrs
Margaret Thatcher as prime minister, urged London to reverse its 'dangerous
and reckless' policy. Mr Patten's approach 'will do much more harm to Hong
Kong than the alternative policy of co-operation with China on the best
terms we can get.'
Sir Percy said Britain had refused China's request for discussion of the
proposals before Mr Patten unveiled them in October 1992.
The Foreign Office said in response Britain had made clear the proposals
were intended for discussion with China.
Parliamentarians on the committee questioned Sir Percy's views. One
suggested that acceptance of China's position would mean the 'emasculation
of real democracy,' and would enable the Chinese government to say that this
had been done with Britain's agreement.
Sir Percy, however, said present policy was putting at risk the increase in
democracy in Hong Kong to which China had agreed. Reforms introduced in 1995
would be dismantled by China in 1997 and replaced in a 'vicious backlash'
with a government subservient to China.
He rejected as an 'extraordinary and ignorant distortion' the suggestion
that British policy on Hong Kong had been directed by Sino-centric officials
at the Foreign Office such as himself.
Chinese and British officials yesterday held the second day of talks in the
Joint Liaison Group charged with details of the 1997 handover to China. The
meeting ends today.

Gunmen have shot dead a Briton at a petrol station in western Algeria, the
fourth foreigner killed since a militant Islamic group's deadline ordering
all foreigners to leave expired last week, Reuter reports from Algiers.
Mr Malcolm Vincent, 41, a oil industry computer technician, was filling his
tank when two men tried to steal his car, shooting him when he resisted, the
official news agency APS said. Mr Vincent, who worked for Pullman Kellogg, a
contractor to the state oil group Sonatrach, was killed hours after a
67-year-old Frenchman was found shot dead near the town of Blida.
Eleven foreigners have been killed in Algeria since September 21, including
three French citizens, three Russians, a Colombian, a Peruvian and the
Briton. Four have died since the expiry of the November 30 deadline from the
fundamentalist Armed Islamic Group. No one has owned up to the last four
killings; an Algerian official said he believed the attacks were the work of
independent groups.
In the past three months, foreigners have become caught up in the political
violence in which at least 1,700 Algerians have been killed in nearly two
years. The violence began after the authorities cancelled an election that
the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front party was on the verge of
winning. The party was later banned.
A wave of foreigners including more than 2,500 French left after three
French consular workers were kidnapped in October. Paris and Algiers said
the kidnapping was the work of the Armed Islamic Group, which released the
three with the warning to foreigners to get out. The Paris foreign ministry
warned French residents 'to exercise extreme vigilance'. A ministry official
said France would bolster security around French public buildings in
Algeria.

<TEXT>
Malaysia's premier, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, has hinted he is ready to defuse a
row with Australia that has threatened diplomatic and trade links between
the two countries.
This follows a further attempt by Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime
minister, to ease tensions, saying the Australian government wanted to 'work
in harmony' with its Malaysian counterpart.
But Mr Keating did not use the opportunity provided by a lecture on
Australia-Asia relations to extend his limited apology to Dr Mahathir.
Instead, he stressed that his description of Dr Mahathir as 'recalcitrant'
because of the Malaysian leader's non-appearance at the recent Asia-Pacific
Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle was not intended to cause offence.
Mr Keating reiterated his regret that offence had been taken.
Yesterday Dr Mahathir said he could accept Mr Keating's statement of regret
over the remark but said it was up to the Malaysian cabinet to decide what
action to take against Australia when it meets on Saturday.
Some Malaysian ministers have called for a downgrading of diplomatic links
and have said business contacts should be curtailed.
Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, conceded that the affair
had already caused commercial damage and could have more serious
consequences.
Malaysia's economy continues to expand strongly, with GDP growing 8.1 per
cent in the third quarter. In the first nine months of 1993 Malaysia's
economy grew 8.7 per cent.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Lessons of a year in Somalia: Noble intentions and political
realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a year of policy blunders and humiliating reversals by the United
Nations, of cold-blooded killings and hostage trading, a more realistic,
hard-nosed policy is taking shape towards Somalia.
The lesson the UN has learned there is that noble intentions are not in
themselves enough. The humanitarian objective of feeding starving Somalis
was admirable: but starvation was a symptom of a deeper malaise. Civil war
had destroyed society and its institutions, and if the country was to
recover its capacity to manage itself and avert further disaster,
international intervention required a military and political framework that
was never fully appreciated.
One year later the world is trying to extricate itself from a responsibility
it decided it did not want. The UN has abandoned its peace-enforcing role
and placed the responsibility of forging a political settlement firmly with
Somalia's fractious clans vying for power in a society that has yet to
rebuild its shattered institutions.
The diplomatic initiative has also shifted from the corridors of the UN to
Somalia's neighbours in the Horn of Africa, which have vested interests in
ending the conflict, but with few resources to spare. 'The fighting could
easily spread into our countries. The clan divisions in Somalia are
reproduced in Ethiopia and Eritrea,' says an Eritrean diplomat.
The omens from peace talks organised by President Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia
this week are not good. General Mohamed Farah Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi,
Mogadishu's rival warlords, have so far refused to meet for face-to-face
talks.
The overwhelming feeling in the US and elsewhere is that the international
community has already fulfilled its moral duty to Somalia by ending the
famine. The consensus is that the UN's humanitarian intervention in Somalia
began to unravel when it widened its mission to include the forceful
disarmament of warring militias as a forerunner to a political settlement.
Some observers however would argue that it is precisely the failure to
achieve this that undermined the mission.
Few could have predicted that the humanitarian mission to deliver food to
starving millions would degenerate into an obsessive search-and-destroy
operation against supporters of a single warlord.
The UN was ill-prepared from the start of its first peace-enforcing
operation. The multinational force was riven with national rivalries and
deeply resentful of the predominant role played by US troops outside the UN
structure of command.
Orders were not obeyed. Military intelligence was abysmal. The disarmament
of Mogadishu's warring factions was not conducted simultaneously, sowing
suspicions among the Aideed camp that the UN aimed to eliminate them.
On the political front, the UN's timetable to have functioning local
councils and a government of national reconciliation in place within 18
months proved hopelessly optimistic. Somalia has had no government since
1991. Before that it had a civil war, and before that a dictator.
Gen Aideed still denies he planned the ambush that killed 24 Pakistani
peacekeepers in June - the event that triggered the escalation of violence
in Mogadishu and culminated in the deaths of hundreds of Somalis and 18 US
troops in a battle in October.
The UN military, under orders from the Security Council to detain Gen Aideed
for the June ambush, became caught up in the very chain of retaliation and
revenge that fuels clan rivalry in Somalia. UN bombs compounded the damage
of the civil war. Helicopters gunned down the civilians who had been saved
from the famine.
Caught in the blind hunt for Gen Aideed, the UN lost sight of its mandate,
its impartiality and its authority to play a constructive role.
The events in Somalia have infected all aspects of peacekeeping. Gen
Aideed's defiance probably encouraged Haiti's military rulers to defy the
UN's would-be peacekeepers there last month.
It has made the Security Council more cautious about authorising new
peacekeeping operations. Burundi has been the first victim. Despite appeals
for protection, the UN has sent only an envoy to mediate between the
government and paratroopers who killed Burundi's elected president in
October.
In Mogadishu, UN troops have abandoned all attempts at maintaining law and
order; their main aim now is to avoid more casualties. Bandits and armed
gunmen roam the streets with impunity. Recruitment for UN military missions
has become harder since the US announced it would withdraw its troops from
Somalia by March 1994.
Many Somalis, including Ali Mahdi, the warlord who controls north Mogadishu,
fear that Somalia will revert to bloodletting when the Americans leave. Few
doubt the US pull-out will spell the effective end to the UN military
operation in Somalia (Unosom).
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, rejects the notion of a
complete UN withdrawal. 'The international community must not abandon
Somalia in view of the incontrovertible desire of the Somali people for
continued presence of Unosom in their country,' he argued recently.
The reality, however, is that the world is disengaging and Somalia's
travails are far from over.

   ABIDJAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Henri Konan Bedie, the self-proclaimed new president of the Ivory Coast,
consolidated his grip on power yesterday after winning the endorsement of
France and other diplomatic missions in the capital, Abidjan.
Mr Bedie, the speaker of parliament, declared himself president a few hours
after the announcement of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's death on
Tuesday. Under the constitution, he is entitled to lead the nation until the
end of the presidential term in 1995.
French President Francois Mitterrand addressed his message of condolence to
Mr Bedie as 'interim president', indicating that France rejected the rival
claim to the presidency by Mr Alassane Ouattara, prime minister. In the
final weeks of Mr Houphouet-Boigny's life, the prime minister had tried to
canvass support for a broad-based coalition government led by himself.
Mr Ouattara and Mr Bedie are bitter rivals in the ruling Democratic Party
(PDCI). They belong to different tribes and different religions, but are
probably less apart on economic policy issues than their rhetoric would
suggest. Mr Bedie is a former finance minister while Mr Ouattara, a former
director of the International Monetary Fund, had been the Ivory Coast's
economic overlord since 1990.
Ambassadors in Abidjan, however, feared Mr Ouattara's plans would unleash a
constitutional crisis at a time of great political and social uncertainty.
They were afraid political infighting might provoke a military coup, and
therefore threw their diplomatic weight behind Mr Bedie, the legal dauphin.
Mr Bedie's move will probably trigger a split in the PDCI. Mr Ouattara is
expected to resign as prime minister, as he had said in the past that he
would not serve under Mr Bedie.

The Vietnamese government has admitted that a year-long campaign against
corruption among state employees is having little impact and that corruption
is costing the country tens of millions of dollars.
Mr Bui Thien Ngo, interior minister, told the National Assembly that
measures to fight corruption had brought about no significant changes and
the situation remained serious. He said efforts to curb smuggling were
failing although more than 17,000 cases of smuggling have been uncovered so
far this year.
Officials say goods smuggled in from China and Cambodia are damaging
domestic industry and losing the government revenue. The fight against
corruption and smuggling has been a recurring theme for the past year and Mr
Vo Van Kiet, prime minister, has made curbing corruption among officials a
personal crusade.
Appeals for more vigilance and more efforts to curb corruption are part of a
political battle now being waged in Hanoi over the pace of economic reforms.
The more conservative members of the assembly and Communist party officials
say corruption and other social ills are a result of rapid economic reforms.

Japanese machine tool orders in October fell 22.2 per cent from a year
earlier and were the lowest for a single month since the Japan Machine Tool
Builders' Association began collecting sales statistics a decade ago, writes
Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
The sharp fall indicates the depth of capital spending cuts among Japanese
manufacturers, who have deferred or cancelled expansion plans and are
delaying new equipment purchases as part of cost-cutting programmes.
Domestic orders slipped 29.2 per cent from a year earlier, while exports
were 10.7 per cent lower.

Mr Nikola Jankovic, a Belgrade pensioner, rifles through the pockets of his
shabby overcoat looking for 25 D-Marks (Pounds 10) to pay for his medicine.
The German currency has all but replaced the dinar as accepted currency in
the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Jankovic's monthly pension of DM2 is 'only enough to die with', he says.
He buys a double portion of tranquillisers because it is cheaper that way.
The monthly rate of inflation in Serbia has hit 50,000 per cent, surpassing
the record 44,000 per cent inflation of the Weimar republic in 1923,
according to Mr Mladjan Dinkic, a Belgrade economist.
Serbia's economy is disintegrating after nearly three years of war and 9
months of United Nations sanctions. Industrial production last month fell by
38 per cent.
Prices are climbing into the trillions. Belgrade economists say the federal
government will soon strike another six noughts from dinar notes.
The UN was told on Tuesday that the sanctions, imposed for Belgrade's role
in the violent carve-up of Bosnia, had cost Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.4bn). By
the end of this year, per capita income is expected to be Dollars 200 to
Dollars 250 a year.
Spending cuts on public transport mean that trams are packed so full they
drive with the doors open. The government on Monday ordered electricity cuts
after early winter weather had overloaded local power stations. Despite
official denials, diplomats in Belgrade forecast that electricity
restrictions will soon be become a regular occurrence.
On Belgrade's Bulevar Revolucije, cash transactions are based only in
D-Marks. Mrs Sonja Durovic, the chemist, dismisses any idea of a revolt
against Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, despite the hard times.
'The Serbs are used to being stomped on,' she says, explaining that people
are preoccupied with making ends meet rather then finding someone to blame
for the crash in their living standards.
With an iron grip on state television, Mr Milosevic has managed to channel
popular resentment about the economy towards the west for imposing sanctions
on Belgrade.
However, Mrs Durovic points out how the economy had already begun to slump
on the break-up of trade between the former Yugoslav republics in 1991.
Mrs Durovic somehow seems to cope but she fears she will soon have to close
down her chemist's shop.
The Serbian government last month passed a diktat ordering 200 private
chemists to meet prescriptions - locally-produced drugs are free, while
imports have to be paid for - and receive payment from a state health fund
later.
'Now we've all withdrawn our drugs from the shelves. We cannot give them
away for free. The state is trying to run us out of business,' she
complains.
In the run-up to elections, Serbia's ruling Socialists are eager to create
the impression that they are reviving the economy. Official propaganda is in
stark contrast to the grey picture on the icy city streets.
Black marketeers hawk their wares - smuggled from Turkey, Bulgaria or
Hungary - indoors, state shops are empty. Serb officials say 70 per cent of
commerce is on the black market, eluding tax collectors.
Strapped for cash, Serbia has ordered the non-stop printing of diners to try
to lure any D-Mark savings from the 9.8m citizens.
Economists estimate that national savings have dipped to an average of DM240
per household.
Marko, a scarf wrapped round his face, says he escaped from Bosnia, but can
barely eke out an existence selling soap, washing powder, and tins of
humanitarian aid. 'Everyone asks the price, but no one buys anything.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Swedish PM irritated by Brussels

<TEXT>
Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, yesterday accused Brussels of
showing 'political insensitivity' in negotiations over Stockholm's
application to join the European Union.
But he said an accession agreement could be reached by the EU deadline of
March 1 if several key issues were resolved at the next ministerial-level
talks on December 21.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Bildt raised the now celebrated case of snus
(snuff). The EU is resisting a Swedish demand for a derogation from a EU ban
on the orally-taken wet snuff that is widely popular in Sweden.
'The snuff issue is a detail in itself but it has become a symbol of
Brussels' interference with the way of life of ordinary Swedes. There has
been a degree of political insensitivity, especially on the part of the
commission, that has not been to our advantage in the debate (about EU
membership).'
He said the issue was one of several 'crucial issues' which he wanted to
'sort out' at the December 21 meeting. The others cover differences in
environmental standards, securing EU acceptance of Sweden's free trade
agreements with the Baltic states and resolving EU demands that Sweden
unwind its tight state monopoly on the production, importation and sale of
alcohol.
If they were resolved, talks would move on to the issues of regional policy,
agriculture and budget contributions. 'These are all money related, and so
are interlocked, and will probably be solved within the context of
continuous negotiations. That should be feasible,' Mr Bildt said. The prime
minister rejected suggestions that Sweden was starting to turn its back on
Europe, an impression created by the rejection of the proposed merger
between Volvo and France's Renault, opposition to the building of a road and
rail bridge to Denmark and opinion polls showing majority opposition to
joining the EU.
He said the rejection of the Renault-Volvo merger was due not to Swedish
nationalism but to what he described as the mistaken view that Volvo would
subsequently suffer from interference by a 'nationalist French system'.
Opposition to EU membership was no greater than anti-Union feeling in many
member countries, he said. 'I am concerned (about Swedish opposition), but I
am more concerned by general attitudes in Europe, not by any turning away
from Europe in Sweden.
'Swedes are affected by the general shift of opinion caused by what is going
on in Europe - the development of economies, unemployment, Yugoslavia and
all that is associated with that. All these are seen as a failure of
Europe.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Greek presidency plans early summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As European Union leaders prepare for their two-day summit in Brussels
beginning tomorrow, a new special summit is already being mooted for early
next year to try to conclude difficult negotiations on EU entry for Austria,
Sweden, Finland and Norway.
Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek alternate foreign minister who will chair
the Council of Ministers when Greece takes over the EU presidency in
January, says Athens initially plans a top-level meeting between prime
ministers of the four applicants, Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime
minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The
Greek presidency would then call a special summit 'if the political will and
conditions for a success are there', Mr Pangalos said.
The EU has set an ambitious March deadline to finish the enlargement
negotiations, essential if the four members of the European Free Trade
Association are to become members by January 1995 as planned. But by early
next year, the remaining obstacles to their entry will require 'settlement
at a high level', Mr Pangalos believes.
One of the main issues to be resolved is how to share the cost of
compensating farmers in the four applicant countries for their far higher
agriculture subsidies, which Brussels intends to align to EU prices. At the
moment, the EU argues that the four should foot the bill. But senior EU
officials recognise that tough negotiations will lead to a dividing up of
the approximately Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.67bn) a year cost between the 12 and
the four.
A further complication, likely to surface at the Brussels summit this week,
could come with changes in EU voting rules to accommodate the new entrants.
Of the existing 12, the small member states are determined that the present
weighted majority voting system in the Council of Ministers should simply be
extrapolated from 12 to 16 members.
The system now is that 23 votes out of 76 can block a proposal - or roughly
two big countries and one small country. An arithmetical transposition of
this system to a 16-member EU would mean 27 out of 90 or 92 votes would be
needed to block decisions, meaning that two large member states would need
to pick up at least two and sometimes three smaller allies.
The big member states want a lower blocking threshold to preserve their
influence. The UK is being particularly aggressive, arguing for retaining
the 'blocking minority' at 23 votes. But some smaller member states, such as
The Netherlands and and Ireland, say this will so alter the balance of power
in the Union that it could end by breaking it up. The four candidate
governments argue that a tilt in favour of the powerful would lose them the
referendums on EU entry they are all committed to hold next year.

FT  09 DEC 93 / P&amp;O chief rejects cartel claims
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW HILL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, the British transport and shipping group,
yesterday hit back at allegations that a group of 15 shipping lines was
abusing its dominant position on routes between Europe and north America.
The European Commission yesterday lodged a formal statement of objections to
the Trans-Atlantic Agreement, which was signed by 15 large shipowners last
year to cut losses and fight over-capacity.
Exporters have complained that the TAA is an illegal cartel which has
limited capacity and forced them to pay more for exporting goods to the US.
But Lord Sterling, speaking on behalf of TAA members, including P&amp;O, said
yesterday that the agreement was essential to the health of the industry.
'The whole point is that there's no way we can give them (the exporters) the
service they expect or want, without getting a realistic return on the
capital investment employed,' Lord Sterling said.
Lines involved in the TAA had lost a total of Dollars 650m (Pounds 436.2m)
over the last four years, he said.
Lord Sterling also denied that the Commission would be able to fine the TAA
if the agreement was ruled illegal, because the shipping lines had kept
Brussels fully informed of its existence. The lines believe the TAA is a
shipping 'conference', which should be exempt from competition rules.
But the Commission said yesterday that even though the TAA had been notified
to the competition directorate, the Commission could impose fines if it
decided the lines were abusing their dominant position in the market.
Last year, the Commission levied heavy fines on two illegal cartels
operating between Europe and west Africa, to the profound irritation of the
shipowners involved.
The Commission is now calling for negotiations with the shipowners and other
interested parties in an attempt to amend the TAA so that it will be
compatible with competition rules. Brussels officials say that although the
TAA is aimed at alleviating over-capacity on the transatlantic routes, it
has not led to real restructuring.
The TAA is likely to have two to three months to respond to the allegations
from Brussels.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the commissioner responsible for competition laws, has
already decided that exporters' complaints do not justify temporary measures
against the TAA and Lord Sterling said yesterday that he believed the
Commission would not need to take further action.

Bosnian government envoys in London yesterday launched a bitter attack on
the British government for refusing to lift the arms embargo, and deplored
the UN's threats to withdraw humanitarian aid if a political settlement were
not found, writes Gillian Tett.
Their comments, made at the start of a conference on Bosnia, came after
senior UN officials in London admitted that the problematic UN operation in
Bosnia was casting a serious doubts over the future of UN peacekeeping.
Brigadier Vere Hayes, former UN chief of staff in Bosnia, said that the UN
peacekeeping forces had lacked the proper military command structure or
support needed to run the operation.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Carrying the banner of communism: Contenders line up for
next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We must understand this: life puts this issue before us - either we
understand the seriousness of our position and mobilise our resources to
fight for our very existence, or Russia as an independent country and the
Russian people as a historic, spiritual community will disappear from the
face of the earth.' Thus speaks Mr Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian
Communist party, writes John Lloyd.
Mr Zyuganov, a commanding and impatient man of 49 who spent much of his life
as a party official, now carries the banner of communism in a post-Communist
society - and, according to opinion polls and impressionistic evidence, is
likely to carry it into the new parliament with a significant number of
deputies.
Denounced by other fundamentalist Leninist groups for taking part at all in
the weekend's elections, Mr Zyuganov defends the decision as what the vast
majority of his party's membership - claimed at around 500,000, and by far
the largest in Russia - wanted.
But his adherence to democratic norms is delicate, and his anti-reform
themes familiar. 'They (the government) cannot claim they are taking the
democratic road when they close opposition papers,' he argues. 'We agree
that state property must be more widely spread but not by a collectivisation
in reverse where you destroy the whole system of production and management'.
The theme with which he is most closely associated, however, is that of the
need to save Russia from an international conspiracy. In electing him
leader, Russia's Communists have chosen a man who projects himself as in
basic agreement with the most vigorous of nationalists.
'Russia,' he says, 'is being destroyed deliberately and consistently: (its
enemies) are fighting not against socialism, but for the realisation of a
plan to push her out of the geopolitical arena. We are the last power in the
world which can stand up against the new world order of a global,
cosmopolitan dictatorship.'
This last phrase has been a codeword for the baleful influence of Jews, the
'rootless cosmopolitans' which Russian chauvinists use as a theme to
substitute for that of attacking the nation's ills.
Mr Zyuganov developed his ideology within the Communist party, but within
that powerful part of the then ruling party which emphasised national
greatness and Russian ethnic dominance. Now, Mr Zyuganov is emphasising the
need for the unity of the Russian people as the aggrieved victim surrounded
by hostile foes - a posture with a long history.
There is no contradiction here with socialism and a class approach, he says,
because the country needs 'those forces which put first the task of
resurrecting the traditional values of Russian power and collectivism. . . .
where the whole people. . . . feels itself to be one family'.
The family, however, is not one: it never was, except in nationalist or
Leninist myth. Yet Mr Zyuganov can expect votes from that considerable part
of the population who benefited from state communism, and that larger part
who regret the passing of a great power which called itself Soviet but, as
Mr Zyuganov says, was Russia writ large.

<TEXT>
The French economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter of this year,
confirming official forecasts of a stabilisation in activity but underlining
the fragility of recovery.
The rise in gross domestic product, announced yesterday by the Insee
statistics office, was given a guarded welcome by economic officials in
Paris.
'We have reached the bottom of the decline,' said a spokesman at the
economics ministry. 'But we do not expect any significant recovery until
next year.'
The release of the GDP figures came as the French franc rose strongly to
return to its previous narrow trading bands within the European exchange
rate mechanism. The rise in the franc, to FFr3.424 to the D-Mark was the
first time the currency had traded above its former ERM limit of FFr3.4305
since the summer's currency crisis forced a widening of trading bands within
the exchange rate system.
Currency analysts in Paris said the franc's strength was more a reflection
of D-Mark weakness and optimism about a successful conclusion to
international trade negotiations than a reappraisal of French economic
prospects. They added that the monetary authorities were likely to continue
their policy of cautious cuts in borrowing costs.
The increase in third quarter GDP, which follows a similar rise in the
second quarter and a sharp contraction in the previous two quarters, was
partly due to stronger than expected consumer spending. Household
consumption rose by 0.7 per cent on the previous quarter in spite of
increases in the CSG social security tax.
Exports also increased, rising by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter after
three consecutive quarters of decline. The housing market showed signs of
life, with sales of new houses rising by 2.5 per cent compared with the
previous quarter.
However, the bright spots were offset by evidence of continued weakness in
industrial confidence. Investment, which declined by 1.3 per cent in the
second quarter, contracted by 0.5 per cent in the July-September period.
The French government said the statistics were in line with its projections
of a contraction of GDP of 0.8 per cent this year and growth of 1.4 per cent
in 1994. But private sector economists believe these projections are
optimistic and some argue that evidence of a weakening in consumer spending
since September could result in a contraction in GDP in the current quarter.

The French franc yesterday returned to its previous narrow trading bands
within the European exchange rate mechanism for the first time since the
summer's currency crisis which forced a widening of trading ranges in the
currency system. The franc rose to FFr3.428 to the D-Mark, breaching its
previous floor rate of FFr3.4305.
Currency analysts in Paris said the strength of the French franc was more a
reflection of D-Mark weakness and optimism concerning a successful
conclusion of the Uruguay round of international trade negotiations than a
reappraisal of French economic prospects.
They added that the French monetary authorities were likely to continue
their policy of cautious cuts in borrowing costs, following the Bundesbank,
in spite of the increased room for manoeuvre afforded by the level of the
franc.
The rise in the franc coincided with the announcement that gross domestic
product grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter of this year, confirming
official forecasts of a stabilisation in activity but underlining the

FT  09 DEC 93 / Intellectual imported into party politics: Contenders line
up for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Tsipko is an outstanding example of an intellectual imported into
party politics. A twinkling-faced, fast-talking man in his early 50s, he is
a Civic Union candidate, writes John Lloyd.
The Civic Union is led by Mr Arkady Volsky, head of Russia's main
industrialists' union, and numbers among its leading candidates Adm Vladimir
Chernavin, admiral-of-the-fleet and a former Soviet deputy defence minister.
Yet Mr Tsipko is unabashedly an intellectual - and a semi-dissident one, at
that.
He came to prominence in 1988, when he published a series of articles in a
relatively obscure journal locating the tyrannical genesis of the Soviet
state not in Stalin, not even in Lenin, but in the writings of Karl Marx
himself. He claimed that Marx had laid the theoretical foundations of a
politics which was bound to be monopolistic and, as it turned out,
murderous.
Even in the early days of glasnost this was heady stuff; the more so since
Mr Tsipko worked in the Communist party central committee as a consultant
under the liberal aegis of Alexander Yakovlev, chief party ideologist.
Mr Tsipko has now launched himself against the current leadership: President
Boris Yeltsin and the radical reformers of Russia's Choice.
'He (Mr Yeltsin) is the typical party product: rude and vulgar. He is not
used to opposition so he does not have it round him. When he was first party
secretary in Sverdlovsk he was among the most enthusiastic of the Communist
leaders: very firmly against any kind of experiments with reform.
'Everything is now very black and white - just as it used to be with
capitalism and socialism. Now, if you are not for the president, you are a
fascist; if you do not agree with the new constitution, you are a terrorist.
I do not agree with the new constitution: it cannot last.
'The reformers are typical representatives of the intelligentsia which came
to maturity in the 1970s. They did nothing. They never showed any signs of
dissidence. Only when they were given permission under glasnost did they
begin to show some signs of action.
'Now, they still act like Bolsheviks. They treat the country like an empty
field, ready for their experiments - only now it is the imposition of
capitalism and not of communism.'
Mr Tsipko puts himself in the same frame as east European dissidents who are
speaking out against the victimisation of Communists by the new
anti-Communist forces.
'This was a country created by the Soviet period. You cannot make that
disappear suddenly. You must recognise and work with this. Gaidar forced the
break-up of the Soviet Union. I was against that. It ripped apart what had
been constructed and which was working in some way.
'There will certainly be a united centrist bloc after the elections. . . By
making politics black and white the president and his supporters are trying
to squeeze it out, but it must exist if the country is to survive. I remain
a liberal, but I also want a strong state; the two are not incompatible.
Indeed, I would say the first depends upon the second.'

FT  09 DEC 93 / Blood, sweat and tears - for others: Contenders line up for
next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of Russia's extreme right-wing party, is
campaigning on a platform of 'blood, sweat and tears' - for everyone, that
is, except the Russians, writes Chrystia Freeland. 'Why should we create
suffering for ourselves?' the husky, 47-year-old lawyer-turned-politician
asks. 'We should create suffering for others.'
Translating this rhetoric into a political programme, the head of Russia's
deceptively named Liberal Democratic Party says he will make Russia rich
again by selling arms to the highest bidder, including such pariah states as
Libya and Iraq, and by bringing an immediate halt to all subsidies -
including the sale of fuel at less than world prices - to other former
Soviet republics.
Mr Zhirinovsky supports President Boris Yeltsin's draft constitution because
it would lay the ground for the sort of strong, centralised state he
favours. He is also promising to renew Russia's international prestige by
defending the rights of ethnic Russians everywhere, bullying Russia's
immediate neighbours and talking back to the west.
His aggressive Russian nationalism has, however, forced him to engage in
some contortions to explain his own, not entirely 'pure' ancestry. He
stresses that although he comes from Alma Ata, capital of Kazakhstan, 'I was
born among Russians and so I consider myself to have been born in Russia
itself.'
But, while Mr Zhirinovsky's flamboyant style and hyperbolic language make it
tempting to dismiss him, there are growing indications that the extreme
right, rather than the Communists, will be the beneficiary of the protest
vote in this weekend's elections.
'The Russian people have three choices,' Mr Zhirinovsky says. 'We can either
choose that which we have now by voting for Gaidar or Yavlinsky, which does
not suit many people. Or we can choose to go backwards, by voting for the
Communists, which also does not suit many people. My party represents a
third choice.'
Mr Zhirinovsky, who seeks simultaneously to emphasise his humble origins
(his autobiography begins with a sentimental description of his birth and
childhood in a crowded, communal apartment) and his superior intellect
('tell your readers that Zhirinovsky knows four languages and graduated with
honours from Moscow University' he instructs a journalist), is refreshingly
frank about which sectors of Russian society are most likely to opt for his
'third choice'.
'In the large cities, where the more cultured, better educated, more
prosperous classes live, we will not do so well.
But in the small cities, in the rural areas of Russia, among the poor, among
the young, among the military personnel, we will be supported.'
As one of the few leading politicians to have never been a member of the
Communist party, he certainly has the potential to conjure up a dangerously
appealing vision of Russia. With his promises to 'bring the non-Russian
republics to their knees', reverse 'Gorbachev's and Yeltsin's policies of
giving everything to the west' and, most magically of all, to raise wages
while stopping inflation, Mr Zhirinovsky represents what many Russians dream
of: a Russia which is a great power, but not a Communist one.

Senior Russian politicians yesterday threatened reprisals against leaders of
republics who have called for a No vote in Sunday's referendum on a draft
constitution for Russia. Fears are growing that the draft will not be
adopted and that a new period of political instability will result.
At the same time, a statement from the leadership of the rebel Russian
republic of Chechnya, the most extreme of the anti-Moscow republics and the
only one which has banned all voting on Sunday, said President Boris Yeltsin
had made a declaration of war by threatening to tighten border controls and
cut rail communications.
Chechnya, under General Dzhokar Dudayev, has declared complete independence
and is a centre of anti-Russian agitation in the north Caucasian region.
However several other republics, led by Tatarstan, insist on the right of
sovereignty and most party leaders have come out against the constitution.
The warnings of reprisals, and of chaos if the referendum were not passed,
reflects intense concern within the Yeltsin camp that the constitution will
not be adopted. It requires a 50 per cent vote on a turnout of at least 50
per cent of the voters - a result originally considered attainable but now,
in the face if widespread apathy and even hostility, thought to be in
danger.
Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, warned the presidents of
Russia's republics who have called for a No vote that the armed forces,
security forces and interior ministry were 'seriously concerned' by the
opposition to the constitution, especially by the leaders of Tatarstan,
Bashkortostan and Tuva. A government reaction to this opposition was now
being prepared, he said.
'Those who are making war on the constitution. . . . should take care of the
unity of the Russian federation, or we shall lead our state to catastrophe.'
Mr Nikolai Medvedev, head of the president's department for relations with
the Russian regions, warned still more pointedly: 'Even after the tragic
events (of October 4 when the Russian parliament was shelled by the army)
they are not behaving responsibly in what they say (and). . . . they are
answerable before their consciences and the state, as state officials.'
Mr Yegor Gaidar, head of the liberal group Russia's Choice, said in a
newspaper interview that the constitution 'bears the stamp of the events of
October 3-4' and that it was far from perfect. 'All the same, I'm deeply
convinced that the risk of it's not being adopted is incomparably greater
than the risk form its imperfections.'
Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg and a leader of the Movement of
Democratic Reforms, which supports the constitution, said he feared the
referendum would not be passed. 'The constitution has not been properly
presented, no explanatory work on he necessity to adopt it has been done and
the overwhelming majority of voters either know nothing or too little about
it,' he said.
Western observers, now gathering in Moscow to review the progress of the
voting on Sunday, generally believe it is 'within the bounds of the
democratic arena' - in the worlds of Mrs Herta Daubler-Gmelin, a German
Social Democrat deputy. However, they stress that it will work only if the
parties and the political class refrain from extreme methods and support
reform.

Russian politicians competing in the campaign ahead of the parliamentary
elections on December 12 speak for constituencies as yet largely unformed. A
propertied class is still in the making; it has not differentiated itself
fully from a working class.
'Liberals' and 'conservatives' do not come with a package of beliefs and
policies - reflecting the still fragile existence of parties which, in
settled democracies, package such policies and use party discipline to
impress them on their members.
There is only a small number of professional politicians, and they are
conscious of their unpopularity.
The 13 groups and parties presently registered to participate in the
elections thus seek to bring in to the political fold public figures from
the intelligentsia, from literature and the arts, and from the stage and
television.
The result, in many of the blocs, is a rich mixture of warhorses and
gadflies, each of whom is concerned to express his or her individuality.
This first parliamentary election in Russia may also be the last before the
minders, media managers and massagers of the message move in: it is thus a
blessed time for the voyeur of the political scene, even if, probably, the
individuals contending for office are unlikely all to make serviceable
deputies.

Deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais, a leading candidate for Russia's
Choice, has been architect of the world's most ambitious privatisation
programme, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
His conservative opponents claim his sell-off - which has already put about
half of Russian industrial capacity into private hands - will be remembered
as one of the world's biggest flops. However, the 38-year-old economist from
St Petersburg has brushed off the criticism, saying 'it means I've been
doing the right thing'.
Even the prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, who once compared his
privatisation to Stalin's collectivisation, has had to give in to the
irreversible process set in train by the distribution of privatisation
vouchers to Russia's citizen. And while other reformist ministers, including
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia's Choice, have come and gone, wavered
and compromised, Mr Chubais has kept both his job and his principles since
the launch of radical reform in January 1992.
His reserved manner and boyish charm conceals a formidable and thick-skinned
political operator.
'He thinks strategically, and then fights as much as it takes, compromising
only when necessary,' says Professor Anders Aslund, the Swedish economist
who has advised the Russian government and is a personal friend.
'It is because of his political skill that privatisation has been the most
successful part of the economic reforms so far.' It is in order to complete
what he sees as a historic mission of switching the state-dominated economy
to 'real owners' that he helped set up Russia's Choice and is running for
parliament in his native city.
Competing parties in the elections continue to assert that his blanket
approach to privatisation is insensitive to the needs of individual
companies and sectors. He defends it as the only way to minimise corruption,
break the stranglehold of bureaucrats on the economy and make enterprises
behave in a more market-orientated way.
In order to ensure support for the campaign, he has also given factory
directors and workers the option of acquiring up to 51 per cent of the
shares in their companies.
His next step, he says, will be to focus on the economic restructuring of
privatised enterprises, helping those who want it and accelerating
bankruptcy proceedings against hopeless companies.
Consolidating his stature as a nationwide politician is the network of local
representatives of his State Property Committee in every town and city of
Russia.
An intensely private man, he has little time for a personal life, even
employing his wife, Maria Vishnevskaya, who is also an economist, to brief
him on aspects of privatisation.
A puritan in comparison to many of his colleagues, he is strikingly honest
for someone in such a potentially corrupting job. Despite having control of
most state-owned property in Russia, he spent his first year in office
living in a small Moscow hotel rather than taking over a nice Moscow flat.
He may not have the hurly-burly bonhomie of many a Russian politician. But
he is looking to the election to confirm that his privatisation, despite
seven decades of hostility to private property under Communism, is indeed,
Russia's choice.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Reformer who is a natural baby-kisser: Contenders line up
for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A discovery of the Russian election campaign has been that Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky is a politician. He is good at the glad hand, the impromptu speech
and the ready quip, writes John Lloyd.
At his meetings, he works the crowds, senses their mood, plays to it. If
baby-kissing were to come into vogue (it is far too cold) he would be good
at that, too.
He is the only candidate outside the ranks of the government with a
reputation both in Russia and outside. His reformist credentials were
displayed in market reform plans - co-authored with Mr Stanislav Shatalin in
1990 and produced with a group of Harvard economists in 1991 - which were
both shelved by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev.
Briefly a deputy prime minister after the August 1991 coup, he worked
frenziedly to get agreement between the Soviet republics on an economic
union. For the past two years, Mr Yavlinsky has run a consulting company,
EpiCentre, and kept his name in the public arena. Earlier this year, he was
the first to declare that he would stand for the presidency as soon as he
could.
The party he has formed to fight these elections, called Yabloko (apple) -
an acronym of the surnames of the leading candidates' surnames, being Mr
Yavlinsky, Mr Yuri Boldyrev and Mr Vladimir Lukin - is presently running
second in the polls after Mr Yegor Gaidar's Russia's Choice. He says he is
confident of taking a large bloc of seats in the new parliament, but
co-operation with Mr Gaidar, he says, will 'depend on Gaidar: he will have
to recognise our strength and come to terms with what we stand for'.
What Yabloko stands for is a much more active state - but a state dedicated
to the creation of a market which renders it quickly redundant, 'by rapidly
breaking up monopolies, by the promotion and protection of competition, by
careful land reform, by clarifying and regulating property relations and by
widening the area of the private sector'.
He has advanced a consistent critique of Mr Gaidar's economic programme as
being misdirected, by putting financial stabilisation before the development
of a competitive market. Freeing a monopolistic economy from state control
does not necessarily create a competitive economy, he argues.
He himself professes the instincts of a liberal, even a libertarian. 'People
must depend on the authorities as little as possible . . . the more they are
independent of the state, the stronger is civil society. The stronger civil
society, the more secure is life itself.' His strength and weakness is that
he is a loner, and something of a prima donna.
That has kept him free of alliances and outside government: it will also
make it hard for him to compromise if and when he is called on to do so.
He is given to high-profile and dramatic interventions - as when he appealed
to Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president, to end his self-imposed
captivity in the Russian parliament in September - and he is relentlessly
self-confident and egotistical.
Mr Yavlinsky is in the power-struggle for the long haul: it will be
surprising if his period out of power lasts much longer.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Markets buoyant as Bank governor hints at interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, SARA WEBB and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday there
could be another cut in interest rates early next year should the recovery
falter.
Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, Mr
George denied he was an 'inflation nutter' but said price stability was a
vital ingredient in long-term growth and wealth creation.
His comments on interest rates, made during a relatively upbeat presentation
on UK economic prospects, helped to buoy the London stock market - already
strong on the back of a highly successful auction by the Bank of Pounds 3bn
in 10-year gilts.
Stock was heavily oversubscribed, underlining optimism among investors that
the UK upturn would be relatively smooth with continuing low inflation and
government borrowing under control.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed up 40.1 at a new peak of
3,277.4, a rise of 3.5 per cent since last week's Budget. The market was
helped by firm trends on other European bourses boosted by hopes of a world
trade agreement. Gilts finished up to three-quarters of a point higher on
the day.
Mr George said he thought 'plausible' the Budget forecast of Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor, that the UK economy would expand 2.5 per cent next year.
Although he said this rate of growth would not necessarily require a cut in
interest rates from 5.5 per cent, he agreed with MPs that there were
uncertainties about the outlook, partly linked to the Pounds 8.1bn of tax
rises due to take effect next April.
Under questioning from Ms Diane Abbott, a member of the committee, Mr George
said: 'If this (growth) was not happening . . . we would assess the scope
for movements in interest rates.' He said there was 'limited danger' of
rates rising due to inflationary pressures.
Demand for the gilt auction stock - the 6 3/4 per cent bond due 2004 - was
strong with a cover ratio of 2.19 times. The cover ratio (of bids to offers)
is a good measure of investor appetite. It last topped 2 times at the July
28 auction.
Optimism over the trade talks and hopes of a cut in German rates in the next
few weeks pushed Frankfurt share prices to a new high, the DAX index closing
1.5 per cent up on the day.
The committee last night agreed on a report recommending that the Bank be
responsible for setting interest rates. Its report is due to be published
next week.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Pension review may affect 400,000: Study finds sales rules
were not followed in four out of five cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four out of five personal pensions sold to people transferring out of
employers' schemes into private plans were taken out without agents seeking
enough information to give proper advice, according to an independent study.
Up to 400,000 people could be affected and several hundred million pounds in
compensation in total may have to be paid by life insurers, banks and
building societies.
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and investments Board, the
City's chief watchdog, yesterday gave details of the SIB's pension transfer
review announced last week. He spelt out how compensation would be handled
and what measures would be taken to ensure that customers would not be sold
unsuitable personal pensions in future.
An advisory committee made up largely of chairmen of the relevant
professional and trade associations, and chaired by former senior civil
servant Sir Douglas Wass, will assist the SIB board.
The pilot study, which points to widespread abuse in the sale of personal
pensions, was commissioned from the accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick. KPMG
sought to assess how many people were at risk of disadvantage from having
followed poor advice. The report is to be published before Christmas.
It found that in 80 per cent of cases examined, sales agents had not
properly complied with regulatory requirements for selling pensions in this
way.
If this reflects wider practice, some 400,000 cases could be re-opened with
sales agents. Up to 500,000 individuals have transferred out of employers'
schemes and into personal pensions.
Many of these cases will have to be raised with the individual customers, to
establish who might be worse off in retirement as a result of following poor
advice.
Mr Large acknowledged that people covered by the review who had already
retired might be receiving less income than they were entitled to, but he
emphasised that all those affected would be fully recompensed.
'Those who may have transferred their pension provision on the basis of
wrong advice will not be harmed by waiting for reliable solutions to
emerge,' he said.
Ministers face particular embarrassment from the political emphasis that was
placed on the benefit of taking out a personal pension in terms of
flexibility.
Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, welcomed the latest move,
but added: 'Should the further investigations now under way reveal that any
clients have suffered financial loss as a result of bad advice, I have made
it clear to SIB that the government expects effective remedies to be put in
place promptly.'
A steering group, made up of the heads of financial regulators and some
professional bodies, will draw up remedies for the harm that has been done,
and recommend measures to prevent future problems.
One difficult area will be pensions sold on bad advice from independent
financial advisers. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the Prudential, one
of the largest pensions providers, said yesterday he was not responsible for
any failure by independent advisers to give proper advice in selling a
Prudential pension.
The steering group will recommend new sales rules to the SIB board by the
end of February. It will make recommendations on compensation by the end of
June, and SIB will publish its intended course of action in July.
Sales agents will be able to sell pensions to people transferring out of
occupational schemes under the existing regulations until new rules are set,
but Mr Large warned that they must take extra care 'to give sound and full
advice'.

FT  09 DEC 93 / Thatcher denies detailed knowledge on Iraq arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Thatcher yesterday publicly distanced herself from responsibility in
the arms-for-Iraq affair.
In an energetic performance before the Scott inquiry which at times echoed
her confrontational style at the parliamentary despatch box, she claimed
that while serving as prime minister she had no knowledge of much of the
detail behind the decisions taken by officials and ministers or of key
intelligence relating to illegal British defence exports.
She was giving evidence to the inquiry being conducted by Lord Justice Scott
into the government's handling of military-related exports to Iraq during
the time she was prime minister.
Her appearance before a packed audience of journalists, Whitehall officials,
personal advisers and ordinary citizens in rooms belonging to the Department
of Trade and Industry, marked the first time a former or present prime
minister has been subjected to questioning by a public inquiry on pivotal
aspects of government policy.
However, the hearing appeared to raise more questions than it answered,
given her persistent refusal to be drawn on some of the main aspects of the
inquiry.
Amid tight security, she told the inquiry that, while in government, she had
not seen many of the documents referred to by the inquiry, which showed
officials and ministers sidestepping government guidelines restricting
defence exports to Iraq.
'Most of the documents before me I had never seen (while in government) . .
. If I had seen every copy of every minute . . . I would have been in a
snowstorm,' she said.
Her statement came in one of the sharp exchanges with Miss Presiley
Baxendale QC, counsel for the inquiry, whose inquisitorial style and
persistent cross-examination drew sighs of exasperation from Lady Thatcher.
Lady Thatcher said she had not been made aware until the summer of 1990 of
intelligence suggesting that British machine tools were being used to boost
Iraq's military capability and that Jordan was being used as a diversionary
route.
As prime minister, Lady Thatcher was supposed to be provided with weekly
summaries of intelligence on matters affecting government policy.
But asked to explain evidence from officials and ministers that intelligence
had been badly distributed, she said: 'Either the machinery was there and
was not effective . . . or else the machinery itself was defective. Either
way it is a matter for concern and inquiry.'
The Scott inquiry was set up by Lady Thatcher's successor, Mr John Major,
after a political furore surrounding the collapse of the trial of three
businessmen from the Midlands machine tool company, Matrix-Churchill.
The businessmen were prosecuted for illegally exporting arms to Iraq, but
their trial collapsed after it emerged that government ministers had known
and approved the exports.
Lady Thatcher said the first and only time she had personally been involved
in the export of machine tools to Iraq was in July 1990, which she claimed
was in line with an international relaxation in restrictions on the export
of industrial goods.
Asked about an earlier intelligence report she had seen suggesting that Iraq
was possibly building up its military capability, she said she had not
linked this with the machine tools.
She denied she had personally been involved in earlier approval of
defence-related machine tools as claimed in evidence by a senior Whitehall
official.
Lady Thatcher said she had no recollection of doing so and that a 'trawl' of
Whitehall documents since the beginning of the Scott inquiry had not backed
up the evidence.
She denied that she misled Parliament about government policy towards Iraq
and argued that in 1988 her ministers had changed the words of guidelines on
defence exports but not the policy. The change which allowed more exports to
Iraq came from 'changed circumstances' arising out of a ceasefire in the
country's war with Iran.
Lady Thatcher originally indicated she wished to appear before the inquiry
only once but has now agreed to provide further assistance if asked.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said Lady Thatcher's
evidence lacked credibility. 'There is clearly a major scandal that goes to
the heart of government and Mrs Thatcher is at the heart,' he said.

FT  08 DEC 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Postbank welcomed
into the German banking fold - But the change will hurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 10th Decemeber 1993) appended to this article.
The Association of German Banks yesterday dropped a two-year legal suit
against Postbank, the state-owned postal bank, which was accused of keeping
interest rates low with the help of state subsidies.
The move symbolically welcomes Postbank, often nicknamed 'the bank without
bankers' into the broader family of German commercial banks following the
government's success last month in pushing its privatisation through
parliament.
Postbank will sell up to 75 per cent of its equity starting in 1995. The
German postal services and the state will each retain a 12.5 per cent equity
stake until 1999.
Mr Gunter Schneider, chief executive, said Postbank would immediately be
seeking equity partners, with a preference for building societies and other
savings and loans institutions.
The first equity exchange is likely to be made with the Vereinigte Post
Versicherung, the insurance company which, after selling life insurances to
the postal employees, has widened its client base. Mr Schneider says he
plans to step up the bank's restructuring before floating shares publicly on
the German stock market.
The bank also intends to strike co-operation alliances with foreign
partners, mostly through Deutsche Postbank International, its recently
formed subsidiary in Luxembourg. Its first cross-national venture was
announced this week. Three weeks ago, Postbank opened three investment funds
co-managed by the Swiss Bank Corporation. The funds will invest in European
fixed-interest rates deposit certificates.
Postbank's operating results for 1992 totalled DM216m (Dollars 127m), but
the bank made a loss of DM173m in 1992 after transfers to the state budget
and special expenses.
Until last year, losses by the state-owned bank were covered by Deutsche
Telekom - a measure which will stop in 1995 with privatisation. In return,
Postbank will no longer pay a substantial portion of its earnings to the
state. 'We expect to be in the black in 1995,' says Mr Schneider.
Becoming a fully-fledged independent bank will not be painless. Up to 40 per
cent of the bank's staff is expected to be axed bringing the workforce down
from 20,000 to 12,000 by 1996. The bank has accumulated DM1.1bn for pensions
in the last two years.
The bank's divorce from the postal services will hurt those working in
German post offices. With privatisation, Postbank will stop covering the
wages of some 30,000 employees offering financial services behind postal
counters. The measure will save the bank about DM800m a year.
Analysts estimate that the bank will only need 1,500 counters, from which it
currently derives nearly 80 per cent of its business, rather than be
represented in Germany's 20,000 post offices.
'We will start operating like a normal commercial bank,' says Mr Schneider.
'We will stay in the savings deposits business but we will offer more
services. We do not want to develop new products. We want to offer known
products at better prices,' he says.
Postbank has started its drive to attract new customers. A new savings book,
called Sparbuch 3,000 plus, has attracted 200,000 customers since it was
launched at the end of 1992.
After losing customers last year, when deposits fell to DM42.5bn from
DM44.8bn, the new product is expected to lift deposits to DM48bn by the end
of 1993.
Other new businesses include a licence with Visa, which will allow Postbank
to issue credit cards later this year.
'We will become a real player now. But we want to remain faithful to our
traditional image of security,' says Mr Schneider.
CORRECTION
Postbank, the German bank, has recently opened three investment funds
co-managed by Union Bank of Switzerland. The co-manager was incorrectly
reported in the Financial Times on Wednesday as Swiss Bank Corporation.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Colombia shifts focus in the drugs battle: Escobar's death
frees government to concentrate on other targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After years of obsession with Pablo Escobar as the main source of Colombia's
evils, the country is unexpectedly realistic about the significance of his
death. An opinion poll after the Medellin drug chief was shot dead last week
found that more than half those interviewed thought drug trafficking would
continue as before; a third said there would be no change in the violence.
President Cesar Gaviria and other political and military leaders were
clearly relieved the memory of Escobar's escape from his luxury jail could
be rubbed out, but they expressed satisfaction rather than triumph and
talked in terms of the long battle ahead. Perhaps one of the most useful
results of Escobar's death is that the drug problem can now be seen in
greater perspective. The US ambassador to Bogota says the government will
now be able to direct its efforts against the more serious Cali trafficking
group.
For years the Cali groups have represented the more tolerable face of
trafficking. While Escobar terrorised the country with car bombs, the Cali
people bought banks, funded politicians, founded universities and
concentrated on legalising their fortunes. On the whole, the violence did
not impinge on the public, but with the appearance of new heroin trafficking
groups, this changed: dozens of bodies floated down the River Cauca and
Cali's murder rate shot up.
The government is trying to draw Cali and other traffickers into the
surrender-and-confess programme; they would serve short sentences and then
emerge with 'legal' status. But some see the surrender legislation as almost
as good as an amnesty.
Even if the top people surrender, as it seems they may, there is no reason
to suppose their organisations will stop trafficking, and there are plenty
of ambitious young criminals waiting.
The number of trafficking groups and the size of the business are growing,
according to drug experts in Colombia.
Only recently has any serious effort been made to tackle money-laundering
structures and stem the avalanche of returning dollars, estimated at Dollars
800m-Dollars 5bn a year over the past two years.
President Gaviria, the police and armed forces have recovered prestige at
home and abroad with the death of Escobar. It also removes one source of
violence from the current electoral campaign (three presidential candidates
were assassinated in the last one). Business people believe foreign
investors will regain confidence in Colombia. As one newspaper columnist
wrote: 'The Escobar excuse is over and forces the government to show better
results on other fronts.'

operations
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, will today sign an agreement with
investors from the US and the UK to sell the Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle
(Mibrag) coal business, Reuter reports from Berlin.
The agency said Mibrag would be acquired by a consortium including PowerGen,
Morrison-Knudsen and NRG Energy.
The consortium signed an agreement in principle in September to buy the coal
company which owns one of Germany's largest brown coal mines. The Treuhand
said it would announce further details about the sale today.
In September, the Treuhand said the consortium would pay DM2bn (Dollars
1.2bn) for Mibrag. The companies had pledged to invest up to DM1.4bn in
Mibrag and employ 2,000 workers.
Mibrag is based in Bitterfeld. Employing 9,000 workers, it is one of the
largest companies on the Treuhand books.
The Treuhand had expected the deal, which has been the subject of
negotiations lasting more than a year, to be completed by November.
The Treuhand said it expected the mines to produce between 15m and 20m
tonnes of coal a year.

Hoogovens, the Dutch steelmaker, said its two-stage issue of new share
certificates over the past week raised Fl 362m (Dollars 190m), AP-DJ reports
from Amsterdam.
The company said the offer was oversubscribed. Proceeds will be used to
shore up Hoogovens' capital base. All 9.05m share certificates on offer were
placed. The issue price was Fl 40 per certificate.
Certificates are a unique Dutch form of depositary receipt representing
shares that many companies in the Netherlands place with trusts friendly to
management as an anti-takeover defence.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Assembly lifts Tapie's immunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman-turned-politician, is expected to face
prosecution for alleged financial irregularities after the French National
Assembly voted yesterday to lift his parliamentary immunity.
The 432 to 72 vote followed a judge's request to investigate alleged misuse
of corporate funds from Testut, a small near-bankrupt manufacturer of
weighing scales which is controlled by Bernard Tapie Finance. The company
was used to extend loans to Olympique-Marseille, the football club which Mr
Tapie also controls, to buy football stars.
Appealing to fellow deputies yesterday, Mr Tapie said: 'This assembly is
asked to cast the first stone at me. And this will allow others to cast
bigger, heavier stones perhaps at me, but perhaps they will also hit some of
you'. Several deputies, mostly Socialists, have been implicated in alleged
illegal funding of political parties by businessmen seeking public
contracts.
Mr Tapie built up his group largely by taking over failing businesses, often
with credit from state-controlled banks, selling some of their assets and
juggling the rest between various holding companies.
According to Mr Antoine Gaudino, a former member of Marseilles' financial
police, Mr Tapie has piled up personal guarantees to banks of nearly FFr1bn
(Dollars 173m). Societe de Banque Occidentale, a subsidiary of Credit
Lyonnais, yesterday acknowledged loans to Mr Tapie, but would not reveal
their amount. SDBO and other institutions are said to have a FFr79m mortgage
on Mr Tapie's Paris mansion, which he admitted this summer was now worth
only FFr30m.

<TEXT>
Low on fuel and unsure where the next paycheck is coming from, the Haitian
army is facing a crisis which diplomats said yesterday could mean a power
struggle between the military and right-wing groups, Reuter reports from
Port au Prince.
Army-backed groups such as the Front for the Advancement and Progress of
Haiti (FRAPH) are expanding their operations, threatening rank-and-file
military men who see their power being eroded, said one western diplomat.
That might help push the army back to the negotiating table after weeks of
the military thwarting a United Nations-brokered plan to restore ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, experts said.
Haiti Prime Minister Robert Malval was to meet UN officials in New York
yesterday and then fly to Rome to seek the Vatican's support for a new
initiative.
Mr Malval said on Monday he would hold a national meeting as early as next
week to bring various national and business leaders together to negotiate a
solution to the crisis.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Gonzalez bid to ease EU strains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A clearer European identity in defence policy and a European economic
recovery would do much to ease strains in relationships with the US, Spain's
premier Felipe Gonzalez said yesterday.
Speaking after a White House session with President Bill Clinton on Monday,
he identified the Nato summit in Brussels next month and the extra steps to
European monetary union due to take effect on January 1 as important markers
in this process.
'We are still unsure if co-ordinated policies can lower European interest
rates,' he said. 'But lowering them, together with a Gatt agreement, is of
most interest to the US because a European economic recovery is in the
American interest.'
Mr Gonzalez thought Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, had
'exaggerated' last week in warning of the deleterious effects on Nato of a
failure to reach a Gatt agreement.
He felt the already evident US economic recovery would remove some of the
broader US concerns, as would a future European rebound. But he conceded
that it was proving difficult to define policies to deal with what he called
'the new world disorder'.
On Bosnia, the prime minister thought the US was right in being 'cautious'
about committing troops to enforce a settlement. But he noted the growth in
public support in Spain, from less than 40 per cent to over 70 per cent, for
humanitarian peacekeeping operations there.
He took consolation in certain political paradoxes: that the current Italian
government might be the weakest in Europe but still had a better chance to
institute necessary domestic reforms than any in the past 10 years.
Concerning Cuba, he stressed the Spanish preference for ending the economic
embargo.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Call for pension funds to back IT research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A joint technology, transport and telecommunications infrastructure is
urgently needed for European recovery, a report by the Federal Trust, the
pro-European integration British think-tank, claimed yesterday.
The report, issued on the back of the recent white paper on European
economic renewal by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, argues
that Europe's fragmented infrastructure, with 12 different transport and
telecommunications networks, is undermining the single market, and Europe's
competitiveness with more unified regions like the US.
Though Europe has more than a quarter of world gross domestic product, it
has only only a tenth of the world's information technology production, the
report says. Since individual nation states are unable to provide the
necessary investment on their own, joint action is imperative.
The trust proposes that private pension funds become a key source of the
necessary investment. According to Mr Graham Bishop, vice-president of
Saloman Brothers International, these are expanding rapidly and could create
a pool of financial assets in excess of Ecu6,000bn (Dollars 6,840bn) in the
foreseeable future - 15 times member states' current foreign exchange
reserves.
But as Mr Jonathon Hoffman, economics director at Credit Suisse First
Boston, points out, a new EC pension funds directive is urgently needed to
allow this type of cross-border investment.
Meanwhile, soaring levels of national debt, twice as high as current
published figures if unfunded liabilities are taken into consideration,
threaten to be a key problem hampering growth, Mr Hoffman says.

In a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, it said
the economy of the rump Yugoslavia had declined to 1960 levels. By the end

Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest private sector bank, yesterday reported an
11 per cent increase in operating profits to DM4.2bn (Dollars 2.48bn) in the
first 10 months of 1993.
The rise, however, came exclusively from foreign operations, according to Mr
Hilmar Kopper, chairman, who said the German recession had caught up with
the country's banks and that its effects would continue to be felt next
year.
Earnings at Deutsche's German-based parent company fell 9 per cent to
DM2.36bn, largely as a result of record group-wide risk provisions of almost
DM2.5bn, up 54 per cent on last year. Some 90 per cent of the provisions,
which Mr Kopper expected to rise to almost DM3bn for the full year, were to
cover risks within Germany.
The cyclical and structural crisis had made a serious impact on the
creditworthiness and income of Deutsche's domestic customers, Mr Kopper
warned. 'As the house bank to thousands of small and medium-sized companies,
we are feeling the effects of this,' he said. The bottom of the industrial
recession had been reached, he added, 'but the bad news is that we will stay
quite a while at this low point'.
Deutsche holds 10 per cent or more of the equity of 25 leading non-banking
companies, worth almost DM24bn, according to details released for the first
time yesterday.
These holdings include 10.65 per cent in Metallgesellschaft, the metals,
mining and engineering group, which this week negotiated new credit lines
with Deutsche and Dresdner Bank to help it meet margin requirements for
hedge positions in oil future contracts taken out by a US subsidiary.
Mr Kopper said Deutsche stood by Metallgesellschaft and saw its difficulties
as a technical, short-term liquidity issue and not a matter of survival.
In a robust rejection of media criticism of German banks' continuing healthy
earnings growth while industry suffered, Mr Kop-per said profits were needed
as capital to fund industry and job creation. 'I am always expecting
congratulatory letters, but they never arrive,' he protested.
Noting that a 20 per cent net return on equity was not unusual in the US, he
said German banks were relatively 'under-developed', doing well to achieve
12.5 per cent. Detailing the results, which were compared as usual in
Germany with ten-twelfths of the full 1992 results, he said foreign
operations' earnings rose 40 per cent, with especially strong contributions
from Luxembourg, Italy, and Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant banking
business.
Foreign branches and subsidiaries also contributed more than half the 7 per
cent rise to DM9.7bn in net interest earnings.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (19): Russia and Germany lead
 -Corporate transactions are taking off in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE WRIGHT, IGOR FILATOTCHEV and TREVOR BUCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past year has seen an acceleration in regulated buy-out activity in a
number of countries across central and eastern Europe (CEE).
The greatest numbers of deals are occurring in the Neue Lander (former East
Germany) and Russia, though markedly different approaches are being used. By
the end of June 1993, 2,364 buy-outs or buy-ins - 19 per cent of all
privatisations in the German Neue Lander - had been conducted on the basis
of a case-by-case negotiation of the transaction.
Buy-outs were, however, relatively small, accounting for only 4.3 per cent
of the total purchase proceeds, 3 per cent of the total promised investment
and 8.3 per cent of promised jobs among all privatisations.
Though large numbers of deals are being processed, the Treuhandanstalt
(THA), the German state privatisation agency, closely scrutinises each
transaction in an attempt to ensure that buy-outs are placed on a sound
financial footing, and that deals are completed which can be successfully
restructured.
In terms of finance, problems with outstanding debts are resolved, venture
capital introduced if deemed appropriate and use made of special equity
support and investment grant schemes.
Buy-out deals may be delayed until the THA is satisfied that restructuring
has taken place to make the enterprise commercially viable. In the case of
Holzindustrie Bienenmuehle, for example, unrealistic management forecasts
led to a reduction of the firm's activities to two product lines and 50
employees. The much delayed deal was completed at the beginning of this
year, and six months later employment had increased by a fifth.
Where a buy-out is not a viable option, a number of related alternatives are
available. A small number of buy-ins have been completed. At the end of
December 1991, a programme to promote buy-ins was launched by the THA, but
although 2,800 inquiries were received, a year later fewer than 20 deals had
been completed.
Parallel to this programme, there have been numerous other attempts to
effect buy-ins. A management partnership scheme has also recently been
introduced, which involves incentivising incoming managers to turn round
groups of underperforming enterprises in the same sector prior to
privatisation. A similar scheme is being introduced in Poland.
In Russia, buy-outs are now taking place in large numbers, but without such
close monitoring of the process. Indeed, it is becoming clear across CEE
that, for privatisation to get under way, it is often necessary, in the
absence of a complete legal framework, to progress with policy
implementation with alternatives which are acceptable within the local
context. For example, where ownership laws are not fully elaborated,
long-term leases may be an acceptable means of enabling privatisation to
progress.
In the absence of such a pragmatic approach, the whole process of regulated
transformation is likely to grind to a halt, with managers still having the
ability to dissipate state assets.
Two principal routes to effecting a buy-out in Russia are available. First,
significant numbers of enterprises which were leased by their workers'
collectives under the provisions of the 1989 leasing legislation are now
exercising their option to buy-out the assets.
Second, and following the introduction of the Russian privatisation
programme in 1992, buy-outs have been effected through the use of vouchers.
The second of the three privatisation variants permitted under the
legislation allows managers and employees to buy-out, at face value, 51 per
cent of the shares of their enterprise through a closed subscription, and by
using their own individual vouchers in payment. After the closed
subscription, the remaining shares are offered to an open auction, in which
management and employees can also participate. For example in the
privatisation of the Bolshevik Biscuit factory, management and employees had
obtained a total of 70 per cent of the shares at the end of this two-stage
process.
Variants 1 and 3 of the law provide other means by which management and
employees can obtain significant, but not majority, equity stakes. Up to
September 1993, according to the Russian statistics bureau (Goskomstat),
some 7,000 large and medium-sized enterprises, employing a total of 4m
people, had been privatised under the Russian privatisation law, of which 80
per cent used variant 2.
Elsewhere in CEE, the volume of buy-outs has been less spectacular. Poland
has so far seen most activity. By the end of May, 2,217 privatisations had
taken place, of which 1,716 were through the 'liquidation' route. within
which 651 were buy-outs.
As in Russia, buy-outs of formerly leased enterprises are an important
element of the privatisation programme in Ukraine. To the end of December
1992, plans were approved for the privatisation of 168 enterprises to
workers' collectives, which had earlier concluded contracts on leasing with
the option to buy.
In July, the state property fund of Romania announced that half of the 162
small enterprises in trade, food-processing, services and construction,
which were to be privatised through worker-management buy-outs, had been
sold. Other countries are effectively in the process of moving from pilot
stages to mass implementation, or with actual large-scale implementation
still being delayed in some countries because of continuing political
problems.
As buy-outs become established, evidence is emerging of how they have fared.
As of February, 30 buy-outs in the Neue Lander were in receivership. Some
estimates suggest that up to half of the buy-outs will fail, while the THA
considers that about 70 per cent of buy-outs will be successful in the
medium term.
In Poland, a study by the Institute of Market Economies, in Gdansk,
indicates that about half of buy-outs effected through lease agreements have
trouble in paying their instalments. A survey of 1,300 buy-outs conducted by
the federal ministry of economics in Germany, in 1992, showed that there had
been insufficient consideration of the anticipated effects of the weakening
economic situation, and that the main problem after buy-out was not a lack
of equity capital but of know-how in the areas of corporate finance,
marketing, management, planning and control, and rationalisation.
Elsewhere in CEE, access to finance is of particular importance for
longer-term survival, since buy-outs may not involve an injection of capital
to meet investment needs.
These observations suggest a pressing need to address post buy-out problems
in terms of improving managerial skills and sources of finance, and
highlight the continuing problem of the desperate need for  - but current
absence of - real entrepreneurs. However, approaches such as voucher
schemes, which effectively involve the 'give-away' of enterprises, while
breaking through bureaucratic log-jams and enabling rapid decentralised
privatisation to be achieved, may make it difficult to address these issues,
as we make clear in a recent report*.
In particular, while there has been enthusiasm to embrace widespread
managerial and employee share ownership, the importance of control exerted
by institutions or commitments to service external finance, as in buy-outs
in the west, has been played down. The absence of some such forms of
outsider control mechanism may mean that, while privatisation meets fairness
objectives, efficiency is not sufficiently enhanced. There may be little
pressure to improve efficiency, as financing commitments are low and
widespread employee ownership may reduce managers' ability to undertake
restructuring, even if they aim to do so.
Finding individuals and institutions with the requisite monitoring skills is
highly problematical. The private investment funds which are emerging may be
driven by the need to achieve short-term improvements in dividend payments
to their investments at the expense of long-term investment.
Such funds are increasingly making attractive offers to employees to buy
their shares, as in the case of Bolshevik Biscuit where the private
investment fund Alpha Capital, having obtained 12 per cent of shares at the
time of the privatisation, subsequently contacted all employees offering to
buy their shares at a price equivalent to four times the nominal value of a
voucher.
Foreign firms may be reluctant to become involved, unless they obtain
majority control, which management and employees are unwilling to cede.
Having resolved the problems of privatising vast numbers of enterprises,
corporate governance issues are becoming the next major policy problem in
transforming the countries of CEE into effective market economies. The need
to address employees' expectations of the extent and timing of the gains
from holding shares is likely to be an important issue in this process.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (20): Plums are tastier than
lemons - Hands off that Bimbo? Charles Batchelor compiles a buy-out-speak
primer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management buy-outs combine the expertise of the corporate financier with
those of the venture capitalist, and the industry makes use of technical
terms from both sectors.
Some of the more colourful terminology imported from the US by the venture
capital community has been lost as the industry has become more established
in Europe. But managers contemplating a buy-out may still be confused by
some of the jargon.
Bimbo: A somewhat controversial term to describe a deal involving both
existing and outside managers: a buy-in/management buy-out (or Bimbo). About
half of all deals take this form.
Bought deal: When a deal maker provides all of the finance needed for a
buy-out deal, and then sells on or syndicates part of the funding to other
investors later. Done by the larger providers of finance when speed or
confidentiality are particularly important for the deal to succeed.
Bridge financing: Short-term funding provided when a company is about to
raise a new round of equity, or is about to go public.
Business plan: The document put together by managers to justify their
application for finance. Should contain summaries of past and projected
profit-and-loss accounts, balance sheets and cash flows. Also details of
products and services, markets, future strategy, and profiles of the
managers. A warning, however: don't get too carried away. Most financiers
will not go beyond the two-page executive summary.
Caps, collars and cylinders: Clauses in buy-out deals which limit the extent
to which the interest rate charged on borrowed funds can rise or fall. A
safeguard against borrowing costs rising to the point where they endanger
the company.
Such agreements usually have a limited life of one or two years. The longer
the period of cover, the more expensive the collar or cap.
Carried interest: A stake, typically 20 per cent, taken in the investee
company by the venture capital or buy-out fund managers. Can be in the form
of options.
Deal flow: The rate at which investment propositions come to the deal-maker
or financier. Many claim to select only one deal in 50, though deal-flow
numbers are treated by some as a sort of virility symbol.
Development Capital: Later-stage finance for more established companies
which are profitable or nearly profitable. Less risky generally than early
stage finance.
Due diligence: Detailed analysis and appraisal of the background of the
entrepreneur and his business plan.
Earn out: Either a formula for relating the final purchase price of a
company to actual future earnings, or a means of encouraging management to
perform by payment on the basis of future performance (see also ratchet).
Employee buy-out: A deal involving not just the top management but also all,
or a large number of, the more junior employees of the organisation. The
difficulty of involving large numbers of employees without disclosing a deal
prematurely has meant that relatively few of these deals have been done.
Some managers get round this by staging a buy-out and then involve other
staff at a later stage.
Employee share ownership plan (Esop): A trust which is established to
acquire shares in a company for subsequent allocation to employees over a
number of years.
Exit: The point at which the financier sells his holding in the buy-out
company, either through a trade sale to a larger company, by the management
buying out the other investors to assume complete control, or by a stock
market flotation. It is essential the managers and their financial backers
agree from the outset on the exit strategy.
Gearing, or leverage: The ratio of debt to equity in a company's capital
structure. Intermediate forms of capital, such as redeemable preference
shares and convertible loans, can complicate the calculations and mean a
variety of different ratios may be applied to the same company.
Hands on / hands off: The degree to which an investor in a buy-out becomes
involved in its management. A hands-on investor would normally nominate a
non-executive director to the board, and might commit some of its other
executives to help out if the company ran into difficulties. Hands-off
investors would have very little, or no, active involvement in the company.
Internal Rate of Return (IRR): Different investors work this out in
different ways, but the term generally refers to annual compound rate of
return to the investor over a given period. Returns normally include
dividend distributions and profits from either disposals or a fair valuation
of the buy-out company.
Junior debt: Unsecured loans which rank after secured or senior debt for
repayment in the event of a default (See also: Senior debt).
Junk bonds: High yielding, unsecured debt used in US buy-outs. Since the
debt is in the form of a bond certificate, it can be bought and sold more
easily than the mezzanine loans (qv) used to finance UK buy-outs.
Lead investor: Venture capitalist or other deal-maker with the largest share
in the syndicated investment. He usually initiates the deal, and takes a
hands-on role on behalf of the other partners.
Lemons and Plums: Bad deals and good. Bad investments usually go wrong
before the good ones produce a profit: the lemons ripen before the plums.
Leveraged buy-out: Similar to a management buy-out, though usually applied
to US deals where the transaction will have been initiated by a financial
group rather than the management. The name refers to the high level of
borrowing which the company takes on, using the assets being purchased as
leverage. When British buy-outs seemed to be going the way of their US
counterparts, with large, highly speculative deals being put together by
City financiers, the term started to be applied to UK buy-outs. Nowadays,
the idea of high levels of leverage is a distant memory.
Living dead: Companies which are just about trading profitably but are
unlikely to do really well. A slightly dated term used about investments the
deal-makers prefer to forget.
Lock-out agreement: An agreement to give the buy-out team time to negotiate
the purchase of their company free of pressure from other bidders.
Management buy-in: An offshoot of the management buy-out industry. The
purchase of a business by one or more outside managers with the help of a
group of financial backers. The term was applied indiscriminately in the
late 1980s to any bid involving a well-known City figure, on the grounds
that a buy-in sounded more constructive than the hostile takeovers they
usually were. Buy-ins are now seen as being considerably riskier than
buy-outs, because they involve an outside management team which does not
know the company as well. Many deals are neither pure buy-ins nor buy-outs
but bimbos (qv).
Management buy-out: The purchase of a business by its existing management
with the help of a group of financial backers. The managers put up a
relatively small amount of the total finance but usually gain a
disproportionately large share of the equity. Buy-outs are funded largely by
loans secured on the assets of the company itself.
Mezzanine finance: Loans, usually unsecured, which rank after secured or
senior debt but before equity in the event of the company failing. To
compensate for the greater risk, they typically carry interest one to three
percentage points above secured loans, and often carry an equity 'kicker' to
give the lender a stake in the equity.
Newco: The buy-out is usually carried out through a newly created company
normally referred to as Newco.
Preferred ordinary shares: Refers to the ordinary shares taken up by outside
investors in a buy-out. They rank ahead of the plain ordinary shares owned
by the management in terms of dividends and the pay-out in the event of a
winding-up.
Ratchet: An incentive arrangement whereby the managers get a bigger share of
the equity if the venture performs well. Sometimes managers forfeit shares
if they do particularly badly (see also Earn-out).
Second-round financing: Sometimes needed to help buy-outs which have run
short of funds. Or it may be a sign that the business has done well and is
raising new money for further investments.
Senior debt: Secured debt which ranks first in terms of repayments in the
event of a default (See also: Junior debt).
Slippage: This is what happens when the buy-out company starts to eat up
more cash than expected, because development costs exceed budget or sales
grow too slowly.
Syndicated investment: An investment which is too large and risky to be
handled by one investor and which needs to be shared among several partners.
Fewer deals are syndicated in present market conditions; while syndicates
also involve fewer participants. This is partly because the smaller deals do
not require so many players; but it also means that, if trouble arises,
fewer people have to be consulted to sort out the mess.
Vendor finance: Finance provided by the vendor in the form of either a
deferred payment or a retained minority stake in the bought-out company,
usually in the form of loan notes. It allows the vendor to share in the
profits of the company if it does well, and can also be used to boost the
sale price, thereby impressing the vendor's shareholders.
Venture capitalist: Deal-maker who provides funds and advice to
entrepreneurs, either starting a business from scratch or staging a
management buy-out.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (17): Almost respectable -
Germany / Increased business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jodag Mobilsysteme, based in Heidhofe in the middle of the rolling hills of
the Schwabishe Alb, in the south-west German state of Baden-Wurtemmberg, is
typical of many mittelstand, or medium-sized companies.
Typical in that, in the 90 years since it was founded, it has evolved from
being a craft business into a modern manufacturing company, like many
companies in south Germany. It started life making wooden carts used for
transporting hay and manure; now, it is one of Germany's largest makers of
portable containers used inter alia as temporary offices and accommodation
across much of eastern Germany.
It was, until recently, a family-owned company. But the former owner reached
retirement age without finding an obvious heir. In 1990, he turned 67 and
realised that none of his five daughters, nor their husbands, was willing or
able to take over the business.
The problem of management succession is common to many thousands of
mittelstand companies: Jodag's solution was highly unusual. Mr Wolfgang
Sander, an engineer in his mid-fifties with a history as a company doctor, a
desire for a new challenge and no previous connection with the container
manufacturer, bought himself a major stake in the company, backed by the
German arm of 3i, the UK venture capital company, together with Candover and
one domestic institution.
'It was very attractive for me to make such a move,' reflected Sander
recently, on the motivation behind the management buy-in. 'It offered
enormous opportunities for developing the business and my career. And, of
course, there is the chance to make some money if all goes well.'
Sander is still a rare breed in German industry - the experienced manager
who is prepared to leave the security of a job in big business and willingly
take the financial risks associated with a buy-out.
Rare, but not unique, as at least two other recent cases show. Mr Jurgen
Grossmann, a main board director at the troubled Klockner-Werke diversified
steel group, teamed up earlier this year with Druker &amp; Co, a Frankfurt-based
investment banking boutique, to buy the group's special steel subsidiary for
a symbolic DM2 (79p).
In November, two businessmen bought LVH - a large German food production
company - from the DG Bank, advised and backed by the Hamburg-based Thomas
JC Matzen buy-out specialist and by CINVen in London. According to Mr Dirk
Brandis, at Matzen, this is one of Germany's largest and most complicated
buy-outs, with the move to new ownership linked with a new commercial
strategy for the loss-making company.
Together with Jodag, these transactions illustrate forces which are leading
to increased buy-out and buy-in business in Germany. The volume of such
deals is far from being enormous - indeed, advisers consider themselves
lucky if they put together two or three deals a year. But in a market which
has traditionally frowned on such transactions as an unpleasant intrusion of
Anglo-American financial jiggery-pokery, there has been a perceptible
pick-up in business opportunities within the last six months alone.
The ultimate cause of this is the German recession, which is hitting both
large companies and mittelstand companies hard.
Germany's big, publicly quoted companies are virtually all conglomerates.
Many are now under financial pressure, forcing management to think hard
about strategic priorities. 'Portfolio clarification' has become a priority:
managers are realising that businesses will have to be sold in order to
concentrate limited resources on newly-identified core businesses.
The idea of 'focus' still has a revolutionary flavour for German corporates,
and as yet it is only the more troubled companies - such as Klockner Werke
or FAG Kugelfischer - which are engaged in wide-ranging winnowing of their
business portfolios. But analysts expect unbundling to gather favour through
the 1990s, creating more opportunities for management buy-outs and buy-ins.
For the mittelstand, the problems are different: the downturn has merely
served to exacerbate the difficulties of finding successors to the ageing
owner-managers who built up their businesses in the aftermath of the war.
'Often management is the most logical successor,' comments Siegfried Druker,
whose firm backed Mr Grossmann's buy-out from Klockner-Werke. 'A management
buy-out is the obvious solution.'
Without obvious successors within the existing management, there is scope
for an outsider to take control by means of a buy-in. This is likely to
become increasingly popular, given the reluctance of large German corporates
to buy mittelstand companies at a time when recession in forcing them to
slim down.
In the past the German banks and their investment affiliates may have acted
as 'buyer of last resort', but there is a tendency for banks to scale back
their industrial holdings as they, too, focus on their core businesses. This
leaves the field open to buy-out specialists and adventurous managers.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (18): Managers deterred by the
bottom line - Italy, activity is low, but privatisation may bring
opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dormant, rather than extinct, is how Italian investment bankers see the
buy-out and buy-in scene on their home ground. The number of transactions
concluded over the past two years, and currently being negotiated, is low.
KPMG Peat Marwick's report on mergers and acquisitions in Italy shows that
there were only eight MBOs and five MBIs last year, against aggregate totals
of 15 in 1991 and 30 in 1990. And no improvement on 1992 is expected when
the statistics are compiled for 1993.
Stefano Tanzi, a partner in KPMG's corporate finance group, notes that the
figures in his firm's report are limited to operations involving investment
banks and funds. They exclude operations in which financial packages were
put together by other intermediaries such as commercial banks.
Mr Tanzi believes these other intermediaries probably undertook a similar
number of transactions last year as the investment banks and funds. However,
it is possible that the number of buy-outs and buy-ins undertaken by other
intermediaries has dropped even more sharply than the number in KPMG's
'professional MBO market'.
As the effects of the recession show through in company results, Italy's
commercial banks are recording much higher levels of non-performing loans.
Licking these wounds, they are becoming still less willing to examine
buy-out and buy-in opportunities, as financing these entails higher risk
than normal commercial lending.
Paolo Colonna, of Schroder Associati, a protagonist in Italian MBO business,
criticises the behaviour of the country's commercial banks, describing them
as 'hysterical and irrational'. He comments: 'With banks being hyper-careful
and cutting normal credit lines to business clients, it is not surprising
that they are not financing MBOs.'
But business fundamentals, like profits and financing costs, as much as
reluctant banks and finance shortages, are the reason why deals have fallen
from favour, regardless of the fact that, even before the 1991-1992
downturn, Italy had never featured among the leaders in this kind of
operation. 'Even attractive businesses became unattractive when the economy
turned down,' remarks Stefano Marsaglia, managing director of Rothschild
Italia.
Corporate profits are suffering in the recession, and this makes repayment
of debt difficult. Managers are less willing and less able to consider
buying out their companies' owners when bottom lines are negative or showing
only small profits.
Another deterrent is the cost of financing. Although real interest rates
have dropped significantly from the peaks reached in summer and autumn 1992,
they are still high. The prime rate recorded by the banking association ABI
in September was 10.4 per cent, while the average interest charged on
borrowings from banks was 12.9 per cent. With consumer price inflation at
4.5 per cent, the cost of money discourages buy-outs.
Reflecting the increasing aversion to indebtedness, the average
debt-to-equity ratio of MBOs and MBIs completed in Italy last year was 1.9.
This continued the steady decline from a level of about 4 that was recorded
in 1989.
'Investors are tending to reduce the risks associated with leveraged
acquisition operations in today's uncertain economic conditions. They are
allowing companies higher levels of capitalisation,' says Mr Tanzi. He notes
that managers and investors have learnt from buy-outs that have gone bad due
to debt overload.
What are the prospects for next year? Prices are clearly an important
factor. Mr Marsaglia considers that they are still high, the combination of
this and high interest rates making transactions expensive. 'Next year
should be more active, as the prospect of economic recovery will be closer,
but it will still be difficult.'
Italy's privatisation programme, which finally seems to be getting under
way, may provide some opportunities. Indeed, before the recent break-up and
sale of two divisions of the SME food, grocery retailing and catering group,
controlled by the IRI state holding corporation, there was speculation that
managers might become owners.
That this did not happen owes something to price. Against the financial
muscle flexed by the likes of Nestle and Unilever, managers are hard pushed
to find the resources to make winning bids. 'The price was too high, and the
cash flow offered by the target companies too low. Moreover, the
restructuring needed is too difficult for a managers' bid to be credible,'
remarks Mr Colonna, about the SME privatisations.
He is even more dismissive of the idea that the troubled state-owned ILVA
steel corporation might be privatised through an MBO. He says that, apart
from ILVA's heavy losses, the capital-intensive and cyclical nature of the
steel business prevents an MBO from being feasible.
Opportunities are most likely to arise during post-privatisation
re-structuring, as new owners sell activities that do not fit their business
strategies. Italy's ENI state hydrocarbons holding corporation is thought to
have several good targets in its chemicals and engineering sectors.
Indeed, re-structuring generally could lead to more deals. Under pressure to
focus on core businesses, Italy's large private-sector groups are expected
to shed non-strategic subsidiaries. This could give a boost to MBO and MBI
transactions, and so also could the re-organisation of Italian assets by
multi-nationals.
At Schroder Associati, Mr Colonna is bullish. 'We are already seeing a
faster tempo in the closing months of this year. Next year the number of
transactions will be higher.' Who will put up finance for this expected
growth?
In an area where banks will continue to tread warily, buy-out funds will
have a role. 'Italy's image leads to difficulties with US investors, but
Europeans do not have too many problems in understanding the situation and
opportunities,' says Mr Colonna. Having raised L95bn (Pounds 38.3m) five
years ago, Schroders are now launching another fund of a similar size. About
half has been raised, and investors are expected to subscribe a further
L40bn-L50bn early next year. 'It is a good time to buy,' affirms Mr Colonna.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (15): Trampled by the bull -
The US / Analysis of the fall in activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the 1980s debt binge, the US management buy-out business is suffering
a prolonged hangover. Buy-out activity since 1990 has been extremely light,
and the business has slowed down even further this year.
According to Securities Data, the financial information services group, so
far this year 131 management buy-out deals have been announced, worth a
total value of Dollars 2.95bn. (The figure includes deals that have been
unveiled but not yet completed, and the total runs up to November 16.)
This compares unfavourably with the totals for 1992, when 151 deals, worth
Dollars 5.6bn, were announced, and 1991 (170 deals, worth Dollars 4.8bn).
This year's total, however, could yet be improved if, as many investment
bankers expect, the Kmart subsidiary Payless is taken private before the end
of the year in a buy-out that could be worth as much as Dollars 1bn. Even
with the Payless deal, the 1993 total is still meagre by comparison with the
late 1980s, the heyday of the MBO business. In 1989, 296 MBO deals, worth
Dollars 34.4bn, were announced, and in 1988 - the peak of the boom - 294
management buy-outs worth an astonishing Dollars 84.5bn were announced.
Various factors have been behind the downturn in the MBO market. They
include:
The collapse of many of the big leveraged buy-outs of the 1980s scared many
potential investors away, possibly for good.
Financing has dried up, although banks are now back in the market, albeit
with considerable caution.
Some of the tax loopholes of a decade ago, which made breaking up a company
after a buy-out so attractive, have been closed.
The roaring bull market in equities has made it much more profitable for
companies seeking value to sell their stock to the public, rather than take
it private in a buy-out. And the rise in stock prices has valued companies
so highly, that they are simply too expensive for management or buy-out
boutiques to consider acquiring.
As one corporate finance executive at a top Wall Street firm explains: 'You
can't really do buy-outs at these prices. (The high valuations) mean that
sponsors have to put in a lot more common stock, and the returns, and the
deals the management group gets, are less juicy. There is a lot less
incentive for everyone to pursue buy-outs now.'
The result has been a sharp drop-off in activity, not just measured by
volume, but also in terms of the size of deals announced. Last year, the
biggest MBO, the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led purchase of American
Reinsurance from Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, was worth Dollars 1.4bn.
In contrast, the largest deal so far this year has been the Dollars 425m
acquisition of Purina Mills, British Petroleum's animal-feed subsidiary.
Purina was bought for cash by its management with the help of the Sterling
Group, a private investment group from Houston, Texas.
After the Purina deal, the next largest transactions were two buy-outs
valued at Dollars 300m: one of General Motors' Allison Gas Turbine Division;
the other of Du Pont's weapons manufacturer, Remington Arms.
Both deals were put together by the firm of Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice. While
many of the bigger name boutiques, like Wasserstein Perella (now minus the
Perella), Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Forstmann Little, have kept a
relatively low profile, Clayton Dubilier has probably been the busiest
buy-out boutique this year.
The firm has kept itself active by focusing on buying smaller companies that
have been struggling to make a contribution to a much larger parent. In the
case of GM's Allison and Du Pont's Remington, Clayton Dubilier found two
companies which the firm believed would be better off separated from their
parent group.
This search for the smaller deals highlights a recent trend. As Mr Jack
Levy, managing director and co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Merrill
Lynch, puts it: 'More often than not, the kind of buy-outs which are
available today are subsidiaries of private companies, private companies,
and the very occasional smaller public company. I can't think of a large
public company which has said in 1993: 'I want to go private.''
Yet it would be wrong to suggest that the majority of buy-out specialists
are sitting around twiddling their thumbs. Many are taking the opportunity
to raise new funds to prepare for an upturn in activity, possibly when the
boom in public markets is over. Mr Levy says: 'Things are rather quiet for
buy-out groups, but they are by no means standing still. A number of groups
are raising money, and are preoccupied with getting refuelled for another
round of transactions.'
Whether the next round of deals will justify the preparation remains to be
seen. One investment banker at a major firm is doubtful: 'The market is
pretty realistic about buy-outs. The business went from one where people
were pretty rational about how much they paid, and the transaction
structure, to a feeding frenzy. It led to disaster and losses. All of the
defaults created a lot of fear in the market. Anyone who went through the
defaults does not really want to do it again. We're never going to get back
to where it was.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (16): Not as bad as it might
have been - France, the banks lose enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA CASASSUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession in France has left a varied trail of damage in the leveraged
buy-out business.
The worst of the economic downturn may be over, but caution remains the
watchword for investors, banks and sellers. Some analysts estimate that
total transactions are about 20 per cent down on two years ago, and that
only four or five large banks are now active in the sector.
Average gearing for new leveraged deals, or debt-to-equity ratio, has fallen
to between 1.5:1 and 1:1 from up to 5:1, according to Mr Dominique Peninon,
director of Alpha Associates and president of the French Venture Capital
Association (AFIC).
Some deals put together in the late 1980s are now shaky, even though the
gearing never reached the spectacular heights of that in the US. Meanwhile,
there has been a shake-out of operators in the field, with a number of bank
subsidiaries having pulled out altogether.
LBO France, which is known as leader for large transactions, has concluded
no deals this year, because asking prices are too high, said its chairman,
Mr Gilles Cahen-Salvadore. 'Prices must come down or French economic growth
must pick up,' he added.
Others take a brighter view. A team consisting of the Credit Agricole
subsidiary (Unicredit), Banque Nationale de Paris and Lazard's Partenaires
fund has closed three large leveraged management buy-outs this year, all
with an expected return on equity of more than 20 per cent, said Mr Eric
Licoys, general manager of Lazard Freres' Fonds Partenaires Gestion.
This is less than the 30 per cent achieved in the past, but it is still
healthy because French long-term interest rates are now at a record low, he
pointed out.
Overall, the sector has not suffered as much as it might have done. 'Despite
high real interest rates in the past few years, the recession and stricter
bank lending terms, French leveraged buy-outs have held up reasonably well,'
added Marc Bradford, manager of Unicredit's structured finance division.
The market for medium-sized companies is 'still fundamentally expansionary,'
and many family enterprises will need a solution to handover problems in the
next decade, commented Mr Charles Diehl, director of Barclays Capital
Developpement.
Prices in the middle range are now 'more reasonable', because potential
outlets are fewer. German and other European corporations that were looking
for a foothold in France have other priorities, and the Paris second market
for smaller stocks has been 'a disappointment,' Mr Diehl said.
The picture for the buy-out/buy-in balance is mixed. For some operators,
buy-outs are still in the majority, while for others buy-ins have taken the
lead. For Financiere Saint Dominique, buy-ins are between 10 per cent and 20
per cent ahead, explained the firm's chairman Denis Mortier.
Whichever the case, perhaps more significant is the fact that tougher cash
demands mean that it is the financiers rather than management who often end
up controlling the enterprise.
One company that has carved out a niche in buy-ins, or rather in taking
long-term minority stakes in family firms, is 3i. Each year, between 100 and
150 candidate bosses of about 40 years of age come forward. About 10 are
selected, who then usually find the target companies themselves. Where 3i
comes in is in putting the financial package together and in negotiating the
deal, explained 3i director Mr Guy Zarzavatjian.
What has changed in the company's steady flow of deals is that the ranks of
potential bosses have increased sharply over the past few years, as lay-offs
because of corporate mergers and dwindling profits have hit more senior
managers, Mr Zarzavatjian said. Another change is that only about 3,000 or
4,000 family firms are now healthy enough for 3i criteria, about half that
of two years ago.
Even so, Barclays' Mr Diehl is 'astonished by the number of very profitable
medium-sized enterprises in France.' This is because they have kept most
wage increases at the rate of inflation or below, and have raised
productivity.
On a positive note, there is plenty of venture capital around waiting for
the right investment, and more spin-offs of healthy subsidiaries are
expected to permit corporations to concentrate on core business. However,
AFIC's Mr Peninon says that, instead of being sold directly, more firms
could and should be spun-off in leveraged deals.
On the fiscal side, the industry may soon be given the flexibility it has
been seeking in exoneration of capital gains tax on venture capital firms'
and funds' investments, provided that more than 50 per cent are held in
non-listed companies.
At the moment, this applies only if the target is the direct holding company
of the operating subsidiary and holds less than 40 per cent of the voting
rights. But this is rarely the case, as corporate holding structures are
often two or three tiers deep, explained Mr Jean- Francois Court, chairman
of AFIC's fiscal and legislation committee.
Hopes are now pinned on an amendment to the 1994 draft budget that will
allow exoneration for gains on shares in any tier of the structure, provided
that the 40 per cent rule is respected, he said.
A number of other technical aspects of venture capital operations should be
ironed out soon. 'This will not revolutionise the sector,' but should
promote buy-outs by making the venture capital business more 'attractive and
profitable,' Mr Court added.
He welcomed proposals just issued by the CNPF, the employers' organisation,
to promote the handover of companies. Part of this would be to relax the
rules on staff buy-outs, which are known in France as RESs.
Announcing the proposals, CNPF vice-president Ernest-Antoine Seilliere said
that RES deals had lost their appeal, causing the market to come to a
standstill.
Budget minister Nicolas Sarkozy will be looking at the whole question of
companies changing hands when the government's 1995 budget is prepared, and
may include measures then. The government has a continuing policy of
encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises, in order to create jobs.
The MBO business may not be booming for all, but at least the recession
seems to be bottoming out, and regulations look as though they are going in
the right direction.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (14): Risen from the ashes -
Case study, Leyland Trucks defies the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Dutch commercial vehicle maker DAF collapsed at the beginning of this
year, receivers in both the Netherlands and the UK found themselves picking
up a bewildering array of pieces.
But their underlying resolve, to find solutions which would keep as much as
possible of the business as going concerns, paid off.
The group has been split up, with several different owners and substantial
refinancing. But workforces have been retained - though they are much
shrunken - and trucks are continuing to come from assembly lines in Holland,
Belgium and Leyland, Lancashire, with vans still being made at Washwood
Heath, near Birmingham.
It nevertheless took several months to pull together the management buy-out
led by Mr John Gilchrist at the Leyland truck manufacturing plant, once the
headquarters of UK state-owned Leyland Vehicles which DAF effectively took
over in 1987.
That potential backers were not falling over themselves to come forward is
not surprising, for what is now Leyland Trucks Manufacturing is operating in
markets which have been undergoing one of their most savage recessions since
the second world war. In some Continental regions, its end is still nowhere
in sight.
In leading the buy-out, Mr Gilchrist, who had been managing director of
Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of the collapsed group, finally found backing
in the form of Pounds 5m of equity funding from Barclays Development
Capital, with working capital finance provided by National Westminster Bank
in a total package estimated at some Pounds 40m, although the total has
never been formally disclosed.
By the time a deal was concluded with the receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr
Murdoch McKillop, of accountants Arthur Andersen, Leyland's workforce had
been slashed from 2,200 to 700.
But a structure was also emerging from the ashes of the old group, which has
provided Leyland Trucks Manufacturing with a 'captive' customer, while also
allowing it to pursue other possibilities for manufacturing vehicles for
other truck companies.
The 'captive' customer is DAF Trucks NV, formed in March with Pounds 370m in
equity and loan backing from the Dutch and Flemish regional governments,
banks and institutional investors, and which effectively represents a
resurrection of the Dutch and Belgian truck manufacturing and distribution
operations.
Mr Gilchrist's company has signed a long-term contract, under which
Leyland's truck output will continue to be sold through 'new' DAF's
continental outlets.
As part of what Mr McKillop describes as the biggest and most complex
manufacturing receivership in the UK since the collapse of Rolls-Royce in
the early 1970s, the rescued Dutch company also reached agreement with the
UK receivers to acquire Leyland DAF Trucks, the 'old' DAF's former UK
marketing and sales arm in Thame, Oxfordshire.
Thus the Leyland company is also selling to a Dutch group back in control of
the UK dealer network, and so providing the key market for the 45 series
light trucks and some heavier models produced at Leyland.
The Leyland MBO was also made possible in part by the entire 230-acre site
being acquired from the receivers by Lancashire Enterprises, the development
arm of Lancashire county council, for development as a business and
technology park - thus cutting costs for LTM, which is merely leasing the
site of the assembly plant.
Apart from the slashed workforce, far-reaching reforms in working practices
agreed with those who have kept their jobs, and a pay freeze agreed until
the end of next year, the receivership has freed Mr Gilchrist and his
colleagues from the debt burdens and restructuring and rationalisation
costs, which did so much to drag down the Dutch group.
Indeed, Mr Gilchrist maintains that Leyland is now a lower cost plant per
vehicle than any rival.
Six months after LTM's renaissance, the UK truck market is recovering
sharply. Sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes were up 14.4 per cent in the first
10 months of the year, and Leyland DAF is once more closing the gap to
market leader Iveco Ford.
Mr Gilchrist has forecast a turnover of Pounds 140m and an output of about
8,000 trucks annually from 1995, and asserts that the company will be shown
to be profitable when the results for the financial year to the coming
December 31 are disclosed.
Mr Gilchrist's backers - he refuses to discuss the company's shareholding
structure - still have some time to wait before the true strength of the
company's renaissance can be judged. It is, for example, lacking the
normally lucrative revenue stream which a manufacturer can expect from the
sale of parts.
It derives only a royalty income from them, the parts distribution company
having been the subject of a wholly separate management buy-in.
In the long term, substantial investments will be required in new products -
one of the key factors which brought the old DAF group to its knees.
Mr Gilchrist is undeterred: 'Challenging market circumstances overwhelmed
our former parent company. But they have created here one of the leanest
manufacturing operations in the European automotive industry.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (13): More deals transcend
borders - The regions / Assessing activity outside London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional pattern of management buy-outs in the UK changed dramatically
in 1993, with surges of activity in Scotland and two English regions - the
south-east and the north-west - but it is probable that nothing much can be
read into this.
There were sharp declines in share in south-west England, East Anglia and
the north, and smaller ones in Yorkshire and Humberside, the West Midlands
and the East Midlands, while Wales and Northern Ireland slightly improved
their normal, if small, shares.
The figures, which relate to the first six months of the year, have been
collected by the Centre for Management Buy-out Research, at Nottingham
University. How significant they may be, however, is obscure.
Dr Ken Robbie, research fellow in the centre, says this is because
management buy-out and buy-in activity suffered a sharp decline in the first
six months, recording the lowest first-half total since 1987. This means
changes in regional shares may well not herald a new pattern.
Only 206 deals were completed in the first six months of the year - about 37
per cent down on the same period last year. The aggregate market value of
Pounds 1.52bn fell about 10 per cent. Activity cannot therefore be seen as
'normal'. Individual deals - or taking longer than usual to conclude them in
some areas - may have had a disproportionate effect.
The south-east shows how erratic the change in shares appears. After falling
back to 32 per cent of the national market in 1992, it shot up to 39.3 per
cent of the first-half deals of 1993 - the highest it has ever achieved.
The north-west, which is the second biggest UK economic region after the
south-east, also picked up to a record share - 11.3 per cent, against 10.6
per cent in 1993. Scotland surged most, moving from an 8.8 per cent share to
13.6 per cent.
The biggest dives were in the south-west, which plunged from 8.1 per cent
last year to 3.6 per cent in the first two quarters of 1993, and the north
of England - the north-east and Cumbria - where the 1992 share of 5.2 per
cent collapsed to only 1.8 per cent. East Anglia went from 4.7 per cent to
3.0 per cent.
Yorkshire and Humberside fell by only 0.2 percentage points to 7.7 per cent,
the West Midlands by 0.5 points to 8.3 per cent and the East Midlands by 0.4
points to 6.6 per cent. Wales's share moved up slightly from 4 per cent to
4.2 per cent, as did Northern Ireland's, from 0.5 to 0.6 per cent.
What Dr Robbie has noticed, however, is an increasing number of deals
involving people working across regional borders. The most notable example
was the buy-out of Leyland Trucks from Daf (see this page). The plant is in
Lancashire, but most of the professional advice came from corporate finance
experts, lawyers and other professionals in Leeds, led by Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
This is different from before. The rise of regional financial centres such
as Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham had seen each regional capital keeping
deals within the region - and the professional fees generated very much to
itself.
The reduction in general levels of activity is one reason why there may now
be some 'poaching' in neighbouring regions.
Another is rationalisation within professional firms, with a few top
consultants operating on a super-regional basis - covering the whole of the
north, say, from Manchester or Leeds - but drafting in local reinforcements
when deals move into the final stages of processing.
At the other end of the scale, polarisation of financial and professional
services into regional capitals can rebound.
Some companies on Merseyside, for example, resent having to go Manchester
for advice. Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, has therefore put a
substantial corporate finance resource into Liverpool, headed by Mr Amin
Amiri.
Some advisers are sceptical about the management buy-out market anyway. Mr
Lindsay Forbes, director of the British Linen Bank - the merchant arm of the
Bank of Scotland - in Manchester, thinks most have been nothing special.
There were many of them in the regions, because of the way many national
companies bought subsidiary companies in the 1980s and spread their branch
factories around the country. When they had to rationalise, they started
lopping in the regions.
Moreover, many of the companies were bought cheaply by their managements
from divesting parents which were anxious to be rid of them. They have not
had to do much to perform well enough for backers to look to flotation
around now to realise their investments.
Mr Forbes says that there remains a shortage of good deals, partly because
there are now fewer motivated vendors, but more importantly because there is
a perpetual shortage of good managers who can triumph when there is not much
general scope for improvement.
A mediocre management can hide its deficiencies when there is only slight
economic upturn if price-to-earnings ratios take a quantum leap from a low
base. If the price of a buy-out was five times earnings three years ago and
it can be floated at 15 times much higher earnings now, everyone makes a
great of deal of money.
But a company that costs 12 times earnings now, in an improving economic
climate, will probably have to float or be sold at more than 20 times
earnings to achieve similar gains. This will require very good management,
and this is in shorter supply than deals.
'There's a lot of money looking for a quality home - and not enough quality
homes,' says Mr Steven Hartley, Manchester corporate finance partner of Stoy
Hayward, the accountants, summing up the current regional MBO market.
In spite of this, Stoys in Manchester has been lead adviser in several MBOs
this year, including M &amp; I Materials, Palletower, Armourshield, Sondhi
Kellar and Lorco Hygiene, and one MBI - Xenon Holdings.
Mr Tony Hyams, regional director of Barclays Development Capital, also
remains bullish. He thinks one reason why the north-west has improved its
national share this year is because the financial and professional services
sector has developed so strongly in Manchester.
'Over the past few years we have seen a discernible trend for the money to
move where the industry is. There is also an increasing preference in
industry to deal with local advisers wherever possible.
'Meanwhile, the cautious approach of many quoted companies and trade buyers
towards acquisition often leaves the existing management in a strong
position as potential purchasers.
'Those choosing the MBO route will find plentiful funds in the regions, not
only from venture capitalists, but also from banks which have taken far less
of a battering in the north than the south,' Mr Hyams added.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (12): Living with the fees
squeeze - The lawyers, 'no hay, no pay'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management buy-out lawyers have had a tough time recently. The recession has
changed the market-place. Clients now exert greater influence on the legal
services they purchase and on what those services cost. Lawyers are unhappy.
Stiff competition among law firms for the MBO work that was around in the
recession gave both management teams and financial institutions the whip
hand in negotiating fee levels.
Many deals are now done on a contingent basis. If the deal aborts, the
lawyers don't get paid - or, as John Kitching, of Lovell White Durrant, puts
it: 'No hay, no pay.'
'It's very difficult', says Tony Keal, of Allen &amp; Overy. 'If a deal
collapses, no one wants to bear the cost, because no one is making a return.
The management team can't bear the costs, venture capitalists don't want to,
and the banks don't see why they should. The result is the lawyers end up
carrying the cost.'
Perhaps this is a reaction to perceived overcharging in the past, he says.
But he warns that there is a danger of it going too far. Fees have been
pushed down to such an extent that it is starting to affect the quantity of
due-diligence work that professional advisers can afford to do. Whether that
will have some impact on recoveries or failure rates in future is a big
question, says Mr Keal.
There is also a danger that the pressure on all parties to ensure the deal
gets done, so that the principals make a return and the advisers get paid,
is such that it could lead to too much completion for completion's sake.
You could reach the stage where no one is asking whether this deal should
really be done, or done in this way, he says.
Matthew Layton, of Clifford Chance, doesn't believe competition among law
firms for MBO work has increased that much; especially for the larger
buy-outs above Pounds 10m where, he says, there tend to be only a few firms
that have the expertise to handle that size of transaction.
But he does accept that clients have become much more conscious of the fees
issue. This has meant that law firms have had to work very hard at
controlling costs, striving to come up with straightforward documentation
which will simplify the negotiation process, and also trying to ensure that
there is no duplication of effort among the advisers to the deal.
There is an obvious overlap with the due-diligence work that accountants and
lawyers do, for example, which has to be avoided, says Mr Layton.
The recession has also clearly had an effect on the way deals are likely to
be structured in the foreseeable future. John Kitching, of Lovells, says
that, faced with restructuring a number of the more complex deals put
together during the boom period at the end of the 1980s, lawyers learnt the
hard way whether their original documentation was any good or not.
Unscrambling and restructuring deals where the agreement of large syndicates
of 20 to 30 banks is required has proved particularly stressful. But the
positive side, says Mr Kitching, is that those who have slogged it out
during the recession will have a better knowledge of what the market will
and will not back, which they can use in the future.
Adam Greaves, of Gouldens, who has just advised on the restructuring of
Maritime Transport Services, a Pounds 155m MBO which he worked on in 1989,
confirms that the experience of unscrambling some of the more optimistically
structured deals of the late 1980s will result in much simpler deals in
future. The days of ratchets are gone, he says. The trend is towards simple
equity share structures, so that if it works it works, but if it doesn't you
can at least start again without the complexities of past deals.
All the lawyers are agreed, however, that the level of MBO activity has
picked up over the past six to nine months. There have been a lot of
flotations at the exit end and a lot of small MBOs, many financed without
institutional money by so-called 'business angels', says Adam Greaves.
Matthew Layton says there may have been a slight downturn in the actual
number of new MBOs, but there is still plenty of activity because, although
debt is harder to obtain than it was in the late 1980s, there is still a lot
of equity money in the market looking for a suitable home.
Lawyers have become more proactive and creative in looking at new structures
in recent years, partly because the lack of available debt forced them to
find alternatives to standard senior debt financing, but also because
vendors have become increasingly interested in retaining stakes in the
buy-out vehicle. Some deals these days are structured more like joint
ventures, he says.
Lower interest rates have been good for buy-outs, but they also mean there
is less pressure on vendors to sell; and, as they don't want to sell at a
low point in the market, they prefer to keep an equity stake in the joint
venture. These deals are much more complex from a legal point of view, Mr
Layton adds.
Tony Keal says he thinks the supply of senior debt has actually expanded
again, particularly compared with six months ago. The evidence of that is
the Gardner Merchant deal, he says. But he agrees that the structure of
deals has changed.
'They are now much more conservatively structured. In the heyday of the late
1980s, deals were being structured with debt-to-equity ratios of 6:1; now 1
 -1.3:1 is the norm.'
The unspoken hope of the MBO lawyers is that the Gardner Merchant deal
represents the first of a second wave of bigger buy-outs. If that turns out
to be the case, perhaps it will at last enable them to return to what they
regard as more realistic rates for the job.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (11): 'The coffee machine may
undermine Chinese walls' - The accountants, when do interests conflict?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure is growing for reform of the rules governing conflicts of interest
in corporate finance, as accountants muscle in on management buy-outs.
Increasing numbers of accountants recognise the tensions in acting for a
range of different parties in a transaction. Yet so far, few of these
concerns are reflected in any professional guidelines.
Mr Howard Leigh, managing director of Cavendish Corporate Finance, says:
'Whoever is retained to sell a business should not be advising on buyers,
and those who want to keep the audit of both should not advise either.'
He points out that, if the auditors are asked to conduct due diligence, they
will end up investigating their own files, which throws up a clear conflict
of interest.
If they are advising the company on whether to accept an MBO and at what
price, while also advising the MBO team and knowing how much money they will
be willing to accept, then they are in a conflict.
The larger accountants traditionally brush off such criticism. They argue
that such commentary is self-interest on the part of smaller firms and
boutiques that are missing out on work going to the larger firms.
Certainly, Mr Andrew Pollock, of Rees Pollock, a London-based firm, admits
that there is still prejudice by potential clients in favour of using the
Big Six accounting firms on the basis of their reputation. 'There is
conservatism; the IBM factor is going to rule for ever. Clients go for
safety,' he says.
The big firms talk about Chinese walls, the use of different partners or
different offices to conduct the different assignments, and other safeguards
to prevent any conflict.
'We have a rule that if we do due diligence and the audit, we will use
entirely separate teams,' says Mr Neil Lerner, head of corporate finance at
KPMG Peat Marwick. 'Where both parties are clear about our role, we are
happy to act on both sides. The most important thing for the finance houses
is to ensure a steady flow of deals.'
However, Mr Leigh says: 'The partners meet and talk at the coffee machine.
You should not advise in a situation where you end up face to face with
yourselves.' He says concern over potential profit-sharing, or the risks of
litigation if things go wrong, acts as an incentive for partners - who are
all equity-holders in the same firm - to share information, too.
These are not purely theoretical concerns. 'Everyone denies it happens, but
it does,' says Mr Leigh. He highlights the case of a deal with six parties,
each represented by a partner from the same firm. 'They knew there was a
problem, but they wouldn't stand down. Things had gone too far.'
Some of the larger firms are also changing. Mr Ian Krieger, head of buy-outs
at Arthur Andersen, says: 'We have a policy that, if advising management, we
won't do the due diligence. We don't feel comfortable otherwise. But we're
in a minority. I think there is a need for new rules. Until that happens,
people are going to work on both sides of transactions.'
A second concern is the growth in contingency fees. 'There is a lot of
ambiguity,' says Mr Leigh. 'People huff and puff about bonuses or premiums
on the audit fee.' He says there should not be any discount or contingency
element in the audit fee or investigation work.
That issue is reflected in current ethical rules for accountants, which
outlaw contingency fees on activities where a professional opinion on
financial information is required.
Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the chartered accountants' joint ethics
committee, says there are also plans to introduce draft new rules early next
year. These would recommend greater transparency in fee structures, and
outlaw any contingency element linked to the audit or other professional
opinion on financial information.
But he says there are no plans yet for any wider rules that would limit the
potential conflicts of an accountant acting on both - or several - sides in
an MBO transaction.
Meanwhile, there seems to be plenty of money available for MBOs, but a
frustrating lack of deals. Howard Leigh says: 'Staff in venture capital
houses have been doing less, because deals have collapsed and they are now
subjecting them to more scrutiny. But they want to get the deals out before
the end of the year.'
Ian Krieger says: 'There's a lot of equity money around. The funds are
plentiful, but there are not an awful lot of deals around. But business is
pretty good. In the last year, we've been quite lucky and our deals have
come to fruition. It's the luck of the draw.'
And Neil Lerner adds: 'I think everybody who is honest would admit that 1993
has been difficult. We have had a buoyant year in privatisation and mergers
and acquisitions. The only disappointing area has been MBOs.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (10): Suitable shoes for a
Bimbo - Case study, how Stead &amp; Simpson trod the survival route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Gee, managing director of the traditional family shoe retailer, Stead
&amp; Simpson, has put his career on the line for a Bimbo - and the board is
delighted.
The Bimbo in question may well have saved the 160-year-old company from
extinction. It is insider speak for a management buy-in/buy-out, which
involves both existing and outside managers.
S&amp;S resorted to the transaction earlier this year, when it became apparent
that this was the only way to survive. Four years under the ownership of
property group Clayform Properties had squeezed both cash and investment at
S&amp;S.
'We were looking at a blank wall,' says Mr Gee, whose family has been in the
business since it was founded in 1834.
S&amp;S's story in recent years makes unhappy reading. After years of
independence as a solid, if somewhat dull company, Stead fell into the hands
of aggressive developer Clayform Properties in 1989. Clayform was
particularly attracted to S&amp;S's 110 freehold high street properties.
Almost overnight, however, the property market collapsed. Clayform forced
S&amp;S to enter into a series of sale-and-leaseback transactions, which
provided instant cash for the parent, but left the footwear retailer exposed
to the volatile rental market.
When recession set in the following year, S&amp;S found investment in its own
business virtually impossible.
It was at this stage that Mr Gee, and Mr Martin Brayshaw, the finance
director who came to S&amp;S with the takeover, realised that the retailer had
to escape from Clayform's shadow to survive.
In early 1992, they began to investigate the possibility of a management
buy-out. By August they had a business plan and had recruited a team
including a former British Shoe director to strengthen the merchandising
division.
There was only one problem. The oppressed retail sector had fallen heavily
out of favour with venture capitalists.
S&amp;S had several characteristics which made it unattractive to potential
funders. First, it had been making increasingly heavy losses for three
years. S&amp;S would also need to invest in its business, with the return not
immediately apparent. The lead time - the period between the design and sale
of a product - is particularly long in the shoe industry.
Finally, S&amp;S needed to be freed completely from the worries of funding debt,
so it could focus on its products and presentation.
Messrs Gee and Brayshaw found little sympathy for their plight with
potential City financiers.
'They were chiefly looking at a company where they felt they could hold the
sales line and cut out a load of costs to get profits,' says Mr Gee. 'But we
had cut and cut costs as part of Clayform.' S&amp;S could cut no further.
Instead, 'what we had to do was drive sales forward.'
Finally at the end of last year, S&amp;S was introduced to venture capitalist
Apax. Here, almost unbelievably, S&amp;S found ready listeners.
Apax had been on the lookout for a retailing investment. 'Our view was that
it was a good time to go back into the retail sector, the shoe sector in
particular,' says Mr Cyril Freedman, of Apax. After years of bloodletting,
the UK shoe industry was beginning to show some signs of life.
S&amp;S was attractive for several reasons: the well-known brand name and
reputation for value; a focus on less fashion-conscious market towns; and
strong administrative and financial controls.
However, there remained the fact that S&amp;S's unusual needs made it something
of a gamble. For Apax, the only way to reduce the risk was to add new
management and demand a greater equity stake, along with a higher than
normal degree of financial commitment from the team. 'It was very important
that the people involved had a lot to lose and a lot to gain,' says Mr
Freedman.
Enter S&amp;S's current chairman, Mr Ken Bartle, with retail experience,
particularly in merchandising, covering Trueform, Freeman Hardy Willis and
Lilywhite's. He replaced one of the original team, at Apax's request.
The revised management team was then asked to put up Pounds 500,000 to back
Apax's Pounds 4m investment. Apax would get a 70 per cent stake in return.
Clayform, anxious to reduce its debt, sold the S&amp;S business and Pounds 3.5m
in borrowings for Pounds 1. Apax's investment was used to pay off the debt
and clear the overdraft. By the middle of May, S&amp;S was ready to start its
new life with cash of Pounds 750,000 and banking and credit facilities of
Pounds 1.75m.
Although these are still early days and cash is still tight, S&amp;S's
management is convinced the Bimbo has done its work. It has given S&amp;S the
headroom to focus on longer-term investment, while also dealing with the
day-to-day battle in the high street. Apax and the management have even put
up further funding for S&amp;S to purchase 22 more retail outlets.
Apax, for its part, is looking to stay with S&amp;S for at least three to four
years. At that stage, the footwear retailer that fell for a Bimbo may well
return to the market.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (9): 'Something in it for you,
too' - Esops are a convenient way to give shares to employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Widening employee share ownership during a buy-out, through an employee
share ownership plan (Esop), is not a priority for most buy-out teams -
which may seem surprising.
'It's much easier if you can go to the employees and say, 'Well, we've
bought the company, but there's something in it for you',' says Mr Mark
Anderson, director of Esop and buy-out specialists New Bridge Street
Consultants. The Esop provides a convenient mechanism for share distribution
to employees.
However, in the UK there are only 50 to 70 pure Esops, under which all
employees are offered shares, according to the Esop Centre. Around 20 per
cent were set up under buy-outs.
Under an Esop, an employee benefit trust (EBT) is set up. It buys equity
with a loan guaranteed by the company. The allocation of shares can be
deferred until a time when the management has its hands less full with the
buy-out. Capital and interest payments on the loan by the company are tax
deductible.
A profit-sharing trust (PST), in a form approved by the Inland Revenue, is
often set up in tandem with the EBT, to distribute the shares. If employees
hold the shares given to them by the trust for five years, income tax is not
levied on them.
In the 1980s, high profile private-sector buy-out involved Esops, with MFl's
MBO perhaps the best known. They are no longer so prominent.
'The Esop is an additional complication, and an MBO is already a very
complicated transaction,' explains Mr David Reid, tax partner and Esop
specialist with solicitors Clifford Chance. Buy-outs have to be arranged in
secrecy. 'The Esop is essentially a further party to the transaction.'
The business climate is unfavourable. 'Esops often involve gearing, and
people have cut down on that recently,' says Mr Anderson, though he adds
that this is not a problem where shares are offered to the workforce at full
value.
It is necessary to look to the public sector to see Esops playing a more
significant role in buy-outs. Service organisations with unionised
workforces look on employee buy-outs as the preferred method of
privatisation, and an Esop is often used to distribute shares. Port
authority and bus service buy-out teams have used Esops, which are also
likely to feature in rail privatisations.
The biggest employee buy-out this year involving an Esop is believed by its
managers to have been that of Mainline Partnership, a Pounds 50m-turnover,
880-bus company, which provides services for the Sheffield area. It was
purchased from the Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority by its 2,200
staff. Shares are being allocated on the basis of length of service.
Another large bus company employee buy-out with an Esop in tow is in the
pipeline. Last month, Manchester Passenger Transport Authority nominated an
employee team as the preferred purchaser for GM Buses South, a
2,000-employee, Pounds 50m-turnover company servicing the conurbation's
southern half.
'There will be an Esop,' confirms the leader of the buy-out team and
managing director designate, Mr Peter Short. 'We've been looking at a
structure in outline that would involve both an EBT and a profit-sharing
trust.'
The ownership structure is still being discussed with funding institutions,
but the aim is clear. 'The hope is that the employees will hold approaching,
if not actually, 51 per cent,' says Mr Short. The deal should be concluded
by the end of the year.
Quadron Services is distributing shares to its 400 employees. Based in
Weston-super-Mare, the Pounds 11m-plus turnover company was born this autumn
out of an employee buy-out of Woodspring district council's contract
services arm. It is involved in cleansing, grounds maintenance, building,
leisure and catering services.
A PST was not set up. The company is prepared to meet the relatively small
tax liability arising on the shares on its employees' behalf. 'It's
administratively easier to do it that way, given the amounts involved,'
explains Mr Robin Blagburn, senior corporate finance manager at Unity Trust
Bank. The bank often advises trade unions in privatisation buy-outs.
Communicating the potential benefits to the workforce has not been easy.
Five trade unions were involved in the buy-out negotiations. 'EBTs, Esops in
themselves are complicated devices,' says Mr Mike Martin, buy-out team
leader and managing director.
No one group has overall control of the company. The largest portion of
equity, 45 per cent, will go to the employees, while management gets 30 per
cent and funding institutions the remainder.
Some of the venture capitalists approached were not enthusiastic about the
size of the employees' stake. 'They were interested in the concept, but not
perhaps to the degree that we were interested in pursuing it,' says Mr
Martin.
The workers will have to purchase most of their allocation. 'We want
everyone to be a stakeholder,' says Mr Martin. 'We also want them to be
dipping into their own pockets, because we think that means something.' The
size of the stake on offer to each employee is between Pounds 200 and Pounds
6,000 worth of shares.
Mr Martin stresses that it is too early to see whether the new ownership
structure will be successful. He is mindful of problems with other deals,
including the outcome of last year's Pounds 31m Medway Ports buy-out.
In September, a year and a half after the deal and in a more promising
economic environment, the company was sold to Mersey Docks and Harbour
Board. It viewed Medway as being of strategic importance and paid Pounds
104m. Three hundred dockers, who had left the company after restructuring,
lost out on the bonanza, receiving Pounds 2.50 for their shares against the
Pounds 37.25 they fetched nine months later. Mr Martin says that Quadron
will take measures to avoid a similar situation as far as possible,
including revaluation of shares at six-monthly intervals.
Esops might be more popular for buy-out teams if reforms took place. Their
rarity is due to the unsatisfactory nature of available structures,
according to Ms Susie Hughes, director of the Esop Centre. Case-law Esops
are, in theory, open to challenge by the Inland Revenue. Problems with the
1989 Finance Act's Esop include its requirement that a majority of trustees
be non-director employees. The Esop Centre hopes the government will make
the statutory Esop more user-friendly.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (7): Financiers favour the
hands-on approach - How to stage a buy-out / Charles Batchelor offers
guidance on the once-in-a-career exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Attempting to buy your business at the same time as you are running the
company makes for a demanding and exhausting time. Managers who stage a
management buy-out can expect an apparently unending round of meetings and
presentations, as they attempt to convince financiers that they are worth
backing.
They may not even have the certainty that their employer is willing to sell
the business to its management. And, while they are preparing their own
offer, they may also be required to show other potential bidders round.
Since most managers only carry out one buy-out during their career,
everything will be new to them. Managers responsible for running small
divisions and subsidiaries may find themselves considering strategic and
financial problems which have previously been dealt with by head office.
Fortunately, as buy-outs have become a more accepted part of the commercial
world, there is no shortage of advisers who specialise in this area. But the
problem then arises of choosing the most suitable accountant, lawyer or
venture capitalist without running up large bills.
The first issue that has to be resolved is whether the business is up for
sale. Some group managements are opposed to buy-outs on principle - they
believe the buy-out team is in too privileged position in any negotiations.
It is not unknown for managers who suggest a buy-out to be told to clear
their desks.
Finding out if head office is ready to consider a sale can best be done by
making an anonymous approach through an accountant or other business
adviser. He, or she, should also be able to give an honest assessment of
whether the business is suitable for a buy-out.
Financiers tend to like stable businesses in traditional sectors, with
strongly positive cash flows to pay off the debt. They are less attracted to
high-technology businesses with uncertain prospects in rapidly changing
markets.
Advisers should be chosen for their experience in dealing with your type of
business. Some venture capitalists specialise in particular sectors, but
more commonly they differentiate themselves by the size of deal they back.
Some are only interested in the larger transactions of Pounds 10m value or
more. Others are quite happy to spend time on smaller deals. Increasingly,
on the larger deals, the venture capitalists have been taking a lead role,
putting a deal together and only then approaching management to take part.
It is important that the managers feel they can get on with their advisers
on a personal level, because they can expect to spend many hours in
meetings.
Professional advisers can act as a buffer between the managers and the
vendor during negotiations. Many managers find it difficult adopt a
dispassionate stance when dealing with the boss with whom they have worked
for many years. They feel uneasy about pointing out the weaknesses of a
business which they have been responsible for running.
A crucial document in the buy-out process is the business plan. Accountants
can help to draw these up, but it is no use presenting a plan which has come
out of someone else's computer. It must clearly be the work of the managers
themselves.
Many venture capitalists are deluged with business plans, so it is important
to keep it short and to the point. Over-elaborate plans, running into
hundreds of pages, are unlikely to be read. Venture capitalists complain of
business plans which calculate large numbers of future scenarios down to the
last decimal point, but which neglect to include essential information about
the business or the management team.
The plan should contain a short executive summary, probably no more than two
pages, and put the detailed financial calculations into separate appendices.
The body of the plan should describe the background and recent history of
the business; its products or services; and its markets and marketing
strategy. The quality of the managers and their ability to work together as
a team will be vital to the success of the buy-out, so detailed profiles of
the management will be needed. On the financial side, there should be
summaries of past and projected profit-and-loss accounts, balance sheets and
cash flows.
In terms of management, the venture capitalist will be looking for a strong
team leader with support from managers with a good mix of other skills.
Marketing, production and financial expertise will normally be required. If
anotherwise strong team lacks skills in a particular area, the venture
capitalist may well suggest bringing in an outsider to fill the gap.
The financiers will be looking for a management that can take a hands-on
approach to the problems, which are bound to arise once the business is
independent. Managers who have grown too used to the support services
provided by a large corporate headquarters may not do as well once they are
on their own. Managers can expect to be called on to tackle a broader range
of problems in a smaller, independent business.
Fund-raising involves a balancing act. The business must not be saddled with
an impossible burden of debt at the outset. At the same time, there must be
enough money to see the company through the early years without the need for
a refinancing. The banks have become more cautious in their approach to
buy-outs, and will not back plans requiring an unrealistic amount of debt.
Set against the total amounts which will be needed to finance a deal, the
sums provided by management appear small. Individual managers can typically
expect to be asked to provide between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 50,000 of
their own money. The point is that, for many managers, this represents a
considerable financial commitment. It is enough to motivate them to work
hard, but not too much so that they feel under excessive pressure.
Curious as it may seem, at the point when they are negotiating their
independence, managers need to be thinking about how they might dispose of
their business. Their financial backers will be looking for an 'exit',
either by means of a trade sale or a flotation, after a few years.
If the business does very well, the managers may be able to refinance the
deal and buy out their backers, thus retaining full control themselves. But
more likely outcomes are a stock market listing or a sale.
Managers must be prepared for the loss or limitation of their independence.
But set against this is the prospect of considerable personal wealth if the
business does well.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (8): Disposals lift turnaround
prospects - Case study, relaunched EuroDollar is number five in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In August, Mr Freddie Aldous finally bought the business he set up 20 years
ago. Mr Aldous, EuroDollar's 64-year-old chairman, led an 11-strong
management buy-out team, backed by Prudential Venture Managers, which
acquired the vehicle rental business from TSB.
He had set up the Swan National car-hire business in January 1973 for his
employer, UDT Industries, the credit finance company which was acquired by
TSB in 1981. Swan National was relaunched in 1989 as EuroDollar, to reflect
the company's growing international strategy, and now ranks as the fifth
largest vehicle rental company in the world.
The sale was the latest in a string of disposals by TSB, reflecting its
decision to concentrate on its core retail banking business. In July, TSB
sold Swan National Leasing, its vehicle contract hire business, to Forward
Trust, the leasing arm of Midland Bank for Pounds 182.5m, and the Swan
National car dealerships to Lex Services for Pounds 44m
In the case of EuroDollar, Prudential Venture Managers, the arm of the
Prudential which invests in unquoted companies, had been introduced to the
deal early this year by the corporate finance division of Touche Ross, which
was advising EuroDollar's management.
'We were competing against two other groups,' said Mr Martin Clarke, a
director of Prudential Venture managers which won the mandate in April after
putting forward a proposal under which EuroDollar's management would retain
a 40 per cent equity stake in the company.
Mr Clarke and the Prudential Venture Managers team spent the period between
April and August in protracted negotiations with TSB which was advised by SG
Warburg. 'We had a willing vendor, but what they were most concerned to do
was to get the deal and the price right,' explains Mr Clarke.
The complexity stemmed from the fact that, on paper at least, EuroDollar was
not a particularly attractive purchase. In its last half-year to March 31
1993, EuroDollar incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.9m, the result of a
deterioration in trading conditions in foreign subsidiaries in Italy and
France, part of the EuroDollar network in 27 countries, operating over
40,000 vehicles.
However the core EuroDollar UK business, which has 10 per cent of the UK
market and is the largest provider of rental cars to the corporate sector in
the UK, had continued to trade extremely profitably. Business clients
account for more than 70 per cent of its turnover, and it has a fleet of
12,000 cars and 1,000 vans, operated from some 106 branches across Britain.
Under the terms of the Pounds 118m buy-out deal, TSB received sale proceeds
of Pounds 59.9m, comprising cash of Pounds 22m for the net assets of
EuroDollar which amounted to Pounds 20.4m on March 31, and Pounds 37.9m in
respect of inter-company debt. The balance of Pounds 58.1m was used to repay
existing company's debts.
Financing facilities totalling Pounds 192m were negotiated and arranged by
Prudential Venture Managers, which holds a 20 per cent equity stake. The
other equity investors, sharing a 40 per cent stake, were Charterhouse
Development Capital, Electra Private Equity Partners and Morgan Grenfell
Development Capital.
Both Mr Clarke, of Prudential Venture Managers, and Mr Norman Murray, deputy
chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, have joined the
EuroDollar board.
In addition to the Pounds 61m in equity, which was used to finance the
acquisition, provide working capital and discharge the borrowings of the
foreign subsidiaries, Lombard North Central, Forward Trust, UDT and Gmac
(General Motors Acceptance Corporation) provided Pounds 100m of leasing
finance, and the National Westminster group provided Pounds 31m of bridging
loan finance, mainly to acquire vehicles from TSB which are being sold and
exchanged for leased vehicles enabling the bridging loan to be repaid.
As Mr Clarke notes, one particularly striking feature of the deal, which was
the biggest management buy-out in the 1993 third quarter, is that the
company has been unencumbered with conventional term debt from the outset.
Since the buy-out, the company has moved quickly to restructure its overseas
operations and has already sold both of its loss-making subsidiaries in
France an Italy. The new board is understood to have been particularly keen
to sell the Italian business, which it had thought might have to be closed -
at considerable expense and perhaps delay. In the event, Mr Clarke says
EuroDollar has made a cash contribution to the new owner's rationalisation
costs.
As a result, EuroDollar's turnaround prospects have been strengthened, and
an early market debut, perhaps within 12 to 24 months, seems likely.
EuroDollar's price tag could yet end up looking like a bargain.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (5): Sales are likely to rise
 -'Exits' remain hard to find
</HEADLINE>

A successful buy-out team seeking to raise new funds has had little choice
in recent years. Its only real option has been to sell out to a corporate
buyer, and face losing the independence which made the buy-out an attractive
idea in the first place.
But the past 12 months have seen a considerable change in investors'
attitudes, and the number of former buy-outs obtaining a stock market
listing has risen sharply. Buy-out companies accounted for one in five of
all new companies coming to the stock market in the first six months of
1993, the highest proportion ever.
Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research recorded 13
flotations of buy-out and buy-in companies in the first six months of 1993,
compared with 11 in the whole of 1992 and four in 1991.
The main reason for this change in sentiment has been the far more positive
view now taken of smaller company shares. Smaller companies performed poorly
in the depths of the recession, but are now expected to return to
above-average levels of growth.
This has meant that buy-out companies have been able to command attractive
price/earnings ratios, typically around 17 or 18, at listing.
At the same time, corporate buyers, which in recent years have been able to
pay highly to acquire buy-out companies, have withdrawn from the bidding.
Many have been devoting all of their energies to surviving the recession,
and have had little time to devote to acquisitions.
Welcome though this increase in the number of listings is, there is still a
long way to go before new-issue activity matches the levels attained in the
mid-1980s. In 1986, 37 buy-out/buy-in companies went to market, while in the
following year there were 35 listings.
And while failure rates among buy-outs have declined over the past year,
receivership remains the single most common form of 'exit'. No fewer than 41
buy-outs failed in the first six months of 1993, compared with 28 trade
sales and 13 flotations, according to the MBO research centre. Receivership
numbers began rising sharply in the late 1980s, to peak at 121 in 1991.
Despite the emphasis which venture capitalists place on finding an exit
opportunity, remarkably few buy-outs have achieved one over the past decade
or so. Even when receiverships and refinancings (second round buy-outs or
buy-ins) are included, only 23 per cent of the buy-outs completed between
1981 and 1991 obtained an exit. Ten per cent went to trade buyers, while 4.4
per cent were floated.
This indicates that a large 'rump' of buy-outs remain under the control of
the managers who acquired them. Many will be small buy-outs financed largely
by bank debt, where there is no great pressure to achieve an exit, or
companies where the managers own most of the equity. Others will have shown
a mediocre trading performance, and would not obtain an attractive price if
they were put up for sale.
Despite this surprising failure on the part of the buy-out industry to
achieve exits, there is likely to be increasing pressure over the next few
years. As many of the 10-year venture capital partnerships set up in the
early and mid-1980s come to the end of their lives, their managers will need
to realise their investments. This could lead to an increase in the sale of
businesses.
The growing trade in second-hand venture capital portfolios is likely to
speed up this trend. The manager who made the original investment, but now
sees it on his books at a lower valuation, will be reluctant to crystallise
his loss. If the portfolio is sold, the new manager can review each
investment more dispassionately and take a decision to sell when necessary.
Many of the companies which obtained a stock market listing in the late
1980s turned out to be too small to attract much investor interest. They
were neglected by analysts and market makers alike, and there was little
liquidity in their shares.
Some of the recent buy-out flotations have been of more substantial
businesses. Devro, a maker of sausage skins, was capitalised at Pounds 224m;
Holliday Chemical Holdings at Pounds 161m; and RJB Mining at Pounds 103m.
But a surprising number have still been small. Of 36 venture capital-backed
companies floated in the year ended June 1993 (half of them buy-outs), nine
were capitalised at less than Pounds 20m, while 11 were valued at between
Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m, according to the British Venture Capital
Association.
In contrast to the revival of investor interest in new issues, the London
Stock Exchange has announced plans to dismantle the Unlisted Securities
Market in 1996. The USM did well during the boom years of the late 1980s,
but more recently has suffered from a negative image.
On top of this, the loosening of regulations governing the main market has
reduced the need for a separate set of rules for the newer company.
Meanwhile, in continental Europe, many of the secondary markets set up in
imitation of the USM, have failed to establish viable trading volumes.
But although it is now easier to obtain a main market listing in London, the
venture capital industry and many City organisations are keen to maintain a
facility for listing the smaller company. They have put together an
organisation known as the City Group for Smaller Companies to lobby for
their interests.
The European Venture Capital Association, for its part, plans to put
proposals to the European Commission for a market for venture-backed
companies, though it is not yet clear whether this will be on a Europe-wide
basis or with a national focus.
The creation of an efficient market for trading in the shares of smaller
companies is vitally important for the venture capital industry. As part of
its efforts to reinforce the status of venture capital, it is currently
attempting to persuade the institutions to treat such investments as a
separate asset class. A successful record of achieving exits is vital if it
is to achieve this goal.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (6): Relief as the banks
return - Deal structures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the excesses of the late 1980s, the past few years have seen power in
the structuring of management buy-out deals shift back to the banks. They
have become much more cautious in their approach to buy-outs, and stipulate
more conservative lending ratios.
This insistence on proper cover for their loans has not prevented the banks
becoming slightly more willing to provide the funds that are needed. 'The
banks have come back into the market, and there is more debt available now
than there has been for the past three years,' commented Mr Graham Hutton, a
director of Morgan Grenfell.
This increase in liquidity is a relief to the venture capital industry,
which had begun to fear that shortages of loan finance would seriously limit
the profitability of deals. Unless the equity providers can gear up their
funds with loan finance, the returns become unattractive. Some venture
capitalists feared at one stage that deals were becoming 'under-geared'.
The banks will normally require an equity to debt ratio of 1:1 though some
are prepared to move to 1:1.5 on the more attractive deals. But contrast
this with the peak of the buy-out boom in 1989, when the banks were willing
to provide loans amounting to nearly six times the equity in a deal. These
times were unusual, however, and the figures were skewed by a small number
of very large deals.
The smaller deals, which account for most buy-out activity in terms of
numbers, have always been more conservatively structured. The two-tier
nature of the buy-out sector, and its impact on the way deals are done, is
revealed in recent research by Nottingham University's Centre for Management
Buy-Out Research.
Smaller deals, those valued at less than Pounds 10m, have seen a drop in the
amount of equity and mezzanine finance used, while the amount of debt has
remained steady. The gap left by the decline in equity and mezzanine has
been made up by increases in the amount of vendor loan notes and in the
contribution made by the management team. The amount of equity in these
smaller deals has fallen over the past two and a half years, from more than
40 per cent to just over 33 per cent, while the contribution of debt has
hovered around 40 per cent.
Vendors contributed nearly 11 per cent to the value of deals in the first
half of 1993, compared with around 7 per cent in the previous three years.
This was the highest share held by vendors since the buy-out centre,
established in 1986, began compiling these statistics.
The attraction to a vendor of retaining a stake in a buy-out company is that
it will benefit if the company does well. Vendors are concerned that they
will look foolish if a business which they have sold prospers, particularly
when the deal is done at a stage when the economy seems set for recovery
from a long recession. Vendor involvement can also boost the nominal value
of a deal, and make a sale appear more impressive to shareholders.
Managements, too, have been increasing their stake in the businesses they
buy. The average management contribution to smaller deals rose to 9.5 per
cent in the first half of 1993, from between 7 and 8 per cent in the
preceding three years.
Larger deals, those valued at more than Pounds 10m, have traditionally been
financed by larger amounts of debt, though the gap between debt and equity
has closed in the past two years. Equity accounted for less than a quarter
of total funding in large deals in 1991, but rose to around one-third in
1992 and early 1993.
The contribution of mezzanine and debt has held steady at about 6 per cent
and 45 per cent respectively. As deal prices have fallen to more realistic
levels there has been less need to bridge the gap between debt and equity
with large amounts of mezzanine finance. Involving an independent mezzanine
provider can also complicate a deal, so venture capitalists have sometimes
preferred to turn to the vendor if extra funds were needed. But this did not
stop the contribution by vendors to larger deals halving in the past two and
a half years, from 15 per cent in 1991 to 7.5 per cent in the first half of
1993. The management's contribution fell to just 1 per cent, the lowest
level for more than four years.
As the banks have become more experienced at financing buy-outs, so their
assessment methods have been refined. There has been a shift from judging
deals on balance-sheet ratios, which are not necessarily the most relevant
measure when a business is about to undergo radical change.
The banks now look more closely at projected cash flows and interest cover.
The recent drop in interest rates has meant that banks can now obtain
interest cover of 3:1 on buy-outs, a rate as good as they could obtain on
corporate credits. The decline in the use of mezzanine finance has had the
additional effect of boosting the security of senior debt.
The banks have also become less willing to leave due-diligence work to the
providers of equity capital, and are now more likely to commission their own
reviews of a company's finances and market prospects.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (4): Shared costs help L&amp;G to
win - Case study, the BP consumer products buy-in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the early hours of Wednesday, May 26, contracts were finally exchanged on
the sale of BP Nutrition's consumer products division to a management buy-in
team led by Legal &amp; General Ventures, in a deal worth Pounds 272m.
The transaction was significant, not only because of its size - it still
ranks as the biggest unquoted equity deal this year - but also because it
was one of the most fiercely contested with no fewer than four teams bidding
for the mandate.
BP put the whole of BP Nutrition, with annual sales of Pounds 2.9bn, on the
auction block early in 1992, as part of the drive to refocus on its core oil
and gas businesses and cut debt.
The consumer foods division was was sold to Sara Lee, the US group, at the
end of December. By that stage, the consumer products division, a leading
supplier of 'own label' household detergents, cleaners and personal care
products to European supermarkets, was also attracting considerable City
attention.
Consumer products includes Manchester-based Robert McBride in the UK, Yplon
in Belgium and Solaro in Italy. Its 12 factories employ more than 4,000
people and although profits have not been disclosed, its margins on turnover
of Pounds 350m last year are believed to be high.
'We started looking at consumer products way before the deal was done,' said
Mr Adrian Johnson, a director of Legal &amp; General Ventures, which put the
winning consortium together.
The Legal &amp; General Ventures-led consortium was one of four preferred
bidders, whose names were shortlisted by SG Warburg on behalf of BP at the
start of 1993 to enter the final round. The three others were led by
Phildrew Ventures and Citicorp Venture Capital; Electra, working with the
Canadian trade buyer, CCL; and Mercury Asset Management, with Montagu
Private Equity.
Over the next two months, all four bidders undertook due diligence while
negotiating with potential financial partners and puting together their
final teams.
As Mr Charles Peal, managing director of Legal &amp; General Ventures, points
out, one of the consequences of the competitive auction procedure was that
the unsuccessful bidders ran up 'seven-figure costs' conducting due
diligence. Mr Peal said Legal &amp; General Ventures limited its own downside
risk to Pounds 30,000 by sharing costs with its three other equity partners,
and by tying some of the fees to success of its bid.
When the sealed final bids were opened in early April, three of them,
including Legal &amp; General Ventures, are believed to have been around the
same level, with the fourth bid lagging some way behind.
But the Legal &amp; General Ventures team believe the unified structure of their
consortium, and the fact that they had already signed-up Mr Michael Handley,
the former divisional managing director of RHM, to become managing director
of the new company, gave them a decisive edge.
'Our transaction was a genuine management buy-in,' said Mr Peal, 'that gave
us a lot of credibility.' In addition, the consortium persuaded Sir Allen
Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, the food and
drinks group, to lead the buy-in team by becoming non-executive chairman of
off-the-shelf company formed to complete the purchase - Templeco Sixteen.
On April 6, the Legal &amp; General Ventures team were summoned back to BP
headquarters and told they had just a three-week exclusivity period to get
the funding for the deal in place, tie-up the the paperwork and agree the
sale.
Those weeks were extremely hectic for Mr Johnson and his Legal &amp; General
Venture colleagues, Paul Southwell and Ivan Heywood; and they were made
worse when, two days into the exclusivity period, the Bishopsgate bomb
demolished the offices of Norton Rose, the lead banks' solicitors, and the
offices of Phoneix Fund Managers, one of the equity partners.
BP, says Mr Johnson, was sympathetic, but did not formally extend the
deadline. Nevertheless the complex transaction - involving equity, bank and
mezzanine debt - eventually went ahead, albeit a little later than
originally planned.
The deal was structured as follows:
Equity: The bulk of the Pounds 115m in equity funding for the deal was
provided by Legal &amp; General Ventures (Pounds 50.5m) and its trans-Atlantic
partner, Lehman Brothers (Pounds 50.5m). The Pounds 14m balance came from
Phoenix Fund Managers, Ontario Teachers Pension Fund and Barclays
Development Capital. Legal &amp; General Venture subsequently sold Pounds 22m of
equity to one of the major UK venture capitalists. Following the deal,
management will also be invited to become shareholders with up to a 10 per
cent equity stake.
Bank Debt: A syndicate of four banks, led by the Bank of Scotland's
Edinburgh team (the Bank of Scotland's London team backed another of the
bidders), underwrote Pounds 115m of senior debt. The other main underwriters
were Bank of Tokyo, Barclays and Morgan Grenfell.
Mezzanine Debt: A further Pounds 30 of mezzanine financing was provided by
Mithras, an investment trust managed by Legal &amp; General Ventures, and
co-underwritten by Intermediate Capital Group.
In addition, the banking syndicate provided Pounds 12m of working capital.
Since completing the buy-in, the Legal &amp; General Ventures team has provided
much of the senior management at the new company, with Mr Ivan Heywood
acting as locum finance director until the arrival of Mr Terry Monks from MB
Caradon.
Now, the prime objective is to build the business from its current base in
order to float it on the stock exchange in about three years.
The BP consumer products buy-in has also generated some controversy. Some
critics maintain that it demonstrates that the dearth of big quality deals
is forcing financial buyers into unhealthy competitive auctions, pushing
target prices up while increasing investor risks and reducing returns.
However, Charles Peal, of Legal &amp; General Ventures, thinks the deal was
one-of-a-kind. 'We had been through a period when a lot of the competition
had not done a large deal for a long time,' he said. Although he believes
some buy-in/out opportunities will generate competing bids, he thinks most
market players would think twice now before entering another four-way
bid-battle.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (3): A change of strategy at
3i - Buy-ins have declined, but Bimbos continue to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the pure management buy-in becoming extinct? It has fallen out of favour
over the last couple of years, after research and performance reviews showed
that it tends to be outperformed by buy-in/management buy-outs (Bimbos).
A review of the performance of 154 buy-ins was conducted by 3i in early
1991. 'If the person buying in was involving the management, they were
usually better informed about the business,' says Mr Patrick Dunne, head of
3i's buy-in programme. 'They usually got on better, because they were
involving the management within in their plans,' he adds.
Buy-in strategy at 3i has altered accordingly. While still placing
substantial emphasis on buy-ins - it backed 15 of the 38 deals in this
year's first half - the focus has shifted. Two and a half years ago, around
20 per cent of the buy-ins it backed were Bimbos. The figure has since grown
to between 65 and 70 per cent.
Pure MBIs remain as a third of deals. According to Mr Dunne, they can be
lucrative. 'You still have situations where a talented md will go into a
business and move it forward, take a fresh view and re-energise it,' he
says. A common misconception is that most buy-ins are turn-arounds. 'They're
mostly people buying into companies which are doing all right, but could do
a lot better.'
In August, for example, a pure buy-in team acquired Unimerchants, a Pounds
16m-turnover importer and distributor of Mediterranean food. 'It was a
profitable business, but it was not as well managed as it would be, in our
view, by ourselves,' says Mr John Durban, leader of the three-man team. He
thinks that former parent Albert Fisher Group could not give it the
attention it needed. The team is concentrating on rapidly-growing niche
markets, notably high-quality imported pasta and olive oil products.
A strong record is usually needed to attract backing for an MBI. Mr Durban
has already run two sizeable food businesses: Procter &amp; Gamble's European
food processing, catering and bakery division, as well as Pounds 200m-plus
turnover edible oils company Acatos &amp; Hutcheson.
No equity was allocated to the incumbent management. Albert Fisher Group's
policy is not to encourage its managers to participate in buy-outs. Mr
Durban says equity participating might be possible for some of the incumbent
team later on.
Institutions and advisers can be more cautious when a team lacks hands-on
experience of the company. The Unimerchants MBI took almost a year to
arrange, and was probably more protracted than an equivalent MBO.
A classic problem with many buy-ins is the discovery after acquisition of
skeletons in the company closet. The Unimerchants team found dinosaurs.
'They seemed to think it would be a wonderful idea to introduce a pasta in
dinosaur shapes,' explains Mr Durban. Fortunately, the surplus stock does
not present a great problem.
The pace of buy-ins for much of this year has been slower than in 1992, with
only 38 deals in the first half, against 134 for the whole of last year,
according to Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research
(CMBOR).
The value of deals struck appears to be holding up well, with transactions
worth Pounds 397m in the first half, against last year's final total of
Pounds 679m. However, when this year's monster Pounds 250m buy-in deal of BP
Nutrition's consumer products division (see below) is stripped out, the
adjusted first-half total of Pounds 147m is much less promising. According
to CMBOR, divestments declined to 19.5 per cent of deals in the first half,
while buy-ins from receiverships grew to 19.4 per cent of transactions.
Mr Dunne says a lack of confidence in the economy held bidders and vendors
back in the early part of the year; but now the situation is looking more
promising: he has noticed a pick up since September.
Family-owned businesses remain a key source of buy-in deals. Their
proportion of total deal value fluctuates from year to year, but, according
to CMBOR's statistics, they have yielded a steady 44 to 52 per cent of deals
over the 4 1/2 years to the end of June.
Buy-ins of family companies often arise due to succession problems. Mr Nick
Theakston, a partner in KPMG Corporate Finance, thinks a Bimbo bringing in
new top management to graft on to existing non-family senior management can
be a good solution. However, he highlights a difficulty with these deals:
'Family businesses have a huge amount of emotion involved in them.'
His latest big family deal came earlier this year, when he advised on a
Pounds 21m Bimbo of Maiden Outdoor Advertising. Mr Ian Maiden relinquished
his post as chairman of the Liverpool-based company after 39 years. The
buy-in team was assembled and led by Mr Ron Zeghibe, fresh from putting
together a turn-around of Dutch advertising company Mediamax.
The Bimbo involved four of the existing management as well as three
outsiders. Luckily, there was no family strife. 'Ian Maiden was extremely
level-headed and sensible about it,' says Mr Theakston.
Around 200 would-be buyers-in are registered on 3i's MBI programme, and
roughly half the deals it backs draw on the pool. Talent-spotting has been
easier recently. 'If you're running and performing well in a recession, then
you're probably going to do even better in a good time,' says Mr Dunne. As
well as training potential buyers-in, the programme helps 3i to get their
measure. 'We seem to do a lot better when we back people we know,' he says.
The Bimbo is no longer the leading-edge buy-in. According to Mr Dunne, 3i is
now placing a lot of emphasis on the 'Chimbo' - a variant of the Bimbo, in
which investing chairmen buy companies in tandem with the existing
management team. The chairmen bring the benefit of experience to bear, on a
part-tine basis.
As well as chairmen from its buy-in pool, 3i can draw on its tranche of 300
independent directors. 'Those people have been particularly powerful with
younger companies, and we see a future for the angel that not only adds some
money but also adds talent,' says Mr Dunne.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (2): A shortage of capital may
compel smaller funds to merge / Examining the factors that divide
participants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Venture capital institutions have enjoyed the best of times and the
worst of times in the management buy-out market over the past year.
Not since the boom period in the mid 1980s have so many of their investments
provided them with an exit, either through a trade sale or flotation.
On the other hand, MBO funds are seeing fewer financeable deals, and a
number of funds are struggling to raise fresh capital. Without fresh
capital, some of those funds that are not 'captives' - financed by pension
fund or bank parents - are likely to have to consider merging, leaving the
MBO market served by fewer, possibly stronger, venture funds.
So which institutions have fared best in the MBO industry? And which
financiers will lead the field over the next few years?
Increasingly, MBO financiers are splitting into those groups that are
prepared and able to finance large deals, and those that are not. The
industry broadly defines 'large' as deals requiring more than about Pounds
10m of equity, for companies capitalised at Pounds 35m or more - although
many of these larger funds would also look at smaller deals.
Any list of the big hitting deal arrangers in the last three years would
include Candover Investments, CINVen, Charterhouse Development Capital,
Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, CVC, Electra and Prudential Venture
Managers.
It was CINVen that led the only really large deal of recent years - the
buy-out of Gardner Merchant from Forte, in 1992, for Pounds 400m. A relative
newcomer to the big time, Legal &amp; General, led this year's second largest
deal, the Pounds 272m purchase of the consumer products division of BP.
The second tier - as measured by a preferred deal size around Pounds 10m -
is dominated by 3i, the UK's largest investment capital institution,
although the institution has been taking a larger share of deals of up to
Pounds 50m.
'We have taken more of those deals in the last three years, because we have
done a lot more through our regional network, which we think has given us a
competitive advantage,' says Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i chief executive.
With 18 offices around the UK, the only competitor who comes anywhere near
in terms of regional representation is NatWest Ventures. In fact, like 3i,
NatWest Ventures is increasingly interested in the larger deals, and led as
many deals as Electra in the past year, according to KPMG.
The other big hitters in the second tier include Schroder Ventures,
Kleinwort Benson, Midland Private Equity, Murray Johnstone, Phildrew
Ventures, Apax, ECI Ventures, and Barclays.
In terms of numbers, however, 3i stands way out in front at the smaller end
of the market. According to KPMG Peat Marwick Corporate Finance, 3i, since
1981, has led more than twice as many deals as its nearest rival, Candover.
The average size of these deals, however, is less than half those led by
Candover and a third those led by CINVen.
A similar pattern emerges in the growing management buy-in market. The
institution maintains a list of 150 managers who are prepared to invest and
take executive management positions in companies. From a standing start, 3i
did 70 MBIs last year, and has about 40 per cent of the market.
Many of these institutions in both tiers of the market, other than captive
funds like CINVen, are actively seeking funds. Over the next six months, the
funds are likely to reveal the extent to which they have succeeded.
Estimates vary, but somewhere between 30 and 40 venture capital groups
appear to be trying to raise new funds. Some industry observers say the
funds are seeking about Pounds 1bn of new money. Typically, the funds are
turning to large US pension funds and insurance companies, which are
identified as having an appetite for some exposure to the unquoted UK
investment.
Not all are going to be successful, and some consolidation is likely within
the industry with increasing specialisation, according to Mr Iain Tulloch,
of Murray Johnstone.
Some of the smaller funds will not have done as well as their larger
counterparts, and may have difficulty attracting capital to a new fund. With
the fees that arise from running a fund, they may need to seek a merger.
TSB Group has already showed that it no longer gives MBOs high priority, by
its decision to put Hill Samuel Development Capital up for sale.
Then there are the banks which provide the debt, without which few
management buy-outs would get off the ground. Mr Chris Beresford, partner at
KPMG Peat Marwick Corporate Finance, says National Westminster and the Bank
of Scotland lead the field, ahead of Midland and Barclays. 'These four have
carried the market through since 1990,' he says. 'The rest have been almost
nowhere.'
Citibank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Westpac were among those
that appeared to leave the market in 1990, after the last bout of excesses.
Some MBO industry observers say the banks are displaying a renewed interest,
in particular for the larger deals, and that some are showing signs of
returning to the market. The Royal Bank of Scotland has signalled its
intentions very clearly by luring Leith Robertson, one of the Bank of
Scotland's senior management buy-out specialists, to become its corporate
director in charge of MBOs and acquisition finance.
If the banks are showing greater interest in lending and new entrants may be
about to compete with the big four, the chances are that gearing levels are
likely to rise.
In the late 1980s flurry of MBO financings, gearing rose sharply with a
commensurate increase in risk. With the onset of recession, the amount of
available debt and bank willingness to lend shrank markedly.
That appears to be changing. 'Equity within deal structures is reducing,
with equity now being 40-50 per cent, compared with more than 60 per cent
two years ago,' says Mr Barrie Moore, of NatWest Ventures.
This is a clear sign of renewed confidence, both in the economy and in the
profitability of MBOs. But many voices continue to warn against deal
structures which load unacceptable levels of debt on to managements, on the
assumption that interest rates will remain low. If history repeats itself,
they will not.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (1): Vendors put the price up
 -The stock market's rise has offered investors an attractive exit route,
but created a dilemma for providers of capital.  Divisions of large
companies are being floated at p/e ratios above the levels that venture
capital backers will pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Almost every month, the stock market demonstrates the attractions of
management buy-outs to the managers involved.
Devro, Holliday Chemicals and Inveresk, which floated this year, all showed
dramatic increases in value for investors. To varying degrees, they provide
role models for future buy-outs, demonstrating the rewards that can be
reaped when managements are freed from the constraints imposed by a parent
company.
The failure rate has also been greatly reduced, suggesting that the risks
involved are falling. Successful exits of MBOs through flotations or trade
sales - the common goal for funders and the liberated management - rose to
24 in the first nine months of the year, compared with 15 during the whole
of 1992.
From the venture capital industry's point of view, there have also been rich
pickings. Some 48 per cent of the 75 commercial company flotations in the 12
months to June, were funded by venture capital, according to the British
Venture Capital Association.
But the UK stock market's rise this year, while providing a more attractive
exit route for investors, has also placed the providers of MBO capital in a
difficult spot. In the first place, there has been a fall in the number of
management buy-out deals that venture capitalists are prepared to fund. As
mergers and acquisitions activity has declined, so has the supply of
potential MBOs that corporate takeovers tend to generate.
While in 1992 there were 520 MBOs, worth Pounds 3.04bn, the year to November
1993 has seen only 390 with a deal value of Pounds 2.19bn, according to
KPMG. The largest, the Pounds 250m buy-out of BP's consumer products
division, was a minnow beside the Pounds 2.4bn Gateway deal in 1989, and
considerably smaller than last year's largest deal, the Pounds 400m purchase
of Gardner Merchant, the catering group.
What is more, companies wanting to sell a division to raise cash or to
pursue the new Holy Grail - concentration on core businesses - have found
that they have direct access to the stock market. Divisions of large
companies are being successfully floated at p/e ratios significantly higher
than the levels that venture capital backers are currently prepared to pay.
Vendors are also becoming more demanding, having seen large increases in the
values of companies, often in a relatively short time between MBO and
flotation. Some of this increase in value has undoubtedly resulted from an
increase in management effort and motivation that direct control inspires.
But some of the teams that led recent MBOs were fortunate to be working for
companies primarily interested in refocusing their activities. If it meant
selling a division to an MBO just as it was on the point of recovering, that
was of secondary importance.
That has now changed, and vendors are holding out for higher prices. There
are fewer distress sales of divisions to MBO teams, and with the pressure
off, some vendors are increasingly getting venture capital suppliers to
tender for the opportunity to back the MBO team. The most extreme example
was the BP deal, where four venture capitalists competed in a beauty
contest.
The second issue facing the venture capital industry is its own funding.
Venture capital providers have made a concerted drive this year to raise new
funds from their own investors. More than Pounds 1bn is probably being
sought. All the signs suggest some of the 30 or so institutions raising
funds will either not succeed or will raise less than they had targeted. As
a result, the market is awash with talk of a shake-out in the industry
leading to a concentration of the available funds in fewer hands.
Mr Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital,
which expects to raise in excess of Pounds 200m for a new fund, says
casualties are inevitable. 'I think there are winners and losers - there
will be fewer players and smaller funds than hitherto,' he says.
News of the death of smaller venture funds has been exaggerated before. But
this time around, the fund-raising will be tough. Back in 1989, a record
year for fund-raising, the industry had just enjoyed a wave of MBO exits,
first through flotations and then with trade sales. Many venture capital
funds boasted impressive internal rates of return to support their marketing
efforts. Institutions fell over themselves to invest - at precisely the
wrong time in the business cycle, it turned out - and in 1989 alone the
industry raised Pounds 1.6bn, some Pounds 956m for buy-outs, according to
the University of Nottingham Centre for Management Buy-Out Research.
With some notable exceptions, the recent record of certain funds has been
less impressive. Some of the earlier investments after the 1989 fund-raising
were disastrous, while many of the more recent successful buy-outs have yet
to exit.
Furthermore, the stock market offers stiff competition. Institutional
investors, now having to decide whether to lock up funds in an illiquid
venture fund, will be comparing the excellent returns they have recently
enjoyed from highly liquid listed investments.
Venture fund raisers accept that they are marketing in a more competitive
environment, but argue that the current stock market returns may not
persist. And for many of the larger funds, the returns are likely to
continue improving as the number of MBOs which are floated or sold,
increases over the next 18 months. They are also optimistic about a new
source of funding - the US.
'A number of the US state pension funds are beginning to look at
international investing,' says Stephen Curran, chief executive of Candover
which is currently raising at least Pounds 200m. Some of these US groups are
beginning to see the attraction of placing small percentages of their
enormous funds in 'alternative assets,' Mr Curran says. The UK unquoted
sector is particularly attractive. Candover expects to raise about half of
its fund in the US - up from the one third it raised from American
institutions for its 1989 fund - and recently secured a Dollars 30m
commitment from Calpers, the Californian pension fund.
If the venture funds are spreading their net wider to raise funds, they will
also have to seek deals more actively once they have completed the
time-consuming fund-raising round. Some observers suggest that new deal
structures will emerge.
One approach, increasingly favoured by 3i, but likely to gain greater
currency, is the Bimbo - the buy-in and management buy-out, where internal
management expertise is married with a team brought in by the MBO funder.
There may also be a return to higher ratios of debt-to -equity financing in
buy-outs, as the economy recovers and financiers become prepared to take
more risks. No one foresees a return to the dizzy levels of the US-style
leveraged buy-outs of the late 1980s, which were, in any case, rarely
attained in the UK, but having fallen to a ratio of a little over one to
one, there is room for gearing to rise.
'The UK economy is moving in the right direction, so it is a safer time to
put on gearing than at any time in the last three years,' says Mr Hugh
Mumford, at Electra.
A modest increase in the financial risk of MBOs would be acceptable,
particularly as the business risk appears to have fallen quite sharply. The
first nine months of this year saw a dramatic fall in MBO failures to just
three, from nine in 1992, according to KPMG.
This may reflect the recent more conservative approach to pricing and
gearing. But as the economy emerges from recession and it becomes easier to
predict business performance, the funders of MBOs may have to accept lower
returns or risk becoming uncompetitive.

FT  08 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conglomerate Hanson was actively traded following exceptionally heavy
turnover in the US and some technical position taking in UK traded options.
In New York on Monday night the equivalent of 150m shares were traded,
followed by a further 75m during the first half of yesterday's trading
session. Dealers said US investors were 'dividend rolling' - stripping out
the dividend following the group's disappointing results at the end of last
week.
Since the figures, the shares have come back around 25p from their all-time
high. Many investors considered that at their reduced level they offered
value, and in London yesterday one house carried out a bullish trade in the
options market where the equivalent of 6m shares changed hands. As a result
of all this frenetic activity the stock rallied from a low of 257p to close
1 1/2 off at 260 1/2 p with 15m shares dealt.
Bearish speculation in Signet Group, formerly Ratners, saw the shares
retreat, although they managed a slight recovery to close 2 off at 20p. The
shares have now declined 33 per cent in the past month as talk of poor sales
at the group's three core jewellery chains - Ratners, Ernest Jones and H.
Samuel - has been heard in the market.
Some stores specialists estimate pre-Christmas sales could be down by as
much as a fifth, and yesterday there was talk the company could bring
forward a widely expected rationalisation programme. This is believed to
focus particularly heavily on the Ratners chain, with some 40 stores facing
possible closure. There have also been persistent rumours in recent sessions
of the imminent sale of Ernest Jones.
Bank shares continued to race ahead with another burst of institutional
buying interest, triggered by ever-increasing hopes of above average
dividend rises in the sector. And there were suggestions that the recent
blaze of buying activity in the banks, which has caught many of the leading
marketmakers short of stock, may well prompt a widening of dealing spreads
in the sector.
Abbey National climbed 15 to a record 460p, with worries about shrinking
margins, after the bank lowered its mortgage rate, said to have been
dissipated. Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to have led a surge of buying in
the stock after a lunch with senior Abbey officials. Royal Bank of Scotland
advanced to another all-time high of 448p before closing a net 7 ahead at
446p, as did Lloyds, up 8 at 646p.
The interim profits upsurge and doubled dividend from trading house Smith
New Court came as no surprise to the stock market, where Smith shares,
trading at a lowly 77 1/2 p as recently as September 1992, fell back from a
record 423p to close a net 11 off at 411p.
Food retailers again faced another difficult session in the wake of further
broker caution. After several weeks of downgrades following analysts concern
over the supermarket price war, renewed fears over profitability were
sparked last week by Argyll's decision to make property provisions in its
results. Yesterday, Cazenove, which has a policy of refusing to comment to
the press, was said to have lopped some Pounds 110m - or 18 per cent - from
its Tesco profits forecast for the current year to Pounds 500m.
Around Pounds 70m of the downgrade was said to be property provisions,
although other brokers were sceptical over the Cazenove figure. One said:
'The Pounds 70m has just been plucked from the air', pointing out that if
Tesco adopts the same criteria as Argyll, profits due to property provisions
will fall around Pounds 32m. However, shares continued to be undermined by
the issue. Tesco lost 3 at 195p, J. Sainsbury 9 at 408p and Argyll a penny
at 257 1/2 p.
Pharmaceuticals group Medeva fell 7 to 132p as weakness in the sector was
compounded by a downgrade from UBS. The house moved from 'speculative buy'
to 'hold' and reduced its 1993 forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 40m.
The sector leaders suffered from profit-taking said to have been prompted by
a technical trade in the derivatives market. Glaxo lost 12 to 683p and
Wellcome slid 22 to 666p. Falls from Zeneca and SmithKline Beecham were
limited by support from Goldman Sachs and Kleinwort Benson respectively.
Zeneca slipped 7 to 790p and SmithKline 3 to 393p.
British Aerospace declined 6 to 409p after talks to sell its Ballast Nedam
unit broke down. A price tag of Pounds 170m had been mooted.
Profit-taking took the shine off good results from Siebe, the shares
weakening 20 to 566p. Strauss Turnbull has pencilled in full-year profits of
Pounds 220m.
NFC trailed off 6 1/2 to 234p ahead of results and an expected Pounds 200m
rights issue today.
Chemicals group Allied Colloids dropped 10 to 228p after reporting lower
interim profits. Hoare Govett cut its forecast to Pounds 42m from Pounds 48m
and said the shares were now overvalued.
Reports that Thorn EMI had been in takeover talks with Paramount, of the US,
in November last year lifted the shares 9 to 989p.

FT  08 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend increases lift Recs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bumper interim dividend from Midlands Electricity saw the company's shares
outpace the rest of a regional electricity sector - itself the best
performing area of the market yesterday - which has attracted heavy buying
interest since the November 30 Budget.
Midlands' 20.5 per cent dividend increase saw the company nudge its way to
the forefront of the Recs' interim 'dividend race', previously headed by
Eastern Electricity, which boosted its interim by 20 per cent last week.
Many analysts had expected Midlands' payment to top the 7p mark but the
actual figure of 7.85p took even the market optimists by surprise.
Midlands' shares touched a record 677p at one point before edging off the
top to close a net 22 higher at 675p. It was pointed out, however, that the
increase in Midlands' interim was an attempt to equalise the interim and
final dividends, similarly to Eastern's move. Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities
analyst at Hoare Govett, said Eastern's move would lead to an annual
dividend rise in the region of 14.6 per cent and Midlands' to an increase of
14.8 per cent. Hoare forecast similar moves by Southern, Seeboard and
London.
South Wales Electricity, which announced its interims yesterday, was totally
overshadowed by Midlands' dividend performance, the shares easing to 699p in
spite of lifting its payment by 14 per cent.
East Midland, up 7 at 616p after 623p, is due to report this morning with a
dividend increase of at least 12 per cent said to be on the cards. Seeboard,
12 higher at 695p, reports tomorrow. Northern Ireland Electricity forged
ahead a further 15 to a closing peak of 241p.

FT  08 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The futures market was enlivened just before the official close by talk of a
tussle between two securities houses surrounding expiry of a large
tailor-made option, writes Peter John.
Dealers said that an OTC - an option contract containing details drawn up
specifically for one client - expired just before the official close of
Footsie futures and options dealing at 4.10pm.
Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull were pinpointed as the
two houses most closely involved, although both houses denied any knowledge.
The expiry was also said to have been behind weakness in the leading health
and household stocks - Glaxo, Wellcome and Zeneca.
In any event, it provided a flurry of interest in an otherwise quiet day
which began with a narrowing of the premium between the FT-SE 100 Index and
the Footsie Futures contract which expires in December.
Concern that talks on the Gatt world trade agreement were not going as well
as previously hoped gave an opportunity for some arbitrageurs to sell the
December contract.
Then, late in the day, heavy buying in the underlying cash market saw the
premium end the day at only 8 points, a return to more manageable levels.
December closed at 3246.5 on turnover of 9,924 lots.
Turnover of only 29,697 traded options was enlivened by hefty volume of
6,284 contracts in Hanson. One house bought Hanson calls and sold puts, a
bullish stance which takes the view that the underlying shares have fallen
as far as they are likely to following disappointing figures at the end of
last week.

FT  08 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record levels maintained after strong
recovery - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-takers were successfully resisted on the UK stock market yesterday in
a more active trading session. Marked selling pressure early in the day took
the FT-SE 100 Index down nearly 18 points, but traders were caught out by
the strength of a rally which left the index unchanged at the peak of
3,237.3 reached on Monday. The rally across the wider range of stocks took
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up 2.2 to a new high of 3,568.
No new factors appeared to influence the stock market; sterling and UK bonds
eased slightly, although both closed in London above the day's lows. But
confidence that UK base rates will be reduced in the new year remained
undimmed.
The late rally, which took the Footsie briefly into positive territory, was
complicated by a clash in the derivatives markets, where a US securities
house unravelled an off-market package written for a single client. The
resulting turmoil in equities caused some confusion among the blue chips and
boosted the day's Seaq volume total to 686.4m shares from the previous
session's 601.9m. On Monday, retail volume was worth Pounds 1.2bn.
Stock Exchange statistics confirmed that November was a very successful
trading month for the London-based securities firms. UK equities worth
Pounds 52.6bn were traded in what now proves to have been the busiest month
since July 1987, just before the market crash of October that year.
The stock market stood up well yesterday to a shrinking of the premium on
the December contract on the Footsie. The futures premium has been a
significant driving factor behind equities since just before Budget Day.
Traders were not disturbed by yesterday's reduction in the premium, which is
normal as the contract approaches expiry.
Another cut in mortgage rates by a leading home lending group kept interest
rate optimists on the alert. Bank stocks, which have benefited very strongly
from the view that rate cuts will work wonders for their unperforming loans,
attracted renewed buying in the second half of the session. Store shares,
however, shed a few pence in what was little more than a profit-taking
pause. Sector analysts are now looking for signs of the consumer spending
pattern in the months leading up to Christmas.
Most share sectors moved narrowly around overnight levels, with the
electricity utilities outstanding following dividend statements. But
profit-taking among the consumer stocks, which have advanced strongly since
the Budget offered relief from fears of adverse tax moves, brought
widespread falls. Publishing shares, which have outperformed over the past
week, also came in for profit-taking pressure.
Equity strategists continued to express satisfaction with the outlook for UK
stocks, although some turned their attention overseas. Strength overnight in
the Hong Kong market helped some London shares, but there were further
worries over Tokyo. London-based securities firms take differing views on
the Japanese market. Some still see weakness there as a potential threat to
global investors.
However, NatWest Markets has upgraded its weighting recommendation on
Japanese equities from underweight to neutral, arguing that prospects of
cuts in both income tax and the discount rate should raise recovery hopes.
Goldman Sachs takes a similar line, although cautious on 'uncertainty about
economic recovery'.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shrugs off hint of tight
monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks nudged into record territory yesterday, shrugging off comments by
the Federal Reserve vice-chairman which were interpreted as a signal of an
early tightening of monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.67 firmer at 3,718.88, surpassing
the previous all-time closing high of 3,710.77 set on November 16. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 0.33 to 466.76, while the American SE
composite put on 1.58 at 467.40 but the Nasdaq composite shed 1.74 to
769.35. NYSE volume came to 285.7m shares.
Equities opened broadly higher, building on a week of steady, if
unimpressive, gains which reflected a stream of good economic news last
week. The market briefly stumbled during mid-morning after Mr David Mullins,
the Fed vice-chairman, said 'vigilance' was required in view of the
economy's strong growth in the fourth quarter. He added that the Fed could
not afford to wait until clear signs of inflation emerged before moving to
raise short-term interest rates.
His remarks were interpreted by analysts as a signal that the Fed may act
sooner, rather than later, possibly as early as the first quarter of next
year.
The negative impact on the US Treasury market was discernible but not
devastating. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was 3/16
off at 101 1/32 , with the yield shading higher to 6.162 per cent.
A firming trend in crude oil futures, which tumbled to five-year lows late
on Monday, failed to lift most of the petroleum-related issues. Texaco
gained Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 62 7/8 , but Mobil was down Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 75 1/4 . Exxon was unchanged at Dollars 62 5/8 .
Transportation issues, which often decline on higher crude oil prices, were
mixed. Investors took in their stride an announcement by American Airlines
that the recent strike by flight attendants would reduce after-tax earnings
by Dollars 160m. The stock rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 1/2 . Boeing
advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 41 after Salomon Brothers lifted its
rating on the shares to 'buy' from 'hold'.
Wall Street was well pleased with RJR Nabisco's announcement of a big
restructuring programme, pushing the stock up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 5/8
.
Retailing issues were mostly easier after the Johnson Redbook Service said
sales had dipped last week from the previous seven days. Sears bucked the
trend, rising Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Pairgain Technologies surged Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars
13 1/8 on the heels of an upgrading by Olde Discount.
Canada
Toronto finished higher in active trading, boosted by strong gains among
mining and transportation stocks.
The TSE 300 index rose 29.5 to 4,265.5 and advances led declines by 434 to
384 after volume of 75.1m shares. The mining and transportation group
indices climbed 4.11 and 2.33 per cent respectively.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo edges higher as
region sets records
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors were hesitant to sell shares against heightening prospects of a
further decline in interest rates, and the Nikkei average, which dropped 3.5
per cent on Monday, closed marginally higher on short-covering, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index regained 63.11 at 16,903.49. The Topix index of all
first section stocks, which fell 46.25 on Monday, picked up 6.75 to
1,420.61.
Traders said renewed hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate
kept investors from further selling. Hopes of monetary easing by the Bank of
Japan pushed down bond yields, and the No 157 10-year benchmark fell to a
low for the year of 3.145 per cent, although it closed unchanged on the day
at 3.165 per cent.
After declining to a day's low of 16,791.28 in the morning session, the
Nikkei gained ground on speculation of lower interest rates. The index fell
briefly on profit-taking, but was supported later by small-lot buying by
investment trust funds and foreign brokers which took it to a high of
17,128.81 in the afternoon.
Volume remained flat at 220m shares. Declines outscored advances by 536 to
455, with 156 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.39
to 1,157.61.
Professionals were absorbed with the domestic political situation and the
government's economic stimulus package. Some investors feared that the
government's likely decision to partially open Japan's rice market ahead of
the deadline of the Uruguay Round of multilateral talks might expose the
strains within the seven-party coalition, further delaying implementation of
the fiscal stimulus.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, indicated yesterday that he was
ready to accept a compromise agreement on rice, while members of the
Socialist party, staunchly opposed to the lifting of the rice ban,
reiterated threats to leave the coalition.
Foreign buying supported blue chip exporters. Matsushita Electric Industrial
put on Y20 at Y1,430 and Toshiba Y5 at Y646, while Toyota Motor advanced Y40
to Y1,750.
Daiichi Pharmaceutical recovered Y30 to Y1,420 and Yakult Honsha by Y50 to
Y2,267 after Daiichi denied reports that clinical tests of their new
anti-cancer drug had side effects that led to a high death rate in patients.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y9,000 and East Japan Railway gained
Y11,000 at Y422,000, both rising for the first time in three trading days.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 10.91 to 18,705.79 in volume of 16.6m
shares.
Roundup
Tokyo's improvement helped some of the Pacific Basin markets to climb to
peak levels.
HONG KONG spent the day in record territory but prices turned back from
their best levels when the Hang Seng index neared 10,000 as investors
remembered the political uncertainties that cloud future prospects.
The Hang Seng still finished 126.88, or 1.3 per cent, ahead at 9,736.57
after an intraday peak of 9,937.36. The previous record close of 9,733.34
was established on November 15.
BANGKOK surged 4.7 per cent to a record close as foreign institutions
returned to buy shares before local mutual fund purchases push prices
further ahead. The SET index strengthened 65.15 to 1,442.56, surpassing its
previous peak of 1,380.84 set on November 12.
KUALA LUMPUR posted its sixth consecutive all-time closing high, the
composite index adding 22.14, or 2.1 per cent, at 1,063.25, on the back of
strong speculative and institutional buying.
Volume was 940.6m shares, the largest since the record 1.04bn of April 15,
and compared with Monday's 901.8m.
SINGAPORE found cause for optimism in the outlook for improved corporate
earnings, and the Straits Times Industrial index added 16.00 to close at a
record 2,163.54.
Malaysian speculative shares traded over the counter continued to dominate
trading and led the 20 top actives.
MANILA was supported by the rebound in other regional markets and growing
optimism about the economy. The composite index jumped 75 to 2,509, well
eclipsing the previous high of 2,467 registered on November 3.
BOMBAY saw a resumption of buying by local investors and foreign funds after
the cumulative 143-point fall of the previous three sessions. The BSE
30-share index finished 81.91, or 2.6 per cent, higher at 3,231.71.
SEOUL saw a mild, across-the-board consolidation following three days of
gains, which left the composite index 3.32 lower at 823.17. Institutional
profit-taking focused on blue chips, although individual investors continued
to seek out low-price bargains.
AUSTRALIA was helped ahead by the strength of the resources sector, on hopes
of a recovery in commodity prices, and the All Ordinaries index climbed 20.2
to 2,073.9.
TAIWAN's weighted index ended 24.57 down at 4,683.60, off a day's high of
4,739.87.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses feel the need for
consolidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were inhibited by the need for consolidation yesterday, although
Milan and Stockholm managed to move firmly ahead, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT eased on the official session but rose in the afternoon, when the
Ibis indicated DAX index ended at 2,127.38 after easing 3.34 to 2,115.46
earlier. Turnover slipped from DM8.8bn to DM7.6bn.
Chart and technical buying were offered as reasons why Commerzbank put on
DM5.80 to DM382.80, and climbed further to DM390.50 in the London afternoon,
and why BMW rose DM9 to DM644.
Elsewhere, professionals looked for special situations, and found them in
AEG, up another DM5.50 to DM185.90 on structural reorganisation talk ahead
of today's supervisory board meeting, and in Escada, the garment company,
DM28.50 better at DM299 on a lower than expected 1992-93 loss, a return to
the preference dividend list and a forecast return to profit in the current
year.
MILAN overcame mid-session profit-taking and the Comit index added 9.31 or
1.7 per cent to 573.46, reflecting growing optimism over the political
outlook and timely passage of the budget. Trading was active ahead of
today's national holiday.
However, Morgan Stanley, overweight in Italian equities between April and
September when it began switching into French defensive stocks, said
yesterday that it was maintaining its underweight position ahead of the
general election, early next year. Mr David Roche and Mr Richard Davidson
attributed their caution to political risks and doubts over whether the PDS
would be able to implement the hard nosed economic reform that Italy needed
if the debt/GDP ratio was to be mastered.
Credito Italiano rose L99 or 4.4 per cent to L2,358, its privatisation offer
looking substantially oversubscribed.
Foreign buying supported industrials. Olivetti rose L59 or 4.4 per cent to
L1,911 in volume of 15.1m shares and Pirelli was L47 ahead at L1,994. Fiat
added L25 to L4,214, unable to sustain the day's high of L4,280, in volume
of 16.7m shares.
PARIS remained caught in a downward correction as concern over the Gatt
talks continued to weigh on sentiment. The CAC-40 index sliped 10.62 to
2,176.12, but off a low of 2,167.70 and down from a high of 2,185.82.
Turnover was around the FFr3bn level.
Club Med, which is no longer a CAC-40 stock, saw sprightly activity on
rumours that it was planning a share swap with the German travel group LTU.
Club Med denied the reports but the shares ended FFr26.40 higher at
FFr341.80.
AMSTERDAM paused for breath with the CBS Tendency index moving upwards a
bare 0.1 to 139.8.
Goldman Sachs, in a global strategy report, remained positive on Dutch
cyclicals, expecting this sector to show the largest gains over the next 12
months. The US investment bank forecast a pick up in exports and investments
in 1994, 'while consumer spending is expected to show limited growth
 .Currently the market is interest rate driven, which is expected to boost
the performance of both financials and cyclical companies, the latter also
benefiting from a pick-up in exports and restructuring measures'.
KNP BT, the paper manufacturer, added 10 cents to Fl 41.10 on news that it
was near to reaching an agreement on the sale of a subsidiary.
STOCKHOLM saw a rebound in Volvo Bs, which put on SKr26 at SKr461 on a
return to the argument that the failure of the merger plan with Renault was
good for the Swedish company's equity rating.
The Affarsvarlden General index rose 18.5, or 1.4 per cent to 1,356.8.
Trelleborg, the mining and metals group, rose SKr5.50, or 7.6 per cent to
SKr70.50 with support from firmer metal prices; Electrolux put on SKr8 to
SKr296 on the story that it would take over AEG's household appliance
subsidiary; and Handelsbanken closed SKr3 higher at SKr109 on the withdrawal
of its offer for Gota Bank.
ZURICH paused to consolidate the cumulative 4.6 per cent advance of the
previous four sessions and the SMI index finished 1.6 easier at 2,834.8.
ISTANBUL lost 3.5 per cent as many investors decided to take profits. The
composite index fell 636.3 to 17,391.8 in turnover of TL1,660bn.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Riyadh survives its post war boom and
mini-bust - A vigorous Saudi equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few more lively social spots in a Riyadh evening than the crowded
and often sumptuous share trading salons of some of the city's bigger banks.
A highly upmarket betting shop might come to mind were such notions not so
unIslamic.
Directly after the Gulf war the association with gambling was not, however,
entirely inappropriate to Saudi Arabia's stock market. Having languished
illiquidly throughout most of the 1980s, the market suddenly burst to life
on a surge of speculative buying, more than doubling the official index
within a year, prompting a flush of new issues and recapitalisations and
recording some huge oversubscriptions in the process.
That speculative bubble has since deflated. The index has long since flipped
from its record high of 233 in April 1992 and has, for the past few months,
settled at a steady and modest level of around 180. And, oddly, it is this
which gives bankers and economists in the kingdom such cheer: in a region
notorious for investors' propensity for speculative excess, Saudi Arabia's
stock market has survived a boom and mini-bust and is still going relatively
strong.
Although down from its post-war peaks, the market has developed beyond
measure from its pre-war doldrums to become considerably the biggest and
most vigorous equity market in the Middle East.
At current prices, the market is capitalised at around Dollars 50bn -
dwarfing the region's second biggest market in Jordan, where the total value
of issued shares is just above Dollars 3bn. In sharp contrast to the sleepy
bourses in Kuwait or Bahrain, trade is also fast and furious: the 35m shares
traded in 1992 were worth more than Dollars 3.4bn.
The rush of speculative funds which revived the market is mainly over. This
was largely the effect of a huge repatriation of wealth by Saudi investors
after the Gulf War, partly out of disappointment at the rewards available in
international markets and partly out of renewed confidence at the returns
and security of investments available at home.
Some economists estimate that SR30bn (Dollars 8.1bn) of private wealth made
its way back and, because of the religious opprobrium attaching to
interest-bearing instruments, found its home in stocks or property.
On this tidal wave of money (the value of annual transactions rose to
SR13.6bn in 1992 from SR4.4bn two years earlier), numerous companies, in
particular nine of the joint stock banks, took the opportunity to
recapitalise. The subsequent rise in liquidity has given the market a lift
and, in general, the number of transactions is now seven times what it was
before the war.
But many analysts wonder if the market has reached its natural limit. They
point out that while the market is far busier and bigger than any in the
region, only about 7 to 10 per cent of issued stocks are actually traded;
the remainder tend to rest in the hands of the few wealthy Saudi individuals
who dominate the market and effectively serve as market-makers. While they
are more content to hold than to trade the bulk of their holdings, the
market's growth will be constrained.
New scrip would help, but there are few immediate signs of this. Only three
of the kingdom's 2,000 manufacturing companies have so far come to market,
and only three companies plan to do so in the near future. This reflects the
predominant ownership structure of most enterprises in the kingdom, which
tend to be closely held family concerns, with a tendency to resist both the
reporting requirements and dilution of ownership entailed in a listing.
Without new paper, trades will also continue to concentrate in just a few
leading shares. At present, trade in the eleven listed banks makes up 70 per
cent of the daily average trades in all 58 quoted companies - largely due to
the flood of shares made available during the past two years' banking
recapitalisation. Banks make up six of the market's top ten capitalised
companies.
But in the absence of new listings, some market users believe that the
exchange could give itself a further fillip by altering its trading
structure. At present all trades must be done through the banks, who are
allowed exclusive use of the floorless electronic trading system. A
substantial grey market also exists but all informal brokers must deal
finally through banking share rooms.
Many believe that the absence of a trading floor is depriving the market of
a central arena of information and worsens what they say is already a high
propensity to trade on privileged information.
It has been suggested that this is an obstacle to opening the market to
overseas investors. But while a number of bankers are beginning to
investigate possible vehicles for attracting foreigners, the central bank
has shown no signs so far of changing the rules.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Belgian, Danish rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continued strength of their currencies allowed Belgium and Denmark to
reduce interest rates yesterday, writes Conner Middelmann.
The Belgian National Bank cut its key central rate by 50 basis points to
7.50 per cent and its end-of-day rate by 50 basis points to 9.20 per cent.
The Danish central bank at its latest open market operation lowered its
14-day certificates of deposit rate to 7 per cent, from 7.25 per cent in the
previous two-week offer.
Both currencies held up well after the rate cuts, with the Danish krone
firming slightly and the Belgian franc ending little changed.
The krone finished at DKr3.933 to the D-Mark, up from Monday's DKr3.934
close. The Belgian franc ended at BFr20.83 per D-Mark, barely altered from
BFr20.82 late on Monday.
Further Belgian rate cuts are likely to continue underpinning the currency,
as they will boost the flagging economy and alleviate the interest burden on
Belgium's massive budget deficits, analysts said.
'Part of the vicious circle has been that a substantial part of the budget
deficit is due to high interest payments,' noted Mr Steve Hannah, head of
research at IBJ International. 'If they continue getting rates down, that
will have a beneficial impact on the budget deficit, thus restoring market
confidence.'
The Italian currency continued to rise on widespread relief that the worst
is over on the political front.
The lira began to rally after Sunday's municipal elections, where left-wing
coalitions swept to power in several major cities at the expense of
right-wing parties. It is also supported by hopes that the 1994 budget,
which was passed last week by the budget committee of the lower house, will
be approved before the end of the year.
The lira opened around L985 against the D-Mark and rose as high as L981.25
during the session. It closed at L983.1, up from Monday's finish of L989.8.
In spite of its recent recovery, 'the lira still looks cheap on fundamental
grounds', said Mr Andre de Silva, market strategist at PaineWebber
International.
'Whenever the lira has fallen below L1,000 against the D-Mark, buyers have
emerged and, from a risk-reward perspective, we are a lot more comfortable
in running open lira positions than we are the French equivalent,' Mr de
Silva added.
The lira's strength gave a small lift to the Iberian currencies, although
trade in all three was thin ahead of today's national holiday in Spain and
Italy.
The Spanish peseta rose to Pta81.93 against the D-Mark, from Pta82.33 at
Monday's close. The Portuguese escudo ended at Es101.9, up from Es102.0 on
Monday.
The French franc drifted lower through the day on concerns over the ongoing
Gatt world trade talks and data showing a 34.8 per cent increase in French
corporate bankruptcies in October.
After breaking key support at FFr3.4360 against the D-Mark, the franc
slipped as low as FFr3.444. It finished at FFr3.440, down from FFr3.434 at
Monday's close.
Sterling shed more than a pfennig against the D-Mark, largely on
profit-taking amid thin trading conditions. However, some pointed out that
recent rate cut speculation was also weighing on the currency. The pound
ended at DM2.5450, down from DM2.5575 at Monday's close.
Market opinion is about evenly split over the likelihood of another 1/2
percentage point base rate reduction before Christmas, said Mr Ian
Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. He listed three factors
favouring a near-term rate cut: 'The Budget's gone down very well in all
markets, the fiscal tightening was at least as large as the Bank of England
wanted, and most of Europe has cut rates.'
However, he feels next Wednesday's November inflation numbers will clinch
the decision on UK rates. 'If the RPI is unchanged at 2.8 per cent or below,
the market will be screaming for a rate cut.' But until the RPI release, the
pound is likely to drift in a narrow range, traders said.
In the money market, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds
1.7bn, which it later revised downwards to Pounds 1.25bn.
At its morning operation it purchased Pounds 17m of band 1 bills and Pounds
20m of band 2 bills at 5 3/8 per cent. In a later round it bought a total of
Pounds 196bn of band 1 and 2 bills at 5 3/8 per cent, and provided late
assistance of around Pounds 755m.
The D-Mark firmed slightly when the Bundesbank revised its October M3 money
supply growth numbers to 6.9 per cent, from the provisional 6.8 per cent
rate released some two weeks ago.
'The numbers were a touch disappointing - a lot of people had expected a
downward revision,' said IBJ's Mr Hannah. M3 growth remains above the
Bundesbank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range.
The German central bank will today allocate another round of 14-day repos at
a fixed 6 per cent - the first of five fixed-rate repos at that rate. Some
DM95bn in repos expire today and traders are calling for a small net
liquidity injection.
In late London trading the dollar tested key technical and psychological
support at DM1.7000 but finished at DM1.7055, down only a touch from
DM1.7060 at Monday's close. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.7032.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistani scientists in search
for weather-proof cotton varieties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FAISALABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's cotton scientists are exploring ways to develop new crop
varieties that will be tolerant of changing weather conditions, after this
year's heavy crop damage.
The government estimates that up to 15 per cent of the expected 12m bales
has been lost because of the recent attack of the leaf curl virus. But some
scientists suspect that higher temperatures, especially during night time,
may have exacerbated the drop in production.
Mr Waheed Sultan Khan, director of the government's cotton research
institute in Faisalabad, said yesterday: 'Cotton is a very sensitive crop.
We have seen this year that night temperature was 3'C higher as compared to
previous years. The night temperature has a great impact on cotton
production'. Such environmental changes required that new crop varieties be
developed, Mr Khan said.
Concern over environmental degradation causing crop damage is the latest
addition to a lengthening list of worries for the cotton industry. Some
officials and experts still fear that the fall-out from the Gulf War is
continuing to affect the atmosphere. However, few efforts have been made to
establish a scientific link. Some experts also believe that higher
temperatures have been caused by large scale deforestation in recent years.
Meanwhile, many cotton farmers among the worst affected in villages outside
Faisalabad, were yesterday busy sowing other crops to recover some of their
losses from cotton. Some have already ploughed their cotton fields without
harvesting any crop, because the lint it contained would have earned them
less money than they would have had to lay out in picking costs.
'I will never sow cotton again,' said Chaudhary Bashir Ahmed, who farms land
about 32km from the city. He has recently ploughed in what remained of his
21-acre crop following the virus attack.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Significant' fall in Russian
gold output predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's gold production is set to fall steeply next year, according to some
analysts. The drop could be as much as 30 per cent, suggests Mr Andy Smith,
analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland.
Ms Natalia Zubareva, representative to Russia and the Commonwealth of
Independent States for the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining
company, thinks that Russia's gold output will remain steady at about 130
tonnes this year but see a 'significant' fall in 1994.
Mr Smith cites three main reason for the expected fall: shortages of
resources; the black market; and obstacles to foreign investment.
More than half Russian gold production comes from two areas, Magadan and the
Sakha republic, but by the end of August Sakha had received only 30 per cent
of its food and only half of its fuel from Moscow. The republic has publicly
warned that it may have to sell its gold and diamond output outside the
centrally-controlled organisations to meet its needs.
Mr Smith says interior ministry data shows that about 30 per cent of
Magadan's 40 tonnes of gold output last year was sold on the black market.
Other factors depressing output are a steep fall in production of mining
equipment and a quadrupling of electricity prices in the far east of the
country. Only 46 per cent of the minimum funds required were allocated to
the region for geological purposes in the second half of this year.
In a recent speech to the Western Gold Show in San Francisco, Ms Zubareva
also stressed that ties between mines and equipment suppliers in different
parts of the former Soviet Union were breaking down, that the mineral
resource base was deteriorating and delays in state payments to producers
were causing great difficulty to the CIS gold industry. She said that in
recent years investment in gold mining had fallen but it had now reached the
stage where there was no investment at all.
China is the world's sixth biggest gold producer, Mr Cui Dewen,
vice-president of the Metallurgical Industry Ministry's gold administration,
told Xinhua news agency, reports Reuter from Beijing.
During the past 14 years, production had increased at an average rate of
more than 10 per cent, he said, but gave no details.
He claimed more than 20 companies from a dozen countries and regions,
including the US, Canada, Australia and South Africa, had shown interest in
investing in China's gold mines. China would have an 'active attitude'
towards Sino-foreign co-operation in gold production, Mr Cui said, with the
departments concerned drawing up detailed policies.
'Readjustment of the gold price (in September) stimulated China's gold
production,' he said. 'Some original gold markets have appeared around gold
mines and more efforts must be made to standardise these.'
On September 1 the People's Bank, the sole legal buyer, raised the state
purchase price to 10 per cent below the international price, converting at
the exchange rate on national swap markets.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weak currency helps Australian
miners
</HEADLINE>

A combination of a weaker Australian dollar, lower company tax and a small
rise in exports boosted profits for the Australian mining industry in
1992-93 (to June 30), according to an industry survey, reports Reuter from
Canberra.
The Australian Mining Industry Council said net profits of the 120 companies
that responded to its survey rose to ADollars 2.31bn (Pounds Pounds 1.03bn)
in 1992-93 from ADollars 1.79bn in 1991-92.
'But despite this the rate of return on shareholders' funds was well below
the average for the past decade and the prospects for future growth are
dulled by continuing depressed world mineral prices,' Amic said. It noted
that the industry's aggregate net profit was still below the ADollars 2.55bn
earned in 1990-91.
The survey showed that while the industry's operating revenue rose by 3 per
cent, its operating profit before income tax rose by 7 per cent and net
profit by 29 per cent, boosted by a 21 per cent fall in income tax.
The substantial fall in income tax reflected cuts in the corporate tax rate,
losses carried over and adjustments to earlier provisions, it said. Unit
costs also declined.
Overall, mine production rose by 2 per cent after a 1 per cent fall in the
previous year, the survey showed.
Smelting and refining production rose only 4 per cent and the generally low
growth in industry output in the past three years contrasted with the strong
growth recorded in the 1980s, Amic said.
The weaker Australian dollar helped to offset lower world prices, resulting
in a 3.6 per cent increase in average prices of Australia's mineral exports
for the year.
Amic said investment fell by 23 per cent in 1992-93 but added that some
improvement in investment was expected next year, with net expenditure on
fixed assets likely to increase by some 39 per cent.
Uncertainty over the government's native title bill continued to cloud the
outlook for the industry, Amic said, with exploration expenditure expected
to rise by only 4 per cent in 1993-94.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium leads further rise in
metal markets

<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange base metals prices yesterday built on their recent
rally, with aluminium, which had been lagging the field somewhat, taking its
turn in the lead.
Having shrugged off news of a further 3,900-tonne rise in LME warehouse
stocks to a fresh record of 2,395,450 tonnes, the three months delivery
aluminium price managed to break down the technical resistance around
Dollars 1,090 a tonne at which its rise had stalled on Tuesday before moving
on to a peak of Dollars 1,116 a tonne. The advance was trimmed in late
trading, however. The price closed at Dollars 1,108.75 a tonne, still
Dollars 20.50 upon the day, and a further Dollars 2.25 was surrendered in
after hours dealings.
Dealers said the performance was particularly encouraging to the bulls as by
holding above Dollars 1,090 the market had indicated that further gains were
possible, while removing the immediate threat of a significant downward
reaction.
The three months aluminium price has now recovered by Dollars 70 from the
eight-year low reached at the beginning of November.
Other notable performances yesterday included three months nickel's Dollars
90 net rise to Dollars 5,037.50 a tonne - though that was Dollars 82.50
below the 4 3/4 -month high reached early in the day.
Lead's recent surge also continued in the morning, with the three months
delivery price touching a 1993 high of Dollars 475 a tonne at one point. The
price was trimmed back by the close to Dollars 461.50 a tonne, up Dollars
4.25 on the day, but that still extended its upward run over the past eight
trading days to an impressive 10.7 per cent.
The zinc market was in an equally buoyant mood as traders looked forward to
Friday's meeting of European producers to discuss proposals for co-ordinated
output cuts.
An early breach of chart-based resistance around Dollars 976 a tonne for
three months metal primed the market for an assault on the psychological
Dollars 1,000-a-tonne barrier. That hurdle was cleared with some ease and
the price sped on to Dollars 1,010 a tonne. But the advance quickly ran out
of steam in that rarefied atmosphere and by the close the three months
position was back to Dollars 998.25 a tonne, up Dollars 24.75 on the day.
Three months copper extended its five-day, Dollars 44 upward run with an
early jump to Dollars 1,714 a tonne before running into expected stiff
resistance. It recoiled to Dollars 1,700.75 a tonne at the close and at the
end of after hours trading was back to Dollars 1,699.50 a tonne, up Dollars
5.75 on the day.
'There is a general round of euphoria in the (base metals) market,'
commented GNI, the London trade house, in its daily commodity report, 'and a
degree of 'call option' mentality.'
It explained that a speculator believing that prices had already seen the
bottom could buy a metal and place a stop-loss selling order below its
recent low, creating what it described as 'a synthetic call option - ie the
risk is limited and the potential upwards huge'.
'This mentality has been cultivated by the low 3.5 per cent US dollar based
interest rates available at the moment,' GNI said. 'For example, to fund a
nickel position with a stop below Dollars 4,000 (a tonne) will accrue just
Dollars 35 a tonne in funding costs for a year, low for a market where
historically prices have shot up to Dollars 20,000 in the not so distant
past.'
Russia, blamed by western producing nations for the glut of aluminium on the
world market, does not plan to cut its production if other producers do not
lower their own output, deputy prime minister Alexander Shokhin declared
yesterday, reports Reuter from Moscow. He also told a news conference that
recent quotas imposed by the European Union on Russian aluminium exports had
had no effect because producers were finding ways to avoid them.
'Russian exporters find other ways to go round these quotas,' he said. 'So
far, our aluminium industry has not felt any negative consequences of the EC
(EU) quotas.'
A flood of Russian aluminium has undermined Western markets since the Soviet
Union's collapse. Russia's non-CIS primary aluminium exports rose to 1.11m
tonnes in the January-October period from 735,000 in the corresponding
period of 1992, official statistics show.
Mr Shokhin said there was no agreement at last week's talks in Washington,
where industry officials from Russia, the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and
the EU discussed the worldwide oversupply of aluminium. The next round of
multilateral talks is scheduled for January 18-19 in Brussels.
Mr Shokhin said Russia was against any sharp production cuts that would hurt
its producers. 'There are limits to a compromise,' he said.
'We are not going to restrict output to the extent that our enterprises have
to close down. We're ready to cut production, but we have our own criteria
for such cuts. Russia is not going to cut output on its own.'
He said further talks were needed with the EU and the US to find a solution
to the problem.
'A lot will depend on whether the EC and the United States manage to agree
between themselves first,' he said.
Washington trade officials fear that increasing flows of Russian aluminium
will flood the US market after the introduction of EU restrictions.
The EU curbs, announced early last week, extend for another three months
quotas initiated in August on imports of unwrought aluminium from the former
Soviet Union.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Members to discuss coffee
pact's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the executive board of the International Coffee Organisation
begin a three-day meeting in London today at which they will discuss the
organisation's future role, delegates said, reports Reuter.
'There will be plenty of time to look at the issue of what we want to do
with the ICO. . . but I doubt it will be time enough to take a decision,'
one producer said.
Members have theoretically until the end of September next year to decide on
the organisation's role after the collapse of difficult negotiations on a
new economic pact in March.
Delegates agreed to extend the existing administrative accord by a further
12 months to October 1, 1994, but were then shocked in September by an
announcement from the US, the biggest consumer, that it would not accede to
the extension.
Its decision has been linked with a scheme devised by producers to hold back
some supplies from the world market. This came into effect from October 1.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Warburg arm leads US stock
issue for Cummins Engine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US subsidiary of SG Warburg took another step in its attempt to gain a
profitable foothold in the US capital markets yesterday when it lead-managed
a Dollars 112.7m issue of new common stock for Cummins Engine, the big
Indiana-based engine manufacturer.
Although the deal is not particularly large by US standards, it is rare for
the US arm of a European investment bank to lead-manage an equity issue by a
well-known US corporation. While Warburg has co-managed a number of US
issues, Wall Street investment banks traditionally run the books for US
companies.
Warburg's New York unit, under its American chairman Mr Thomas Wyman, has
been pursuing US underwriting business aggressively in the past two years as
part of a strategy to reduce the firm's reliance on European investment
banking transactions and building a US business independent of the UK
parent.
At the same time, Warburg has continued to emphasise its strengths in
international capital markets. It was this global reach that helped the firm
win the mandate from Cummins.
The company, which is the world's largest manufacturer of engines, with
almost half of its sales generated overseas, wanted to sell a large part of
its new stock issue to non-US investors.
Although Cummins would not say why it chose Warburg as lead underwriter, Mr
Michael Cohrs, head of equity syndication at Warburg, said the firm's
ability to distribute Cummins' shares to non-US investors, particularly in
the UK and continental Europe, was a crucial factor in winning the deal.
Three big US firms, CS First Boston, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Securities,
were co-managers of the issue.
Ultimately, about 45 per cent of the 2.3m common shares sold in yesterday's
issue went to non-US investors, primarily in the UK, Japan, Switzerland,
Denmark and France.
Warburg said the issue was oversubscribed. It was priced at Dollars 49 per
share and at the close of trading Cummins shares were up  5/8 at Dollars 49
5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Cummins will use the sale proceeds to
reduce its debt.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Rare equity-linked warrant offering
from Dresdner Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank raised DM475m through a five-year issue of equity-linked
warrant Eurobonds yesterday, a form of financing which has become virtually
extinct in Germany due to shareholder opposition to waiving pre-emptive
rights.
Only two such issues have been launched this year, by companies which still
had authorisation from their shareholders to raise equity-linked financing
without offering pre-emptive rights.
In March, Allianz, the insurance group, raised DM950m through a five-year
issue of equity-linked warrant Eurobonds while Veba, the utility, raised
Dollars 300m through a seven-year Eurobond issue with equity warrants.
An official at Dresdner Bank said the bank had been keen to launch the deal
before its authorisation from shareholders expired in the spring.
In recent years, German companies have been discouraged from seeking further
authorisations at annual meetings because of shareholder opposition.
Bankers said that in the future, raising equity-linked financing would be a
far more complicated process because the bonds would have to be offered to
shareholders first.
The rarity value of these issues contributed to the success of Dresdner's
offering. The bonds, which were priced at 115, traded at 116.70 bid late in
the afternoon.
The warrants were quoted at 18.50, compared with their theoretical value of
17.40, thereby increasing the conversion premium to 18 per cent from 16 per
cent at the launch.
Elsewhere, the Province of New Brunswick made its annual outing to the
Eurobond market when it raised CDollars 200m through an issue of 20-year
Eurobonds, the first offering with this maturity in the Canadian dollar
sector. The borrower last tapped the Eurobond market in March 1992.
Lead manager Wood Gundy is donating the commissions and trading profits from
this deal to Children in Crisis, a charity currently concentrating its aid
efforts on children in the former Yugoslavia. Around CDollars 150,000 was
raised yesterday but Wood Gundy hopes to raise a total of CDollars 2m.
The bonds were priced to yield 100 basis points over 10-year Canadian
Treasuries but were not freed to trade late yesterday.
Syndicate managers expect the Republic of Argentina to launch its first
issue of global bonds today. The 10-year offering, via Merrill Lynch and
Salomon Brothers, is likely to raise Dollars 750m, up from an original
amount of Dollars 500m. The bonds are likely to be priced to yield around
280 basis points over US Treasuries.
There were also rumours that a Scandinavian sovereign borrower was
interested in taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities which are
currently available in the 10-year area of the Euro-yen sector.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries slip as prices of crude oil
recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With crude oil prices firming, US Treasury bonds slipped yesterday morning
after the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve said vigilance was required
on inflation in view of the economy's growth rate.
By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 101, and
the yield rose to 6.17 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off
 3/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.183 per cent.
After the long bond surged nearly a point on Monday, selling pressure
resurfaced as oil prices firmed on the Nymex. Crude oil futures had tumbled
to five-year lows late in the previous session.
Bond activity remained light, however, ahead of the release later this week
of November price data, which are expected to show inflation is in check, at
least for the moment.
Traders now appear less concerned with current conditions than with possible
developments in the first quarter of next year. Comments by Mr David
Mullins, the Fed vice-chairman, served to support the view that the central
bank could move to increase short-term interest rates sooner rather than
later.
His remarks held bond prices in negative territory, aided by profit-taking
by dealers and speculative buyers, who had helped bid up the market during
the past two sessions.
UK government bonds slipped by between  1/16 and  1/4 point ahead of today's
gilt auction, with stock in the auction area experiencing the largest
declines.
The Bank of England is auctioning Pounds 3bn of 6 3/4 per cent stock due
2004, and dealers said the 10-year area of the curve underperformed other
maturities as market-makers and clients prepared for the sale of stock.
Despite the release of a batch of 'bond-negative' news yesterday, German
government bonds rallied and closed firmer, though off the highs of the day.
The upward revision in October money supply data came as a disappointment
since market participants had expected any adjustment to be downwards: M3
money supply grew at an annualised rate of 6.9 per cent, up from the
provisional 6.8 per cent reported last month,
However, even less encouraging was the release of higher than expected GDP
figures, which showed that western German GDP grew by a seasonally adjusted
0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
The high-yielding European bond markets saw strong gains initially, with
Spain following Germany's strength early in the day and rising
three-quarters of a point, helped by renewed foreign interest.
The Italian government bond market also saw a good rise on the back of
confidence in the political situation, but lost some of the gains when news
emerged that the treasurer of the Italy's federalist Northern League party
had been arrested on suspicion of corruption. Prices ended about a quarter
point higher.
Dutch government bonds closed firmer, with the new tap stock providing the
main focus of attention in the market.
The finance ministry said the tap sale of the new 5.75 per cent bond due
2004 raised Fl 1.8bn yesterday after Monday's Fl 7.5bn. Today will be the
last day of the tap sale.
Japanese government bonds continued to climb to new intra-day highs,
prompted by hopes of a cut in the official discount rate, but prices slipped
back on profit-taking to end the day little changed overall.
The March futures contract rose from its opening level of 116.58 to touch a
high of 116.69 before closing at 116.54. In the cash market, the yield on
the benchmark No 157 JGB opened at 3.15 per cent and ended at 3.185 per
cent, corresponding to the low price of the day.
Market participants said several contributing factors were driving the rate
cut hopes. Last week, Bank of Japan and government officials were reported
to be predicting an ODR cut in the week of December 13.
At the same time, the central bank has allowed money market rates to slip
below 2 per cent, which some regard as a sign that an official rate cut is
in the wings.
The steady stream of depressing economic news is expected to continue with
the release this week of third-quarter GDP figures and the release on Friday
of the quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment, which is expected to
be gloomy.
Mr Gerard Lyons, international economist at DKB International, predicts that
GDP will fall by 1.0 per cent quarter-on-quarter: 'I'm expecting to see the
biggest quarter-on-quarter drop since the first quarter of 1974.'

Ameritech, the Chicago-based local telephone company, yesterday took the
first step to becoming the first Baby Bell regional telecommunications group
to enter the long-distance calling market. It has asked the US Justice
Department for permission to offer a long-distance service, initially on a
test basis.
The seven Baby Bells are currently banned from the long-distance market
under the terms of the 1982 anti-trust court case which spun them off from
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. Regulators feared they would use their
monopoly power in the local market to compete unfairly in the long-distance
arena.
However, technological factors and a pro-competition regulatory environment
are gradually whittling away at the local monopoly.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Merck executive to head Upjohn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Zabriskie, executive vice-president and head of manufacturing at the
US drugs group Merck, is leaving the company to take over as chairman and
chief executive of Upjohn, a chief rival.
The appointment ends the search for a new Upjohn chief executive that began
last April, when the previous chairman and chief executive, Mr Theodore
Cooper, died of cancer. The company said last night Mr Ley Smith, Upjohn
chief operating officer, would continue to serve as interim chief executive
until the 54-year-old Mr Zabriskie assumed his duties in the new year.
Mr Zabriskie said yesterday he was sad to leave Merck after 28 years, but
that the 'opportunity to lead a company in my own right became an
irresistible challenge'.
News of the appointment was warmly received by investors and analysts, and
Upjohn's shares rose Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 31 1/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Mr Joseph Riccardo, an analyst with the Wall Street broking house Bear
Stearns, hailed Upjohn's choice. 'John Zabriskie is a seasoned
pharmaceuticals executive who had a very good career at Merck. He is a good
manager and leader and will be a valuable asset to Upjohn.'
Mr Zabriskie's main challenge at Upjohn will be to steer the company through
what could be a difficult transition. Although it has some promising
products under development, Upjohn faces the expiration of US patents on
several of its leading drugs; new legislation affecting the tax charge for
its Puerto Rican manufacturing facilities; and a healthcare environment that
President Clinton's planned reforms have turned increasingly hostile.
The departure of Mr Zabriskie, meanwhile, clouds the issue of who will
succeed Mr Roy Vagelos as chairman and chief executive of the world's
largest drugs group when he retires next year.

Fourth-quarter earnings at Deere and Company, the US agricultural,
industrial and lawn equipment manufacturer, jumped to Dollars 103.5m, or
Dollars 1.33 a share, before special accounting charges.
Deere said strong North American sales in all equipment lines lifted
profits.
Last year, the group recorded fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 4.2m, or 5
cents.
Before special charges, Deere posted full-year income of Dollars 286.3m, or
Dollars 3.70 a share, up from Dollars 37.4m, or 49 cents, a year ago.
Including the special charges, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 920.9m, or
Dollars 11.91, in fiscal 1993. Those charges included a one-time accounting
charge of Dollars 1.1bn for post-retirement employee benefits.
In spite of the Dollars 80m restructuring of its European operations,
announced in the second quarter, overseas agricultural equipment operations
incurred large operating losses in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 1993.
The full-year's losses 'substantially exceeded' last year's operating loss.
Deere's worldwide sales jumped 15 per cent to Dollars 2.18bn in the fourth
quarter, from Dollars 1.9bn in the same 1992 quarter. Production tonnage was
up 31 per cent from last year's fourth quarter.

its factories to limit the build-up of inventories.
For the fiscal year, Deere reported worldwide sales of Dollars 7.75bn, up 11
per cent from 1992's Dollars 6.96bn. North American equipment sales made up
Dollars 4.9bn of that total, up 19 per cent from last year.
Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said North American sales of agricultural
equipment in 1994 should reach 1993 levels.
'Due to the lower 1993 grain production and the resulting reduction in
carry-over stocks, a substantial increase in planted and harvested acreage
of corn and soya beans is expected in 1994,' he said.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: BCE tunes into a multi-media
future / Examining the Canadian Telecom's investment plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many companies in the fast-evolving telecommunications business are bigger
than Canada's BCE. However, in the scramble for a toehold in the converging
worlds of telephones, cable television and entertainment, only a handful
have managed to leave their footprints in as many places.
With its plan to buy an initial 30 per cent stake in Colorado-based Jones
Intercable, BCE is now about to secure a significant presence in one of the
pioneering parts of the business - the US cable-TV industry.
'We're not finished,' says Mr Derek Burney, chairman of BCE Telecom
International, a wholly-owned unit through which BCE is channelling its
international expansion.
BCE Telecom's mandate, Mr Burney says, is 'to make investments
internationally covering the full range of telecommunications in areas where
we either have expertise to offer or where our expertise will complement
that of our partner in a way that we both benefit'.
Mr Burney, who until last year was Canada's ambassador in Washington, says
BCE is especially seeking opportunities in Latin America and Asia.
BCE's telecom interests now stretch from stakes in Canadian, UK and New
Zealand telephone companies, to a 52 per cent interest in Northern Telecom,
the telephone equipment maker. It also has interests in cable-TV franchises,
telephone directories, and cellular and mobile phone systems.
The decision to focus on telecommunications marks an about-turn from BCE's
strategy a decade ago. Then, the prospect that its offshoot, Bell Canada,
would not maintain its stranglehold on Canada's domestic telephone market
led BCE into an ambitious - and costly - diversification.
However, Mr Raymond Cyr, architect of BCE's entry into financial services,
pipelines, computer services, printing and property development, made way in
1990 for Mr Red Wilson, former head of Tate &amp; Lyle's Canadian subsidiary.
The unflappable Mr Wilson, 53, has often said that the survival of any
serious player in the telecommunications business depended on its ability to
deliver a wide range of services.
The last of the non-telecom businesses, comprising financial services group
Montreal Trustco and property developer Brookfield Development, were sold
last week. A CDollars 750m (USDollars 564.3m) loss on these investments will
be charged to BCE's fourth-quarter earnings.
The Montreal Trustco sale has left BCE with a stake of almost 5 per cent in
Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third-biggest bank.
BCE's latest purchase is one of the US's lesser-known but more innovative
cable-TV companies. Mr Glenn Jones, chairman and controlling shareholder of
Jones Intercable, 'is considered one of the industry's visionaries,' says Mr
George King, analyst at Canseco Capital Management in Indianapolis.
Jones Intercable is among the pioneers in bringing school and university
courses to cable-TV subscribers - a service which has yet to catch on. It
also has several interests in the entertainment business, among them a
subsidiary which provides programmes to 600 US radio stations.
BCE and Jones became acquainted through their joint ownership of Encom
Cable, which owns six contiguous franchises in London. Besides cable-TV,
Encom offers voice and data services in its franchise area, a model which
North American telephone and cable companies are seeking to emulate.
Jones is the seventh-biggest US cable operator. However, its strength is not
so much the cable systems which it owns, as those which it manages on behalf
of about 20 limited partnerships.
The partnerships are typically liquidated after between five and seven
years, leaving Jones with an interest in the residual value and an obvious
route for expansion.
Much of the Dollars 400m which BCE has committed to invest in Jones is
likely to be earmarked for purchases of systems owned by defunct
partnerships, as well as outside systems. BCE has an option to lift its 30
per cent stake in Jones to a controlling one.
While BCE's diversification drive in the 1980s proved to have been an
indisputable mistake, its telecommunications investments have not been
trouble-free either. Northern Telecom is in the middle of a painful
restructuring, having lost Dollars 989m in the first nine months of this
year.
Bell Canada, BCE's cash cow, is also in transition, hobbled on the one hand
by growing competition in Canada's long-distance telephone market, and on
the other, by continuing regulation of its monopoly on local services in
Ontario and Quebec.
BCE's challenge, like that of other companies trying to bring the strands of
the telecommunications and cable-TV businesses together, is to demonstrate
that a stable of diverse investments can produce more innovation and a
better return for shareholders than each company operating by itself.
BCE's consulting arm, Bell Canada International, will be integrated with BCE
Telecom next month as part of the effort to promote exchanges between the
companies in which BCE is a shareholder.
Mr Burney says: 'We're not looking to some grand international alliance
where all the pieces come together.' However, he points to the
cable-cum-telephone partnership with Jones in the UK, and says: 'We do see
complements.'
BCE and Mercury Communications, the UK telephone company in which BCE bought
a 20 per cent stake earlier this year, have begun to tap into each other's
resources.
About half-a-dozen Bell Canada managers have been parachuted into senior
positions at Mercury, while several Mercury employees have been seconded to
Bell. BCE and Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent, are meeting in the UK this
week to discuss further co-operation.
Similarly, Jones has commissioned Bell-Northern Research, Canada's biggest
privately-owned research group, to help on a systems integration project.
'We would expect that the full range of the family's expertise could be
brought to bear in some shape or form in this investment, as it has in
others,' Mr Burney says.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: AMR warns of costs of attendants
strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMR, parent of American Airlines, estimates that fourth-quarter after-tax
earnings will be reduced by more than Dollars 160m because of the strike by
flight attendants last month, agencies report.
As a result, AMR would report a 'significant loss' for the fourth quarter
and a loss for the year. For the fourth quarter ended December 31 1992, AMR
reported a loss of Dollars 200m, or Dollars 2.66 a share, on revenues of
Dollars 3.6bn.
The airline said it lost about 1.3m passengers in November because of the
dispute.
Flight attendants at American Airlines went on strike for five days just
before the November 25 Thanksgiving holiday. The strike ended after
President Clinton interceded.
The company said its system-wide load factor in November declined 7.63
points, to 51.44 per cent from 59.07 per cent a year ago, due to the strike.
It said November system-wide revenue passenger miles fell 16.8 per cent to
6.28bn from 7.55bn a year ago, while available seat miles declined 4.5 per
cent to 12.21bn from 12.78bn.
For the year to date, load factor declined to 60.5 per cent from 64 per
cent.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Top Canadian bank battered by
loan losses
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has had
another disappointing year, with earnings hit by restructuring charges and
unexpectedly high loan losses, especially in real estate.
Net earnings totalled CDollars 300m (USDollars 225.7m), or 46 cents a share,
in the year to October 31, compared with CDollars 107m, or a loss of five
cents a share, in 1992. Return on equity was a meagre 2.4 per cent,
following last year's negative return of 0.3 per cent.
The previously-announced charges, totalling CDollars 410m, reflect the costs
of integrating the operations of Royal Trust, which the bank acquired
earlier this year, and an internal restructuring plan. RBC is cutting 4,100
jobs from its payroll, equal to almost 8 per cent of its workforce.
After the charges, the bank posted a CDollars 420m fourth-quarter loss,
equal to CDollars 1.47 a share, against a loss of CDollars 473m, or CDollars
1.63, a year earlier.
Loan-loss provisions for the year were CDollars 1.75bn.
This is lower than the CDollars 2.05bn set aside in 1992, when the bank was
hit by its exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the failed real estate developer.
The final 1993 provisions, however, are more than double the CDollars 820m
estimated at the end of the first quarter. Provisions for sour commercial
real-estate loans have now reached 20 per cent of the bank's gross property
portfolio.
Ms Donna Toth, analyst at Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto, said RBC's problems
stemmed from aggressive lending policies with inadequate controls. Several
of the bank's most senior corporate credit officers have taken early
retirement in the past year.
On the brighter side, Mr Allan Taylor, chairman, said retail banking and
treasury operations performed strongly, while the bank's investment banking
subsidiary, RBC Dominion Securities, posted record earnings. Non-performing
loans have dropped to CDollars 3.26bn on October 31 from CDollars 3.48bn a
year earlier, with the level of non-performing consumer loans falling for
the first time in four years.
The inclusion of Royal Trust from September boosted assets by 19 per cent to
CDollars 164.9bn. Royal Trust's operations have been 'close to' break-even
since then.

Reynolds Metals, the US aluminium group, is considering restructuring some
of its operations, mainly in the fabricating area. It wants to improve
worldwide performance in 'extremely difficult market conditions' in the
aluminium industry, Reuter reports.
The actions could result in charges of between Dollars 150m and Dollars 225m
after tax, or Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 3.75 per share, the group said.
It said the most significant operations being looked at were parts of its
business at the McCook, Illinois, sheet and plate plant. Freeport-McMoRan
Copper &amp; Gold of the US said its PT Freeport Indonesia unit was to sell its
existing and planned power transmission and generating assets for about
Dollars 200m.
The buyer is a joint venture between Duke Energy, an affiliate of Duke
Power, and PowerLink, a unit of Northstar Energy.

Wheelock and Co, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir Yue-kong
Pao's listed empire, reported a 61.1 per cent rise in profits after tax and
minority interests to HKDollars 940.3m (USDollars 121.7m) from HKDollars
583.7m for the six months to September 30.
Wheelock, formerly World International, has interests ranging from trams to
property to cable TV. Wharf Holdings, a diversified conglomerate and the
company's main subsidiary, contributed some 70 per cent of profits.
Analysts said much of the growth in earnings was made from treasury
operations. Income from this source rose by around 40 to 45 per cent;
brokers reckoned underlying profits growth was closer to 30 per cent.
Mr Woo said the group would pursue its strategy of buying stakes in
companies manufacturing in both Hong Kong and China, which sell to western
industrialised countries but which may have potential markets in China.
Earnings per share over the six months rose to 46.1 cents, compared with
28.5 cents last year. The dividend rose to 9.5 cents a share, up from 7.5
cents last year.

Lawyers for plaintiffs said the company would issue Dollars 225m of

The plaintiffs, who include customers and independent service organisations

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Wheelock posts 61% interim
profit rise

Wheelock and Co, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir Yue-kong
Pao's listed empire, reported a 61.1 per cent rise in profits after tax and
minority interests to HKDollars 940.3m (USDollars 121.7m) from HKDollars
583.7m for the six months to September 30.
Wheelock, formerly World International, has interests ranging from trams to
property to cable TV. Wharf Holdings, a diversified conglomerate and the
company's main subsidiary, contributed some 70 per cent of profits; Wharf
itself previously announced a 44 per cent increase in first-half net
earnings to HKDollars 1.38bn.
Mr Peter Woo, Wheelock's chairman, said profits improved on the back of
largely healthy performances from all associates.
Analysts said much of the growth in earnings was made from treasury
operations. Income from this source rose by around 40 to 45 per cent;
stripping out these earnings, brokers reckoned underlying profits growth was
closer to 30 per cent.
Mr Woo said the group would pursue its strategy of buying stakes in
companies manufacturing in both Hong Kong and China, which sell to western
industrialised countries but which may have potential markets in China.
Since the name change two weeks ago, Wheelock Pacific, the company's
investments, retail and trading arm, has made its first investment by taking
a 25 per cent stake in Climax International, a Hong Kong-listed paper
products company.
Wheelock's stated policy is to invest up to 20 per cent of its balance sheet
 -or HKDollars 20bn - in China. The group's investments in China are
currently less than 10 per cent of assets; however, Mr Woo said it
wouldembark on many projects over the next two years that would increase
exposure to China by a further 5 to 10 per cent of assets.
Earnings per share over the six months rose to 46.1 cents, compared with
28.5 cents in the same period last year. Shareholders are to receive a
dividend of 9.5 cents a share, up from 7.5 cents last year.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sanyo plans Y22bn flash memory
chip investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sanyo Electric, a leading Japanese consumer electronics company, is planning
to invest Y22bn (Dollars 203m) in flash memory chip production.
Flash memory, an advanced silicon chip which 'remembers' what has been
written on it without the need for constant electronic refreshment, is now a
Dollars 500m market worldwide. Forecasters are predicting 100 per cent
growth each year for the foreseeable future.
It is seen as essential for success in portable computers and other portable
electronics products. Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company and
leader in the flash memory field, is marketing the chips as a replacement
for hard disk drives in portable computers.
The technology was invented by Toshiba of Japan, but Intel secured the
leadership position by improving chip designs and making them both
manufacturable and affordable.
Flash memory has the advantage of high shock resistance, speed and low power
consumption. While it is still more expensive than hard disk storage, it is
expected to replace conventional semiconductor memory chips (DRams) as the
leading high-speed memory technology by 1995.
Sanyo plans to begin production of 1m bit chips in February and 4m bit chips
in May. The company has signed a licensing agreement with Silicon Storage
Technology (SST), a California-based chip designer and manufacturer.
Sanyo will use SST's design and technology to manufacture the chips, which
will then be supplied to the US company under the Sanyo brand name. Sanyo
will also sell its chips in the merchant market, and supply processed
silicon wafers, on which the chips are printed, for flash memory cards.
Sanyo said its monthly output of chips would be about 500,000 each of the 1m
bit and 4m bit variety.
Sales next year from all suppliers are expected to amount to some 60m chips.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Something green stirs in the
investment forest - A New Zealand company hoping to attract environmental
investors with a new type of pine tree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fletcher Challenge, New Zealand's second biggest company, believes it has
found a solution to the depletion of the world's natural forests and the
increasing shortage of timber. It is called the radiata pine.
The pine is being developed by Fletcher Challenge in its New Zealand and
Chile plantations to produce a rapidly growing supply of high quality wood
for construction.
It is the main attraction of a new class of share that the company has
created to realise the value of its forestry assets. The shares, known
variously as targeted, letter or alphabet stocks, have been used by US
companies such as General Motors and USX to separate out specific activities
without restructuring or floating them off. Fletcher Challenge claims to be
the first large non-US company to adopt the practice.
Existing shareholders are receiving one forest division share for every four
ordinary shares. 'For an investor who wants liquidity on an international
scale, just wants to invest in forestry and wants to be on the fast growth
side, this is the unique investment today,' said Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief
executive.
Trading in the shares in New York begins next Monday, but began last week on
the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. It has already added about
15 per cent to the recognised value of the forest assets, taking them to
about NZDollars 3bn (USDollars 1.6bn).
'I would consider any initiative that does that to be a great success,' said
Mr Fletcher.
The 400m new shares represent half of Fletcher Challenge's total forestry
assets worldwide, or 244,000 hectares of solid wood forests in New Zealand
and Chile and the related log trading business.
The radiata pine accounts for 95 per cent of these plantations. It can
produce a large, quality sawlog, for making solid wood products, in 25 to 30
years. Fletcher Challenge has been developing it over the past 15 years to
be disease-resistant and to contain as few knots as possible.
The company estimates that this type of high-value pruned log will account
for about 26 per cent of the forest division's total harvest by 2015,
compared with about 2 per cent now, as plantations mature. At the same time,
the overall harvest volume is expected to double to about 4m cubic metres.
The emphasis is on quality, rather than the volume of producers of timber
for pulp. The New Zealand radiata pine grows by 25 to 30 cubic metres a year
compared with 10 to 12 cubic metres in plantations in the southern US and
three to five cubic metres in the natural forests of north west US.
The company hopes to attract investors interested in the environment, said
Mr Fletcher. The way to save the rainforests 'is to plant fast-growing
plantations'.
It expects the price of wood to rise as demand grows with an increase in
population and per capita income, especially in Asia. At the same time, the
supply of large logs is declining because much of the best quality timber
has already been cut, particularly in south east Asia, and because
conservationist pressures are reducing felling in natural forests, notably
in the US states of Oregon and Washington.
'In contrast to most commodities, where real prices have declined over time,
here's a commodity where nature is constraining the supply side and there's
a reasonable prospect of increasing real prices,' said Mr Fletcher.
The company has signed agreements with environmentalists in New Zealand,
saying it will not cut down natural forests to plant the radiata pine but
will use poorer quality farmland prone to soil erosion, which the trees
should help prevent. Adding to the environmental attractions, it says one
hectare of radiata pine extracts nine tonnes of carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere every year.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Nabisco to cut 6,000 jobs and
take Dollars 445m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and food group, yesterday announced that it was
to cut 6,000 jobs from its worldwide workforce of 63,000 as part of a
cost-cutting drive aimed at improving productivity.
The restructuring would result in a charge of Dollars 445m to net income in
the fourth quarter, equivalent to 32 cents a share.
However, the company added that it would enhance future net earnings by an
average of Dollars 250m a year.
Nabisco emphasised that the job losses would be spread across the group's
tobacco and food operations in the US and overseas, at all levels of the
workforce.
Mr Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our restructuring
programme is intended to improve margins in both the tobacco and food
businesses, so we can resume our earnings growth track next year.'
The company said other components of the charge included reductions in
corporate expenses, promotion and merchandising programmes, and
manufacturing cost improvements.
In October, Nabisco had warned that fourth-quarter net income would be hit
by a restructuring charge. Yesterday the shares rose by Dollars 3/8 to close
at Dollars 6 5/8 in anticipation of future earnings growth.
Nabisco's announcement comes less than two weeks after Philip Morris, its
closest rival in the food and tobacco industry, unveiled similar plans for a
restructuring aimed at defending its brands from low-cost competitors.
Philip Morris said it would cut its world-wide workforce of 168,000 people
by 14,000, in a move that would produce a Dollars 457m charge to
fourth-quarter earnings but would later result in a Dollars 600m-a-year
enhancement of earnings.
Both companies have been hard hit by a price war which broke out in the US
cigarette market earlier this year when Philip Morris reduced the price of
its best-selling Marlboro and other premium brands by 20 per cent.
RJR Reynolds, which makes Winston and Camel cigarettes, reported a 58 per
cent fall in third-quarter net income because of the price war, and warned
that cost-cutting measures would follow.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: HJ Heinz slips 15% in second
term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HJ Heinz, the US food products company, yesterday said its second-quarter
earnings, excluding a one-time gain for divestments, slipped 15 per cent,
mainly because of the negative impact of currency fluctuations.
However, the weaker financial performance belies the underlying strength of
Heinz's leading brand franchises, which showed volume growth, improved
prices and better market shares in the three months to October 27.
Sales were 4 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.8bn, against Dollars 1.73bn a year
earlier. However, Heinz's large presence in Britain and Italy, which have
witnessed sharp devaluations of their currencies over the past 15 months,
worked against the Pittsburgh-based company.
If exchange rates held steady, revenues would have shown an 11 per cent
gain. Heinz does not give separate figures on its domestic and international
sales and earnings.
The company, which includes Heinz ketchup, Star Kist canned tuna and 9 Lives
cat food in its brand stable, said net income was Dollars 193.1m, or 75
cents a share, against Dollars 154.1m, or 60 cents, in the 1992 quarter.
If a Dollars 127m pre-tax gain from the sale of an Italian confectionery
business and a US rice operation were excluded, however, earnings would work
through at 51 cents.
Increased marketing expense and a higher rate of taxation also had a
negative impact on the bottom line. Advertising costs and other brand
support rose 13 per cent on the year, while the provision for income taxes
climbed 65 per cent to Dollars 115m.
For the first six months, net income was Dollars 345m, or Dollars 1.34 a
share, more than double last year's total of Dollars 164.3m, or 64 cents.
Sales were 3 per cent higher at Dollars 3.39bn, against Dollars 3.3bn.
Mr Terry Bivens, an analyst with Argus Research in New York, said the
performance was disappointing.
On Wall Street, the shares fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8 in morning
trading but recovered to close Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 37.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Gota Bank sell-off hit as bidder
drops out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish government's plans to sell Gota Bank were dealt an unexpected
blow yesterday when Svenska Handelsbanken, one of the country's leading
commercial banks, pulled out of the bidding.
The move means that Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Nordbanken are the
only bidders for Gota which collapsed into state hands last year under large
losses. The only foreign bidder, General Electric, has pulled out.
Mr Arne Martensson, Handelsbanken chief executive, said information had
emerged 'which made us increasingly hesitant about buying Gota Bank'.
His main criticism was that the government's price expectations were far too
high. 'A privately-owned international bank like Handelsbanken cannot pay a
price for Gota Bank which would risk our rating and our international
competitiveness,' he stated.
Mr Martensson declined to specify what had emerged during the valuation
process to cool the bank's enthusiasm for Gota. A total of SKr43bn (Dollars
5.3bn) of Gota's problem loans have been hived off into a separate entity
called Retriva and will not form part of the purchase.
Gota Bank has SKr60bn worth of healthy assets which analysts say could
attract more than SKr2bn.
Observers suggested that SE Banken's credit rating might suffer if it bought
Gota Bank, tipping the odds in favour of a purchase by Nordbanken, which was
bailed out by the state last year.
'Nordbanken is the front runner now which means that taxpayers' money just
shifts from one pocket to the another,' said Mr Peter Mansson, financial
analyst with ABB Aros Securities.
Some commentators believe that the synergy benefits of a Nordbanken/Gota
Bank merger will be considerable, enabling the state to get a better price
for the combined entity than two components.

FT  08 DEC 93 / CS Holding improves 65%

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding, the financial services group built around Credit Suisse, said
its business performance continued to be extremely satisfactory in the
second half of the year.
However, Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, warned that provisions for bad debts would
remain high because of the continuing business recession, especially in
Switzerland.
CS reported consolidated net income of SFr882m (Dollars 588m) in the first
half, up 65 per cent. Net income in the full year 1992 was SFr1.03bn.
Mr Gut was speaking at a special shareholders' meeting in Zurich to approve
the creation of shares to finance the purchase of the shares of Leu Holding
that it does not own.
Last month, CS bought a 15 per cent block in Leu, Switzerland's fourth
largest banking group, for SFr416m in shares and cash, raising its holding
in Leu to 70 per cent. It has since offered the same terms - one CS bearer
share and SFr720 in cash for every six Leu shares - to the remaining
minority shareholders.
Resolutions to create new shares and to split the existing bearer and
registered shares 5-1 were approved.
Mr Gut gave no indication of CS's plans for Leu once the takeover was
completed, but said that it was having a good year.
'The turnround at Bank Leu and successful operations at Bank Hofmann and
Clariden Bank allow Leu Holding to reckon with a result that will be
markedly higher than in the previous year,' he said. Leu's net income was
SFr104m last year.
Mr Gut said CS Holding's total assets at the end of the third quarter were
practically unchanged from the SFr343.3bn reported at the end of June.

Italian deal

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whirlpool, the world's largest white goods producer, is selling its Italian
compressor business to Embraco of Brazil. The unusual Dollars 106m deal will
create the world's second-biggest compressor producer after Matsushita of
Japan.
Whirlpool is transferring its factory at Riva di Chieri, which makes Aspera
brand compressors, to the Brazilian company, a long-time strategic partner
in which it holds a minority interest.
The deal includes a five-year agreement to provide compressors - one of the
basic components of refrigerators - to Whirlpool Europe. Embraco already
supplies them to Whirlpool in South and North America.
The sale fits into Whirlpool's overall strategy of making more effective use
of its global network. The two formerly-separate manufacturing units - Riva,
near Turin, and Embraco's plant in Joinville, Brazil - will work together to
enhance their position in the world compressor market.
Mr Miguel Etchenique, Embraco's chairman, said the purchase would assure his
company an important presence in Europe, the world's largest home appliance
market.

FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Electrolux may sell US
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux, one of world's leading white goods manufacturers, said yesterday
it was considering the sale of Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment, its US
subsidiary, as part of a strategy to streamline its structure.
The group has decided that the business, which it acquired with its purchase
of White Consolidated in March 1986, was not a core activity.
White Consolidated, said: 'Electrolux is primarily a consumer goods company
and Blaw-Knox does not have any relation to any of our other operations.'
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank has been retained as an adviser.
Blaw-Knox is based in Mattoon, Illinois and has 700 employees. Its sales in
1993 are expected to be more than Dollars 80m.
The company is the leading manufacturer of asphalt paving machinery in the
US and has large European operations based in Rochester in the UK.
Electrolux has experienced tough market conditions in 1993, particularly in
Europe. But the weaker Swedish krona and restructuring helped drive a 31 per
cent increase in profits in the first nine months to SKr961m (Dollars 119m).
AEG, the German electronics group, declined to comment on reports that it
was planning to sell its household appliances group to Electrolux. AEG's
supervisory board meets today. Electrolux last year took a 10 per cent stake
in the AEG unit.

placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Industrial, a property company specialising in small working units,
yesterday raised Pounds 14m through a share placing with institutions.
Mr Harry Platt, managing director, described the company as 'a provider of
starter homes for small businesses.'
The placing through Smith New Court of 5.05m ordinary shares at 320p each,
values the company at Pounds 29.3m. Of this 4.58m are new shares, with the
remainder from existing shareholders. Pro forma net tangible assets after
the placing are Pounds 28.8m, equivalent to net asset value per share of
315p.
The money raised will be used to finance the purchase of four estates,
including one in Stevenage, the first outside the M25, for a total of Pounds
8.5m. The remainder will be used on capital expenditure and further
expansion.
While gearing will fall from 167 per cent at the end of September to 80 per
cent after the placing, the company plans long term gearing of about 100 per
cent.
The company was established in 1986 when 12 institutions subscribed Pounds
16.7m to acquire 18 estates from the Greater London Council's industrial
property portfolio. It has since expanded through acquisitions, joint
ventures and extensions.
Before the latest acquisitions, which will be concluded shortly, the
portfolio comprised 27 estates with 900 units and 700 tenants. The average
unit is 1,000 sq ft, with an average rent of Pounds 6.71 per sq ft.
Mr Platt said the occupancy rate of the original 18 estates had been 72 per
cent when the company started, and had risen to 95 per cent before the
recession. He believed the bottom of the market had been reached in the
summer of 1991, when the rate fell to 75 per cent. The company total for its
27 estates is now 77 per cent.
He was confident that the company, which has overhead staffing of 17 people,
could almost double the amount of property managed without increasing
overheads.
The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 355,000 on rental income of Pounds
2.53m in the six months ot September 30. In the last full year pre-tax
profits were Pounds 1.03m on rental income of Pounds 4.76m. The board
intends to recommend a final dividend of 5p for the year to end March,
giving a total of 7p.
Dealings in the shares are expected to begin next Wednesday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of Julian Hodge Bank, the family-owned Cardiff bank, rose from
Pounds 5.32m to a record Pounds 8.13m pre-tax in the year to October 31.
The figure included a surplus on investment sales of Pounds 3.38m (Pounds
1.3m).
The bank, which specialises in commercial and industrial lending, is chaired
by Mr Julian Hodge, son of Welsh financier Sir Julian Hodge who founded the
bank seven years ago.
Mr Hodge said the bank had increased its deposit base by a quarter to Pounds
24.7m despite a period of low interest rates. Shareholders' funds had more
than doubled since 1988 to stand at Pounds 48.4m.
'The current economic outlook is the most promising for a number of years,'
he said.

<TEXT>
Exceptional costs left Atkins Group, the Leicestershire-based textile
company, in the red for the six months to October 2.
On turnover 15 per cent up at Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 7.69m) pre-tax losses
were Pounds 96,000 (Pounds 16,000 profits). Losses per share were 2.1p
(0.33p earnings) but the interim dividend is raised to 3.85p (3.6p).
The sales improvement noted at the annual meeting continued and operating
profits advanced 33 per cent to Pounds 138,000 (Pounds 104,000).
However the Pounds 281,000 cost of ending fabric dyeing, which was less than
estimated, less Pounds 113,000 surplus on sale of plant resulted in an
exceptional charge of Pounds 168,000, against profits last time of Pounds
48,000.

Holmes &amp; Marchant Group, the marketing services company, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.25m for the year to September 30, against losses of
Pounds 4.76m. The improvement was accentuated by the comparative figure
being restated for FRS 3.
Lower exceptional costs of Pounds 294,000 (Pounds 3.02m) and a lower charge
for discontinued activities of Pounds 10,000 (Pounds 2.96m) were the main
factors behind the improvement. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 826,000
(Pounds 1.08m).
Turnover fell to Pounds 32.3m (Pounds 33.6m) but operating profit rose to
Pounds 2.38m (Pounds 2.3m). Earnings per share came out at 4.1p (losses
18.9p).
On prospects the company said there was little evidence that recessionary
pressures were easing.

The company said the benefits of reorganisation were being seen but
continued sales growth and stringent cost controls would be needed in the
second half to counter effects of the price war between the retailing
multiples and intense competition between manufacturers.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 8.1m against Pounds 11.1m which included Pounds

Wace Group, the pre-press and specialist printing concern, has agreed with
de Zoete &amp; Bevan the placing of 3.69m new 20p shares at 170p each, to raise
Pounds 6.27m before costs.
The directors said the proceeds will be used for the early termination of a

pay for the group's final earn-out obligations, which are estimated at
Pounds 1.6m and due to be paid next April.
They added that the primary objective during 1994 and 1995 was the continued
reduction of borrowings through strong operational cash flow.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Apollo Metals falls slightly to Pounds
1.03m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Apollo Metals, the aluminium processor and distributor which gained a
listing in May, turned in pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds
1.03m in the year to September 30.
The outcome was struck on turnover up by 20 per cent from Pounds 23.4m to
Pounds 28.2m and after an increased interest charge of Pounds 391,000
(Pounds 159,000).
The directors said the proceeds of the Pounds 4.9m placing and open offer
were received at the end of June - too late to have a significant impact on
interest costs in the second half.
As a result, and despite capital expenditure amounting to Pounds 2.1m during
the year, the company now had a strong balance sheet and gearing at the
year-end stood at just 7 per cent.
A final dividend of 2.4p (2.3p) is proposed making a total for the year of
3.6p (3.45p). The dividend is 1.4 times covered by earnings per share of 5p
(6p).

Despite a 19 per cent fall in turnover, pre-tax profits at Eurocopy, the
office equipment distributor, improved by 54 per cent from Pounds 1.71m to
Pounds 2.62m in the year to end-September.
Mr Cyril Gay, chairman, said the drop in turnover - from Pounds 34.2m to
Pounds 27.6m - resulted from lower machine sales and service revenue,
coupled with the absence in the second half of furniture sales after the
April disposal of the furniture division.
However, losses in the sales divisions were reduced substantially through a
combination of better margins and lower costs, he added.
Earnings per share came out at 3.6p (2.32p) and an improved final dividend
of 1.2p (0.5p) raises the total for the year to 1.7p (1.6p).
