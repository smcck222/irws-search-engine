FT  03 DEC 93 / Council taxes may rise 7% after cuts in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government announced one of the toughest crackdowns ever on
local-authority spending in England yesterday.
Under new plans to fund local authorities unveiled by Mr John Gummer,
environment secretary, many council tax bills will increase by at least 7
per cent next year.
However, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said Mr Gummer's assumptions about
local authority spending were too modest and council tax bills might rise by
as much as 15 per cent.
'Councils are already spending more this year than the government wants them
to spend next year,' the institute said.
The proposals, announced in the government's annual finance settlement for
local authorities, will radically reduce Whitehall's grant to England's 403
local councils as a proportion of their overall spending.
The shortfall will have to be raised by increases in council tax that may be
four times the present level of inflation. It might further undermine the
Conservatives' performance in next year's local-council elections.
Ministers said councils would be able to increase their overall spending
programmes next year to ensure that local services, including education and
housing provision, stay at current levels.
But local-authority chairmen and Labour politicians said the measures would
undermine local services and were a result of the spending cuts imposed on
the Department of the Environment in this week's Budget.
Councils that spend more than the amount projected for them by central
government will be limited to an increase in total spending of at most 1.75
per cent.
That 'capping' measure, designed to limit council tax bills, will cut even
more tightly the more councils exceed their projections. Seven authorities
are certain to have to make cuts, with 26 certain of a freeze.
Several groups of public-sector workers, including teachers and the police,
are paid out of local-authority budgets, so any increase in their pay would
require cuts in other services.
Mr Gummer said he was expecting local authorities to spend a total of Pounds
42.66bn in 1994-95, an increase of 2.3 per cent on the current year.
However, local-authority associations said that amounted to a 1.2 per cent
cash cut, as councils are spending more than their government assessments.
The total central government grant to local councils will be Pounds 34.32bn,
an increase of 1.7 per cent on current spending.
Mr Gummer expected that the council tax for band C, one of the most widely
applicable charge bands, would be Pounds 468 a year, a Pounds 30 increase on
its current level.

FT  02 DEC 93 / People: Sir Bob Reid to chair London Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bob Reid, full-time chairman of British Rail since 1990, has been
appointed a non-executive director of London Electricity, and is scheduled
to take over as part-time chairman of the company on April 1, when the
incumbent, John Wilson, retires.
A BR spokesman said that the new appointment did not signify the likelihood
of Sir Bob stepping down from his role at BR, where he is on a five-year
contract. 'He anticipates that his post with London Electricity, even when
he becomes chairman, will not take up more than two days a week.'
Nor is there any indication that Sir Bob's current part-time BR job, which,
in his words, was to 'make sure the trains run on time', will be scaled
back, even though the Railways Bill, coincidentally coming into effect on
April 1, will leave him without any train timetables to concentrate upon.
Sir Bob has in the past clashed with government ministers over rail
privatisation, and his role at BR has to some extent been undermined by the
appointment of another former oil executive, Bob Horton, former chairman of
BP, as head of Railtrack, the newly-formed body which will initially take
charge of railway stations, though the two are understood to have cordial
relations.
From April 1, Sir Bob's role at BR, according to some commentators, will be
merely to supervise the dismantling of the rail network as it is known
today; though he gives every indication of seeing his BR contract through to
what may ultimately be a rather bitter end.
But Sir Bob is pleased to join London Electricity not least because its cash
position is - unlike BR's - very healthy.
Aged 59, he joined Shell UK in 1956 and spent more than 30 years there,
eventually becoming chairman and chief executive in April 1985 until
September 1990. He is also a director of the Bank of Scotland, and
earlier this year was installed as the first chancellor of the Robert
Gordon University, Aberdeen.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Donors' generosity overwhelms Uganda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KAMPALA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When the World Bank and other donors abruptly cancelled their support for
Uganda's National Aids Secretariat, the shock waves went through the entire
edifice of donor-funded projects that prop up Uganda's economy.
The secretariat had appealed in November for Dollars 450m to fund a
'multisectoral' plan to combat the disease. It proved to be the last straw
for donors already exasperated by the failings of the secretariat. 'We are
interested in fighting Aids, not funding an Aids bureaucracy,' one of the
donors present at the meeting explained.
The secretariat's staff had not been up to the job, causing donors to
question whether they had been too ambitious for one of their model pupils
in Africa.
Uganda has been smothered with aid since President Yoweri Museveni's
government adopted a World Bank-approved programme of economic reforms six
years ago. The international community, delighted with Mr Museveni's
enlightened, if unelected, leadership, pledged more than Dollars 825m in aid
this year, an amount equivalent to a quarter of Uganda's gross domestic
product.
Foreign aid finances 60 per cent of government spending. Even the luggage
trolleys at Entebbe airport say 'donated by the UN Development Programme'.
Aid has financed every development project since the end of the civil war in
1986. Most of it has gone on rebuilding roads, dams, electricity and
telephone systems destroyed during the war. Donors are also involved in
rebuilding civil society: providing judges to train new magistrates,
inspectors for the police force, and cash for the demobilisation of
soldiers.
But their generosity has begun to outstrip Uganda's ability to absorb the
aid. The World Bank estimates it has a backlog of projects worth Dollars
750m awaiting implementation. In some cases the government has been unable
to contribute the 10 per cent counterpart funding for projects demanded by
the World Bank. In others, the underpaid bureaucracy has been slow to get
projects off the ground.
'I think we have reached the point where we have to take a hard look at the
amount of aid Uganda is getting,' says Mr Chukwuma Obidegwu, the resident
World Bank economist in Kampala. 'My main concern is that it discourages
Ugandans from developing the exports that would reduce their dependence on
aid.'
The inflow of dollars has led to an appreciation of the Ugandan shilling,
which is now overvalued. This has undermined donor-funded efforts at export
promotion and diversification. As the trade deficit widens, Uganda has
become more dependent on donors for balance of payments support.
Aid money is also feeding an industry of consultants. Virtually every
government ministry has a clutch of expatriate 'advisers'. Their standard
pay is Dollars 10,000 a month, or about 100 times the salary of a senior
Ugandan civil servant.
One official said he knew of an international firm of chartered accountants
who charged Dollars 200,000 for a report on accounting information systems
for the public sector. 'It was copied straight out of a first-year
accountancy text book,' he said. Its recommendations were not implemented.
Although most aid is being put to good use - building roads, repairing
hydroelectric dams, providing essential drugs - its abundance is breeding
corruption.
Diplomats in Kampala speak openly and disparagingly about government
ministers who are on the take.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Let Moscow join European Union, says Seguin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the French national assembly, last night
called for radical changes in the European Union to widen its membership to
Russia, to create a European Security Council, and to relaunch the European
economy with interest rate cuts and massive public borrowing.
The impact of the views of Mr Seguin, who led last year's French referendum
campaign against Maastricht, and the degree to which they might rock the
foundations of the Balladur government's European policy, may depend in part
on the outcome of the Gatt negotiations.
If a Gatt crisis were seriously to divide the French government, and
particularly Mr Edouard Balladur from his party leader, Mr Jacques Chirac,
then the latter might lend a sympathetic ear to some of Mr Seguin's views,
at least those on economic and monetary policy.
Mr Seguin, who has led the criticism of government policy, particularly its
failure to stem unemployment, within the prime minister's own RPR Gaullist
party, has been competing with Mr Balladur for Mr Chirac's ear.
The National Assembly president shares much of the Euroscepticism prevalent
in London.
But, in his speech last night to a Paris university audience, he pushed the
thesis of a wider-rather-than-deeper European integration further than any
British conservative minister would dare or probably want to.
He called for the EU to consolidate the peace of Europe by extending its
membership to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Capping his vision of a 'Grand
Europe' would be a European Security Council, modelled on the United Nations
version with four or five main European powers on it and able to dispatch
peace-keeping forces throughout the continent.
He proposed a radical downgrading in most EU institutions, with the Brussels
Commission losing its right to make proposals and with the European
Parliament confined to ratifying European legislation 'which would be
collectively elaborated by national parliaments'.
To stop Europe's 'collective suicide' in the form of ever-rising
unemployment, Mr Seguin called for a 'rapid and substantial lowering of
interest rates', and for recognition that the plan for a single European
currency, is 'strangling the whole of Europe'.

FT  02 DEC 93 / EU warns it may use force to free blocked aid in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian presidency of the European Union yesterday served notice that
Europe was ready to use force against local warlords blocking the flow of
humanitarian aid in Bosnia.
The warning followed talks in Brussels between Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
which helped lay the groundwork for next month's visit by President Bill
Clinton to Europe and a Nato summit.
The talks were a clear effort to patch over the political rift which
surfaced in the transatlantic relationship earlier this year, principally
over US support for arming the Bosnian Moslems against the Serbs.
Mr Christopher said the US opposed using the threat of a suspension of
humanitarian aid as a lever on the Bosnian government to offer concessions
in the Geneva peace talks.
Meanwhile, Bosnian government officials yesterday signalled for the first
time that they might accept the partition of the Bosnian capital of
Sarajevo.
Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the UN said: 'If the division is
what we need to save lives ...The Serbs are insisting on it, while we are
wondering how to survive the winter."
A member of the Serb delegation yesterday said he believed the two sides
were on the verge of making a deal. He said Serbs had offered to make
territorial concessions outside of Sarajevo, if they were given 40 per cent
of the capital.
Moslem leaders reportedly rejected the Serbian proposal to exchange two
industrial suburbs, Vogosca and Ilijas, in exchange for the Moslem enclaves
of Srebrenica and Zepa, eastern Bosnia. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian
president, had earlier put forward a map outlining a mostly Moslem republic.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a member of the Bosnian Serb delegation
yesterday dismissed the map as 'maximalist'.
In addition to Moslem demands for eastern Bosnia, a key sticking point
remains their plan to gain a land connection to the Adriatic and a 10km
stretch of the coast.
Croat leaders this week reiterated their refusal to hand over any portion of
the coast.
In exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions on Belgrade, the European
Union 'action plan' says Serb leaders must hand over 3-4 per cent more land
to their Moslem adversaries, in addition to the 20 per cent of land
envisaged in the plan brokered by the international mediators.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Volvo plans for merger hit by wave of dissent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Volvo's ambitious plans to merge with France's Renault were under renewed
threat last night after the Swedish group's third-largest shareholder joined
a growing chorus of opposition to the deal.
The call by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken Funds, which controls 5.7 per cent
of Volvo's voting capital, for the merger to be postponed brought to seven
the number of Swedish institutional shareholders that have said they will
not support the deal at a special shareholders meeting next Tuesday.
With only two Swedish institutions independent of Volvo pledged in favour,
opponents called on Volvo not to proceed. Volvo declined official comment,
but a senior executive said: 'We are, of course, taking the situation very
seriously'.
Volvo's share price rose steeply on speculation that the merger would fail.
The most-traded B share closed at SKr444 (Dollars 51), up SKr30 from
Tuesday's close.
Votes committed against the merger still trail those in favour by a margin
of between 10 and 6 per cent of the votes. But the Yes camp includes
Renault's 10 per cent holding and the opposition now holds a clear lead
among the independent institutions. Volvo admits it is reluctant to push
through the deal on a narrow majority.
Renault said that while yesterday's developments were obviously unwelcome it
had no new plans ahead of the shareholder vote and would await next week's
decision.
A French government official adopted a similar stance, adding that the
French side had done all it could to reassure Swedish investors and clarify
points of concern about the deal.
Doubt was also cast yesterday over the decision of one of the supporting
institutions. The board of the Fourth Fund state pension fund, the biggest
Volvo shareholder after Renault, is set to reconsider its narrow 8-6 vote in
favour of the merger at a meeting tomorrow. This follows the revelation that
the fund's chief executive also sits on the board of a Volvo subsidiary.
Today, attention will focus on a decision expected from the SPP insurance
company which holds 4.5 per cent of the Volvo votes.
S-E Banken Funds, which has a close relationship with the Volvo board, did
not reject the merger outright, but said a final decision should be
postponed until next April.
The funds sharply criticised the information provided by Volvo on the
merger, saying it was not sufficiently detailed to allow a proper evaluation
of the values placed on Volvo assets.
Under the merger plan, Volvo would put all its core car, truck and bus
making operations into the new Renault-Volvo company in exchange for a 35
per cent shareholding. 'The information was not up to the standard we like
to have in such an important case as this,' said Mr Peter Thelin, S-E Banken
Funds chief executive.
He also said time was needed to 'repair the damage' caused by what had
become an emotional tussle between Volvo and its shareholders.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (19): A tour of the gnomes' grottos -
Night-life: Though it may not be that exciting, Zurich has something for
everyone, from Latin American music to a panorama bar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARIA MULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compared to that of London or Paris, Zurich's night-life is small town
stuff. Still, there is something for almost everyone, from Latin American
music at the old stock exchange to the Jules Verne panorama bar for the
star-struck.
On the right bank of the Limmat, night-life centres on the medieval part of
Zurich, stretching along Limmatquai between Central and Bellevue.
The Polygon (Rothus, Marktgasse 17) offers a variety show and dancing, while
the Limmatbar (Limmatquai 82) with its loud music, attracts a young
clientele.
For a drink and to observe the night-life in full swing, the bar of the
Konigstuhl (Stussihofstatt 3) is recommended. You can watch the comings and
goings of le tout Zurich from the comfort of an enormous black and white
striped sofa.
Or have a peaceful, pre-midnight drink at the Splendid Hotel's piano bar
(Rosengasse 5). After midnight, the bar tends to become very noisy and
crowded.
Close to Bellevue is the Odeon (Limmatquai 2), featuring big chandeliers and
marble walls. Once frequented by Zurich's artists and writers, the Odeon
lost much of its glory when the bar was split in two and the balcony
removed. One side of the bar now houses a chemist and all efforts to restore
it have come to naught.
A few steps up the hill from Bellevue brings you to the quiet Kronenhalle
bar (Ramistrasse 4), which is attached to the famous restaurant and where
the drinks are good. Or head south across Bellevue to the Spaghetti Factory,
known as something of a meat market.
On the left bank, traders and bankers often convene at the Old Fashion Bar
(Fraumunsterstrasse 15) for after-work drinks. Another yuppy favourite is
the Savoy Hotel Bar on Paradeplatz.
For something more exotic, try the Jules Verne bar (appropriately in
Uraniastrasse 9) for a view of Zurich by night or some serious star-gazing.
Take the lift in the Brasserie Lipp on the ground floor to the 11th floor to
reach Zurich's only panorama bar. Be prepared to wait for a place.
When Jules Verne closes at midnight, make your way to the nearby Roxy disco
in Beatengasse 11.
Kaufleuten at Pelikanplatz is favoured by the city's young bankers and
beautiful people. The front part of the bar is narrow and noisy, but if you
go through the connecting door at the back of the bar and around the corner,
you will find yourself in a ballroom with a long bar, comfortable velvet
sofas and a gleaming parquet floor. This part of the bar turns into a disco
at weekends and is sometimes used for concerts during the week.
As a fitting conclusion to your tour of the gnomes' grottos, go to the old
stock exchange building (Bleicherweg 5) where the erstwhile main trading
ring has been converted into a Latin American bar, the El Cubanito. Unlike
the stock exchange, it is open only on Fridays and Saturdays.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (18): When men get a chance to dress up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich's own festival, called Sechselauten, (six o'clock chimes), is played
out on the streets of the old city every year on the third Monday of April.
According to a 650-year-old tradition, the (male) pillars of the city's
business establishment dress up in extravagant medieval garb and, having had
slap-up lunches in the halls of their various guilds (zunfts), they parade
down the streets on foot or on horseback.
Lining the streets are mainly the men's wives, mistresses, secretaries and
other female friends and acquaintences, many of whom will have been
dragooned into being there.
Their role is to throw flowers at their preening menfolk. The man who
accumulates the most flowers by the end of the parade gains new prestige. He
is easily identifiable because he will have acquired a woman assistant along
the way to help carry his flowers.
The procession ends in a city park where a symbolic figure of winter, known
as Boogg and capable of being pronounced only by Swiss, is put to the torch.

The galleries tend to be less specialised than in other cities, most of them
showing a wide range of contemporary work, from drawing, painting and
sculpture to photography, printmaking and video. Some feature only Swiss
artists, others have an international cast.
A quarterly listing of exhibitions, called Kunst in Zurich, complete with
maps showing the locations of galleries, is available at any of the
galleries. The Zuri Tip pull-out section of the Tages Anzeiger newspaper
every Friday provides up-to-date information.
To get a taste of the scene, one might start with the Susi Brunner gallery
at Spitalgasse 10 in Niederdorf. It specialises in naive and primitive
painting, sculpture and furniture.
Many of the exhibits, such as the strange, brightly painted papier mache
giant animal forms and the small human forms with trays on their heads
holding the visualised content of their thoughts will make you smile.
The furniture includes chairs with legs of deer and arm-rests with cats'
heads and tables and cupboards with birds' wings and angels' heads.
Up Spitalgasse a few steps and left into Predigergasse you will find the
very posh and rather cold Lelong Zurich gallery. It shows the top
international painters and sculptors and is worth a visit just to enjoy the
wonderful gallery space.
Although the staff can be intimidating, it is a treat to browse through the
catalogues of their artists. The October-November exhibition included a
group show of Forg, Kirkeby, Klapheck, Lam, Lupertz, Miro, Nitsch, Penck,
Rainer and Tapies.
Other galleries that show interesting international artists include Galerie
Esther Hufschmid, next door to Lelong, Ruth Alleman and Walcheturm at
Stampfenbachplatz, Renee Ziegler in the Schauspielhaus across from the
Kunsthaus, Helmhaus at Limmatquai 31 and Ursula Siegenthaler in
Oberdorfstrasse 24.
Sylvia Baviera in Zwinglistrasse 10 has a reputation for discovering new
Swiss and German artists.
A sort of Soho has developed in recent years in Hardturmstrasse where a
clutch of old warehouses along the Limmat have been transformed into
galleries. Many of them specialise in experimental art, the most adventurous
being the Kunsthalle Zurich.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (16): Key facts for the visitor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXIS
Zurich is one of the most expensive towns in Europe for taxi rides. Short
trips in town cost SFr20 (Pounds 9 or Dollars 13.28) very quickly, and for a
15-20 minute ride to or from the airport you can expect to pay between SFr45
and SFr60.
In general, one does not hail a cab in Zurich. There are several ranks in
the centre of town, or a phone call to one of the co-operative radio cab
centres will almost always produce a cab within five to ten minutes.
Tel:271-1111 or 444-4444.
TO AND FROM THE AIRPORT
Avoid taking a taxi in rush hours. It is much quicker and cheaper to take a
train from the main station (Hauptbahnhof). Trains run every 10 to 20
minutes and the journey takes roughly 10 minutes. You alight at the station
underneath the airport building. Some hotels have a shuttle service.
PUBLIC TRANSPORT
Zurich's blue painted trams and buses are the epitome of Swiss efficiency.
They have reserved lanes in most streets, so they do not get bogged down in
traffic, even in rush hour. Board at any door except the front one next to
the driver. Alight from any door.
Make sure you buy a ticket before boarding as there is a SFr50 (Pounds
22.50) fine, payable on the spot, for those caught by random inspections
without one. Every stop has a vending machine with instructions in four
languages, and manned kiosks are at Paradeplatz, Bellevue and under the main
station.
Tickets cover zones and a given time period. If you are taking at least two
rides in the central zone within a 24-hour period, it is worth buying a SFr6
day ticket (Tageskarte), which entitles you to as many rides as you like for
the next 24 hours.
Timetables at tram and bus stops are unfailingly adhered to. Vehicles run
roughly between 6am and midnight at fairly frequent intervals.
BOAT EXCURSIONS
Take a boat trip on Zurich's lake - in good weather, this can be a quick way
to get away from it all and relax. The main departure stop is at
Burkliplatz. One boat features a midday trip, complete with lunch, which is
pleasant in the summer.
TOURIST INFORMATION
The Tourist Office on Bahnhofplatz (main station) is a mine of useful
information and usually very helpful.
TRANSLATION SERVICES
Rarely needed in this multilingual business centre, especially as most Swiss
companies have their own in-house translators. Try Agentur der
Dolmetscher-und Uebersetzervereinigung, Lindenbachstrasse 7. Tel: 362-3714.
CONSULATES
Addresses of consulates in Zurich (the embassies are in Berne, the official
capital):
Austria: Minervastr. 116 Tel. 383 7200
Belgium: Bellerivestr. 36 Tel. 385 3033

UK: Dufourstr. 56 Tel. 261 1520
US: Zollikerstr. 141 Tel. 422 2566
CHANGING CURRENCY
Banks will quickly and efficiently exchange your Japanese yen into Italian
lire without batting an eyelid. Normal banking hours are 8am to 4.30pm. But
the offices at the airport and main railway station have much longer hours.
STOCK MARKET PRICES
All the big banks in the city centre have the prices on display screens in
their windows. Or go to the Investor's Club in Nuschelerstrasse, in fact a
public cafe, where information on all financial markets is available.
TIPPING
A service charge of 15 per cent is automatically included in all restaurant
or cafe bills, but many people still round up the figure. Taxi fares also
include a service charge but the drivers usually expect a slight rounding up
of the bill, especially if they heave your heavy luggage about.
CINEMAS
Zurich has a large number of cinemas - and they almost always show foreign
films in the original language, with subtitles in both German and French.
Cinema listings in the newspapers specify the languages by use of letter
codes, for example, Efd, meaning English with French and German subtitles.
French films come with only German subtitles and German films usually come
with none.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (15): Start at 'The Gates of Hell' -
The city is blessed with enough museums, gardens and galleries to keep the
visitor busy for a week or more. But check admission times: some are open
only in the afternoons
</HEADLINE>

Where is the largest collection outside Scandinavia of the work of Edvard
Munch? And where is one of the finest private collections of European art?
Where is the only museum in Europe entirely devoted to native American
Indians? And where is the only museum showing the influence of coffee on
social and cultural life? Where did the Dada movement begin?
Where can one view a collection of 20th-century art, dominated by the works
of Augusto and Giovanni Giacometti and Giovanni's son, Alberto? Where is one
of the world's finest museums of Asian and African art? And which European
city threatens its graffiti artists with imprisonment?
The answer to all these question is, of course, Zurich. The city is blessed
with enough museums, gardens and galleries to keep the most enthusiastic
observer busy for a week or more.
The smaller contemporary art galleries tend to open only in the afternoons,
so it is a good idea to visit the main collections in the mornings.
Why not start your tour at 'The Gates of Hell' by Rodin outside the entrance
to the ultra-modern Kunsthaus in Heimplatz? Here, you can acquaint yourself
with the work of the leading Swiss 20th-century painter, Ferdinand Hodler.
There is also an excellent range of paintings, drawings and sculptures of
old masters and Zurich artists from the 15th century to the present. It is
here that one can see so much Edvard Munch and so much space devoted to the
Giacomettis.
The Kunsthaus is on the circuit for full-dress exhibitions of artists of
international repute and often has smaller studio presentations of
contemporary and local artists.
The Swiss National Museum (Schweizerische Landesmuseum) is a neo-Gothic
building which looks like an old castle complete with gate tower and wings
built around a central courtyard. It is across the street from the main
railway station and acquired notoriety in the late 1980s when drug addicts
converged in the adjacent Platzspitz park. The addicts have since been
shooed away and the park has been restored.
It displays artefacts of Swiss culture from the stone age to present,
including weapons, flags, uniforms, armour, toy armies, costumes, coins,
jewellery, seals, glass painting, religious painting and sculpture, whole
house interiors, watches, musical instruments and farm and industrial tools.
In short, one can discover a well-presented and informative illustrated
history of Switzerland.
The Rietberg Museum in Gablerstrasse is housed in the grounds of an
exquisite 19th-century neo-classical mansion, Villa Wesendonck, built for a
German merchant in imitation of the Roman Villa Albani. It long served as a
retreat for musicians and writers. Richard Wagner spent several years here,
and there is a monument to him.
After the City of Zurich acquired Baron Eduard Van der Heydt's famous Asian
and African collections in 1956, this villa became a public museum for
non-European art.
The Bellerive Museum, housed in another neo-classical villa in Hoschgasse,
is devoted to arts and crafts, including art nouveau textiles, tapestries
and modern furniture. Sadly, the display space is limited, but the care
which is taken in presenting the frequently changing displays make it well
worth a visit. In the summer the courtyard contains a sculpture exhibition.
Across the street from the Bellerive is the unique Heidi Weber Private
Museum. This was the last building built by Le Corbusier and is the only
modern example of 'total concept art', where architecture, sculpture, and
painting live in supposedly perfect harmony. It is open only from June to
October.
The Buhrle Collection (Stiftung Sammlung EG Buhrle), built on the fortune of
the great Zurich-based weapon makers, Oerlikon Buhrle, is small, but
contains some of the finest European paintings from several periods. The
impressionist and post-impressionist works are particularly dazzling. Here
one sees Manet's Swallows, Renoir's Little Irene and Cezanne's Boy in the
Red Waistcoat, among other masterpieces. The collection is open only on
Tuesday and Friday afternoons from 2pm to 5pm but alone is worth a trip to
Zurich.
If North American Indians are of special interest, the Indianermuseum in
Feldstrasse 89, with some 1,400 items in part of an old schoolhouse, is
worth a visit. On the same theme, try to find the Museum Leuengasse in
Leuengasse 10. This unusual exhibition space - it is an old nuclear bomb
shelter - is devoted exclusively to North and South American Indian and
Eskimo art and culture. It houses not only ancient works but also the
occasional contemporary artists on two levels proceeding ever deeper into
the earth.
In addition to these formal collections, the city's main churches are
repositories of wonderful works of art.
The 12th-century Fraumunster in Munsterhof is best known for the narrow
stained glass windows created by Marc Chagall in the chancel and south
transept and by Augusto Giacometti in the north transept. If you have time,
you can see the remains of the Romanesque cloisters on the south side of the
church, decorated with frescoes by Paul Bodmer representing the legend of
the foundation of the abbey as well as that of Grossmunster and the
Wasserkirch.
Across the Munsterbridge the Grossmunster cathedral, with the south tower
crowned by a colossal statue of Charlemagne, can be clearly seen. The
Grossmunster also dates from the Carolingian period, and it was here that
Huldrych Zwingli set off the Reformation in 1519.
The bronze doors of the north and south portals are by Edvard Munch and
inside are stained glass windows by Augusto Giacometti. The crypt under the
choir is the best example of early Romanesque architecture in Switzerland,
and it contains the original statue of Charlemagne. The one on the south
tower is a copy.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (14): In search of antiques - The best
places in which to find old masters, silver plate, old books, antique
furniture and other objects of value - and some advice on what to look for
in the city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Zurich is an attractive hunting ground for antique lovers. The leading shops
are concentrated in the area between Ramistrasse and Niederdorf and around
Paradeplatz. They deal in old masters, antique furniture, silver, porcelain,
non-European art and old books.
The best address for old masters from the Dutch baroque, early Renaissance
and Venetian painting schools is David Koetser in Talstrasse 37. Koetser is
the youngest member of a art-dealing dynasty of Anglo-Dutch descent.
Inside Koetser's distinguished but unobtrusive premises you will find the
whole palette of artists from the Golden Age.
Craggy peaks under stormy skies point to Joost de Momper. Cheery skaters
frolic on the ice in front of a wintry village scene with snow-covered
houses - the sort of subjects that could stem from Hendrick Avercamp or
Pieter Brueghel the younger.
Jan Brueghel the Older liked to create rich vegetation in typical
turquoise-brown contrast dotted with tiny figures. Scenes from the Old
Testament or mythology were often painted with minute finesse.
Grandiose landscapes with the melancholy or serene atmospheres of Salomon
and Jacob van Ruysdael hang opposite an endless range of still-life works
painted by Jan Davidsz de Heem, Pieter Claesz or Jan van Kessel.
Between flowers and fruit, wine goblets and oysters, you will find fine
droplets of water glittering, delicate insects crawling and cute mice
sitting up and begging. The prices range from SFr50,000 up to seven figures
and beyond.
The leading specialist in silver plate for the distinguished table is Fritz
Payer in Pelikanstrasse 6. Most of the pieces he offers are of German origin
from the 17th and 18th centuries, quite often partially gold-plated.
Figures and floral patterns on sideboard bowls, imposing carafes with
medallions, voluptuous lidded jugs and trophies with floral decoration in
filigree, solid mugs with emblems and curved handles provide a breath of
luxury to the discerning user. Prices go into five or six figures.
English and French furniture, flanked by objets d'art and 19th century
silver, is offered by the dealer pair Monica Hellman and Richard Redding in
Strehlgasse 9 - again for prices in five or six figures.
A rare carriage clock made of marble and gold-plated bronze in the shape of
a graceful lyre costs SFr55,000. The signature on the enamel clockface is
Robert Robin, clockmaker to the King in Paris (approx 1785).
Or you may prefer a heavy silver mustard holder from Napoleon Bonaparte for
SFr25,000. The engraved hallmark promises highest quality craftsmanship. Or
how about a superbly decorative pair of wine carafes of crystal and gold
plated silver, specially created by Christofle for the World Exhibition in
Amsterdam in 1883 and now going for SFr45,000?
In 1898 Elkington &amp; Co created an exceptional solid silver bowl - decorated
with a scene from mythology and featuring two panthers audaciously bent over
the rim. Price SFr28,000.
British noblesse or Asian meditation radiate from the furniture, sculptures
and objects at Robert Hafter, St. Peterstr. 10.
Hafter has a broad range of Buddha statues, some of which feature costly
gold plating. A bronze Buddha head from Thailand, Sukhothai (14-15th
century) costs SFr12,000, while a sitting Buddha made of wood with gold
setting (around 1800 from Burma) has SFr10,000 on the price tag.
A Tibetan casket with dragon decoration in black and gold on red background
(17th century) costs SFr9,000. A mahogany bookcase, Regency, created around
1810, is priced at SFr38,000.
The little mahogany 'Drum table' of the same period (around 1815) is a
charming and versatile piece costing SFr12,000, and an oil lamp in the shape
of a young Greek (around 1810) costs SFr7,800.
Marguerite Iseli-Mooser is the leader in Zurich in the area of antique
furniture from the Louis XV and Transition periods. Her business, Arts et
Decors in Kirchgasse 33, is a pearl.
A bewitching small chest of drawers created by Maitre Louis-Noel Malle in
Paris 1765 is an example of the highest level of craftmanship. Richly
decorated with inlays in precious woods of musical instruments, amphora
flowers and geometric patterns, and with brass handles and a marble top,
this piece costs SFr136,000.
A further small commode (1765-1770) from Paris is remarkable for its oak
base, worked with rosewood with maple inlay. This decorative piece which
features the original handles and an original grey-white marble top is on
offer for SFr52,000.
Two charming Transition gueridons also await a discerning buyer. One of them
bears the mark of Jean-Pierre Dusautoy (1719-1800) and is veneered and
richly inlaid a la reine (with coloured exotic wood) for SFr65,000.
The other gueridon for SFr48,000 has oak bodywork with rosewood veneer. Both
are crowned with a gilt, perforated gallery, chutes and sabots and a white
and grey marble top.
The cheaper piece may not have any inlay work, but offers a pull-out writing
top with leather inlay inside the drawers.
A few houses further down at Kirchgasse 31 is Fortuna Galerie. Here Margit
Szechenyi offers decorative graphic art contrasting with fascinating
antiques from the Mediterranean area.
An Etruscan, early Hellenic pair of anthropomorphic handles made in bronze
(330-280 BC) with beautiful rust-red patina draw attention. The finely
modelled figures of young men probably served as handles on a carafe or an
amphora.
Their hair falls to the rim of the vessel providing a frame for the broad
strong faces. The price is SFr40,000 for the pair.
The late-Etruscan-Hellenic silver on bronze bottle dated 2nd or 3rd century
BC, once containing perfume, would grace a museum. Ornamental strips are
laid over the smooth base ring. It is priced at SFr28,000. Worth a mention
among the graphic art is a charming lithograph called 'Zurich from the
vantage point Waid' which shows the town embedded in green fields and
pastures. It stems from Lemercier in Paris around 1860 and costs SFr20,000
framed.
A picturesque view of old 'Zurich with Paradeplatz' dated 1950, from a print
by Johann Konrad Werdmuller and part of a series of views of old Zurich,
costs just SFr1,200.
Hellmut Schumann AG, Ramistrasse 25, offers antiquarian books. This
establishment is a leader in the field of rare manuscripts and books, 15th
to 19th century literature and a wide range of Helvetica.
For SFr25,000 there is a large one-side printed woodcut from an 'Ars
Moriendi' book (around 1470) on offer, originating from Niederrhein in
north-west Germany. The Master ES has caught for posterity the fate of a man
on his deathbed being tempted by three demons. The Latin title says that
there is no hope of salvation.
Giovanni Alessandro Brambilla compiled an 'Instrumentarium chirurgicum
Viennense' (SFr23,500) published by Matthias Andreas Schmidt in 1781 and
containing hundreds of illustrations by Ferdinand Landerer.
In Bernhard von Breydenbach's 'Peregrinationes in Terram Sanctam' published
by Peter Drach in Speyer in 1505 (SFr65,000) you can discover one of the
most famous pilgrimages to the Holy Land and to the Catherine Monastery on
Mount Sinai.
'Der Romische Carneval' (1789) is judged to be Goethe's most imposing work.
An edition with title illustration by Heinrich Lips and 20 coloured copper
engravings by Georg Melchior Kraus from Johann Georg Schutz is on offer for
SFr45,000.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (13): How to raise the heartbeat - The
hilly city of Zurich and its environs provide plenty of opportunities for
those who wish to take exercise - ranging from walking trails to skiing and
wind-surfing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In many cities these days, the better hotels provide guests with jogging
maps and other guides to help them get some exercise while on a business
trip.
In Zurich, this would be largely redundant. The city is blessed with
beautiful parks with well-marked walking and jogging trails. A fair portion
of its streets is given over to cyclists and the surrounding countryside is
ideally suited for day or half-day walks.
Slightly further afield, the highest Alps beckon to those who have at least
a full day for recreation.
Zurich is also a hilly city, so it is possible to raise the heartbeat just
by walking about or cycling. Good bicycles can be hired from main railway
stations throughout Switzerland.
For walkers and joggers, the park of choice is the Zurichberg, the large
hill rising on the east side of the city, with trails of varying lengths
well indicated, and a vertical rise from downtown of over 200 metres. Two
tram lines (5 and 6) run to the excellent zoo at the southern edge of the
park.
For swimmers, there are two Olympic length public indoor pools, the
Hallenbad at Sihlstrasse 71 in the city centre and the Club Intersport in
Oerlikon. Most visitors will be impressed by the cleanliness, efficiency and
swimming discipline at the Hallenbad, but locals feel it is less than
immaculate and they complain about having to slalom around the idlers there.
They much prefer the wider pool at Oerlikon where they can stay well clear
of the layabouts.
In summer, swimming in the Lake of Zurich is a treat, with changing rooms
(Badanstalt) conveniently located on both the east and west shores.
From November to March, a low band of fog hangs over the city almost
constantly. By the end of the working week, Zurichers have had enough and
head for the mountains to get above it. Visitors, too, may feel the need.
Depending on the height of the fog band, you may not have to go very far.
Sometimes, it is enough to take a train of the private
Sihltal-Zurich-Uetliberg (SZU) line from the main station to the Uetliberg.
Its peak is only 16 kilometres to the south-west of the city, but at an
altitude of 870 metres, 465 metres above the lake.
Trains run every half hour - more frequently in rush hours - and the trip
takes less than half an hour. (This line achieves the steepest grade in
Europe for an adhesion railway, 70 metres per kilometre.)
From the top of the Uetliberg, there is a delightful ridge walk south about
20km to Sihlbrugg, with several opportunities to break off sooner and catch
another SZU train back from one of the Sihl valley stations.
The scope for full day outings from Zurich is much greater, thanks to the
country's excellent train and Postauto (bus) services.
Popular destinations start with Rigi, an 1,800 metre peak rising from the
Lake of Zug to the east and the Lake of Lucerne to the west. A dense network
of cogwheel trains and cable cars gets you to the top where the views of the
Alps are suitably spectacular. There is plenty of space for gentle walks and
several restaurants.
Slightly further afield are Pilatus (2,100 metres), Burgenstock (1,100
metres) and Engelberg (up to 3,200 metres on the Titlis glacier), but the
facilities and charms are much the same as those at Rigi. The Swiss Federal
Railways offer special day packages from Zurich to all of these areas.
In the winter, the railways also offer day trip skiing packages from the
main station to nearby resorts, including Andermatt, Arosa, Engelberg and
Klosters. The package includes a day ski pass at a ridiculous discount,
making it among the few bargains to be had in Switzerland.
In the spring and summer, motorcyclists flock to the many roads over
mountain passes, revelling in the endless hairpin turns. Visitors can join
in the fun, as the local dealers of the main brands are willing to rent
bikes, fully insured, by the day.
Wind-surfing enthusiasts go to the Urner See, the south leg of the Lake of
Lucerne, which benefits from constant strong winds funnelling down the Reuss
valley from the Gotthard massif. Boards can be hired on the edge of the lake
at Fluelen from Surfcenter Jauch (tel 044-29-222).

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (11): Lobster might creep off the plate
 -A close look at two of the best restaurants in the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best restaurant within the city of Zurich these days is, by general
consent, Tubli, a small establishment in a narrow street in Niederdorf
behind the city's leading fishmonger's shop.
Lights strung along the wall of the restaurant twinkle brightly, providing a
warm welcome in an otherwise dark alley. The warmth continues inside, where
the small staff seem genuinely pleased to see you and seek throughout the
evening to sustain a quietly festive atmosphere.
The restaurant is in a small room, with low vaulted ceilings and probably
only a dozen tables. The walls are bare white, but for a few pictures of
pigeons (Tubli means little pigeon in Swiss German).
The menu is utter simplicity. There is a single daily fixed price
seven-course programme, with the option to take fewer courses for reduced
prices. The menu consists of pasta and salad courses alternating with two
fish courses and ending up with pigeon, all for SFr145 (about Pounds 65 or
Dollars 96) per person.
For vegetarians or others who insist on something else, Mr Martin Surbeck,
the enthusiastic young chef, aims to please.
We both had the menu, and found everything fresh and pleasantly presented,
but nothing particularly memorable. We also felt slightly cramped under the
vaults and found ourselves whispering to each other.
No such inhibitions emerged at Petermann's Kunststube, a roadside restaurant
cum contemporary art gallery in the lakeside suburb of Kusnacht, a 10-minute
drive from the city centre.
This restaurant, too, is quite small, but the high ceilings, warm dark
panelled wainscotting, immense vase of fresh flowers by the entry and
well-separated tables give a sense of relaxed spaciousness. The clientele
seemed more the comfortable suburban horsey set whereas at Tubli one felt
among the earnestly upwardly mobile.
And from the arrival of the complimentary duck pate on tomato aspic hors
d'oeuvre, one has an expectation of something special. As at Tubli, there
was a set six-course meal, complete with cheeses and Creme brule, for
SFr160, but there is also a substantial a la carte selection, which we also
sampled.
As befits a restaurant attached to an art gallery, the presentation of many
of the courses was outstanding, usually on delicate Paloma Picasso plates.
The lasagne lobster looked as if he might just creep off the plate; a course
featuring a slice of veal pate was composed in such a way that it could be
admired from every angle. The seafood consomme was delightfully tangy and
the beef in a light balsamic vinegar sauce a discovery.
The cheeses were mainly standard Swiss and French, but very fresh. A
chocolate glazed pear on a bed of fruit and praline sauces was more
memorable - and not only visually - than the creme brule.
Alas, although the restaurant was not full, the service occasionally
flagged, and we ended up waiving coffee rather than extend our visit beyond
four hours.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (12): A chance to eat, drink and be
merry - Alan Bridgman samples two top Italian restaurants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN BRIDGMAN

<TEXT>
Il Giglio is a fairly recent arrival on the Zurich scene and is managed by a
young team. Casa Ferlin, on the other hand, which dates back to 1907, is
still owned and operated by the Ferlin family and their long-serving staff.
Il Giglio is a little off the beaten track in a less attractive part of
Zurich, near Stauffacher. The dining room does not have a specially warm
atmosphere, but is very reminiscent of many restaurants in Italy in its
austerity.
First courses include antipasto, a plate of undistinguished cold vegetables,
some fried in oil. But the prawns in batter (gamberetti) (SFr14) on a green
salad were delicious.
For those who like their pasta with a 'bite', the linguine mare (SFr16) were
acceptable, if rather chewy. The plate-sized pasta triangle filled with
ricotta and basil, however, was perfect (SFr12).
The beef tournedos with aceto balsamico (SFr36), a speciality, was
beautifully tender, but the scaloppine al limone (SFr27) was too drenched in
lemon juice to have its own flavour.
Full marks to the waitress who immediately offered and quickly brought a
plain grilled veal dish in replacement.
The choice of desserts was not enormous, but strictly Italian. Panna cotta
was excellent, and there were various fruit-flavoured sorbets. The
restaurant also offers a choice of dessert wines by the glass.
The wines available were from all over Italy at prices from SFr34 to SFr130
a bottle. The Vino Nobile di Montepulciano (SFr42) was agreeable, although
the year we asked for was not available despite being on the list.
On arriving at Casa Ferlin, which is a short walk from the main station and
the Bahnhofstrasse, one cannot but be impressed by the warm and welcoming
atmosphere exuded by the dark red walls, and the oil lamps alight on every
table.
The service is friendly and personal, in a relaxed way that the young and
less experienced staff of Il Giglio will no doubt learn with time.
The menu here is more international, although the specialities of the house
are typical Italian dishes. Unfortunately, the main specialities of the
house (including filetto di vitello al limone) are available only for a
minimum of two persons.
We started with a half portion of the locally famous home-made meat-filled
ravioli (SFr17), and a half-portion of fettucine alla panna (SFr14), and
were not disappointed. For our main course we chose the piccata alla marsala
(SFr36), which was pleasant if not memorable, and an excellent veal
medaillon at SFr45, with mushrooms (funghi porcini), spinach and saffran
risotto.
These dishes were accompanied by a good if overpriced 1981 Chianti (SFr58).
The restaurant's other name happens to be Chiantiquelle, or source of
Chianti, and the wine list mentions a number of vintages, mostly from the
same grower. There is also a reasonable selection of other wines from Italy
and elsewhere.
Our dessert was a zabaglione of outstanding quality (SFr11), accompanied by
a Vinsanto dessert wine (Antinori).
Both these restaurants were full when we visited, but we had to book a day
in advance for Casa Ferlin, which suggests that many people appreciate its
qualities.
Casa Ferlin, Stampfenbachstrasse 38, tel 362-3509.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (9): All your needs can be satisfied -
A plethora of specialist retailers, offering something for everyone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN BRIDGMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich is well endowed with specialist shops, and they are a delight for the
knowledgeable shopper, partly because the staff are also knowledgeable, but
also because they usually have the time and willingness to explore all of
your needs.
If you want to buy climbing rope 'off the reel' - try Seilerei Denzler in
Torgasse. Buy your walking or climbing boots at Schuhhaus Grab just round
the corner in Oberdorfstrasse - the staff there will patiently search for
just the right fit and make you balance on the edge of the stairs to test
how far forward your foot moves.
For ski equipment, Fritsch in Rennweg, Och in Bahnhofstrasse and Max Eiselin
in Stampfenbachstrasse are the leaders. Beach Mountain at Birmensdorferstr.
21 are the snowboard specialists.
For advice on fishing rods and bait go to Fischerei &amp; Sportartikel,
appropriately situated on the corner of Burkliplatz at the edge of the Lake
of Zurich.
Browse through an awe-inspiring array of buttons and buckles at Keck in
Oetenbachgasse off Rennweg or choose a decorative silver-topped wine cork
with a sporting or culinary motif from H. Meng, also in Rennweg. They have a
fascinating choice of silver thimbles, too.
For upmarket desk accessories for the executive who has everything, look in
Papeterie Landolt-Arbenz in Bahnhofstrasse.
You can find some unusual gifts in the Messer Dolmetsch shops - Shop-Ville
under Bahnhofplatz, Bahnhofstrasse and Limmatquai - where you will be
stunned to see so many types of scissors (there's even a pair to cut the top
off your boiled egg) and, of course, a full line of Swiss Army knives.
Drogerie Wernle in Augustinergasse specialises in candles in any shape, size
or colour.
If you want to please a philatelist friend, choose a first-day cover with
one of the Swiss stamp series from the Post Office shop in
Fraumunsterstrasse, first floor.
Zigarren Durr on Bahnhofplatz sells cigars to customers from all over the
world and has a good selection of pipes and tobacco.
There are several model railway specialists ready to give highly technical
advice - look in at Paul Aebi, Schrennengasse 37; Peter Schneebeli in
General-Willestrasse or the special sections in the big toyshops.
Musical instruments are at Hug, Limmatquai and Jecklin in Ramistrasse. At
Rascher in Marktgasse in Niederdorf you will find experts on all types of
watercolours, oils, paint for airbrushes and every type of canvas or drawing
paper.
Beautiful topographical maps are a Swiss speciality. The high-quality
printing makes them so decorative that many people buy them just because
they look good. Orell Fussli are the printers - they also print Swiss
banknotes - and you can buy the maps at their new bookshop in Susslistrasse.
The town's silver specialist is Silber Meister on Paradeplatz where the
daughters of old Zurich families still have lists left for their future
trousseaus. Starting with their christening, they are given bits of silver
on every occasion until they get married.
Pastorini, across the street from the Storchen Hotel on the left bank, has a
huge choice of well-made wooden toys - and specialises in doll house
furniture. The Franz Carl Weber store in Bahnhofstrasse probably has one of
the most comprehensive selections of toys in Europe, but avoid a visit on
Wednesday afternoons when Zurich's children get a half-day off.
Pewter has always been popular in Zurich - go to Braumandl in
Zahringerstrasse (Niederdorf), which specialises in wine carafes - a
different shape and style for every canton.
Leaded glass paintings to hang in a window are typically Swiss creations,
mainly of family coats of arms, or cantonal flags. Anton Christen's shop in
Hallwylstrasse is a main supplier.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (10): Even the well-educated use this
dialect - The mysteries of the Swiss German language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN BRIDGMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An English friend, visiting Zurich for the first time, got off the tram and
asked what the big argument had been about: why had her neighbours been
shouting?
Without realising it, she had been listening to a normal, civil conversation
in Swiss German. Zuri Tuutsch, to be precise, is one of many Allemanic
dialects in the country.
Visitors with some knowledge of German get completely frustrated with these
dialects, which seem so close, yet are so far, from proper German.
Zurichers politely reply in German if thus spoken to, but among themselves
they stick to dialect almost as if they are guarding a 'secret code' to
exclude all foreigners.
Before the first world war, it was considered a sign of culture in German
Switzerland to speak proper German - only the peasants and lower classes
spoke dialect with its extraordinarily guttural consonants and singsong
tone.
Educated Swiss felt themselves to be part of a greater German culture. Two
world wars have wrought a radical change in attitudes and the Swiss now have
a horror of being mistaken for Germans.
Thus, you have the bizarre phenomenon of well-educated German Swiss who can
speak virtually unaccented English, French and Italian, but who deliberately
put a heavy accent on their German.
The code is not that difficult to crack - although it is easier without a
foreknowledge of proper German.
In Zurich dialect, the 'au' sound, as in ouch, is usually pronounced 'oo' as
in boot. 'Ei', as in eye, is pronounced 'ee' as in feel. But if you follow
these rules slavishly, you can end up causing much hilarity when you say
'Stoobsooger' for Staubsauger or 'Bleestift' for Bleistift. For no obvious
reason, they are pronounced 'Staubsooger' and 'Blaystift'.
The suffix 'li', meaning little, gets tacked on to the end of all kinds of
unlikely nouns from 'Huusli' (toilet) to 'Guetsli' (biscuit). The past
participles in constant use are 'gsii' (gewesen) and 'ghaa' (gehabt).
There is a paucity of adjectives, reflecting the fact that this is a purely
oral language. Everything from the weather to a meal or a pretty girl will
be described as 'schon' (pretty or nice).
German speakers should not be surprised if they find it impossible to
recognise some words. Some common ones, such as 'Anke', meaning butter, come
from other sources.
Many French words have been incorporated, such as Billet for ticket and
Perron for platform. Merci and Adieu are commonly used. In recent years, as
elsewhere, many English words have been borrowed, especially in the youth
culture.
But the core remains strong. The Swiss will be bellowing 'Gruuezi mitenand'
at each other and at visitors for a long time to come.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (8): Where shopping can still be a
pleasure - This relatively small city offers exquisite and tranquil delights
for the discerning visitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN BRIDGMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even people who generally hate shopping will probably end up succumbing to
the charms of an excursion in Zurich.
Few places can boast so many interesting and well-stocked shops in a
concentrated space, a combination which reflects the extraordinary wealth
and earning power of this relatively small city. Moreover, apart from
Saturday mornings, Zurich shops and pavements are seldom crowded; shopping
here is not stressful.
There are three main shopping areas in the city centre; the Bahnhofstrasse,
the old town (Altstadt) and Niederdorf, although all three are within short
walking distance of each other and connected by the city's usually uncrowded
trams.
The Bahnhofstrasse is especially pleasant because it is a car-free zone, but
with tram services to take you from one end to the other.
Zurich's shop window displays are among the most exquisite in Europe. Window
shopping through the old town with its boutiques and many antique shops can
bring surprises - here a window full of broken pieces of mirror with some
sunglasses artistically arranged on top, there another with autumn fashions
cunningly strewn across banks of fallen leaves.
If you are tempted inside, you will find sales staff friendly, patient,
multilingual and knowledgeable about their particular type of merchandise.
Swiss sales staff do two years' apprenticeship in their special product area
to qualify for a job.
They will also gift-wrap anything you ask them to, be it a diamond ring or a
humble potato peeler.
Fashion
Swiss fashion shops tend to cater for discerning, fairly conservative buyers
 -but top quality materials and classic lines make up for any slight lack of
originality.
In so prosperous a city it is no surprise that many international names are
based in or around the golden mile, as the Bahnhofstrasse is sometimes
called: Chanel, Ungaro, Krizia, Cartier, Fendi, Jaeger, Burberry, Bally and
Benetton are all here.
Swiss establishments, such as Walter Gross, Weinberg, Grieder Les Boutiques
(which sells couturiers' lines), Oskar Rom (fabulous evening gowns),
Goldschmidt and Gassmann all stock high-class fashions and are worth a
visit.
Slightly down the scale is Modissa (take a peep at the vast pullover section
on the ground floor, with every imaginable shade), Wollen Keller,
Sturzenegger (special blouses), and Handar, all in Bahnhofstrasse, within a
stone's throw of each other.
There are three department stores on the golden mile - Globus, Jelmoli and
Vilan. Although it recently had a face lift, Jelmoli has the most
traditional, 'you can find anything here' image. Globus's range is less
comprehensive but has a definite style and everything is colour co-ordinated
(the kitchen and tableware department alone is worth a visit), and Vilan
tries to appeal to the young.
Go up to the rooftop restaurant in Vilan where you can admire the scenic
view over the town and rest your tired feet in a conservatory - alas,
without the Palm Court orchestra.
As in London, there is an incredible number of shoe shops in Zurich. The
Italian designers are especially popular. Without leaving Bahnhofstrasse,
you will find exclusive and beautiful shoes at Bruno Magli, Ferragamo,
Pedrino, Flair 2000, Michel, Moda Parade and, of course, Bally.
Much of Limmatquai, along the right bank of the river at the edge of
Niederdorf is devoted to shoes and watches, occasionally interspersed with
sidewalk cafes and casual clothes warehouses, blaring deafening pop music.
Not surprisingly, Zurich is particularly well endowed with shops selling
Swiss watches, where you will be served with endless patience, whether you
want a SFr20,000 diamond wristwatch or a crazy Swatch for SFr50.
For handbags look in at Fendi or Maedler, both on Paradeplatz, or walk a few
steps to Leder Locher on Munsterhof. It is next door to the most beautiful
baroque building in Zurich, the guildhall Zunfthaus zur Meise.
For underwear try Kowa or Perosa or the lingerie floors in the department
stores. Silk foulards are at Leonardo's in Bahnhofstrasse or Seiden
Fenigstein.
And when it all becomes too much, you can rest your feet in Paradeplatz and
watch the trams go by, at chairs and tables provided by Credit Suisse.
Food
You can find Swiss hand-made chocolates in imaginative packages at any of
the Confiserie Sprungli branches around the town, at Teuscher in
Storchengasse 9 or Hefti in Bahnhofstrasse.
All department stores offer a variety of chocolate gifts, and Merkur in
Bahnhofstrasse specialises in whimsical packaging for all occasions.
Migros is the biggest supermarket chain in Switzerland and their basement
food hall in Migros City, a glass and marble shopping centre in
Lowenstrasse, is a showcase.
The rows of mink-coated women at the checkout on a Saturday morning,
especially before Christmas and the new year, are clear testimony that here
one finds the freshest - as well as the cheapest - lobster and smoked salmon
in town.
Cheese shops abound - take home a specially put together mix of grated
cheese for your next fondue from Chas Hebise in Rennweg, or choose from the
huge selection downstairs in Globus's food hall.
Leave some time to stroll through the city's open flower, fruit and
vegetable market on a Tuesday or Friday morning on Burkliplatz at the
lakeside (7-11am). The Swiss are enthusiastic about 'bio' produce (no
chemicals used in cultivation) and the market is usually packed with
housewives picking out exactly the tomato or apple they want (the
stallholders don't complain).

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (7): Noted for foreign talent - The
music scene: Zurich offers a varied repertoire, and performances should be
good. But don't expect the avant garde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich's private banks, Alpine views and chocolate truffes may be
unmistakably Swiss, but its musical life is heavily dependent on imported
talent. That gives it a more international character than most European
cities of comparable size.
Insecure about their own artistic merits, the Swiss have used their money to
tap into Europe's cultural mainstream. In return, Zurich has provided
foreign artists from Wagner onwards with a haven of wealth and stability.
This means that, while Zurich may not be the cradle of the avant garde, it
offers dependable performances, varied repertoire and appreciative
audiences. For the visitor in search of a civilised evening, the Opera House
and the Tonhalle concert hall are the places to be. Both were built a
century ago by the Viennese architectural team of Fellner and Helmer, whose
sense of proportion and stucco ceiling decorations provide a handsome
central European atmosphere.
The Opera House, situated next to the lake, is run on a semi-stagione basis
not unlike Covent Garden. The season comprises around 25 operas, each
performed in a properly rehearsed series. In any given week, you might have
three operas and a ballet to choose from, perhaps with a song recital or
chamber music concert on a Monday.
Casts are a mixture of youth and experience. Zurich may be a small speck on
the map for Pavarotti and Domingo, but it regularly attracts divas such as
Agnes Baltsa and Gwyneth Jones. This season's highlights include Verdi's
'Falstaff' staged by Jonathan Miller, Handel's 'Alcina' conducted by
Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Mozart's 'Le nozze di Figaro' with Ruggero
Raimondi.
Performances are sung in the original language without surtitles - but the
programme-sellers will provide an English synopsis free of charge. The
theatre has good acoustics and an attractive neo-baroque lay-out, with
galleries and side-boxes. The best seats and sight-lines are in the central
and rear stalls, which cost up to SFr200 (Pounds 90). You can eat before the
performance in Belcanto, the upbeat Italian restaurant attached to the
theatre, but nearby hotels and restaurants offer a more relaxed meal after
the performance - as long as you book in advance.
Zurich's opera public is smart and cosmopolitan. The atmosphere at the
Tonhalle is more sedate. Like the Opera House, the exterior of the building
has been spoilt by redevelopment, but the interior - a shoe-box design with
a resonant acoustic - is magnificently intact. The Tonhalle Orchestra has a
distinguished history and a well-blended sound. Its problem is complacency:
it hardly ever tours or makes records, and is run by a variety of
commissions and committees - a very Swiss arrangement which militates
against dynamic artistic leadership.
Audiences are dominated by subscription-holders, but each programme is given
three or four times, so tickets are never hard to find. A good seat in the
body of the hall costs around SFr100 (Pounds 45). The standard of guest
conductors and soloists is comparable to a good regional orchestra in
Britain. This season's highlights are a Lutoslawski cycle and a series
pairing the conductor-oboeist Heinz Holliger with the pianist Andras Schiff.
A big shake-up is expected when the American conductor David Zinman takes
over as chief conductor in 1995, the Tonhalle's centenary.
Zurich has several good choral societies, and the Zurich Chamber Orchestra
gives concerts about once a month, often with instrumental soloists of the
old school. Both the Tonhalle and the Migros retail co-operative promote
concerts by touring orchestras, and there some high-powered recitals - but
to get a good seat you have to book well in advance.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (5): There's a yen for business cards -
Business etiquette: It reduces a host's anxiety if you arrive early and are
as fully briefed on the Swiss as they will be on you, advises Ian Rodger.
Indeed, the parallels with Tokyo are surprisingly close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When leaving Tokyo for Zurich, nearly three years ago, I joked to friends
that this would not be a difficult move because the two cities were much
alike: clean, safe, expensive, blessed with dependable services and
inhabited by courteous, if inscrutable, natives.
I soon realised that this observation was actually quite perceptive. Zurich
is perhaps not as neurotically clean as Tokyo, but it is every bit as safe,
and public services are well maintained and a treat to use.
But the big surprise related to the natives. They are astonishingly like the
Japanese, especially in their business culture. They are, for example, only
fractionally slower than the Japanese to produce their business cards, and
nearly as earnest about studying them.
Swiss businessmen, like their Japanese counterparts, tend to preface any
conversation with a foreigner with a po-faced litany of the overwhelming
disadvantages and problems they face - including high labour costs, an
absence of natural resources and a paralysed government.
Japanese companies are famed for their consensus decision-making; Swiss
companies also prefer to go through a long process of consultation before
taking important decisions.
And the Swiss match the Japanese taste for nemawashi - preparing for every
meeting or conference with the most meticulous care. Do not be surprised if
you are asked for a curriculum vitae and a list of topics or questions
before meeting a senior corporate executive. And be as fully briefed as you
can on them. They will be fully briefed on you.
Needless to say, meetings occur punctually in Zurich, and it reduces a
host's anxiety if you arrive a little early. As in Japan, offices are
modest, even for chief executives. Meetings with outsiders tend to take
place in specially appointed meeting rooms.
The Swiss business set, like that in Japan, is overwhelmingly male and
misogynist. Women are used mainly for menial tasks and decoration. At a bank
press conference in Zurich a few months ago, visitors were greeted at the
door and guided about by immaculately groomed and identically uniformed
young women, each in a state of ill-concealed terror that she would put a
foot wrong. But for the prevalance of blonde hair and the absence of bowing,
one might have been in Tokyo.
As in Tokyo, the foreign company or bank setting up for business in Zurich
is obliged to have an opening party to which the city's business leaders are
invited and usually appear. All guests are presented with a gift as they
leave.
The Swiss corporate structure bears more than a passing resemblance to
Japan's keiretsu or loose networks of companies, although it would probably
be more accurate to see the Swiss structure as one single keiretsu, a sort
of Schweiz AG.
It is not uncommon to find the chairmen of two of the big three banks
sitting on the board of the same industrial company, or an industrialist on
two or three bank boards.
As in Japan, when Schweiz AG companies get into trouble, everyone closes
ranks to help out. Thus Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, and Mr
Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman of the Holderbank cement group, were helping
Swissair in its ultimately unsuccessful negotiations on joining forces with
three other European airlines.
At first glance, there would seem to be no reason why the two business
cultures would be so similar. They have certainly not had much impact on
each other historically, although General Douglas MacArthur promised when he
went to run the occupation administration in Japan after the second world
war that he would make it the Switzerland of Asia.
Socially, there are at least two intriguing similarities - cultural unity
and a strong egalitarian spirit. Before someone protests that the Swiss are
anything but mono-cultural, I should limit the claim to the German Swiss,
who make up 70 per cent of the population and rather more of the business
community.
And even though there are many sub-groups in Swiss German society, the men
at least are brought together in a very intense way through their compulsory
military service, just as the Japanese are in their gruelling education
system.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (6): Where to get to know your banker -
There may be no restaurant in the area worth a detour, but Ian Rodger offers
advice on where to eat in the city if you are in search of a memorable
evening out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One eats well in Zurich, but if an evening out is memorable, it more likely
to be for the company or the atmosphere of the restaurant rather than for
the cuisine.
It is safe to say that there is no restaurant in the Zurich area that is
'worth a trip in its own right' as the Michelin Guide would have it, and
probably none that is 'worth a detour'. That is perhaps as it should be in a
city that still lives very much by Protestant virtues.
Public restaurants also suffer from the loss of a large part of the most
desirable clientele. This is because private bankers would not dream of
taking their rich clients to a restaurant, for fear a competitor would see
them.
Conversely, many rich people would not like to reveal their status by being
seen in the company of a private banker. Thus, some of the city's best
tables can be found in the banks.
Reviews of four of the Zurich area's top restaurants, all of which will
certainly fulfil the needs of a special evening, appear elsewhere in this
survey, on page 10.
Swiss ambience and cuisine are at their best in the Rotisserie of the Hotel
zum Storchen. The restaurant overlooks the Limmat and, on a rare clear
evening, one can see past the lake to the Alps. At night, a fairytale
atmosphere prevails, as the river lights twinkle and the illuminated old
facades of Niederdorf on the opposite bank are reflected in the water.
Try to get a table by the window or - in summer - on the terrace. Nowhere
will you find the traditional Zurich speciality, Zurcher Geschnetzeltes -
thin slices of veal in a rich cream sauce with rosti potatoes - better
prepared.
Other purely Zurich-style culinary experiences can be found in the Zunft
houses (guild halls), the best being the Zunfthaus zur Waag in Munsterhof
and the Zunfthaus zum Ruden on Limmatquai. In both cases, the prices are
adjusted upwards for the medieval atmosphere.
The Kronenhalle at Bellevue, once one of the finest restaurants in town, has
lost a bit of its flair since the passing of its legendary foundress, Hulda
Zumsteg. But it still serves a good meal and is worth a visit anyway just to
sit among some outstanding paintings of Chagall, Miro, Matisse, Klee and
Braque.
For fondues and other simple Swiss dishes, try Walliser Kanne in
Lintheschergasse or Walliser Keller in Zahringerstrasse. For Grison
delicacies, it is Bundnerstube in Nuschlerstrasse.
Italian restaurants have a long and distinguished tradition in Zurich,
reflecting the immigration of thousands of Italians to the city in the
1950s. They range from cheap and cheerful pizzerias to exclusive
establishments. Standards are high in all categories, reflecting the fierce
competition.
For a quiet, elegant business lunch or dinner, try Conti da Bianca in
Dufourstrasse behind the Opera (their lobster spaghetti is a revelation), or
Piccoli Accademia near Stauffacher (where the calves' liver Veneziana is a
speciality and the Zabaglione a marvel).
Hard by Paradeplatz, established bankers eat at Orsini, while up-and-coming
colleagues frequent Bindella or Contrapunto. The cachet of the latter two
establishments is likely to rise next year as their owner, Mr Rudi Bindella,
figures in a trial of a former city restaurant inspector for taking bribes.
For a light lunch and all the business news, go to the Investors Club in
Nuschlerstrasse, and after work to the James Joyce pub, both establishments
maintained lovingly by Union Bank of Switzerland, whose headquarters are
only a few steps away.
For seafood, the Hummer Bar in the St Gotthard Hotel rates highly and has a
warm, clubby atmosphere. Nouvelle cuisine and and a hip atmosphere combine
well in a refurbished mill at Tiefenbrunnen called the Blaue Ente, while
Kaufleuten in Pelikanplatz offers a bistro style.
Zurich is not much of a town for fast food. There are three McDonald's
outlets, but no chicken emporiums. Zurichers on the run grab a slice of
pizza from the occasional sidewalk vendors or stop at the Vorderer Sternen
stand at Bellevue for the best bratwurst in the world.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (4): Private banking provides fuel -
Finance: Managing the private fortunes of the rich is the sector's
speciality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich is synonymous with finance in most people's minds, yet an uninformed
visitor would be surprised to hear that this is Europe's second most
important financial centre after London.
The city is not dominated by grand banking halls, either new or old, and the
average banker walking along the Bahnhofstrasse is more likely to be wearing
flannels and a sports jacket than the sober dark suit that prevails in the
City of London. As for pinstripes and bowler hats, a gnome who was so
attired would be laughed out of Paradeplatz.
Secondly, for the non-German-speaking visitor, the names on the big Swiss
banks that have their headquarters in Zurich bear no relation to their
international brand names, and are somewhat intimidating as well. The
well-known Credit Suisse, for example, becomes transformed into
Schweizerische Kreditanstalt, or SKA, as it is known locally.
Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation have confusingly
exchanged names, UBS becoming Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft while SBC,
which is in fact based in Basle, calls itself Schweizerischer Bankverein.
Most financial centres are known for being compact, enabling participants to
walk to all their deal-making meetings. Zurich's is especially so, with
virtually every institution enclosed in the triangle formed by the rivers
Limmat and Sihl and the Lake of Zurich.
For most visitors, nothing more exotic than a currency conversion will be
required, and most downtown bank branches are ever ready to do this -
usually in a number of languages - with a minimum of fuss.
The main attractions of Zurich's financial centre are its private banking
services. The city is host to dozens of banks that specialise in managing
the private fortunes of the rich.
Private banking has been a speciality of the Swiss for nearly a century, the
country having initially been a safe haven from the wars and bouts of wild
inflation that ravaged Europe in the first half of the century.
In the post-war period, Switzerland's role became more that of a haven for
rich people seeking to avoid paying taxes in their home countries and, in
some instances, seeking to hide funds gained from criminal activities. Also,
until the 1980s, Switzerland was nearly unique among European countries in
allowing total freedom of capital movement.
In recent years, with the rising concern about drug money laundering, the
Swiss have tightened their banking laws and regulations so that it is no
longer possible for criminals to hide their money in anonymous accounts or
to insulate themselves from international criminal investigations.
This, together with the development of other havens and an increasing demand
from clients for good investment performance, has made life tougher for the
Swiss private banks. But they have managed to retain a leading market share
in this very attractive business. According to various recent studies, they
still look after about a third of all funds placed by rich individuals
outside their home countries.
Zurich is just one of four centres of private banking in Switzerland. Geneva
is probably slightly larger in this sector, appealing more naturally to
clients from the Middle East, the Mediterranean countries and Latin America
than Zurich.
Lugano is the centre used by Italians, while Zurich and Basle appeal mainly
to Germans, east Europeans and, to some extent, clients from North America.
The Zurich scene is particularly competitive. The big Swiss universal banks
are leading players in their own right as well as through subsidiaries such
as Bank Leu, Bank Hofmann and Clariden Bank in the case of Credit Suisse, or
Bank Cantrade and Hyposwiss in the case of UBS.
Then there are the Swiss specialists, such as Bank Julius Baer and Bank J.
Vontobel, and a long list of outlets of foreign banks, including Barclays,
National Westminster (Coutts), Midland (Guyerzeller) and Rothschild from the
UK.
Private banking throughout Switzerland provides much of the fuel that drives
other aspects of the Zurich financial centre. For example, it gives the
banks huge placing power, enabling them to absorb much larger bond issues
than would normally be expected in a country of this size - and financial
prudence.
That has attracted a large number of foreign investment banks, especially
from Japan, to the city. Starting in the mid-1980s, several Japanese
companies used the Swiss franc market to float bonds, largely because the
rules were then simpler than those prevailing at home.
Since then, borrowers from other countries have joined in and the business
has ebbed and flowed, depending on the competitiveness of swap rates from
Swiss francs into other currencies.
In the late 1980s, the main Swiss financial markets - in foreign currencies
and equities - lost considerable ground to London and other centres, mainly
because of the government's refusal to remove transaction taxes, but also
because of the lack of liquidity.
In the past few years, the Swiss have fought back gamely and with
considerable success to revitalise their markets. Four of the seven regional
stock exchanges have been closed and Zurich's dominates.
By early 1995, a national electronic exchange will replace all the remaining
open-outcry exchanges, a move which could win back a lot of activity from
London. The Zurich exchange moved into a new building only last year, and it
is well worth a visit before the electronic exchange turns it into a white
elephant.
For its part, the government has removed or reduced many of the transaction
taxes, although bankers still grumble that they are at a disadvantage to
other financial centres that do not impose such taxes.
The government has also significantly eased the conditions on granting work
permits to foreigners, a move that has contributed significantly, along with
the improved liquidity, to the rapid development of lively derivatives
markets in Zurich.
The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex), now just over
five years old, is the third-largest option exchange in Europe and has the
second most successful product, an option on the Swiss stock market's SMI
index.
Both the quoted and over-the-counter derivative markets have also become
extremely active, with foreign as well as local banks bringing out new
issues regularly.
It all means that Zurich is not likely to be easily displaced as Europe's
second-largest international financial centre.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (2): A harder line on drugs - The
city's policies have been tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich's hard drug scene became infamous throughout the world in the late
1980s because the city's Pink-Green government adopted a liberal policy
towards its surprisingly large addict population.
Soon, gruesome photographs appeared in international newspapers and
magazines, spoiling the city's image for order and perfection in all things.
Tourism plunged, and the city's business community protested bitterly about
the policy and the associated petty crime that was driving visitors away.
Today, the Pink-Green coalition is still in power and the liberal policy is
still largely intact, although with some significant modifications.
For one thing, Zurich has driven away non-resident addicts, thus
substantially reducing the concentration of addicts and dealers. And it has
stepped up rehabilitation programmes, including from next year an experiment
in distributing low-cost heroin through legal channels.
For its part, the federal government has finally cracked down on asylum
seekers, mainly from the former Yugoslavia, who support themselves by
dealing in drugs.
In the past, it was impossible to subject these people to long imprisonment
or extradite them until their applications for asylum had been processed, so
they were often back in business shortly after being arrested. A new law
will soon make it possible to throw them out summarily.
From the visitor's point of view, there are two reassuring things about the
Zurich drug scene:
Addicts and dealers remain in a relatively derelict territory well away from
the main sightseeing and shopping areas.
There is remarkably little petty crime, such as shop break-ins, or mugging,
suggesting that most of the addicts are pretty well-heeled. Also, the Zurich
police force is deeply frustrated by orders from its political masters to go
easy on drug offences, and so it jumps with zeal on even the most minor
misdemeanour committed by these people. And the drug community knows it.
Visitors can examine the, admittedly depressing, scene quite safely, by
walking along Sihl Quai or Wasserwerkstrasse. It is probably best to do so
in daylight and in nondescript clothing.
What is less reassuring is the fact of the scene's existence, which seems
extraordinary in such a prosperous and well-organised place as Zurich.
Paradoxically, it seems, it is precisely this easy comfort and smooth
organisation that many young people cannot tolerate.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (3): High standards, high prices - Ian
Rodger explores the city's hotel scene and offers advice to the would-be
visitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hotelkeeping could be called a Swiss art.
Cosar Ritz, 'hotel-keeper to kings and king of hotelkeepers', as Edward VII
is said to have called him, was Swiss. And the Ecole hoteliere de Lausanne
is still the most respected institution in its field.
Its graduates, most of them Swiss, run many of the world's best hotels, so
it is only to be expected that hotels in Zurich have very high standards.
Unfortunately, prices also tend to be rather grand.
The city's most famous hotel is, undoubtedly, the Dolder Grand, perched
spectacularly on top of a hill of the same name, overlooking the city and
its lake.
The Dolder has its own nine-hole golf course and tennis courts. Nearby are
an outdoor pool in summer, an ice rink in winter and a funicular railway to
take you down to Romerhof near the city centre.
The Dolder, which wears its grandeur heavily, is fine if you have lots of
time and your Zurich contacts are content to come to you. But if you have to
be out and about in the city, it is inconvenient.
The city has five other luxury hotels, all of which are more in the swing of
things. The Baur (pronounced bore) au Lac at the bottom of Bahnhofstrasse is
probably the second ranked, and it combines the convenience of being in the
centre of the city with lush gardens overlooking the lake.
Le Pavilion restaurant in the garden is extremely pleasant, especially in
summer, but the atmosphere around the hotel otherwise is rather solemn.
The Savoy Baur en Ville, a short walk up the Bahnhofstrasse at Paradeplatz,
was founded by the same Austrian immigrant, Johann Baur, more than a century
ago, but is now controlled by Credit Suisse and run by Mr Manfred Horger
with style and warmth.
The Hotel Zurich on Neumuhlequai on the Limmat is the closest thing Zurich
has to a large, downtown, luxury, convention hotel. Housed in a nondescript
skyscraper, it comes complete with the inevitable piano bar and a medley of
interesting restaurants - a suave brasserie, a Thai emporium and a highly
rated Italian restaurant, Scala.
The Zurich is a bit of a trudge from the banks and boutiques of the
Bahnhofstrasse and Niederdorf, both physically and spiritually. Its upstream
neighbour is a pornographic cinema while 100 metres downstream can be found
the hard drug scene.
Among the several three- and four-star hotels in the downtown area, the
Storchen is much appreciated for its setting on the Limmat among the
boutiques of the old town. The Glockenhof in Sihlstrasse is close to all the
big department stores and the Seidenhof, also in Sihlstrasse, is teetotal.

FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (1): The pun that said it all - First
impressions: The city's calm and wealth mask tensions be neath the surface
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Except to those who pass through it often, such as fervent alpinists and
those whom Swiss bankers covetously refer to as high net worth individuals,
Zurich probably conjures up little more than images of heartless gnomes in
Spartan counting rooms conspiring to manipulate the world's financial
markets.
Even the city's exact location is something of a mystery - somewhere in the
Alps between Germany and Italy and close to - well, we are not quite sure
what it is close to.
Oddly, a first visit confirms this uncertainty. Whether the visitor arrives
by aeroplane, train or car, he or she quickly becomes disoriented. The city
is spread over a series of gentle pre-Alpine valleys where the waters flow
out of the Lake of Zurich from the river Limmat, which will be joined a few
hundred metres later by the river Sihl.
Roads meander up and down these valleys unpredictably rather than follow any
systematic pattern, making it difficult to maintain one's orientation. And
in the centre of the town, the presence of two rivers, plus the remains of a
long river-like moat, adds to the confusion.
A second impression is more reassuring. The city exudes a sense of calm and
confident order. There is a place for everything and everything is in its
place, and what is more, you will have to pay a quick SFr60 fine if your car
is not in the right place.
The first surprise, for many, may be that the city's proportions are so
modest. Few buildings exceed five storeys and few roads are wider than four
lanes. Zurich is the antithesis of the great monumental cities of Europe -
Paris, Berlin, Rome and Vienna.
Zurich has never had an empire, but it has always been associated with
money. Its early history can be traced to the site of Fort Lindenhof where
Roman soldiers established a tax collecting station called Turicum in 15BC.
Today, Zurichers play chess on giant boards in the pavement in the small
park above the Limmat, surrounded by ruins of the old fort.
Other landmarks in the city's history include seeing off the Habsburgs and
joining the Swiss confederation in 1351 and the Protestant reformation in
the first half of the 16th century, led by the still revered Huldrych
Zwingli.
The city's key figure in the 19th century was Alfred Escher, sometime
president of the cantonal government, founder of Schweizerische
Kreditanstalt (Credit Suisse) and financier extraordinaire, notably of the
railway tunnel through the Gotthard pass and of massive hydroelectric
projects in the Alps.
Were it not for Escher's prodigious efforts, Zurich might today be just
another relatively nondescript provincial European city - like, say,
Toulouse or Stuttgart.
But Zurich is still a financial centre to be reckoned with. Along its quiet
streets can be found the headquarters of two of the world's largest
international banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse, and two of
its largest insurance companies, Zurich Insurance and Swiss Reinsurance.
The wealth that they and several other Zurich-based banks and businesses
have brought have made the city the rather special place it is.
That wealth is not on display in great buildings or great plazas. Indeed,
there is very little distinguished architecture in Zurich, old or new.
Rather, reflecting the Protestant values that have long prevailed, wealth is
manifested discreetly, and only gradually does it become apparent to the
unsuspecting visitor.
It is, of course, in the Fraumunster church, with its exquisite stained
glass windows by Chagall and Giacometti. And it is in the splendid private
art collections, the astonishing variety of small, but excellent, museums
and the world-class music schedule, only made possible by the sponsorship of
the big banks and others.
Above all, it is in the shops. Few agglomerations of Zurich's size can boast
such a range of high quality shops. From antiques to fashions, every
specialised taste is catered for with skill and polish, usually in the
language of your choice.
It is also in the excellent public services, especially the public transport
system, whose clean and uncrowded buses, trams and trains run unfailingly to
schedule.
For all its understated bounty, Zurich is not paradise. Even the casual
visitor will notice signs of social tension. Many building walls have been
decorated with angry, surrealistic graffiti paintings, testimony to youthful
frustration with such a well-ordered society.
Hard by the main railway station, youths squatting in an abandoned warehouse
painted on the wall facing the platforms the word 'Zureich' in the style of
the Swiss Federal Railways. 'Too rich]' shouted this cunning pun - but last
week the police demolished the buildings and drove out the squatters.
Zurich's biggest social headache, however, is its outsize hard drug scene.
Originally the outgrowth of student protests in the 1970s, it grew and
shifted through the 1980s, becoming firmly entrenched in 1986 when a
coalition of Socialists and Greens took control of the city government.
They implemented as liberal a policy towards the addicts as Swiss laws would
allow, and provided clean needles and counselling services. The scene
mushroomed as addicts from all over the country and even from beyond Swiss
borders came to take advantage of these friendly conditions.
Tension of a different kind is reflected in the absence of a ring road
around the city, forcing a huge volume of through traffic to negotiate the
downtown area. When proposals for a ring road were first advanced in the
1950s, city merchants objected, fearing they would lose business. Now the
project is stymied because of endless legal manoeuvres by environmentalists.
The city's main problem, however, is not yet easily visible. Like many
American cities, its population is declining as people move to the suburbs.
Initially, this movement reflected a shortage of housing in the city, but
latterly it has become a form of protest by companies and the middle classes
against the ever-higher taxes the city has imposed to deal with its mounting
social problems.
Zurich's population has sunk from 445,000 in 1962 to about 340,000 today,
but the real trend is even more dramatic, as the exodus of the middle
classes has been replaced partly by lower earning immigrants.
The city runs large deficits chronically and, sooner or later, some
political restructuring will be needed, perhaps by incorporating suburban
municipalities into the city, perhaps by shifting more of the city's
obligations to the cantonal government. If the history of the drug problem
is any example, action will only occur when the business community feels its
custom is seriously threatened.

FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drinks cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drinks sector was buoyant following the chancellor's decision not to
increase excise duties. Bass, which yesterday reported respectable but dull
figures, according to analysts, was one of the star performers, surging 34
to 537p in its biggest ever turnover of 16m. Other domestic-based drinks
stocks also bounded forward, Scottish &amp; Newcastle rising 25 to 512p,
Whitbread 21 to 557p, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 31 to 531p, Allied-Lyons 25 to
620p and Greenalls also 25 to 408p.
Poor results from Argyll Group confirmed the market's worst fears over the
impact of the price war currently under way among the country's food
retailers. As well as announcing figures at the bottom end of forecasts, the
company was telling analysts that the continuing price pressures might
affect second-half profits. The stock dropped 23 to 256p in record turnover
of 23m.
Bank shares were among the market's best performing stocks and interest in
the sector was additionally boosted by news that SG Warburg Securities had
launched a call warrant into a basket of four UK bank stocks, underlining
the broking firm's bearish stance on the stocks.
Each basket is the equivalent of seven Barclays, seven National Westminster,
six TSB and three Royal Bank of Scotland shares, and was priced at Pounds
104.57 as at 4.30pm on November 30. Warburg said the warrant would enable
holders of the underlying stocks who want to lock in profits but also wish
to maintain exposure to the sector to do so by selling the stock and
purchasing the warrant.
National Westminster was the strongest performer in the sector, climbing 27
to 586p, closely followed by Barclays, up 25 at 609p. HSBC climbed 20 to
762p, Lloyds 11 to 604p, Abbey National 18 to 424p and TSB 7 to 221p.
Merchant banks showed SG Warburg 40 higher at 897p and Kleinwort Benson up
16 at 539p.
Composite insurances delivered strong gains across the board, confirming the
view prevalent in the market after the Budget that the imposition of a 3 per
cent tax on general insurance would have only a minimal impact on the
companies' business and that their stock prices would anyway be big
beneficiaries of the market's surge.
Commercial Union, where dealers cited large-scale switching out of the
convertible bond, jumped 19 1/2 to 626p. Sun Alliance rose 11 1/2 to 381p.
Leading property shares bounded forward as hopes of sustained low interest
rates underpinned the rises. Dealers said the immediate response was to the
hardening gilt yields, which will impact in turn on the yields in the direct
property market. Even after yesterday's big rises, one leading agency broker
said: 'All the bull arguments are still valid. The sector still has plenty
of value.' MEPC, which reports results today, advanced 17 to 550p, Land
Securities 20 to 763p and Hammerson 17 to 394p, leading the risers.
Rothmans International softened 2 to 411p after a disappointing trading
statement and profits of Pounds 233.4m, which were in line with forecasts
but affected by Pounds 16.6m of restructuring.
Publishers recorded sharp gains on relief that the chancellor did not impose
VAT on books, newspapers and magazines in the Budget. United Newspapers
soared 34 to 583p, EMAP forged ahead 38 to 401p, The Telegraph was up 19 to
404p and Reed International gained 32 at 797p.
Airline and foreign holiday companies shrugged off worries over the new
airport levy. BAA rose 22 to 951p, British Airways 8 to 428p, Airtours 22 to
457p and Owners Abroad 4 to 79p. Euro Disney was helped by a report in the
French press that US parent Walt Disney may be prepared to put up Dollars
700m in loans and fresh capital if banks follow suit. The shares jumped 45
to 413p.
The strong market rescued an oil sector still beset by worries about crude
oil prices. Shell was run up 14 to 694p and BP edged up 4 to 337 1/2 p.

FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: GEC upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market's fears earlier this week that GEC's interim results would be
accompanied by a warning of continuing difficult trading proved correct as
the company warned that its full year earnings were unlikely to be
substantially higher than last year's.
It was that warning, rather than the actual figures - which showed half-time
profits at the top end of market expectations - that produced the latest
severe bout of underperformance by GEC shares.
They dropped to 317p in the aftermath of the results and accompanying
statement before embarking on a rally which left them a net 13 off at 320
1/2 p. Turnover in the stock reached a hefty 44m, easily the highest since
January 1989, shortly after GEC launched its ultimately successful bid for
Plessey. GEC shares have come under sustained downside pressure since early
October, retreating from a peak 366p.
'It seems likely that downgrades in the order of 3 to 5 per cent will be the
norm,' said one specialist. Previously analysts had been looking for full
year profits of between Pounds 910m to Pounds 945m. A figure of Pounds 900m
was being pencilled in late yesterday.

FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke out of favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the market surged ahead, Ladbroke provided one of the few splashes of red
on dealing screens as a variety of bearish stories struck the leisure stock.
First came news that Mr Michael Hirst, a main board director, had unloaded
125,000 shares - virtually half his stake - in the market four days ago at
161p a share.
The timing of the announcement, which came just minutes before the market
closed on Tuesday, meant the stock felt the full brunt of investor concern
as the market opened yesterday. It drifted lower throughout the morning
session, amid reports that one of the stock's most bullish brokers had
turned negative. There was also talk of a boardroom rift over the share
sale.
However, it was not until late afternoon that the shares went into full
retreat as rumours swept the market - later confirmed in an after-hours'
statement from the company - of the group's decision to take advantage of
foreign income dividend rules, a move which will hit pension fund
shareholders. There were grumblings from some brokers that the news of the
announcement had been leaked into the market selectively.
The stock finished 20 1/2 weaker at 151p after very large turnover of 23m
shares.

FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's derivatives markets saw record turnover and huge premiums
yesterday. The buying played a significant role in driving the FT-SE 100
Index to a new high after the Budget, writes Peter John.
Volume in Footsie futures for December topped 30,000 contracts, which
represented an underlying value of some Pounds 2.5bn and the highest
turnover ever. Also, furious activity in traded options drove the daily
turnover above 90,000 contracts, nearly two-thirds of which reflected
activity in the Footsie.
One dealer said: 'Everyone was involved, UK institutions, US investment
houses, marketmakers taking profits and setting up positions. The Budget has
renewed interest in the London market.'
On most arithmetic models the December contract should be priced at or just
below the underlying cash market. But yesterday when it opened at 3,213 it
was at a premium of about 15 points and it continued to push ahead
throughout the day.
At best it hit 3,274, and while it eased back to 3,259 by the official
close, it pressed ahead again in after-hours' trading to reach 3,265 and
show a premium of 32 points to cash. The premium reflected the dearth of
stock in the underlying market and most dealers expected the Footsie to rise
by a further 20 points when it opens today.
One important element behind the rise was closing of bear positions by
pension funds, who had been particularly worried about Budget changes to
advance corporation tax and bought Footsie put options as protection.
Implied volatility on at-the-money puts fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent
yesterday.

FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities scale new peaks in very
heavy trading - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market surged to new peaks yesterday in the most successful
trading session of the year as investors welcomed a UK Budget seen as
sustaining economic recovery and opening the way for further cuts in UK base
rates in the new year.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended the day 66.3 points up at a new closing peak of
3,233.2, showing the biggest daily advance since September 1992 when the
stock market was celebrating sterling's departure from the European exchange
rate mechanism. Buying across the wider range of the market took the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index ahead by 80.7 to 3,565.6, also a new peak.
One seasoned trader described trading volume as 'phenomenal - the heaviest
I've seen in 17 years.' European and US investment funds were heavy buyers
of UK equities, spurred on by upgradings of the London market by two of the
largest US investment banks. Seaq volume of 1,235.1m shares dwarfed
Tuesday's 576.4m.
The absence from the Budget of the feared attack on pension fund tax and
dividend status played a significant role in the hurried reversal of some
bearish positions taken in the equity futures markets during the week before
Budget day.
Dealers arrived in the City early yesterday morning and the market broke
through to new peak territory before the official opening, and without
waiting for the futures sector to provide a lead. Between 8.00am and 8.30am,
when screen prices are 'indicative only', the FT-SE Index touched a nominal
3,202.
The Index dipped back to 3,197 but quickly rose again when the December
future contract opened at a substantial premium. Footsie 3,200 was quickly
recaptured and from then on, shares forged ahead strongly, pausing only
briefly as the premium on the December contract ebbed and swayed.
London was also sharing in the general advance in other European bourses and
benefited from a firm start on Wall Street, which gained 18 Dow points in UK
trading hours.
At best, the Footsie was 83.2 points ahead at 3,250.1 and the drift
downwards towards the close was ascribed to little more than the expected
profit-taking in a market which, at yesterday's peak, had risen by nearly 6
per cent since the eve of last week's cut in UK interest rates to 5.5 per
cent.
There was no lack of encouragement from the market strategists. Mr Nicholas
Knight, the bull from Nomura, heads predicted a rally of 200 - 400 Footsie
points 'in the next eight weeks,' which would bring it to his celebrated
year-end forecast of 3,500.
At Goldman Sachs International, believed by some dealers to have turned
bearish ahead of the Budget, yesterday raised its Footsie forecast to 3,600
'in a year (3,250-3,300 at year-end). Salomon International, another heavy
presence in derivatives markets, raised its year-end target to 3,350, with
its June 1994 target at 3,500.
Two weak spots in the market were GEC, after a disappointing interim report,
and Ladbroke which confirmed intentions to take advantage of foreign
dividend rules.
Among the strongest sectors yesterday were building and construction issues,
cheered by Budget decisions to proceed with major projects, and banks, which
benefit both from interest rate optimism and active stock markets. Brewery
stocks advanced on the absence of Budget changes in beer duties.

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow loses steam after nudging
record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
An overnight rally in Tokyo, more favourable news on the US economy and a
resilient bond market lifted Wall Street out of the doldrums yesterday,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
But an early surge in share prices petered out in the final hours of
trading, leaving only the secondary markets with big rises on the day. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 13.13 up at 3,697.08, after flirting with
a record high level of 3,710.77 during mid-morning. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 gained just 0.10 at 461.89, but the American SE composite added 2.74 at
462.77 and the Nasdaq composite climbed 9.42 to 763.81. NYSE volume was a
heavy 294m shares.
The US Treasury market once again set the tone. After a much stronger than
expected reading of business activity in Chicago on Tuesday, bond traders
were braced for more unfavourable news when the US purchasing managers'
monthly index was released yesterday.
In the event, the index showed a moderate gain to 55.7 per cent, from 53.8
per cent in October, bringing a measure of relief to traders fearing a
strong signal of inflationary pressure. In late trading, the 30-year
benchmark government bond was  1/2 higher at 99 13/16 , yielding 6.258 per
cent.
With concern over tighter credit temporarily put aside, equity investors
took encouragement from a 4.4 per cent jump in Tokyo shares overnight and
impressive showings by European exchanges.
Sentiment was also buoyed by the Commerce Department's announcement of a 2.5
per cent increase in October construction spending, the largest rise since
March 1992.
Amid the fresh signs of steady economic growth, cyclical stocks were among
the session's best performers. Deere, the farm equipment maker, advanced
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 72, Chrysler Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 and
Ford Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 1/2 . Paccar, the truck manufacturer, was
up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 68 1/4 , but rival Navistar International fell
Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 22 3/8 . Whirlpool added Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars
62 1/8 after Merrill Lynch said a recent price decline left the stock
undervalued.
Boeing shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 1/8 on news that the aerospace
concern would further cut production and employment.
Walt Disney rallied Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 3/4 after an upbeat assessment
of attendance prospects for the Euro Disney theme park, in which the US
company has a 49 per cent stake.
On the Nasdaq, America Online rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 67 1/4 after
announcing plans to develop interactive television services with Intel and
General Instrument. Intel put on Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 62 3/4 . On the
NYSE, GI edged ahead Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 53 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto rose sharply in active trading, in line with other major world
markets. The TSE 300 index closed 40.2 ahead at 4,220.4 and advances led
falls by 459 to 291 after volume of 75.7m shares.

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pledges on economy take
Nikkei up 4.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday's rush of promises to support the economy by ministers and financial
authorities prompted short-covering and bargain hunting, and the Nikkei
average jumped 4.4 per cent, retrieving the 17,000 level for the first time
in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 718.77 ahead at 17,125.31 after a day's low of
16,429.94 and high of 17,168.22, while the Topix index gained 69.81, or 5.1
per cent, at 1,443.87. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.71 at
1,169.12.
Investors actively sought shares after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime
minister, told parliament that he would take whatever measures necessary to
revive the economy.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said investors were also cheered by
Tuesday's comments from leading ministers regarding the implementation of a
land tax reform to boost the ailing property market. 'Investors saw this as
the government's pledge to finally deal with asset deflation,' he added.
However, there is still concern over the parliamentary debate on political
reform, which is currently being stalled due to talks over the supplementary
budget. Mr Hosokawa has pledged that he would resign if he could not
introduce the reforms this year.
Volume rose to 370m shares from 332m. Advances overwhelmed declines by 1,064
to 42, with 41 issues unchanged.
Banks, which have been especially hit during the recent falls, recovered
ground. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y170 to Y2,860 and Sumitomo Bank
gained Y220 at Y2,000.
East Japan Railway advanced Y12,000 to Y427,000, while Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone moved ahead Y45,000 to Y729,000.
High-technology stocks firmed. Hitachi climbed Y31 to Y799 and Fujitsu Y50
to Y772. Consumer electronics companies were also strong, with Sony up Y190
at Y4,860 and TDK adding Y320 at Y3,670.
Steel issues were in demand: Nippon Steel put on Y13 at Y314 and NKK Y9 at
Y230. Construction shares, which have been battered by the recent spate of
bribery scandals, rose: Nishimatsu Construction, the most active issue of
the day, rallied Y70 to Y1,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 797.93 to 18,977.00 in volume of 26.5m
shares. Roundup
Strong advances were recorded in some regional markets.
HONG KONG was buoyed by a late surge in index futures, in spite of lingering
investor caution over Sino-British friction.
The Hang Seng index climbed 128.92, or 1.4 per cent, to 9,254.03 in turnover
that improved to HKDollars 5.06bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 4.82bn. December
index futures surged to a high of 9,355 before finishing a net 140 up at
9,340.
HK Telecom put on 20 cents at HKDollars 14.90 in spite of the government's
decision to allow three competitors to enter the market after the expiry of
Telecom's local monopoly in 1995.
TAIWAN forged ahead by 2.6 per cent, led by the Formosa Plastics group,
which soared after the group said on Tuesday that major construction work on
its Dollars 9bn petrochemical complex would start early next year.
The weighted index rose 114.44 to 4,468.34, its highest close since May 18.
Turnover jumped to TDollars 58.84bn, the heaviest since April.
Shares in four major Formosa group firms soared, Formosa Plastics ending
limit up at TDollars 44.10, Nan Ya Plastics ahead TDollars 2.90 at TDollars
48.10, Formosa Chemical and Fibre limit up at TDollars 24 and Formosa
Taffeta limit up at TDollars 30.40.
BANGKOK took its lead from higher Tokyo and Hong Kong markets, advancing 2.4
per cent on strong demand for finance, brokerage, banking and property
shares. The SET index rose 31.39 to 1,341.34 in turnover of Bt13.15bn,
against totals of less than Bt8bn on Monday and Tuesday.
SINGAPORE was helped higher by the rebound in major overseas markets and
speculators returning to trade Malaysian shares dealt over the counter. The
Straits Times Industrial index closed 9.87 up at 2,106.01 but was off the
day's best of 2,112.37.
KUALA LUMPUR extended recent gains on strong speculative and institutional
buying and the composite index rose 18.97 to an all-time peak of 1,015.42.
News that Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim had been appointed Malaysia's
deputy prime minister and would also keep his finance portfolio helped
market sentiment.
NEW ZEALAND finished firmly after a heavy day's trading and strong overseas
interest, particularly in forestry stocks. The NZSE-40 index added 18.9 at
2,040.53.
BOMBAY closed higher in spite of a ban on the forward sale of 10 volatile
shares. The BSE 30-share index moved forward 59.71 to 3,292.85. KARACHI saw
fresh buying of fuel, power and textile issues, which pushed the KSE 100
index up 29.47 to 1,721.30.
AUSTRALIA was left easier by a weak mining sector and mixed performances
from blue chip issues. The All Ordinaries index shed 4.0 to 2,005.4.
SEOUL's composite index finished 2.31 off at 808.75 in spite of support for
blue chip manufacturers.

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: US drug stocks affected by health care
reforms - The afflictions of the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US drug stocks have had a torrid year so far. Since the beginning of
January, the Standard &amp; Poor's drug index has underperformed the S &amp; P
composite by 18 per cent.
The reasons for this are not hard to find: the sector, which generates an
unusually large proportion of sales outside the US, has been hit by health
care reform in most of its international markets, as well as changes in its
domestic customer base.
Growth of the US market, the world's most important, has decelerated rapidly
over the last 12 months. IMS International, the market research company,
estimates that it expanded at only 4 per cent during the first nine months
of this year, compared with the same period last year. Until last year it
was enjoying double-digit growth.
The deceleration has been caused not by the Clinton reforms, but by changes
in the customer base. Hospitals, doctors and other purchasers of drugs are
increasingly grouping together to purchase drugs.
These managed groups, often more interested in the price of a drug than its
safety and effectiveness, represent an increasingly large proportion of the
drugs market. They are also negotiating ever greater discounts from
pharmaceuticals companies.
The drugs groups' difficulties in the US have been exacerbated by a series
of significant patent expiries. These affect sales of not only the
off-patent drug but its patented competitors as well.
Many drugs groups are cutting prices to compete in this new environment. The
Clinton reforms, encouraging the creation of health alliances, can only
assist the market's deceleration. At the same time, pharmaceuticals earnings
have also been hit by changes in the tax regime in Puerto Rico, where many
of the US companies make their medicines.
US groups have found little help through exports. The Japanese market, the
world's second largest, is growing at only 4 per cent, while Europe's top
seven countries generated zero growth during the first nine months of this
year compared with the same period last year.
But although all US groups are facing similar problems, their abilities to
weather the health care storm vary enormously. Analysts have spent the last
12 months trying to explain to investors the difference between the haves
and the have nots of the drugs industry. They have almost completely failed.
The differences between the companies are immense. At one extreme there is
Syntex, the Californian-based group. The US patents of its most important
product, Naprosyn, expire this month and effects will devastate the company.
Naprosyn's US sales were Dollars 760m last year, compared with group
pharmaceuticals turnover of Dollars 1.8bn. Its shares have underperformed
the drugs market by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.
At the other extreme is Merck &amp; Co, the world's biggest drugs group. Its
shares have also underperformed the drugs sector by 12 per cent, yet its
underlying volume growth rate is about 9 per cent.
Another star with a disappointing stock market performance is Pfizer. Its
volume growth remains in double digits and its main problem is minimising
its profits to prevent political embarrassment. Yet it has only outperformed
the drugs sector by 3 per cent and has underperformed against the market.
Those that have done well against the sector this year are not the
industry's traditional stars. Warner-Lambert, normally seen as a dull
consumer products, chewing gum and confectionery company - with a few drugs
tacked on - has outperformed the sector by 9 per cent so far this year.
Upjohn, which has been struggling with the patent expiries of three of the
group's leading drugs over the past 12 months, has also done well: its
shares are 10 per cent higher than the sector on the basis of takeover
rumours. At one stage it was outperforming by 26 per cent.
The only company whose stock market performance has matched its commercial
performance has been Schering-Plough. The analysts' favourite this year,
with its young portfolio of products, its strong position in antihistamines,
its programme of operating margin improvement, and its powerful pipeline of
new drugs, the company has outperformed the sector by 18 per cent. Even so,
the shares are only 5 per cent up since January.
The drugs industry is complicated. The market is fragmented, with Merck, the
world's largest drugs group, controlling little more than 5 per cent of the
market; there are about six important therapeutic areas which cover many
different diseases; for each disease there may be four or five different
classes of drugs that can be used; in each class there may be as many as 15
different drugs; and each of these probably has three different names.
When all drugs groups were generating 15 per cent earnings growth, such
complexity did not matter. Now, in spite of the quality of some drugs
companies, it is not surprising that many fund managers have been
disinclined to increase their weighting. The sector is too difficult for its
own good.

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses gain ahead of Buba
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bourses were encouraged by signals that the Bundesbank might cut rates
today, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT put on a good performance ahead of theBundesbank meeting, although
opinion among analysts remained divided as to whether there would be a
further round of cuts. Many expect the bank to wait until December 16.
The DAX index closed just below the day's high, up 32.01 or 1.6 per cent at
2,089.78.
Sentiment was also helped, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck, by an
improvement in machinery orders which showed an order inflow up some 17 per
cent in October.
Daimler was one of the day's main movers, the shares gaining DM19.30 to
DM734.00, as investors were encouraged by co-operation talks between the
German group and Mitsubishi of Japan.
Thyssen underperformed the market, rising just 40 pfg to DM237.90, after
reporting a loss in 1992/1993 of nearly DM1bn and omiting the dividend.
PARIS rose some 2 per cent in good turnover as the market looked forward to
a year end rally on renewed optimism for lower interest rates. Even the rise
in jobless figures did not affect the rally as the CAC-40 index gained 43.89
to 2,153.98.
Turnover was FFr4bn.
Euro Disney featured with a rise of FFr4.20 to FFr36.45 on hopes that
negotiations over financial restructuring were proceeding. However,
suggestions in the French media that its US parent was to inject fresh
capital were erroneous, the group said.
ZURICH was boosted by better than expected economic data, taking shares 1.3
per cent higher to an all-time record close. The SMI index added 35.8 to
2,774.3.
Domestic led demand picked up on figures showing that November inflation
fell to 2.2 per cent, its lowest level since January 1989, and compared with
expectations of between 2.5 and 2.7 per cent.
The mood was enhanced by news that seasonally-adjusted GDP rose 0.6 per cent
in the third quarter, compared with a 1.1 per cent decline in the same 1992
period.
Banks led the advance with bearer shares in UBS jumping SFr14 to SFr1,327.
Exporters were also strong with recent positive US economic figures being
seen as enhancing their prospects. Registered shares in Nestle, at the top
of the actives list, rose SFr13 to SFr1,172.
AMSTERDAM was another market to be supported by positive sentiment
throughout the continent with the CBS Tendency index adding 1.3 or almost 1
per cent to 138.2.
The internationals were all firmer with Elsevier in particular gaining from
arbitrage to end up Fl 4.90 at Fl 161.20. ING added Fl 1.20 to Fl 85.40
ahead of today's results which are expected to be broadly positive.
STOCKHOLM rose 2.9 per cent, the Affarsvarden index adding 38.40 to
1,342.00. The market was led higher by a SKr30 or 9.6 per cent rise in
Volvo's B shares to SKr444 as opposition grew to the proposed merger with
Renault.
MILAN remained inhibited by political uncertainties ahead of this weekend's
second round of local elections and the Comit index shed 3.90 to 544.66.
Fiat added L126 to L3,916 in the wake of analysts' recommendations while
Olivetti rose L60 to L1,808. In the opposite direction, Generali shed L608
to L36,056 on the back of one large sell order.
Montedison shed L31.5 to L755.80 as shareholders approved its capital
increase and the group outlined investment plans.
MADRID rebounded on late institutional buying and the general index rose
5.60 or 1.9 per cent to 298.54 in heavy volume of Pta 35.4bn. The market
took its lead from the strength of foreign markets and a cut in the one year
treasury bond yield at the day's tender.
Banks, hard hit in recent days, led the advance. Banesto rose Pta110 or 5.3
per cent to Pta2,200 and Santander added Pta280 or 4.6 per cent to Pta6,390.
Sevillana led electricals with a Pta40 or 6.8 per cent rise to Pta631.
ATHENS continued higher, still pinning hopes on the announcement today of
tax policies favourable for investors. The general index ended added 14.25
or 1.7 per cent to 877.26 in turnover of Dr5.5bn.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Pound falters after Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After its initially positive reaction to the chancellor's tough Budget on
Tuesday, the pound fell back yesterday to close a touch lower on the day -
even though UK shares enjoyed one of the biggest rallies of the year and
gilts continued to rise on the back of the Budget, writes Rachel Johnson.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's outline of a sharply diminishing public sector borrowing
requirement over the next few years - which should bring a big decline in
gilts supply in its train - was among the best pieces of news that gilts had
had all year.
But other factors were clearly contributing to take the post-Budget shine
off the pound. Topmost were investor fears of further UK interest rate cuts,
combined with the view that sterling's level was about right for the moment.
Mr Roger Bootle, UK economist at Midland Montagu, the securities house, said
it was a little disappointing that demand for sterling had evaporated so
fast after the Budget, but the market clearly had its reasons. 'The pound's
effective range is DM2.40 to DM2.60. As soon as sterling starts trading
comfortably above DM2.54 there is too much downside.' Above that level the
authorities start becoming concerned about UK competitiveness, he added.
On the Bank of England's trade-weighted index against a basket of
currencies, sterling opened at 81.7 and finished slightly weaker at 81.6, as
dealers sold off after the small rise in the currency. Against the dollar
the pound finished at Dollars 1.4805, down from Dollars 1.4845, and against
the D-Mark it slipped to a close of DM2.5425 from a previous DM2.5475.
The chancellor's fiscal tightening and unexpected cut in government spending
underpinned the currency late on Tuesday and sparked a 66-point jump in the
FT-SE 100-share index yesterday.
On monetary conditions, Midland economists could not understand why the
money markets were showing such caution about the future path of interest
rates. For according to their reading of the fiscal projections, the
chancellor's PSBR cuts were predicated on revenues from strong economic
growth. With the recovery still as yet not firmly established, there was no
question that lower interest rates would be needed as a further stimulus for
growth.
Before last week's cut in the base rate to 5.5 per cent, the markets thought
the interest rate floor would be about 5 per cent. But some economists have
been arguing that economic conditions dictate a 4 per cent floor for some
time.
The sterling contract for June was just three basis points higher at 94.95,
while the December short sterling contract ended fractionally lower at
around 94.62. Gains in short sterling futures were concentrated in the
contracts expiring from late 1994 onwards - the December 1994 contract was
up 10 basis points at 94.85 at one stage.
The markets took their lead from Mr Clarke, who suggested on BBC radio that
he would not cut again 'unless and until' he was satisfied the right
conditions existed. The three-month interbank rate moved a tiny bit lower to
around 5 3/8 per cent, reflecting the view that the chancellor would level
the rate to 5 per cent over the next few months.
The Bank of England predicted a shortage of Pounds 1.15bn (revised from an
earlier Pounds 900m) during the day, which it relieved with total help of
Pounds 831m. The Bank bought Pounds 141m of band one bank bills at the
established rate of 5 3/8 per cent.
The dollar was guided by a revision in the US gross domestic product figure
to 2.7 per cent, after a previous 2.8 per cent, in the third quarter.
Economists had expected the revision to produce a number closer to 3 per
cent, but rationalised the figure by recalling the heavy disruption caused
by flooding in the Midwest during the three months. Growth for the final
quarter is expected to near 4 per cent.
The November survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management in
Detroit reported a drop of 2.1 points to 60.0. But economists said it
reflected strength in production, new orders and employment. The dollar
ended a shade firmer at DM1.7175 in London, and finished at DM1.7237 in New
York.
There was bad news on the world trade talks, which are due to be finished in
exactly a fortnight's time. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister,
said the European Union must have an outline accord on the Uruguay Round of
the Gatt trade talks well before December 15; and said there had been no
progress on four problem areas.
The D-Mark's weaker tone - following on from remarks made by Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the new Bundesbank president, which helped to depress the
currency on Tuesday - continued yesterday.
The chances of an early easing in the Lombard or discount rates disappeared
following the announcement that the Bundesbank would hold no news conference
after its regular fortnightly council meeting today. This heightened
expectation that the Bundesbank would take advantage of slower growth in
broad money and lower inflation to ease on December 16. The central bank's
last rate cut, on October 22, however, took the markets by surprise.
During the day, the Bundesbank withdrew DM15.1bn in this week's fixed rate
6.25 per cent repo. This left call money firm and not far below the 6 3/4
per cent Lombard rate.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals put on a spurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Precious metals went through a brief torrid interlude yesterday afternoon as
a sudden burst of buying on the New York Commodity Exchange sent prices
spurting upwards. Silver lead the way by gaining nearly 4 per cent to touch
Dollars 4.62 a troy ounce at one point, gold jumped to Dollars 377 an ounce
and platinum reached Dollars 374.
Analysts said buying, mainly by New York funds, was prompted by the
announcement of economic data showing a surge in construction spending and a
big rise in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index. These
data suggested a strong US economic recovery, which might eventually cause a
rise in inflation, they pointed out.
The surge spilled over to trading in London where the shorts - or those who
had sold metal they did not own in the expectation of buying it later at a
lower price - rushed to cover their positions.
However, the excitement died away as quickly as it appeared.
One trader suggested that the funds pushed prices up through various
important points on the technical charts and, having achieved their
objectives, allowed prices to drop back again.
Gold closed in London up Dollars 4.45 an ounce at Dollars 375.45, silver
ended at Dollars 4.57 1/2 , up 13 cents an ounce, while platinum closedonly
10 cents up at Dollars 366.75.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan set for another
disappointing cotton crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's cotton output will be at least 15 per cent below target this
year.
'We will not be able to achieve our targets and we may stay in the range of
10m bales,' said Mr Chaudhary Ahmed Mukhtar, the minister of state for
commerce. That would represent a shortfall of 2m bales.
Pakistan had expected a bumper cotton crop of over 12m bales, but large
losses were caused by inadequate rainfall and a subsequent pest attack in
the province of Punjab. Last year the crop was 3m bales below target because
of widespread floods.
Mr Mukhtar was still hopeful, however, that some of the production loss
would be compensated by higher international prices . Pakistan expects that
its leading cotton market competitors, such and India and China, will also
face short-falls because of crop damage.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Estonia's hot rock industry
shows its age - The republic's oil shale sector faces severe cost problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large black mounds dot the flat landscape along the southern Gulf of Finland
coast. These mountains of ash are sombre monuments to Estonia's oil shale
industry and the environmental damage it has inflicted on the area over the
past 70 years.
Ecological questions are less peripheral than they were under Soviet rule,
but the newly independent state is being forced to restructure its energy
sector in the face of mounting economic costs.
Thanks to oil shale, Estonia enjoys a measure of self-sufficiency rare among
former Soviet republics. The fossil fuel covers half the country's energy
needs, including all electricity demand, according to the International
Monetary Fund. Worryingly, however, output has been falling - from the
equivalent of 5m tonnes of oil in 1990 to 4.22m tonnes in 1992. The drop
would be even more marked but for sustained electricity exports to Latvia.
Age and inefficiency are the chief culprits at all three levels of
production: mining, retorting and upgrading.
Estonia's only natural resource, the oil-bearing rock, is mined at three
open pits and two underground mines near Kohtla Jarve, an hour's drive east
of Tallinn, the capital. Since the 1920s, plants have turned the fossil fuel
source into liquid fuel and electricity by retorting, or heating, and then
upgrading.
Because of high costs, the mines are not extracting fast enough to meet
demand. Imported explosives are too expensive, accounting for a full third
of all costs associated with oil shale production. Little can be done about
that, but the consultancy Arthur D. Little said in a recent study that costs
could be reduced by buying new machinery and selecting mining sites more
wisely.
The retorting operations, using ancient gas-generators, also desperately
need new equipment to improve efficiency. Normally, state-owed enterprises
would be privatised to do this, but the retorts are not hot items. 'They're
awful. Nobody will buy it,' says Mr Jaan Uustalu, of the Estonian ministry
of economics.
Instead the government plans to sell off subsidised divisions at two of the
three chemical factories, such as the ammonia and urea producing operations,
and keep profitable production of shale oil, the fuel product, in state
hands for another ten to 15 years. Shale oil production at present fails to
meet its profit potential, reckoned at around Dollars 60m a year, because
the other divisions eat the money.
Kivioli and Kohtla Jarve, the two plants, also face staff reductions. The
larger Kohtla Jarve plant, with 3,500 employees, would ideally have to lay
off half the employees to be profitable, according to Mr Uustalu.
Kivioli is starting to move into the black after recently cutting its
workforce from 2,500 to 1,100. The small plant's advantages are
illustrative: it operates 400 tonne retorts, rather than the 1,000 tonne
units used at Kohtla Jarve, to get better yields and higher quality of shale
oil and to use less energy.
The broader economic question, hotly debated in Estonia, revolves around
price. Since spring producers have pressed for a rise in the state-set lump
oil shale price, which is below cash flow minimums needed by the mines. The
government did raise the price from EKr36 to EKr45 a tonne on October 21,
but only after pressure from Eesti Energia, the state electricity company.
Mr Uustalu estimates that, to reflect true cost, the price must go up to
EKr65 per tonne. But the government fears this might stoke inflation. The
latest increase electricity raised costs by some 27 per cent, compared with
an inflation rate of just 5.6 per cent.
The processing factories are also worried. Arthur D Little found Kivioli
could afford to buy oil shale at prices up to EKr110.5 a tonne but Kohtla
Jarve would be forced into bankruptcy if the price was set at EKr65 a tonne.
At current low prices, however, the industry as a whole suffers. Declining
output hurts lucrative exports: on the world market, shale oil fetches
Dollars 75 a tonne, raised to Dollars 105 a tonne in Rotterdam by the
inclusion of transport costs.
More importantly, if mined and processed correctly, oil shale could help
make up for the drop in Russian oil imports by supplying at least a quarter
of domestic fuel needs, up from below 20 per cent today. Last year Finland
helped the country through the tough winter with a 100,000-tonne delivery of
heating oil, but Estonia needs a more fecund domestic fuel industry.
Western governments are equally, if not more, worried about the high
environmental cost. Oil shale mining has left a legacy of pollution around
Kohtla Jarve with an estimated 350m tonnes of untreated water pumped out of
the mines annually. The Purtse River is biologically dead and local bathers
recount coming out of area streams covered with black ash.
The large ash mounds are another a problem: they have a 10 per cent organic
content, which slowly leaks out.
Finland allotted FMr37.4m (Dollars 6.5m) last year to help ease
environmental problems in Estonia, oil shale pollution chief among them. But
no active cleaning operation is under way. 'Everyone's there looking at it
and thinking about it. The hotels are happy", comments an Estonian
government official.
The last, less discussed, alternative would leave the oil shale in the
ground until the price went up or a less costly way was found to develop
Estonia's unique resource. But few in Tallinn can afford such patience.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm exit bonds 'could save EU
Pounds 3.8bn a year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union could save about Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.8bn) a year in
agricultural spending in the short-term under a bond scheme that would
replace open-ended subsidies for farmers, according to a study published
today.
The study, published by the European Policy Forum, a London-based
think-tank, examines options for so-called exit bonds, which would guarantee
farmers a sum equivalent to the subsidies they replace, but only for a fixed
period, in this case 15 years.
After that, all financial support would end and farmers would be subject to
market forces.
Barclays Bank economist Mr Philip Poole, who wrote the report, said recent
reforms of the common agricultural policy did not go far enough.
'Medium term budgetary savings are unlikely, particularly in view of the
prospects for (EU) enlargement to include agricultural producers in central
and eastern Europe,' he said. 'Reconciling the revamped CAP regime with
global trading rules is also problematic under existing plans for reform.'
His report draws on proposals put forward by Prof Stefan Tangermann,
applying them to a specific sector - UK wheat production - in order to
examine their likely impact.
Mr Poole suggests that farmers could choose between two kinds of exit bonds.
The first, income-only bond, would pay interest in the form of a coupon for
a fixed term, while the second would provide no income but grow in value
until maturity.
The bonds would be tradeable on a secondary market, so that farmers who
wanted to leave the industry could sell them and re-invest in some other
activity, such as leisure facilities. Alternatively, farmers could use the
bond as collateral for a loan to restructure their holdings, for example by
cutting food production and diversifying into a non-farm business.
'The only rationale for continuing the subsidisation of agriculture is that
farmers have invested over an extended period on the basis of previous EC
policy and you need to give them time to readjust,' said Mr Poole. 'This
gives them that opportunity with a guaranteed period of subsidy but then
they have to live with the market.'
Mr Poole suggests that the near-term annual savings to the CAP budget,
standing at Ecu35bn this year, would be about Ecu5bn, assuming that 15 per
cent of farmers choose the second bond option to take advantage of its
higher sale value in order to leave the industry. This is because subsidies
to those farmers would end immediately and the EU would not have to pay out
on the bond for 15 years.
Exit bonds would also remove the need for set-aside, since they would bring
about the shrinkage in arable production which set-aside is designed to
achieve, Mr Poole said.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK poultry industry 'at
disadvantage'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More stringent application of European Union rules in the British poultry
industry is costing companies around Pounds 60m more than their competitors
in other member states, according to the National Farmers' Union.
Mr Norman Brook, NFU poultry chairman, told a House of Commons select
committee that he believed the UK industry's costs were Pounds 30.4m higher
than those of French companies. In addition, he estimated that tighter
salmonella rules added 4p a dozen to the cost of producing eggs in the UK.
UK poultry producers were operating on very low margins, which gave them
little ability to invest in new equipment in line with tighter regulations
on animal health, according to Mr John Maunder, managing director of Lloyd
Maunder, poultry producers.
'I believe we lead Europe in animal welfare regulations. The industry is
making a massive investment by January 1995 in new equipment,' he told the
committee. The industry must bring its equipment up to meet standards set in
the EU's Battery Cage directive which Mr Maunder estimated would cost about
Pounds 10 a bird.
Poultry industry representatives told the committee that a settlement of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would put further pressure on
producers with an expected large increase in imports to the EU. In addition,
restrictions on export subsidies that would accompany a Gatt agreement could
see French producers finding it harder to export outside the EU and
diverting shipments to the UK.
Separately, the British Egg Industry council told the committee that annual
egg consumption in the UK had dropped from 225 a person to 177 over the past
5 years. Free-range eggs' market share had risen to 15 per cent over the
same period, and was expected to grow to 20 per cent by the end of the
decade.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (5): Slow to catch
on to their potential uses - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent expansion of derivatives trading has yet to feed fully into the
fund management industry. International fund managers have been slower to
catch on to the potential uses of derivative instruments than the treasurers
of large international companies, most of whom actively use swaps and
options to manage their exposure.
Fund managers now account for a relatively small portion of the Dollars
140,000bn-worth of futures contracts traded annually on the world's
exchanges, and an even smaller portion of the notional Dollars 4,500bn
outstanding in the over-the-counter (OTC) swaps market. (The OTC market
consists of specially tailored, bi-lateral agreements between two
counterparties, rather than contracts traded on and cleared on exchanges).
A gradual evolution is in progress, but most fund managers remain extremely
cautious, even sceptical. However, many of them have woken up to the
advantages of using derivative instruments for asset allocation. Because
futures contracts traded on exchanges are more liquid than their underlying
cash markets, fund managers often buy, particularly, stock index futures,
when they have decided they like a particular market but are not yet sure
which stocks they wish to buy.
Many fund managers go no further. Some are concerned at the lack of
liquidity of some OTC instruments. Most fund managers mark their positions
to market on a daily basis, but it may be difficult to realise that profit
by selling on the option, because of the market's illiquidity.
The difficulties involved in performance measurement can prove a deterrent.
And some trustees still do not allow institutions to use derivatives. 'It
would be much easier if we could use derivatives across the board, but we
can't,' says one manager.
These difficulties are exacerbated by a lack of familiarity with these
instruments. It is widely accepted that the US fund management industry is
at least a few years ahead of Europe in this area.
Often, the institutions most sophisticated in using derivatives have
appointed a specialist head of derivatives, and/or employed staff with a
background in derivative markets. One such is Mr Rob Gambi, head of fixed
interest and currencies at AMP Asset Management, the UK-based fund
management group owned by the Australian insurance company.
The complexities of options pricing hold no mystery for Mr Gambi, a former
derivatives specialist at a bank who used to price options for a living. For
him, derivatives are 'multi-dimensional', allowing more complex views to be
expressed. When an investor buys bonds or shares, he takes the view that
they are going to go up. With derivatives, he can take the view that they
are going to go down - and within a certain period of time.
There are a number of ways, other than straightforward asset allocation, in
which some fund managers are using derivatives.
WRITING OPTIONS:
If a fund manager has an overweight position in a particular market, and
thinks he may already have caught most of the rally, he may decide to write
call options against that position.
This is called covered call writing. It is common among UK fund managers,
who frequently write options against their UK equity portfolios. Writing, or
selling, options earns additional revenue, thereby enhancing returns, but if
the fund manager does not already hold the underlying securities it can be a
dangerous game.
HEDGING:
If a fund manager expects a market to rally, without being certain when,
derivatives can be used for protection. If a bond fund manager is
underweight in US Treasuries and overweight in European bonds, because he is
bullish on the European market but concerned that European bonds will
under-perform in the next three months, he can hedge by buying options on
the spread between the two markets.
The more specific the hedge, the cheaper it is to buy - you are only paying
for what you get. So knock-out options - which expire if the price of the
underlying security falls below a certain level - have been popular.
RISK ENHANCEMENT:
Derivatives can be used to adjust risk in ways which are not possible in the
cash market, and which may involve taking on new risk, but will pay off in
several different scenarios.
'Nine times out of 10, forward contracts are the best instruments for
currency hedging. Options are more complicated and less liquid,' says Mr
Andrew Maclaren, assistant director at UBS Asset Management in London.
Mr Gambi says he is more likely to use derivatives for bonds than for
currencies: 'Let's say I'm fully invested in global bonds, but I want dollar
not D-mark exposure: I can hedge forward my D-marks into dollars. That is
what I would call hard exposure - you make money all the way up and lose
money all the way down.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (5): Service by
fractions - Costs do make a difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an industry which defines the difference between success and failure in
fractions of a percentage point, costs make a difference for sharp-eyed
clients asking whether the fund manager has under- or out-performed the
industry median. High on the list of costs are those required for custody.
'Typically, all the leading fund managers in the UK had their own
custodians,' says Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner in the investment practice at
consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow. 'It was a fairly cosy relationship
and there was no unbundling of services because pension fund trustees did
not know what a custodian was.'
The recent publication of a report from the UK government's advisory panel
on occupational pension law, headed by Professor Roy Goode, urged that the
appointment of custodians should be a function delegated to trustees, a move
which Mr O'Sullivan believes will only serve to heighten awareness of just
how much that service costs.
'We came across one European bank that was offering clients interest rates
of three percentage points below base rates on cash balances of Pounds
250,000 or less,' he says. Furthermore, in the course of advising clients,
Mr O'Sullivan says he has come across custodial banks which habitually
credit client accounts for transactions the maximum number of days after
execution which the client's contract allows.
Mr O'Sullivan is one of a growing number of UK pension fund consultants
specialising in advising clients how to get the most out of their custodian
at the lowest cost. Consultants of a similar stripe have been carrying on a
land office business in the US for years, with the result that prices for
the basic master custody service have been driven down to barely profitable
levels.
Consultants urge clients to consider the various components of a custodian's
service, and examine whether each can be obtained more cheaply through the
use of several providers. Awareness about fees is accompanied by
increasingly complex client needs. The use of derivative instruments for
sophisticated hedging strategies is becoming an accepted element of
investment. Investment strategies around the world increasingly require
cross-border fund movements.
A study prepared by InterSec Research Corp, a pension fund research group,
concludes that US pension funds transferred nearly Dollars 50bn abroad in
the first six months of 1993. This compares with Dollars 30bn which went
abroad in the whole of 1992. Of that, Dollars 2bn went into emerging
markets. By contrast, at the end of 1992, US investment in emerging markets
was Dollars 5.4bn in total. The later development has in particular spurred
demand for the so-called global custodian - the custodian who can service
the client's needs in any number of centres, especially investments in
emerging markets. According to Philips and Drew Fund Management's 1993
survey of investment industry trends, there has been an increasing use of
global custodians by clients. Some say this may be somewhat misleading.
'They are choosing custodians with global capacity,' says Mr Michael Borkan,
vice president at Bank of New York's custody business. 'But what they really
want are a series of regional custodians.'
Mr Simon Murray, consultant at Davis International Banking Consultants, says
that some European banks still do not offer interest on cash balances, and
have tended not to have made the significant systems investments, thus
forcing them to be more labour-intensive and more expensive.
But Mrs Adrienne Cooper, partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm,
says that price is typically not at the top of the list of criteria for
clients selecting a custodian. Mrs Cooper, who carried out a comprehensive
study of custodial services in Britain for a leading UK insurance company,
says: 'People talk about all these added services. But what they really want
is to have all the basic stuff done well. Better than if they had done it
themselves.
'But it is important to say that most of the outfits contracting for
custodial services don't know what it is costing them.'
One UK pension fund which has loudly advocated greater transparency in
custodial charges is ESN, which manages the Pounds 12.5bn pension scheme of
the privatised electricity companies. 'You appoint a custodian and you
appoint a fund manager on the basis that you have clarity of responsibility
and clarity of cost,' says Mr Brian Matthews, finance director.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (5): Rally may soon
end - Government bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond investors will probably look back on the early 1990s with affection,
grateful for the generous profits they have reaped from the world's main
government bond markets.
With the economies of the US, Europe, Japan and Australia in recession,
there was plenty of scope for investors to make gains in the fixed income
markets. As inflation was brought under control, there was a strong case for
lower interest rates in order to stimulate the flagging economies. (Falling
rates, with a low inflation background, are generally good for bond
markets.)
In the first 10 months of 1993, the high-yielding European government bond
markets provided investors with returns of over 20 per cent in local
currency terms. Spanish government bonds showed a gain of 23.13 per cent,
while Italian government bonds rose 22.45 per cent, according to Kemper
Investment Management Co.
Given the strong performance of the bond markets, what is perhaps so
surprising is that many institutions still place a relatively low proportion
of their funds in fixed income investments. According to Caps (Combined
Actuarial Performance Services), the average holding of global bonds in UK
pension funds has steadily declined over the past decade. At the end of
September 1993, UK pension funds held 9 per cent of their assets in global
bonds (5 per cent in overseas bonds, 4 per cent in UK fixed interest). In
1982, they had nothing in overseas bond markets, but an average of 21 per
cent in UK fixed income.
The question is: just how much further can the bull run in bond markets go?
Japanese yields have fallen steadily since 1991 - the official discount rate
fell from 6 per cent in 1991 to 1.75 per cent in 1993, and 10-year
government bond yields have declined from a high of 6.81 per cent in 1991 to
a low of 3.61 per cent in November 1993. As a consequence, many
international investors believe there is little more to be gained from the
Japanese government bond market.
In the US, the Treasury bond market has suffered jitters recently over
whether inflation is likely to pick up, fuelling expectations that interest
rates could be edging up again. One international fund manager says: 'We see
the global government bond rally as being very close to its end. In fact in
some countries - the US, and possibly the UK - it could have gone too far
already.'
So much of the focus now is on continental Europe, in particular the
expectation that the Bundesbank will continue to bring down its key interest
rates. In the early 1990s, investors felt they could hardly go wrong in
Europe. The prospect of European economic and monetary union meant that
European inflation and interest rates were expected to converge gradually,
while investors saw little risk on the exchange rate front because of the
close currency alliance of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The result was that the Bundesbank set the pace at which other countries
could lower their domestic interest rates; and as the Bundesbank stubbornly
refused to lower its rates as rapidly as some of the other Europeans would
have liked, more and more countries were forced either to devalue within the
ERM or to abandon their links, and when that failed, they opted for wider
fluctuation bands.
The UK pound and the Italian lira broke free in autumn 1992, unable to bear
the strain. The fluctuation bands were widened for most of the other
currencies this summer.
For many international investors, these changes have had important
consequences. Before the collapse of the ERM, investors had a tendency to
lump the European markets into the D-Mark core bloc and the high-yielders.
With the system's collapse, they expected not only to see individual central
banks using their freedom to ease more rapidly (they were largely
disappointed), but they also realised that it was prudent to examine
European markets on a more individual basis.
Nick Henderson, at Gartmore fund management, says: 'Break-up of the ERM
means we have to pay closer attention to individual countries - for example,
Belgium. There the government bond market had been swept along on hard core
currency status, but following the ERM break-up, spreads have widened and
currency has remained weak.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (4): Wall of money
rolls on - US cash has driven world markets this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US investors, led by the country's ballooning mutual funds, have provided
much of the cash that has fuelled stock and bond markets around the world
this year.
The question is now: when will this wall of money subside - and what effect
would a reversal have on the more overheated of the 'emerging country'
stockmarkets?
The move by US mutual funds to direct a larger proportion of their cash flow
abroad is the latest twist in the search for higher yields which began with
the flood of cash out of money market instruments and into US stocks and
bonds. The flow of money abroad in earnest, from both bond and equity funds,
dates from the first quarter of the year.
So far in 1993, US mutual funds have bought an average of Dollars 20bn a
month of foreign financial assets, split evenly between fixed income and
equity investments.
After the post-1987 lull in foreign investment, this renewed interest has
pushed up US holdings of overseas financial assets: total holdings of
foreign equities reached Dollars 210bn at the end of June - twice what they
were two and half years before, according to the Securities Industry
Association. The demand has caused a rapid growth in some US-based mutual
funds. Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund group, has seen
its six-year-old international growth and income fund jump from Dollars 100m
in March to Dollars 1bn now.
It is all eerily reminiscent of the pre-crash market in 1987. Then, the
perception that US asset prices had become over-inflated encouraged funds to
look for value - and higher yields - abroad.
The ebb and flow of interest of US investors in foreign markets is clearly
seen in the rise and fall, and rise again, of some of the big foreign mutual
funds.
Assets in Fidelity's main overseas fund, for instance, reached a record
Dollars 3.2bn in 1987, the year of the crash. By the end of last year, the
fund had fallen back to just Dollars 700-800m. This year's renewed interest,
though - and the rising value of assets held in the fund, in dollar terms -
has doubled it again, pushing the level back up to Dollars 1.5bn.
One difference from 1987 has been the fad for emerging markets.
Last year, US investors bought a net Dollars 5bn of shares in emerging
markets, up from Dollars 2bn the previous year, while total net foreign
equity purchases remained constant at about Dollars 30bn. In the first half
of this year, emerging markets purchases reached nearly Dollars 4bn out of a
total of Dollars 20bn.
Mutual funds have not been the first, nor the only, US investors to drive
this flow of capital abroad. US pension funds have also been forced to
become more adventurous in overseas investing, though foreign assets
continue to account for only a small portion of their portfolios. Declining
investment returns in the US and burgeoning liabilities have together forced
the pension funds to be more ambitious in the search for returns.
The pressure on pension funds is not restricted to those, mainly in the
steel and auto industries, which have the biggest deficits - though the
extent of the underfunding has reached gargantuan proportions. The deficit
in the 50 weakest funds jumped from Dollars 29bn to Dollars 38bn by the end
of 1992, and will have jumped by as much again by the end of this year,
While General Motors grabs the headlines for its Dollars 14bn deficit (it
expects this to become Dollars 24bn this year), the overall picture shows a
general weakening in the financial position of US pension plans.
In 1988, according to Buck Consultants in the US, 95 per cent of corporate
pension plans had sufficient assets to cover obligations. By the end of 1992
the proportion had fallen to 76 per cent. Over the period the average
funding ratio of US plans has fallen from 158 per cent to 135 per cent.
The funding levels have fallen fast as US interest bond yields have come
down (the yields provide the discount rates used to calculate the present
value of the funds' future liabilities, so falling falling bond yields have
boosted liabilities). Falling bond yields have also hit investment returns,
putting further pressure on funds to be more adventurous in their outlook.
But what would happen if Treasury bond yields continued to climb, in turn
helping to stimulate a rise in the US dollar?
The returns (in dollar terms) available in some of the emerging markets
would look far less stellar, prompting a retreat by some investors. An
appreciation of the dollar against the European (and perhaps Japanese)
currencies would also make US assets more attractive again. And, given that
the long bond yield fell to nearly 5.5 per cent this autumn, a level of 6.5
per cent or even 7 per cent may not look so bad after all.
'The US has become the fountain of liquidity for the world. One thing that
will shut it off overnight is a good correction,' says Mr John Hickling,
manager of Fidelity's overseas fund. The Treasury bond market's losses so
far are more of a hiccup than a correction, he adds - but it is a movement
that is already sending jitters through stockmarkets around the world.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (4): EU failure to
agree - Artificial barriers to pension investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over three years ago, the European Commission began work on a directive
aimed at lifting the barriers to pension fund investment and pension rights
mobility across Europe.
The goal, in line with other EC directives, was to remove the artificial
barriers which countries have constructed to keep their assets at home. But
while great strides towards free movement in banking, insurance and
investment services have passed the critical hurdles within the EU, free
movement in pension investment remains an elusive goal.
'The insurance and banking directives were more far reaching than the
pension directive,' said Mr Humbert Drabbe, of the Commission's DG-15, which
has been shepherding the directive through the system. 'And those were
achieved within one year.'
Why liberalising pension fund investment is so thorny, when agreement is
possible on banking and insurance, remains a vexing question. But the facts
are that last June, the European Commission failed to agree on terms of the
directive hammered out over a two-year period, and referred it back to the
EU's Internal Market Council.
Since then, several meetings of the council have been held to try to work
out a compromise which will allow the directive to gain the approval of all
member states. But fundamental differences in the style of pension fund
provision throughout Europe and varying degrees of dependence on pension
scheme assets to fund public sector deficits remain obstacles.
The draft rejected by the full council contained three key elements. First,
a rule barring countries from requiring minimum degrees of investment in any
category or nationality of investment. Second a rule allowing countries to
set a maximum investment in any category. And third, a rule barring
countries from requiring that more than 60 per cent of liabilities be
financed by assets in the same currency.
This last rule, which applies to defined benefit final salary schemes, has
proved to be perhaps the most controversial one of all. The directive does
allow a higher ceiling of 80 per cent to apply to money-purchase defined
contribution schemes.
The European Federation of Retired People (EFRP), a Europe-wide body
representing pension scheme sponsors, is deeply troubled by the directive.
'We would rather have no directive than a bad directive,' said Mr Koen de
Ryck, permanent representative. In short, Mr de Ryck says, the directive
falls far short of what is needed to help funded pension schemes achieve the
kinds of returns they will need to meet retirement bills in the next
century. Not only is there extensive academic research to show that currency
diversification reduces risk and increases returns, but in some countries
domestic markets are too small to absorb all the cash which could
potentially be invested in them.
Moreover, the directive is more restrictive than what is already allowed in
many EC states, thus raising the possibility that some governments will wish
to roll back their relatively liberal laws and adopt those in line with the
directive.
Figures from the EFRP show wide variations in the degree to which European
pension schemes invest outside their home country. In the UK and Ireland,
the figures are 29.98 and 35 per cent respectively, while Denmark has only 4
per cent of its assets outside the country.
And while there are no investment requirements in the UK, Netherlands or
Ireland, other countries do set limits both on categories of asset and
non-domestic investment.
In Germany, purchases of foreign securities are limited to 5 per cent of
total assets, while the total equity exposure of a pension scheme is limited
to 30 per cent. Switzerland limits total equity investment to 50 per cent of
assets, but foreign purchases may be no more than 30 per cent of assets.
Denmark, which relies heavily on pension schemes to purchase government debt
and mortgage bonds, sets a ceiling on total equity exposure at 40 per cent
and foreign purchases at 15 per cent of assets.
Given these rules, it is easy to see why some EC states feel the directive
goes too far. Several member states, France and Italy in particular, tried
hard to raise the 60 per cent currency matching requirement to 80 per cent
for all pension schemes. They point to the currency matching requirements of
the EC Insurance directive and ask why more liberal investment rules should
apply to pensions.
Mr Emmanuel Reynaud, pensions researcher at Institute de Recherches
Economiques et Sociales, the French labour think tank, said 'One problem
with pensions at the European level is that people do not understand each
other.' In France, which has almost no funded pension schemes anyway, there
is no distinction between pension and insurance.
Ironically, the member states which have raised the greatest objections to
the liberalising moves are those with the smallest pools of pension scheme
assets. France, for instance, relies almost entirely on so-called Pay As You
Go financing, in which the current generation of workers pays for its
parents' retirement and has almost nothing to invest. For the French, the
terms of the EC pensions directive are still academic.
With growing public sector deficits, many European governments have kept
their eyes on the the potential for domestic pension pools to finance their
debts. Among the factors leading to the withdrawal of the proposed directive
in June was opposition from the Dutch government. While there are officially
no restrictions on pension fund investment there, foreign investment for its
huge public sector scheme, the ABP scheme, is limited to 5 per cent of
assets. The Dutch tried - and failed - to have the APB scheme exempted from
the legislation on the grounds that it is a social security system.
Similarly, the French tried and failed to have their AGIRC and ARRCO schemes
classified in the same manner.
'I do not believe that there will be a pensions directive,' Mr Reynaud said.
Still, Mr Drabbe of DG 15 remains much more optimistic. The Belgians,
currently holding the EU presidency, are determined to achieve a directive
by the end of their term. But whether it is one which truly liberalises
pension investment remains to be seen.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (4): Brokers'
prayers are answered at last - Japanese fund managers return to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<TEXT>
A recent visit by leading Japanese brokerage officials to Ise Shrine, an
important Shinto sanctuary, to pray for a recovery of the Tokyo stock
market, may have failed to support share prices, but it seems to have
brought Japanese institutional investors back into the market.
The recent falls in the stock market are pushing share prices to levels
which make the Tokyo market's value seem reasonable. Leading life insurance
companies recently said they were considering stepping up purchases of
Japanese shares.
During the first half of the business year, sharp declines in interest rates
prompted increased bond investments. However, investors are becoming
increasingly wary that bond prices may be peaking out, and are searching for
alternative investments.
With buying by foreign investors and public pension funds petering out,
Japanese stocks failed to find support until recently. But the Tokyo market
broke through the main psychological support levels in November, making
stocks more attractive.
Nippon Life, the country's largest life insurance company, says it will
actively buy stocks of companies with good earnings performances if the
stock market continues to decline. The company bought stocks worth Y30bn in
November. Officials at Sumitomo Life said the company purchased Y50bn during
October and November.
Investment in tokkin, or specified trust funds, by insurance companies,
which accounts for about 3.8 per cent of total assets, were up by 19 per
cent over the last year.
Foreign investors and public funds have been the main buyers of Japanese
shares. Public pension funds have been pumped into the market by the
government to prop up share prices since the Nikkei plunged to a six year
low in August last year.
The sharp appreciation of the yen attracted foreign investors, and
foreigners have been the leading buyers since last March. However, a recent
halt in the yen's price has caused profit taking; overseas investors have
become net sellers of Japanese shares since the end of September.
Until recently, domestic investors invested heavily in the bond market. Life
insurers, the largest category of institutional investor with total assets
of Y157,000bn, actively placed funds in the government bond market. Bond
yields have fallen sharply as the Bank of Japan cut its discount rate to a
record low 1.75 per cent.
According to brokers James Capel in Tokyo, total investments in bonds by
life insurers rose by 42 per cent during the year to June, accounting for
almost half of net cash flow. Government bond investments rose by 71 per
cent, while local government bond investments rose by 66 per cent.
In sharp contrast to bond investments, life insurers' attitudes to shares
have been conservative. Equity investment has fallen to below 20 per cent,
with only 5.8 per cent, or Y710bn of net cash flow, invested in the stock
market.
The strength of the yen has taken away incentive for Japanese institutions
to invest overseas. 'We're trying to reduce European and US investments
because of currency movements and the high prices,' says a fund manager at
Tokio Fire and Marine, a non-life insurance company.
Uncertainty over the Nafta trade negotiations has also been a reason to
restrain allocation of assets to the US. Overseas investments have been
reduced by life insurance companies over the past year by Y1,100bn to about
10 per cent of total assets.
Mr Kazuo Tamayama, fund manager at the second investment division of Yasuda
Kasai Brinson Investment Management, expects to maintain a portfolio
weighted heavily towards bond investments, keeping weightings in equities at
a minimum. He expects a further rise in government bond prices, but does not
see an upturn in the stock market and advises taking profits in equity
holdings.
Meanwhile, Japanese fund managers have recently joined in the rush among US
institutions to invest in Asian markets, where growth potential is expected
to overcome currency risk. Over Y210,000bn in Asian funds has been
established this year. Nomura Investment Trust set up two large scale
investment trusts based in the region at the end of October.
But Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, believes that Japanese
institutional investors are eventually going to be forced to invest in the
Tokyo stock market because of the lack of alternatives.
Some insurance companies are becoming increasingly nervous about the rise in
the bond market, and are starting to take profits. Growth in corporate
loans, which accounts for 40 per cent of life insurers' assets, is likely to
be difficult to sustain, as demand for funds is declining. Companies have
slashed capital spending, and refinancing needs for equity-linked bonds
issued during the late 1980s have also peaked.
Property investments have grown strongly. Mr James believes that low
interest rates and low equity weightings at financial institutions offer
buying opportunities which could 'represent the start of a sustainable new
trend.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (3): Well placed to
out-perform market - As the crisis in the property sector diminishes,
Christine Moir finds the market in better shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All the main property markets have been in crisis to some degree over the
past three years.
Falling rents and demand, over-supply from the development boom of the late
1980s, recessionary squeezes throughout the broad economy and structural
problems in some centres have persuaded many investors to become net
disinvestors in property.
But the corner may have been turned. According to Rick Lacaille of NatWest
Investment Management's property team: 'The perception now is that there may
be a risk in not being in property. Not that property assets will suddenly
shoot ahead but the sector is now placed to out-perform steadily.'
The price of that change in perception has been a savage correction in
property values across the world.
Over the past year that painful process has been reinforced by falling
interest rates. In those centres where the dual effect has been to produce a
positive yield gap between property and fixed interest, investors are
returning.
Evidence is still patchy. The UK Central Statistical Office (CSO) figures
for the second quarter (the latest available) inspired a wave of invective
from property market professionals for suggesting that institutions had
lapsed back into net sellers of Pounds 177m of property in the UK in the
second quarter this year, after a spring flurry of net buying amounting to
Pounds 155m.
Anecdotal evidence pointed to buying activity continuing to strengthen in
the summer. But the two might not really be in dispute.
The Pru is typical in concentrating on its home market for the present. 'We
disinvested from Europe over the past few years and we are not planning to
re-enter it. We don't feel we have sufficiently good information about the
markets. In North America we are looking more actively, but we haven't done
deals.'
Nigel King, Salomon Brothers' head of European real estate, confirms that,
for US institutions, cross-border activity has been a low priority recently.
'There has been concern over currencies, the economic slow down and lease
structures. On top of that, US institutions have been busy turning private
pools of assets into public pools.' This has mostly taken the form of
repackaging property portfolios from failed savings and loans operations as
quoted Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
Where US investors do look abroad, Mr King says, their first port of call is
London. Beyond that their preferences are - in order - Paris, Frankfurt and
Madrid.
US investors are not the only ones to turn their eyes first to London. As it
becomes the first important market to complete the painful correction and
offer positive rates of return compared with cash and fully priced equities,
overseas investors remember the virtues of the UK's uniquely long leases and
upwards-only rent reviews.
In the past couple of months, says Malcolm Naish, a fund management partner
at Jones Lang Wootton, competitive bidding has returned to the London
market. Interest has resurfaced from German, middle eastern and far eastern
investors - witness last month's sale of the headquarters of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), at No 1 Exchange Square, in
the Broadgate development, to Deutsche Grundbesitz Investmentgesellschaft.
David Seddon, Mr Naish's colleague, confirms that London's restructuring is
the most advanced of European centres.
Price corrections elsewhere have not yet been completed. Nevertheless some
markets are already reviving. In Germany lettings remain weak, but the
investment side is buoyant, with local open ended investment funds sucking
in DM11bn in the first nine months of 1993, compared with DM6bn for the
whole of 1992. Since they must invest at least 50 per cent of income,
domestic markets are now sure to be supported. Munich, Hamburg and
Dusseldorf are likely to benefit first. Rents there have stabilised, while
in Frankfurt and Berlin rents are still falling back from the giddy peaks of
post-union euphoria.
Demand is also picking up in the Benelux countries, where rent stability has
also returned. Brussels, which showed exceptional growth from 1987 until
last year, is beginning to be attractive again, especially to Scandinavian
investors. The four main cities of the Dutch randstadt have developed a
positive yield gap over fixed rate mortgage money. Although they are
dominated by Dutch institutions, these markets also attract cautious
international funds happy with the long history of rents matching inflation.
Opinion is most divided about Paris. No investment market to speak of has
existed there for the past couple of years, yet many investors remain
sceptical about whether the locals have got the message and reduced prices
far enough.
Others believe that the final correction cannot be far off, and that rents
will bottom out by the end of this year. On this theory, France is the
market for 1994, and a few institutions are already fishing at the bottom,
hoping for early worms.
Spain continues to present a less than attractive front. although prices
have more than halved. Madrid is simply over-built outside its historic
core, which is largely closed to commercial opportunities. Rents in
Barcelona, despite having fallen from Pta4,500 to Pta2,500 per sq m per
month, may still not have bottomed out. And prices still produce a yield of
7.5 per cent at a time when cash offers 8 per cent to 9 per cent.
In short, Europe divides into two halves: the north already active and in
some cases buoyant; inertia still ruling in France and Spain - though with
France, perhaps, poised to hit bottom and bounce back.
Everywhere, however, investors' appetite will only be maintained if interest
rates remain below property yields.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (3): Volatility is
likely to continue - The foreign exchange markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the striking features of international financial markets this year
has been an outflow of funds from the US as investors there seek higher
yields.
It has not been so much a question of retail money moving abroad. Small
investors prefer to stick with their own market, but their push into US
stocks and bonds has driven up local values to the point where institutions
have felt compelled to seek better opportunities overseas.
Since this development coincides with a feeling among large institutions
that they are underweight in international issues, many have begun to
increase their foreign exposure to 20 per cent - or even more - of their
total portfolio.
That, however, only serves to aggravate the nagging worry about the currency
risk they may be running, especially given the widespread perception that,
after years of cyclical decline since the Plaza agreement of 1985, the
dollar may tend to strengthen once US interest rates start to rise. US
investors could then see their foreign market gains wiped out by currency
loss.
Besides, currency volatility in the second half of last year was as high as
it had been since 1985, says Ms Margaret Waller of Pareto Partners, the
London-based currency advisers. 'There is no evidence that volatility is
going to turn down, particularly given the changes to the ERM (European
exchange rate mechanism). If anything, it's going to become more of an
issue.'
Thus it is no surprise that US fund managers should be expressing increasing
interest in currency management techniques such as overlay, whereby currency
and investment decisions are taken separately and appropriate hedging
arrangements put in place for the latter.
A recent survey of US funds by Rogers, Casey, the Connecticut consultancy,
shows more than half of them expected active currency management of their
international investments to increase over the next three years, and 71 per
cent expected currency overlay to reduce the volatility of these
investments.
According to Mr Reza Viskai of Rogers, Casey, the appeal is enhanced by the
perception that active currency management can add value to the portfolio.
'You can actually enhance the return on your international investment,' he
says.
One way this can work is if investors change their hedge ratios as currency
rates move, so that they increase their exposure to a strengthening currency
and reduce it to a strengthening one.
Some investors go further and engage in active currency investment for its
own sake, through the derivatives market. That increases the return compared
with a conventional overlay which cannot use leverage, but it also increases
the risk.
The slowly growing popularity of the latter approach to currencies is,
however, an admission that currency decisions involve some active judgment.
Using outside advice to put a currency overlay in place can provide comfort
for the fund manager who does not wish to take full responsibility for the
impact of exchange rate movements, but it does not provide automatic
protection.
Judgments are easier to make when currencies are moving in a clear long term
trend. They are harder when the waters are simply choppy, as may be the case
at the moment.
Nor is an active hedging policy easy to pursue in every type of investment.
Emerging market portfolios are difficult to hedge, for example, because of
the limited instruments available in individual currencies, and because high
real short term interest rates in developing countries would often make
hedging expensive.
Indeed, the only currencies where hedging is easily available are the yen,
the larger European currencies and the dollar itself.
Emerging market exposure can be hedged by using the dollar as a proxy for
developing country currencies which are often linked to the US unit, but
hedging by proxy can produce some nasty surprises, as some US investors
found when the ERM collapsed.
While the ERM was holding together, the D-mark could count as a proxy for
the smaller currencies in the system, which also, incidentally, carried
higher interest rates. It was thus tempting, if only on cost grounds, to use
the D-mark to hedge exposure to, say, Irish pounds or Spanish pesetas. That
looked a lot less sensible when the high interest rate currencies started to
devalue.
Partly because they are more used to taking currency exposure as a matter of
routine, UK fund managers remain less drawn to overlay theory. 'Using
currency tactically is something we do all the time, but it's part of the
overall iterative process,' says Ms Caroline Burton of GRE. She does not
believe that it makes sense to separate the decisions on whether to have
exposure in yen and whether to buy European bonds.
One important relationship, the sterling dollar rate, has been remarkably
stable over the past year, but that does not mean currency management does
not help.
Mr Tom Crombie of Scottish Equitable says that while the Japanese market may
have room to rise, the yen's appreciation against sterling has probably just
about run its course.
Low interest rates in Japan mean it actually saves money to hedge Japanese
exposure against a fall in the yen. Scottish Equitable has covered half its
exposure in this way. Cleverly, it has also used the savings to buy an
option that allows it to benefit if the currency continues to rise. That
looks like the best of both worlds.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (2): From Brady to
Beijing - Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In September Morgan Stanley, the New York-based investment bank, led a tour
of American and European institutional investors to China. A subsequent huge
surge in Hong Kong share prices, as Morgan Stanley's investment strategists
sharply raised their target weightings, symbolised the power of the flows of
funds now moving around the globe, with an impact especially on the
so-called emerging markets.
The key conclusion - according to a subsequent 80-page report, exclamatorily
entitled 'China]' - was that 'investing in China's future will be the
world's most profitable investment opportunity for the next 10 years'.
History may well show that the hype associated with the Morgan Stanley trip
marked a temporary peak in the fortunes of the Hong Kong market. By
mid-November Morgan Stanley was reducing its weighting again, apparently
taking something less than a ten-year view.
Investors in emerging markets are seeking high returns to offset the
generally high risks, and after a prosperous few years they are confident
that the rewards are there. For instance, as Mr John Mullen of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York points out in a recent study, annualised equity
returns averaged more than 20 per cent over the years 1976-92 in Argentina,
Chile, Mexico, South Korea and Thailand. Developed country returns, in
comparison, were in the 14-17 per cent range over the same period.
The current emerging markets boom reflects the coincidence of two, maybe
three, favourable trends. There has been a general outflow of capital from
the US, partly reflecting greater international diversification by pension
funds and partly, also, a search for value by mutual fund investors who have
embarked on an unprecedented shift towards international bond and equity
funds.
Second, the developed markets happen to have become relatively unappealing.
Economic growth in Japan and Continental Europe is currently zero or even
minus something. In many countries, bond interest rates have slipped to
levels not seen for many years, and US pension funds are having trouble in
reaching their actuarial rate of return targets by investing in conventional
US Treasury or corporate bonds. For example, each 1 percentage point fall in
bond yields increases the deficit of General Motors' pension plan by Dollars
5bn-Dollars 6bn.
The focus of global investors has therefore shifted to developing countries,
where economic growth rates are still high - often 6 per cent a year in
Latin America and parts of the Far East. Indeed, there is a fashionable
theory that the economic momentum of south east Asia is now strong enough -
especially as a source of cheap manufactures - to be causing a realignment
of the global economy.
The emergence of China is a key element in this argument. India and
Indonesia, with big populations, also have great potential. If relatively
small nations such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand could
create a significant impact, how much more dramatic will the changes be when
the giants of the region really get going?
Hence the theories of investment strategists that global equity investors
should search for growth in these fast-expanding emerging markets, while the
uncompetitive developed world will be troubled by price deflation and
economic depression (although developed country bond prices may benefit from
low inflation).
The third factor that has encouraged investment in emerging markets relates
in a rather less specific way to favourable political developments. Many
Third World countries have dumped socialism and adopted market-oriented
policies much more acceptable to international investors.
This trend has not yet done much to encourage flows of capital into Eastern
Europe or Africa, where the political obstacles are judged to be too great
for the time being. But Latin America has benefited tremendously, and is
currently receiving large flows of capital from the US.
After the protracted insolvency crisis of the 1980s, most Latin American
countries are now regaining their creditworthiness, especially after the
Brady-type debt restructurings. For instance, American investors bought
Dollars 1.4bn worth of Mexican bonds in 1992 - and stepped that up to
Dollars 2bn in the first half of 1993. Bigger sums still are involved in
equities - but the political and financial frameworks of many countries
remain fragile.
So risks remain, but investing in emerging markets is no longer primarily
the occupation of pioneers - the kind of lone prospectors who would fly into
Bangkok or Santiago, aiming to be the first foreigner investors in town.
A global infrastructure is being built, so that today international equity
and bond placements are quite frequently made by developing countries.
Privatisation issues have featured strongly, and provide the kind of large
scale and solid corporate investments that are favoured by mainstream global
investors. For example, Telemex raised Dollars 1.2bn in 1991, with a listing
on the New York stock exchange, and such placements reached some Dollars 9bn
in 1992.
Mr Martin Quintin-Archard is managing director of emerging market debt
trading at Intercapital Brokers. the London firm. 'We sell Mexican CDs to
Danish pension funds,' he says. 'It's a completely global business. We sell
Peruvian debt to the Singaporeans.'
Nevertheless, once investors move outside a narrow group of large,
relatively liquid issues, they still need to tread carefully. Share prices
can be volatile, financial reporting may be primitive or even fraudulent.
Overseas investors may be confined to less-attractive classes of share
capital, or cut out of attractive new issues. The quality of research will
also be poor, although some investors see this as an advantage as it implies
that emerging markets can be very inefficient, thus offering attractive
opportunities if you know what you are doing.
Growth, however, now so hard to find in developed markets, is the
fundamental attraction.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (2): Seeking
undiscounted recovery - This year's equity performance in the main markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the turn of the year, opinion on the main stock markets was almost
unanimous: Europe was the place to be and France was the market most likely
to perform.
Interest rate cuts had powered US equities in 1991 and UK shares in 1992,
and so (the reasoning ran) falling rates would do the same for continental
stock markets in 1993. France was favoured because it had come further
through its recession than Germany. French interest rates would fall
rapidly, either because the Bundesbank would cut rates or because France
would leave the ERM. Once the rates fell, France was the European economy
best placed to grow.
Events, of course, did not quite pan out that way. De facto, France has left
the old ERM - but has continued to peg its monetary policy to Germany. As a
result its recession has intensified. Small wonder, then, that Paris has not
fulfilled the best hopes of the bulls. The CAC-40 index is up by 13 per
cent, only slightly more than the 12 per cent gain for the FT-A All-Share
index. More surprising, perhaps, is the performance of the market no one
liked in January: the economic news from Germany has worsened over the year,
yet the DAX index is up by almost a third.
Liquidity - particularly American liquidity - is the driving force behind
the rally. Low deposit rates and falling US bond yields have tempted
investors into equities. Mutual fund receipts are running at record levels,
with some Dollars 60bn a quarter flowing in. Yet despite hitting new highs,
Wall Street has proved a dull performer and the S&amp;P composite index has only
risen by 7 per cent this year.
So about half of that money has flowed into markets where recovery prospects
are not so heavily discounted. There has been heavy US buying of UK gilts,
French OATs and, particularly, German bunds. Equities - their yields looking
cheap by comparison - have followed.
Even more spectacular have been the gains in those Pacific Rim markets which
benefit from booming regional economies and trade with China. Hong Kong
equities are up by three-quarters, largely on the strength of US buying. The
only market to fare poorly in the region has been Japan, which is up 1 per
cent on the year thus far. It is saddled with deflationary forces, political
instability and a rising yen; its problems will take years rather than
months to resolve. The government's inability to agree a fiscal stimulus for
the economy is further damaging shares.
The main worry now for most equity markets is the degree to which such a
liquidity-driven boom can be sustained. 'By the conventional measures of
earnings ratios or absolute yields, shares look expensive. In our model
portfolio we have gone underweight in equities.' says David Roche of Morgan
Stanley.
Yet because the rally was led by a lowering of bond yields and reduced
inflationary expectations, the ratio of bond to equity yields still shows
most stock markets to be relatively cheap. Such yield ratios should be
treated with some caution since they only give strongly reliable signals
near extremes. But they do at least offer some comfort that equity
valuations can hold so long as bond markets do not suffer.
Andrew Bell of BZW says that slow growth rather than renewed inflation is
the greater threat. Markets may thus be able to hold on to the gains of the
last year. Even if inflation ticks up slightly in the US and the UK during
1994, real bond yields are still satisfactory by long run historical
standards. Most countries still have substantial unemployment and output
gaps, subduing inflation. Commodity prices also remain depressed.
More alarming is the prospect that growth will be too slow for companies to
generate significant earnings increases. P/e ratios are high in all the
important markets - and astronomical in many emerging ones. Many industrial
managers continue to make exceptional provisions against further
rationalisation, and trading statements are often downbeat.
Companies are also backing words with deeds. Rights issues are running at
record levels in the UK and the new issue market is buoyant. Initial and
secondary public offerings in the US are also running at high levels as the
de-gearing of balance sheets continues. Companies are increasingly choosing
to demerge or float off subsidiaries rather than make trade sales. The
market is valuing prospects much more highly than most company directors. If
these managers are right and earnings prospects are poor, then a correction
may set in.
Set against that is the weight of money. Unlike some previous booms which
relied on margin trading and borrowed funds, much of the cash coming into
shares is as a direct transfer of assets from deposits to equities. That
should help prevent panic selling, but it does raise the question of whether
investors sufficiently appreciate the risks they run. A 3.5 per cent yield
on equities may have more appeal than a 2 per cent return on cash while
markets are rising, but when shares start to fall minds may change quickly.
The other risk is that US short term interest rates may start to rise, not
because of renewed inflation, but because competition for capital will
increase if the recovery gathers pace. David Roche of Morgan Stanley thinks
that the US economy may expand by almost 4 per cent next year, and with
savings low, funds for investment may be low. If that happens the flow of US
money out of international equities would be hard to replace.
Ironically, given how unpopular it was earlier this year, Germany may be the
market best able to cope. Bond yields in that country may have further to
fall, and the extensive retrenchment programme needed may make its capital
goods exports industries competitive. The UK and US markets may also be
relatively successful, if modest performers, next year. But the seemingly
intractable problems of Japan, and the slow recovery in the continental
economy, will make it hard for equities to make substantial gains in those
markets.
Overall, equities are caught between the risk of slow worldwide growth
producing disappointing earnings, and stronger US growth sucking funds back
into America. The difficulty for investors now is in deciding how far they
dare ride the liquidity wave before it hits the beach.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management: US investors back
in the driving seat - International fund managers have enjoyed buoyant
conditions in most markets, with bonds largely leading equities upwards. A
general downward trend in short term interest rates has created a benign
framework for the capital markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It has been a year in which the US has once again come to dominate the
global investment scene.
Upstart rivals such as Japan and Europe have faced acute domestic problems
and have retreated before the tidal wave of money - aggregating nearly
Dollars 50bn during just the first half of 1993 - which has left the US and
flooded into the global equity and bond markets.
One corporate event may symbolise this new phase of American domination: the
decision by the troubled German motor giant Daimler-Benz to list its shares
in New York in October, and to agree to publish amended financial statements
which comply with the US generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP).
Not very long ago, it was countries such as Germany and Japan that were
effectively writing the rules on the back of heavy capital outflows.
However, Germany has stumbled under the burden of reunification and its
capital surplus has faded away. Japan, meanwhile, is still fighting its long
battle against debt deflation and the aftermath of the bubble economy of the
1980s.
The Japanese economy is in deep recession. One consequence is a large
balance of payments surplus that has helped to push the yen exchange rate to
extreme heights. Instead of sending more capital abroad and risking currency
losses, Japanese investors are keeping their heads down.
As for the UK, for much of the 1980s a disproportionately important
participant in the global securities markets following the 1979 abandonment
of foreign exchange curbs on portfolio investment, the institutional
allocation to overseas assets appears to have peaked out, with the typical
pension fund having an exposure of almost 30 per cent.
How big are these international securities markets? We are dealing in
international telephone numbers here, but the IMF estimates that the value
of publicly-traded debt and equity around the world is of the order of
Dollars 24,000bn. Some Dollars 14,000bn of this is managed by investment
institutions and a different agency, the United Nations, has calculated that
Dollars 2,500bn is held on a cross-border basis.
There are different theories about the right degree of international
exposure.
Some arguments are based on concepts of diversification, through which a
better balance of risk and return can be obtained so long as the different
national markets have only a low degree of correlation. Others are based on
matching theories, so that the appropriate international exposure for a
pension fund, for example, is linked to the proportion of imports in the
basket of goods and services that the future pensioner can be expected to
consume.
Whatever the details of the logic, the broad brush conclusion is that
overseas diversification is more important in a small, open economy than in
a large, closed one where a broad range of investment opportunities is
available in the domestic markets.
Strategic judgments are subject to tactical modifications, however. The
impetus of the current US portfolio outflows has been derived from perceived
declining value for money in US securities markets. Long Treasury bond
yields fell below 6 per cent at one stage this year, prompting an
intensified search for higher returns elsewhere. Dividends and
price-earnings ratios on US equities have been at historically unattractive
levels, again leading to a renewed inspection of international
opportunities.
Some of the effects have been quite strange. US pension funds have found it
hard to invest in domestic bonds which meet their actuarial return
requirements, and so they have been buyers of substantial volumes of Latin
American and other Third World debt. It is not clear whether they understand
all the risks they are taking - although probably such securities should be
seen as replacing domestic junk bonds rather than US Treasuries.
US mutual fund investors, meanwhile, have been drawn overseas for
straightforward reasons by the performance figures. Most of the
top-performing mutual funds earlier in the year were international
specialists, and investors have recently been putting nearly half of their
new money into overseas stock and bond funds in the hope of capturing extra
performance.
Although American investors have stayed light in Japanese equities, which
they have judged to be still very overvalued (correctly, on the basis of the
very latest tumble by the Tokyo market), they have been active in driving up
stock prices in Continental Europe and many less developed countries (or
emerging markets, as they are somewhat tendentiously named).
The greatly strengthened US interest in global securities markets has
created substantial opportunities for US-based investment management firms
to develop their international business.
This is putting competitive pressure on some of the London managers who have
until now been able to exploit a reputation for global skills almost
unchallenged.
US pension plan sponsors, for instance, find it less necessary to hire their
global specialist expertise in London than they used to.
London remains a leading centre for global equity management, however.
According to Technimetrics, which runs an investment management database,
equities worth Dollars 530bn were managed out of London at the end of last
year, almost as much as the Dollars 580bn of equity portfolios being run in
New York. Boston came some way back with Dollars 270bn.
Given the much higher overseas weightings in the London portfolios -
probably 30 per cent against 7 per cent in the US - the role of London is
considerable, especially when backed up by the Dollars 110bn or so
controlled in Scotland.
The biggest centre of equity fund management by far is actually Tokyo, with
funds of nearly Dollars 1,400bn, but this again is very much an
inward-looking centre: its US and European equity assets of some Dollars
60bn at the end of 1992 were less than half the size of the corresponding
portfolios run in London.
With bonds the picture is rather different. There is a lot of expertise in
bond fund management in Continental Europe, in centres such as Frankfurt and
Zurich, although London has been rapidly developing its skills in this area
too.
In some respects the management of global bond funds is easier to organise
than global equities. Economic and political data can be gathered into a
single location and analysed according to a consistent framework.
Equities are more difficult, because local information still counts for a
lot, especially in emerging markets where information may be poorly
distributed and where pricing may well be inefficient.
Managers in London have too often attracted criticism for poor performance
in the US and Japan. The obvious solution is to set up overseas subsidiary
operations which have their ears close to the ground. But this is often not
a satisfactory answer either, because global networks can be difficult to
manage, and expensive.
For a big institution, the better the quality of the people in local centres
around the globe, the more difficult it is likely to be to maintain central
control of the strategic asset allocation process.
No magic formula has been found for international fund management. There are
still plenty of opportunities for small specialists, while at the other end
of the spectrum the biggest institutions struggle with multi-office
telecommunications hook-ups across the time zones to allow their various
investment gurus to talk to each other.
Fast-talking marketing men from quantitative boutiques, armed with glamorous
global tactical asset allocation models and impeccable backtesting results,
are in direct competition with traditional international banks.
With Dollars 14,000bn of assets there to be managed around the world, and
more every day, perhaps everyone can find an opportunity.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Post-Budget rally continues in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK gilts continued their post-Budget rally, rising by about 1 1/2 points at
the ultra-long end and outperforming most continental European bond markets.
The market has been cheered by the chancellor of the exchequer's forecasts
of a declining Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, his larger than expected
spending cuts and his optimistic inflation forecasts.
Long maturities posted the biggest gains, with the yield on the 25-year
benchmark nudging against the key 6.75 per cent barrier. The March long gilt
futures contract rose by 1 5/32 on the day to 117 1/32 .
Some traders warned the market could correct ahead of Wednesday's auction of
Pounds 3bn of 6.75 per cent gilts due 2004. 'The market doesn't want to own
new paper at this level,' said a gilts trader at a large UK bank. 'I expect
to see a decent correction before the auction.'
But so far, 'there's been no sign of profit-taking, and it would be
dangerous to be short right now,' said Mr Adrian James, European bond
analyst with NatWest Markets.
Gilts' yield spread over other European bonds narrowed dramatically. The
10-year gap over German bunds dropped to 76 basis points, from 96 before the
budget. At the ultra-long end, the UK 25-year yield gap over the French
30-year benchmark dropped even more sharply, to some 17 basis points from 44
two days ago.
German government bonds edged higher in thin trading as dealers looked to
today's meeting of the Bundesbank
In the morning, hopes of a cut in official interest rates were fuelled by
rumours - later denied by the Bundesbank - that it would announce a
significant downward revision in Germany's October M3 money supply numbers
today. But towards the close, the majority of dealers expected no change in
rates today.
The December Bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 99.92, up 0.15 points.
French bonds traded largely in line with bunds. The December notional bond
future ended at 124.20, up 0.20 points.
In the Dutch market, traders are looking to Friday's likely announcement of
the first government bond issue in the 1994 calendar. Most dealers are
calling for new 10-year bonds with a coupon of around 5 3/4 per cent.
'There's a real supply shortage in that sector - we haven't had any 10-year
paper since March,' said a trader.
Japanese bonds gave up some of their recent gains but remained relatively
well supported by hopes for further interest rate cuts to boost the flagging
economy.
Amid hopes for another cut in the 1.75 per cent Official Discount Rate, the
key three-month certificate of deposit rate plunged to 2.08 per cent from
2.22. per cent on Tuesday and 2.31 per cent a week ago.
Braced for a further sign of surging economic growth, the US Treasury market
breathed a sigh of relief when an important indicator of business activity
showed only a moderate advance.
By midday the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 higher at 99 7/8 ,
to yield 6.254 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was 1/16 ahead
at 100 1/8 , yielding 4.167 per cent.
Early trading was listless as the market awaited the November report on
business activity from the National Association of Purchasing Management.
Traders were expecting the worst after a sharp rise in the Chicago index of
purchasing managers during the previous session sent bond prices down.
In the event, the national index advanced moderately to 55.7 per cent from
October's 53.8 per cent and the market took the figure in its stride.
Meanwhile, dealers moved to cover their short positions when the expected
sell-off failed to materialise.
Also encouraging was a revision in the Commerce Department's estimate of
third-quarter gross domestic product to 2.7 per cent from an earlier
estimate of 2.8 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: UK tops November government
bond league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gilts were the top performing government bonds last month showing a return
of 2.15 per cent in local currency terms, followed by Japanese government
bonds (with gains of 2.07 per cent) and Belgian government debt (2.05 per
cent), according to figures compiled by JP Morgan Securities.
The UK government bond market was boosted by favourable inflation news and a
0.5 percentage point cut in the base rate to 5.5 per cent a week ahead of
the Budget. Gilt returns since the start of the year have amounted to 17.76
per cent.
Continuing signs of economic weakness and a sharp fall in the Tokyo stock
market fuelled hopes of an easing in interest rates by the Bank of Japan and
drove the Japanese government bond market higher last month.
Among continental European bond markets, Belgium turned in the strongest
performance in November, propelled by government measures to curb social
spending, keep wage increases under control and tackle unemployment. The
measures enabled the Belgian central bank cut its key interest rates.
Italy showed the worst performance last month with a loss of 2.17 per cent,
mainly in response to the municipal election results, which sent foreign
investors scurrying out of Italian government paper. However, the
high-yielding bond markets of Spain and Italy have been the top-performers
since the start of the year in local currency terms, with returns of 28.26
per cent and 25.25 per cent respectively.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Austrian agency adds to unsold DM
mountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market let out a collective groan yesterday as a further DM800m
piled on to the mountain of unsold, D-Mark Eurobonds with maturities of more
than 10 years.
Asfinag, an Austrian government-guaranteed agency, raised DM500m through an
offering of 20-year Eurobonds while the German state of North
Rhein-Westphalia launched a DM200m issue of 25-year Eurobonds which are
puttable after 10 years.
'There is far too much supply of long-dated paper but no demand from
investors,' said one syndicate manager who was involved in the Asfinag deal.
Sales of Asfinag's bonds were reported to be slow, reflecting a view in the
market that they were expensive compared with other long-dated issues. The
bonds remained in syndicate overnight but were expected to be freed to trade
today.
Asfinag's bonds were priced to yield 51 basis points over the 6 per cent
German government bond due 2003, which was virtually the same as the current
yield spread on LKB Baden Wurttemberg's 15-year Eurobonds. Some syndicate
managers said that the yield spread on Asfinag's bonds should have been at
least eight basis points wider.
Late in the day, the German state of Schleswig-Holstein came with a DM300m
issue of 10-year Eurobonds which provide investors with an option to extend
the maturity by a further 10 years and receive a higher coupon. 'This is a
new structure which turns the puttable bond on its head,' said lead manager
JP Morgan in Frankfurt.
Merck, the largest pharmaceuticals group in the US, could provide some
sparkle to a jaded Eurobond market today when it raises Dollars 250m through
its first Eurobond offering.
The five-year bonds, via Morgan Stanley, are likely to be priced to yield
around 15 basis points over US Treasuries.
The tight yield spread reflects the borrower's triple-A rating and the
scarcity of corporate issuance in the Eurobond market.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Net sales of gilts could be
cut to Pounds 26bn in 1994-95
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government bond market could be looking at dramatically lower net
sales of Pounds 26bn in the forthcoming financial year as a result of the
lower Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and the chancellor of the
exchequer's Budget decision to 'sell some Pounds 7bn fewer gilts than would
otherwise be necessary to fund the PSBR through to the end of 1994 - 95'.
The gilt market was clearly delighted with Mr Kenneth Clarke's forecasts for
a diminishing PSBR over the next few years, which implies a sharp decline in
supply.
While there was no official revision for the 1993 - 94 PSBR in Tuesday's
Budget, some City economists expect that the original Pounds 50bn forecast
may turn out to be too pessimistic.
However, the chancellor gave the gilt market two shots of good news for the
next financial year (1994 - 95). First, the PSBR is forecast to be Pounds
38bn rather than the Pounds 44bn which Mr Norman Lamont, the previous
chancellor, projected in March 1993.
Second, Mr Clarke said that Pounds 6.8bn of gilt sales from the 1992 - 93
financial year would be used for funding between now and the end of the 1994
 -95 financial year. This follows from a change made to the funding rule in
March 1993 whereby gilt sales to the monetary sector (banks and building
societies) which in the past had not counted towards funding, would do so in
future. Mr Lamont said then that retrospective account would be taken of the
Pounds 6.8bn of purchases made in 1992 - 93 'over the next two to three
years' but did not specify when.
The implications of these two measures are that the Bank of England will not
need to issue so heavily in the gilt market. So far this year the Bank has
issued about Pounds 43bn of gilts which will fund the estimated Pounds 50bn
PSBR, leaving an estimated Pounds 7bn more funding to complete this
financial year.
The Bank has another Pounds 3bn auction lined up for December 8, and in all
likelihood will continue to hold auctions and issue stock through the first
three months of 1994 - provided market conditions remain favourable - with
the result that it will 'over-fund' for 1993 - 94. Many gilt specialists
believe the Bank would be wise to over-fund while conditions are good and
there is a bull market for gilts.
With a 1994 - 95 PSBR of Pounds 38bn, the Bank may be looking at net gilt
issuance of Pounds 26bn (taking into account the Pounds 6.8bn from gilt
sales to banks and building societies in 1992 - 93 and estimated National
Savings sales of Pounds 5bn). Taking into account gilt redemptions, gross
issuance would be around Pounds 34 - Pounds 35bn.
The Bank has been very successful in its funding programme in the last two
years, during which gilts have rallied strongly. Provided market sentiment
remains good and there are expectations of further base rate cuts, the
funding task should not prove onerous.
Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, says the chancellor
should not rush to cut the base rate to 5 per cent, but should keep the gilt
market on its toes waiting for the next half-point easing. 'If they cut
again too soon, there's a danger the market will think that is it and the
next move will be upwards,' he said.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Injunction awarded against Smith
Barney
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US judge issued a preliminary injunction yesterday prohibiting the Wall
Street securities house Smith Barney Shearson from diverting its mutual fund
administration business away from the Boston Company, the money management
company that Mellon Bank bought from Shearson last year for Dollars 1.45bn.
The injunction follows a lawsuit filed by Mellon in September which
contended that Smith Barney Shearson had been breaking an agreement the two
companies concluded when Shearson merged with Smith Barney in March.
Under the pact, it was agreed that the Boston Company would continue to
administer Shearson's mutual funds, an arrangement that had been established
in 1992 when Shearson, then part of American Express, sold the Boston
Company to Mellon.
Mellon's original lawsuit claimed that Smith Barney Shearson had dodged its
obligations to grant its mutual fund administration business to the Boston
Company by creating new funds that were replicas of the funds that the
Boston Company had run for Shearson.
Mellon has taken the issue to court because the job of administering the
Smith Barney Shearson funds provides the bulk of The Boston Company's
Dollars 170m in annual fund servicing revenues.
Under the terms of yesterday's injunction, which will last for seven years,
Smith Barney Shearson is blocked from providing administrative services to
any fund it acquired because of the Shearson merger, any fund that is
similar to existing Shearson funds, or any new fund created after Smith
Barney agreed to acquire Shearson on March 12.
The injunction also forces Smith Barney Shearson to recommend to the boards
of the relevant funds that the Boston Company administer the funds.
Smith Barney Shearson said yesterday that it was disappointed at the judge's
ruling, which would prohibit the firm from providing administrative services
to the funds 'on a more competitive cost basis'. It said it would appeal
against the ruling.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Mexico gives Televisa network
concession
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media group, has been granted a concession to 62
television stations that will enable it to extend a television network
across much of the country.
Televisa serves 90 per cent of Mexico's television audience, and takes a
similar proportion of advertising. The new network will give the company a
total of 291 television stations, about 51 per cent of the total in the
country.
The concession has been a controversy since the beginning of the year.
Rivals complained that while the government was selling off two state-owned
television national networks in an open auction, Televisa was being given
another national network without any competition.
The concession was granted to Radiotelevisora de Mexico Norte, a subsidiary
of Televisa, after it promised to pay the Mexican government Dollars 91m.
The two state-owned television networks were sold for Dollars 646m last
July, to an investor group headed by Ricardo Salinas of Grupo Elektra.
Critics say Televisa is being rewarded for its close co-operation with
Mexico's ruling party. Televisa was not available to comment.
The company is planning a secondary stock offering of about Dollars 900m
later this month, which will give it a full listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.

Mahindra and Mahindra the Indian truck manufacturer, yesterday said that its
Dollars 65m global depositary receipt (GDR) offer, was nearly eight and a
half times oversubscribed with a demand of over Dollars 550m.
The Euroissue was the first Indian GDR offering without warrants to be
priced with no discount to the ruling market price. Mahindra's GDRs were
priced at Dollars 7.44, the equivalent of Rs232.50, which was the closing
price of the company's equity share on the Bombay stock market on November
25. The issue was priced five days earlier than expected, to avoid further
demand.
Banque Paribas, lead managers, will exercise an option to increase the issue
to approximately Dollars 75m. coThe Mahindra family purchased part of the
equity, to maintain their 32 per cent stake. The money will be used to
expand and modernise production.

Trust Bank New Zealand, the country's fifth biggest bank, is to raise up to
NZDollars 200m (USDollars 109m) in a public flotation early next year,
writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
There has been speculation that it intends to use the money to buy
Countrywide Bank, the country's sixth-largest retail bank, from Bank of
Scotland. Trust Bank is the largest New Zealand-owned and controlled bank,
formed by the merger of nine regional savings banks in the late 1980s.
Chief executive Mr Graeme Pentecost said yesterday there are no specific
plans. However, ANZ McCaughan Securities analyst Mr Hugh Amundsen said the
funds being raised were well above what the bank needed for its capital
ratios, and suggested the capital may be used to buy Countrywide Bank.

<TEXT>
A 15 per cent fall in domestic wholesale cement prices has hurt profits at
Siam Cement, Thailand's largest conglomerate and building materials
supplier. Unconsolidated third-quarter net earnings slid 28 per cent to
Bt694m (Dollars 27m).
Net profits for the first nine months were 38 per cent lower at Bt2.22bn.
Many stockbrokers now think full-year consolidated earnings will dip to
Bt3bn from 1992's Bt3.98bn.
Mr Hayden Meadows, of Baring Research in Bangkok, said the company's
aggressive depreciation policy - capital values over five years - along with
heavy interest charges distorted the figures.
'Operational results have been better than expected because the demand for
cement has picked up,' he said.
Two-thirds of Siam Cement's revenue comes from cement and construction
material sales. Good returns from steel and machinery and electricals
subsidiaries boosted Siam Cement's consolidated third-quarter earnings by 2
per cent to Bt1.03bn from Bt1.011bn. The nine-month consolidated profit was
down 29 per cent to Bt2.58bn.
Siam City Cement, Thailand's second-largest cement company, reported
consolidated net earnings for the first time at Bt364m, a 2 per cent rise
over last year's parent company only figures. Nine-month consolidated
profits were Bt1.38bn.
Analysts are forecasting full-year earnings of Bt1.6bn, compared with
Bt1.24bn in 1992.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: MAS interim profit falls 96%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the state-controlled national airline, continues to
battle financial problems, with results for the six months to September 30
revealing a 96 per cent fall in pre-tax profits.
MAS made pre-tax profits in the period of MDollars 6.4m (Dollars 2.5m),
compared with MDollars 153m in the same period last year, although turnover
rose 4 per cent to MDollars 2.02bn.
Analysts point out that MAS would be in the red but for a change in
accounting policy which cut aircraft depreciation charges, thereby adding
MDollars 31m to operating profits.
The analysts say MAS is paying the price for an ambitious fleet expansion
programme launched three years ago just as the worldwide airline industry
was heading into recession. In the course of its present five year plan to
1996-97 MAS has orders for 72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn.
MAS, partially privatised in the mid-1980s but still more than 60 per cent
controlled by various state bodies, now has excess capacity on many of its
routes.
In the past MAS has benefited from cash generated by aircraft sales. Such
sales have then been incorporated into pre-tax profits. But in the six-month
period MAS was unable to sell any aircraft, adding both to its financial
difficulties and its excess capacity problems.
While MAS has managed to defer delivery on some aircraft the financial
position of the carrier is likely to come under increasing pressure in the
short term with 10 new aircraft due for delivery over the next six months.
The Malaysian government has also announced plans for a second carrier which
could take business away from MAS on domestic and regional routes.
"MAS expanded into a recession in the world aviation business,' said one
industry observer. 'It got carried away in the general euphoria about
economic growth in the south-east Asia region.
'But it's clear airlines in this part of the world are not immune from the
problems of the world economy. MAS looks set for a couple of very tough
years.'
Despite the generally gloomy assessment of MAS' prospects, the carrier's
shares have been trading at all-time highs on the Kuala Lumpur stock
exchange in recent weeks.
Analysts say there have been rumours that Bank Negara, the Malaysia central
bank, will sell some or all of its 40 per cent shareholding in MAS.
But so far there has been nothing to substantiate the reports.
State-run Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) said it earned a profit of
Rs312m (Dollars 9.9m) in the year to last June, showing a decline of more
than 70 per cent over the previous year, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
Revenue of about Rs22bn was 7.45 per cent up on 1991-92, when the profit was
put at Rs1.1bn. PIA's operating income declined to Rs623m from Rs1.58bn in
1991-92, it said.
Directors blamed the decrease mainly on global recession, introduction of an
open-sky policy by the Pakistani government allowing freer access by foreign
airlines and new domestic privately owned airlines.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kunming Machine Tool Company, the sixth Chinese state corporation to launch
its flotation on the Hong Kong stock market, has become the second most
heavily subscribed new issue in the colony's stock market history.
The HKDollars 128.7m H share offer for the company was 628 times
oversubscribed, attracting HKDollars 81.7bn (USDollars 10.6bn) in public
money. The largest over-subscription was in February, when Chinese car
manufacturer Denway pulled in HKDollars 240bn.
The offer closed on Friday, in a nervous stock market and amid increasing
concerns over the lack of agreement between Britain and China over the
colony's political future. It demonstrates the continued enthusiasm for
companies profiting from the rapid restruc turing of China's economy.
Kunming Machine Tool, founded in 1938, has developed into the market leader
within a niche industry, despite its location in the capital of one of
China's poorest provinces. About 92 per cent of its orders are in China,
servicing the manufacturing, transportation, energy, aerospace and
electronic industries.
The company is on a strong growth track, with profits forecast to increase
from Yn16.4m (Dollars 2.8bn ) to Yn31m, putting the shares on a fully
diluted prospective price-earnings ratio of 10.6, a substantial discount to
the blue chip Hang Seng Index average of more than 15.
Support for the issue was fuelled by the performance of the previous five H
share flotations. When the Kunming Machine Tool offer closed, the average
increase in share price for the previous five H share offers was 103 per
cent.

<TEXT>
Improved earnings from diamond and gold investments helped Anglo American
Corporation, South Africa's largest company, increase attributable
first-half earnings by 8 per cent to R629m (Dollars 172m) from R581m a year
ago.
Earnings per share rose to 271 cents from 251 cents and the interim dividend
was increased to 95 cents from 90 cents a share.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, predicted that full-year results would
show a similar pattern to those recorded in the first half.
Commenting on the political backdrop to the group's performance, Mr Ogilvie
Thompson welcomed the interim constitution agreed last month, describing it
as a 'major achievement' in the country's progress towards 'market democracy
status'. He also described the five-year government of national unity, which
will follow next April's election, as offering 'the best chance of creating
the political and economic stability required for growth and broadly based
development'.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson also said the economic outlook was more positive. Not
only has the country's four-year recession ended, but the economic policy
debate has produced considerable consensus. He stressed particularly
progress made on the anti-trust debate - where Anglo is normally the prime
target on account of its size - which had developed 'in a rational and
co-operative spirit'.
On the operating side, investment income rose to R690m from R641m mainly as
a result of higher dividends from Anglo's gold interests. Higher dividends
from diamonds were offset by weak performances from platinum and base metal
interests.
Trading income fell by 12 per cent to R201m because of the fall in operating
profit at Amcoal.
A R68m surplus on the realisation of certain gold investments helped lift
pre-tax income to R978m from R928m.

Montedison, the Italian industrial group controlled by the debt-ridden
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, yesterday got the green light
from shareholders for an ambitious recapitalisation.
Approval for the scheme, part of the wider rescue package for the entire
Ferruzzi group, followed Tuesday's go-ahead from Ferfin shareholders for its
own financial restructuring.
The plan for Montedison, which controls the Montecatini chemicals group as
well as Edison (energy) and Eridania Beghin-Say (sugar) envisages raising
L5,172bn (Dollars 3bn) by a mixture of new shares and warrants.
Montedison's board also gained approval to raise a further (nominal)
L1,000bn in new shares and L500bn in bonds over the next 18 months.
Mr Guido Rossi, chairman, said Montedison expected to raise about L3,629bn
over the next five years from disposals, which would also reduce its debt
burden by about L150bn.
He gave no indication as to when the group might finalise 'Project Sophia',
its ambitious joint venture in polyethelenes and polypropelenes with Shell.
The new company due to be formed would be the world's leading supplier of
such materials.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Miller Brewing to close brewery

<TEXT>
Miller Brewing Company, the second biggest brewer in the US, yesterday
announced it was to close its Fulton brewery in upstate New York next year
with the loss of all 900 jobs. Another 300 jobs are to be cut from its other
brewing operations.
The company is owned by Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and brewing
group, which last Wednesday outlined plans to cut 14,000 jobs as part of a
worldwide restructuring aimed at defending its brands against price
competition.
Two days later Philip Morris detailed the first of the cuts when it
announced that 800 hourly-paid and 100 salaried employees would be cut from
the workforce of its cigarette manufacturing operations in Richmond,
Virginia.
Miller Brewing Company, which makes Miller Lite, the world's top-selling
low-calorie beer, employs 9,000. It has been struggling in the face of
stagnant beer sales in its domestic market caused partly by a doubling of
the federal excise tax.
Mr John MacDonough, the subsidiary's chairman and chief executive, said
Miller had more production capacity than it needed and the cost of retaining
it could not be justified in an extremely competitive environment.
'By closing our Fulton brewery, we would be able to eliminate significant
fixed expenses while still meeting demand in the north-eastern US through
production at our other eastern plants,' he said.
The brewery will be closed in two phases next year: the first on January 31
and the second by October 1.
Production will be transferred to Miller breweries in Eden, North Carolina;
Albany, Georgia; and Trenton, Ohio.
The remaining 300 jobs to go are salaried posts at Miller's Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, headquarters and six other breweries.

Intel and General Instrument of the US have jointly developed new high-speed
communications devices linking personal computers to cable TV networks to
provide a broad array of information services.
The technology can transform a cable TV network into a data pipeway to the
home, delivering information 1,000 times faster than via standard telephone
lines, the companies said.
The development is the latest evidence of the rapid convergence of computer,
communications and consumer electronics technologies.
Intel is the world's biggest maker of computer chips and General Instrument
is a leading designer of TV set-top devices for cable TV systems.
Both companies are also developing technologies that will upgrade television
sets so they become terminals for interactive information services but
personal computers are more likely to lead the way toward broad use of home
information services, the companies said.
'The much touted congruence of high-speed communications and computing will
intersect at the PC long before anywhere else,' said Mr Andrew Grove,
Intel's chief executive.
Approximately 24m US households now own at least one PC, while 60m US homes
are linked to cable TV networks.
'This breakthrough could open up a vast new market of home PC-based on-line
services that cable system operators could provide with minimal capital
investment,' said Mr Daniel F. Akerson, chairman and chief executive of
General Instrument.
Two leading cable system operators, Comcast and Viacom International, are
planning to field-test the technology next year. America On-Line and
Prodigy, two leading on-line information service providers, said they would
participate in the trials.
The Viacom test will take place in Castro Valley, California, where 500
homes will initially be provided with modems to link PCs to on-line
information services, on-line games, and software distribution. Details of
the Comcast trial were not available.
Further blurring the lines between television and computer services, America
On-Line said it would also team up with General Instrument to develop
services for interactive television in 1994.

Seagram, the international drinks group, was pushed into the red in the
third quarter by losses stemming from its stake in Du Pont, the US chemicals
producer.
The net loss for the three months to October 31 was USDollars 100m, or 27
cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 166m, or 44 cents a share,
a year earlier.
The latest figure includes a Dollars 239m loss, equal to 64 cents a share,
resulting from non-recurring charges taken by Du Pont, in which Seagram has
a 24 per cent interest.
Revenues dipped to Dollars 1.41bn from Dollars 1.45bn, due to a Dollars 85m
foreign exchange loss, while operating income was virtually unchanged at
Dollars 197m, compared to Dollars 195m.
Income of the wine and spirits group, accounting for over 90 per cent of the
total, was unchanged. Weak sales in Europe, Seagram's biggest single market,
were offset by a strong performance by Chivas Regal whisky and Martell
cognac in south-east Asia and Latin America.
Tropicana, the fruit juice maker, boosted operating income by 14 per cent to
Dollars 25m, due to higher market share in the US orange juice market and
improved international results.
Earnings for the first nine months, excluding accounting changes, fell to
Dollars 232m, or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 428m, or Dollars 1.14 a
share.
Pepsi-Cola Canada will cut prices in a corporate strategy that the company
described as 'an all-out assault', AP-DJ reports from Toronto.
Pepsi Canada said it would continue to streamline operations and
administrative procedures and 'enhance its competitiveness by eliminating
activities which do not directly add value to its products, consumers and
retail customers'.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T to cut workforce in
long-distance business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, yesterday
confirmed it needed to cut jobs in its consumer long-distance business,
where it faces strong competition from rivals such as MCI Communications.
In a separate move, the company said it had signed a licencing agreement
with All China Marketing Research, a subsidiary of the Chinese government's
statistical bureau, to commercialise and market worldwide a database
containing information on more than 400,000 Chinese companies.
Responding to reports that it could be planning to cut several thousand jobs
in its consumer long-distance business, AT&amp;T acknowledged it needed to
reduce costs significantly.
It said it would take every initiative to do so before resorting to job cuts
but believed some reduction in employment would be necessary. It expected
that a significant portion would come through attrition, voluntary
separation and retraining.
AT&amp;T's consumer business, which employs some 32,000 people, is still the
largest in the US, accounting for some 60 per cent of long-distance
telephone calls.
It has, however, been losing market share to smaller rivals, notably MCI,
whose innovative marketing programmes have led to a growth rate of around 15
per cent a year, three times the industry average.
Mr Joseph Nacchio, who took over as head of the consumer business three
months ago, has a reputation as a cost cutter, and has promised to make AT&amp;T
a much more effective marketer of services.
The deal with China follows AT&amp;T's signing of a memorandum of understanding
with the Republic last February to explore business opportunities.
Eastgate Services, an information consulting arm of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories,
will publish an English language directory of the industrial database and
licence it to third parties internationally.

<TEXT>
AgipPetroli, the petroleum distribution arm of Italy's state-owned Eni
energy and chemicals group, has sold its Argentine operation to local buyers
for about L120bn (Dollars 70m).
The deal is part of a drive to dispose of non-core activities and raise
money ahead of privatisation plans for Eni's oil and gas operations by the
end of 1995.
AgipArgentina is being bought by Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, the
recently privatised Argentine state oil group which has more than 50 per
cent of the local petroleum market. AgipArgentina, created in 1960,
specialises in bottling and distributing liquefied natural gas and has about
700 employees with a market share of about 15 per cent.
The sale, which follows that of AgipPetroli's Steuart Petroleum subsidiary
in the US this year, is part of a plan to focus on markets in Europe and
south-east Asia. However, Agip will remain active in Argentina in the
lubricants sector.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Record-breaking drive for
Argentina's volume car makers - The recent revival in the industry despite
low levels of investment and profit return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once given up for dead, Argentina's car industry is recovering rapidly. Its
three volume car makers, Ciadea, Autolatina and Sevel, are breaking
production records almost every month and, for the first time in decades,
companies are considering investing, rather than divesting, in Argentina.
GM, which pulled out of Argentina 15 years ago because of political violence
and plunging sales, is investing Dollars 100m to start making pick-up trucks
next year in association with Ciadea, a local company that makes Renault
cars under licence.
Mr Leo Kunigk, the Brazilian organising the GM project, said GM will move
part of its pick-up production from the Brazilian industrial city of Sao
Paulo to Cordoba.
Output in the first year will be only 5,000 units but should build up to
around 25,000 units in a year. Four-fifths of the pick-ups would be exported
to Brazil, other South American markets and possibly the Middle East.
In addition Mazda is talking to its local distributor Cirlafin about a
Dollars 50m venture to assemble pick-ups in Buenos Aires.
Mr Sasson Attie, Cirlafin president, says he hopes to start building 5,000
Mazda pick-ups a year towards the end of 1994, and raise output to 10,000 a
year within three years. The Mazda factory, like GM's, would be equipped
with imported second hand equipment.
But talks between Isuzu and Argentina's Cametal to build buses in the
industrial city of Santa Fe are making little progress. A company official
said 'the Japanese keep saying that they're looking and studying the
situation, but nothing happens. They say it's the recession in Japan, or
that they are not in conditions to invest.'
As for the industry as a whole, output is growing at a rapid pace. Although
sales dipped 6 per cent in October, output this year should hit a record
340,000 units, one-third more than last year. Next year it is forecast to
rise to 400,000 units and it should hit 500,000 units before the end of the
decade.
Demand is expected to remain strong as Argentines continue to replace their
obsolete cars, the average age of which is estimated to be 15 years. In
addition, economic growth, forecast at 5-6 per cent a year to the end of the
decade, should boost sales further.
However, Argentina, a country of only 32m people, is not the main objective
of the manufacturers. The great prize is privileged access to the much
bigger Brazilian market through the Mercosur common market, that takes in
Paraguay and Uruguay as well as Argentina and Brazil.
Mr Alan Acosta, an analyst at Baring Securities in Argentina, said: 'The
size of the combined Mercosur market is estimated to be about 1.5m units a
year and is expected to grow to 3m by the year 2000'.
Trade in cars and parts between Brazil and Argentina was worth about Dollars
1bn last year.
Both governments require that trade be balanced. Companies based in both
countries, like Autolatina, the company that manages Ford and Volkswagen in
Brazil and Argentina, can meet this requirement relatively easily.
But Brazil-based GM lacks a foothold in Argentina while Ciadea has no
operations in Brazil. GM, which exported about 13,500 pick-ups and small
cars to Argentina last year, has trouble balancing this with imports of
Ciadea's cars and vans. Building pick-ups in Argentina with Ciadea and
shipping them to Brazil will make it easier to balance trade.
The government also hopes increased competition will help the local car
industry to shape up. It is the only large industrial sector still
benefiting from significant import barriers and will retain this protection
until the end of the decade.
As a result, the industry's costs are high and investment has been low.
Despite 1992 sales of Dollars 5.09bn, the industry's trade association Adefa
says investments were only about Dollars 140m.
It puts investments this year at Dollars 240m. Sevel, a locally-owned
company which dominates the market with Fiats and Peugeots made under
licence, has invested only Dollars 160m in 1992-93, despite sales of Dollars
1.38bn in the nine months to September.
Profits are thin as well. Sevel, one of Argentina's two quoted car
companies, earned Dollars 52.6m to September, a margin of just 3.8 per cent
over sales. However, performance at Ciadea, where Renault transferred
control to local management last year, did better, with a 7 per cent margin
on sales of Dollars 1bn.
Sales across the industry are levelling off after their heady explosion
following economic stabilisation in 1991. Although analysts are confident
growth will remain steady in the coming years, Argentina is unlikely to
repeat the days of the 1960s when it had 24 car manufacturers.
Companies and government both say Argentina cannot compete with Brazil's
lower cost, high-volume car makers. They hope instead that Argentina can
attract investments in more sophisticated design and component niches as
well as volume production.
However, for that to happen, the industry will need a shake-up in
management, a big reduction in costs, more investment and more training to
raise productivity. And productivity will first have to rise to Brazil's
levels and then to world levels if the industry is to survive the planned
elimination of import protection in 2000.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Boeing forced to cut more staff
and production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, is to reduce
production of its 737 and 747 jets further next year and cut its workforce
by between 2,000 and 3,000 because of continued recession in the world
aviation industry.
The move comes on top of a programme, announced early this year, to sharply
cut production of its 737, 747, 757 and 767 jets, which involves the loss of
some 28,000 jobs.
Mr Ron Woodard, executive vice-president of the company's Commercial
Airplane business, said yesterday: 'While there are some signs of
improvement in the air travel market, losses or inadequate profits continue
at many airlines.'
'Until more customers are in a position to order new airplanes, we must
reduce our production, as painful as that is for our employees, for our
suppliers and for our communities.'
Production of the 747 jumbo jet, which is now at five a month and is due to
drop to three in February, will fall to two a month from January 1995. The
smaller, twin-engined 737 aircraft, now produced at 10 a month, will drop to
8.5 a month next November.
The cutbacks will have a significant knock-on effect on parts suppliers such
as Northrop, the Los Angeles-based group which makes fuselage sections for
the 747. They will also have an impact on the economy of Seattle, Washington
State, where most of Boeing's 118,000 employees work.
Yesterday's announcement dashed hopes that Boeing would be able to shore up
its current production rates with its share of an impending order for up to
60 aircraft from Saudi, the Saudi Arabian state-run carrier. The order is
also being pursued by rivals McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie.
That order is likely to be the last big one for many months in a market
which has battered the main three manufacturers.

Thyssen, the German steel and engineering group, incurred a loss of DM994m
(Dollars 391.3m) for the year ended September, against a profit of DM350m
the previous year.
As a result, it will not pay a dividend. In 1991-92, shareholders received
DM6 a share.
The company said all non-steel divisions experienced a decline in sales and
profits, with the exception of the US Budd subsidiary, which makes
automotive parts. The steel divisions suffered massive, undisclosed losses.
Although operational results improved in the second half of the year,
earnings were swallowed by extraordinary expenses for the restructuring of
the steel divisions.
Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive, launched an attack against remaining state
subsidies for European steelmakers, saying such hand-outs were threatening
the survival of German private steel companies.
'We cannot afford a steel industry when politicians in Bonn and Brussels are
unwilling to create fair competition,' he said.
Sales at Thyssen Stahl, representing a third of group turnover, fell 15 per
cent to DM10.6bn. The group spent DM400m this year on restructuring the
business.
Talks are also continuing between Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's
second-largest steelmaker, on the possibility of merging special steel
activities.

Richemont, the Swiss group combining the Rothmans tobacco and the Cartier
and Dunhill luxury goods businesses, has defied the prevailing pessimism
over branded products. It reported a 9.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits,
to Pounds 310.9m (Dollars 460.1m), for the six months to September 30.
Mr Anton Rupert, managing director, said although times were tough, his
faith in brands was unshaken. 'I would rather keep on supporting our brands
in a recession than show a big increase in earnings,' he said.
Group sales were up 13.2 per cent, to Pounds 1.7bn, but almost all of the
growth came from currency gains. Net income rose by only 2.2 per cent to
Pounds 96.6m, because the strong performance of Rothmans' 50 per cent-quoted
companies in Malaysia and Australia led to a 29 per cent jump in deductions
for minority interests.
Rothmans' worldwide cigarette volumes were 9 per cent lower, with the drop
particularly pronounced in France, the UK and the former Yugoslavia.
Vendome, the new holding company combining Dunhill and Cartier, the group's
luxury goods interests, saw sales rise 15.4 per cent to Pounds 524.4m in the
half year, helped substantially by favourable currency changes.
Similarly, exchange rates, combined with the impact of cost-cutting, enabled
Vendome to increase operating profits by 23.9 per cent, to Pounds 90.1m from
Pounds 72.7m. However, the increase in operating profits was restricted to
just 8 per cent in Swiss francs.
The strongest area of Vendome's activity was the jewellery and pens
division, which includes Cartier and Mont Blanc. The watch division suffered
a 3 per cent fall in sales, and the leather goods business, which is heavily
dependent on the volatile Japanese market, slipped by 11 per cent.
Operating losses on other activities rose to Pounds 8.7m from Pounds 8m.
Larger losses at the satellite television network, FilmNet, in which the
group has a 45 per cent stake, overwhelmed the lower profits of the US
direct retailing interests.
Mr Rupert said Vendome's sales in October were slightly below those of a
year earlier. However, he forecast that both it and Rothmans would turn in
satisfactory full-year results. There would be further significant costs at
FilmNet.

Thyssen, the German steel and engineering group, incurred a loss of DM994m
(Dollars 391.3m) for the year ended September, against a profit of DM350m
the previous year.
As a result, it will not pay a dividend. In 1991-92, shareholders received a

Although operational results improved in the second half of the year,

Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive, launched a bitter attack against remaining
state subsidies for European steelmakers, saying such hand-outs were
threatening the survival of German private steel companies.
'We cannot afford a steel industry when politicians in Bonn and Brussels are
unwilling to create fair competition,' he said. He was referring to German
government support for Ekostahl, a loss-making east German steel mill, and
to the failure of the European Commission to reach an agreement on reducing
state subsidies for steel.
Sales at Thyssen Stahl, representing a third of group turnover, fell 15 per
cent to DM10.6bn. The group spent DM400m this year on restructuring Thyssen
Stahl, including 15,000 job cuts between October 1992 and October 1994.
Talks are also continuing between Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's
second-largest steelmaker, on the possibility of merging special steel
activities, including tin plates, non-corrosive steels and sheets for the
electrical industry.
Members of the board of both companies are due to meet on December 16 to
discuss proposals ranging from managerial co-operation to full mergers.
Thyssen warned, however, that such talks had been held in the past without
yielding concrete results.
Among the non-steel divisions, Thyssen Industrie, capital and manufacturing
goods, recorded a 7 per cent drop in sales to DM8.1bn.
Sales in the trading and services divisions were DM14.1bn, down 2 per cent.
Thyssen said that despite the slowdown in economic activity, a 'declining
but satisfactory profit' was recorded in this division.

Volvo is losing the battle against shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week ago, Volvo saw the tide turning in its struggle to win shareholder
approval for the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with
France's Renault. However, a flood of opposition has now engulfed the
beleaguered group, threatening the deal anew.
Little has gone right since the Fourth Fund state pension fund, the second
biggest Volvo shareholder after Renault, and the Folksam insurance group
announced last Thursday they would support the merger.
Since then, the number of Swedish institutional shareholders opposed to the
deal has grown to seven, with none joining the Fourth Fund and Folksam in
the 'yes' camp. Moreover, opponents made much of the narrow 8-6 majority
within the board of the Fourth Fund, which undermined its symbolic
importance as the 'swing vote' in the merger affair.
The determination of those opposed to the deal has been hardened by the fact
that the Fourth Fund vote was carried largely because of the support of the
blue-collar trade unions, government officials, and the fund's chief
executive who, it turned out, sits on the board of Volvo's group finance
unit. These forces beat off the opposition of representatives from private
industry.
The parade of senior business figures to line up against Volvo over the past
few days has been impressive. The objections they have aired against the
merger agreement have also shown that the Swedish opposition runs much
deeper than worries about the privatisation of Renault and terms of a
subsequent state golden share.
The deal's essential feature - that Volvo would sell its vehicle-making
operations to Renault in exchange for a 35 per cent stake in the merged
company - has, at best, been seen by critics as a too-vague valuation of
Volvo and, at worst, as the unacceptable sell-out of Sweden's industrial
crown jewels.
A powerful voice in the 'no' camp is Mr Gunnar Johansson, a former Volvo
chief executive and member of the Fourth Fund board.
'The merger,' he declared, 'transforms Volvo from a vehicle-manufacturer to
an investment company. That cannot be right for a company whose name means
'I roll''.
Others have weighed into the public debate, notably Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief
executive of Skandia, the insurance company, and Mr Marcus Storch, chief
executive of Aga, the industrial gas group.
'French interests will dominate the new (merged) company at all levels,'
said Mr Wolrath. 'Volvo's engagement in the automotive industry will be
limited to three executive posts on the board of (the merged holding
company),' said Mr Storch. 'For shareholders . . . the Volvo parent will be
valued as an investment company, with a discount.'
At the same time, Volvo's case has been weakened by internal developments.
Both Skandia and the S-E Banken Funds, which announced its opposition
yesterday, cited a growing hostility to the merger among Volvo employees,
led chiefly by the engineers and white-collar workers.
'We are very concerned about the doubts among Volvo's personnel, especially
the engineers,' said Mr Peter Thelin, chief executive of the S-E Banken
Funds. 'If you don't have your employees with you going into a merger like
this it will be very damaging.' Ironically, Volvo has also been a victim of
its own recent success. Figures leaked this week showed the company made an
operating profit of SKr460m (Dollars 54.3m) in October, more than it showed
in the whole first nine months.
This has been fuel on the fire for those arguing that Volvo cars and trucks
could survive without the merger, especially given the recent trend of
falling profits at Renault.

unit

<TEXT>
The French government has asked Renault to draw up plans to prolong activity
at Chausson, the motor group which suspended payments in September.
Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, said the government was seeking to
ensure the industrial future of Chausson, which is owned 50-50 by Renault,
the state-owned automotive group, and Peugeot, its private-sector rival.
Mr Longuet said Peugeot's decision to stop manufacturing bodies for its 504
utility vehicle from the end of November left the fate of the company in
Renault's hands.
Chausson has two factories on the outskirts of Paris, at Creil and
Gennevilliers. It manufactures body parts and components for cars, including
Renault's Trafic van.
Mr Longuet said rationalisation was still necessary at Chausson, which has
been confronted by an increasingly difficult financial situation.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Rescue talk triggers Euro Disney
share rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Euro Disney, the struggling leisure group, rose 12 per cent
yesterday on speculation about the progress of negotiations over the
company's emergency financial restructuring. They closed FFr4.20 higher at
FFr36.45.
The rise was triggered by a report in La Tribune, the French financial
newspaper, that Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which owns 49 per
cent of Euro Disney, had offered to inject FFr3bn (Dollars 341m) of fresh
capital into the company.
However, the Disney camp said the report related to a meeting in Paris three
weeks ago, at which Walt Disney told Euro Disney's 60-strong banking
syndicate it would be willing to participate in a rescue rights issue. Walt
Disney's share of such an issue would be roughly equivalent to FFr3bn.
Sources said there had been no formal contact between Walt Disney and the
Euro Disney banks - which are owed FFr20.3bn and include Deutsche Bank,
National Westminster and Citibank - since last month's meeting.
The next stage in negotiations will be the formation of an official steering
committee by the Euro Disney banks, which are presently split into two
syndicates.
The committee is expected to be headed by Banque Nationale de Paris or
Banque Indosuez, the heads of the existing syndicates. Once the committee
has been formed, it will map out a negotiating strategy for the banks
against Euro Disney and Walt Disney.
In the meantime, the banks plan to commission an investigative audit of Euro
Disney. The audit will assess the company's present financial position and
its capital requirements for the future.
Euro Disney's shares, which collapsed following last month's surprise
announcement of a FFr5.3bn net loss for the year ended September, have risen
18 per cent since the start of this week, when they were worth FFr30.90.

FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Currency gains bolster profits
at Rothmans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Favourable exchange rates lifted first-half profits of Rothmans
International, the restructured tobacco group, by 11.5 per cent. The rise
came in spite of a 9 per cent decline in worldwide cigarette sales writes
Philip Rawstorne.
Operating profit rose 8.6 per cent, to Pounds 212.6m (Dollars 314.6m), in
the six months ended September, on net sales 12 per cent ahead at Pounds
1.22bn. Taxable profits, boosted by Pounds 29m from currency translation,
rose from Pounds 209.3m to Pounds 233.4m.
Due to the complexity and timing of the group's reconstruction, a single
dividend for the year will be paid next August.
Much of the overall decline in cigarette volumes was accounted for by lower
sales in the UK, France, and the former Yugoslavia. Profits in western
Europe were also hit by taxation changes in Germany and rationalisation
costs of Pounds 16.7m, mainly in Belgium.
Operating profit in Malaysia benefited from price increases and a favourable
change in the mix of brand sales. The contribution from Australia, Indonesia
and the Philippines improved after last year's Pounds 9.2m exceptional
costs. However, in the Philippines volumes were significantly lower due, in
part, to the closure last December of Alhambra Industries.
Net investment income rose 54 per cent, from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 20.8m.
In spite of difficult conditions in a number of markets, Lord Swaythling,
chairman, said he expected satisfactory full-year trading results. Profits,
however, would reflect the effects of reconstruction costs of Pounds 48m.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Development Securities to spend Pounds 44m
on properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development Securities, formerly Clayform Properties, yesterday announced
two acquisitions for Pounds 44m to be partly funded by a placing and open
offer to raise about Pounds 29.3m.
Mr Robert Ware, joint managing director, said that yesterday's moves were
the same as those which had been planned for November, when the property
investor and developer postponed the share issue and acquisitions amid press
comment about an investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry into
dealings in the shares of Clayform.
Mr Ware said that the company welcomed the probe which was - as he
understood it - looking into dealings on the two days before Mr Martin
Landau, the property entrepreneur, joined DS as deputy chairman. He
emphasised that the dealings had 'nothing to do with the company or the
directors'.
DS is buying a portfolio of 85 properties from Ethel Austin Properties for
Pounds 26m, Pounds 25m of which will be in cash. Valued at Pounds 25.8m on
December 1, they consist mainly of retail units in town and city centres.
Currently the properties produce net rental income of about Pounds 2.2m a
year.
DS is also acquiring Grafton Estates for Pounds 18m, of which Pounds 15.4m
will be in loan notes, Pounds 2.2m in cash and the balance in shares.
Grafton has a portfolio of 10 properties across the UK; which were valued at
December 1 at Pounds 28.3m and produce rental income of about Pounds 2.5m a
year.
Mr Ware said that the acquisitions would increase retail property's share of
DS's portfolio to 69 per cent of the total leaving offices with 25 per cent
and the industrial property with the remainder.
DS is issuing some 93.7m shares at 32 1/2 p - the shares were unchanged
yesterday at 33 1/2 p - on a 4-for-5 basis. It is also borrowing Pounds 15m
to lift the Pounds 29m from the placing to the Pounds 44m acquisition price.
Year-end debt will be between Pounds 31m and Pounds 33m, giving pro forma
gearing of 45-50 per cent.

Provisions against stocks of properties left Dunton Group with pre-tax
losses of Pounds 3.79m for the year to May 31, against losses of Pounds
803,000.
Turnover for this USM-quoted company with interests in brickmaking,
engineering and property, was Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.74m). Provisions,
resulting from the revising of the carrying value of the company's assets,
totalled Pounds 2.66m.
Further provisions of Pounds 3.36m were taken against the revaluation
reserve and the group now has negative net assets of Pounds 4.02m.
Losses per share were 8.91p (1.01p).

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Field grows by 14% to Pounds 6.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Field Group, the folding carton company which floated on the stock market in
July, yesterday reported interim results showing a 14.4 per cent rise in
pro-forma pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.8m - in line with expectations.
The interim dividend is set at 2.3p, an 8 per cent rise on the dividend the
group indicated it would have paid had it been public last year.
The shares rose 8p to 273p, compared to the float price of 250p.
Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive, said that the high level of promotional
activity by customers such as supermarkets - which adversely affects Field's
business by shortening runs - had not eased as hoped. Mareen, the Belgian
subsidiary, had been affected by the economic slowdown in continental
Europe, although it had recently won two new contracts worth Pounds 1.5m.
However, the group's Portsmouth factory had beaten expectations on its
tobacco packaging machine, installed in February.
Mr Gilchrist said recovery in the UK was still slow and fragile, but there
were signs of improvement further ahead. For instance, orders for Easter egg
packaging next year were not imaginative, but designs for Easter 1995 now
being discussed were revealing a greater desire for innovation from
customers suggesting, he said, 'marketeers are less constrained by
accountants'.
Pressure on selling prices had been balanced by raw material price
reductions and through cost cutting. Turnover growth in the half to October
3 was 10.5 per cent to Pounds 75m, although volume growth was higher than
that.
Operating profits rose 10.7 per cent to Pounds 6.97m, including Pounds
205,000 from the packaging business bought from Boots in July. Pro-forma
interest charges fell to Pounds 176,000 (Pounds 360,000). The tax charge for
the year is estimated at 26 per cent. Earnings per share were 8.5p (7.5p) on
a pro-forma basis.
Despite the Pounds 5.7m acquisition of the Boots business, net debt was
Pounds 1m.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Osborne back into property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Trevor Osborne, former chairman of Speyhawk, the debt-strapped
development company which went into receivership in May, yesterday took
another step back into the property world with the launch of a facilities
management company.
The new concern, Building and Property Group, is a joint venture formed by
Amec, the UK construction company, and Pell Frischmann, the international
engineering consultancy.
BPG paid the UK government Pounds 10.4m for two former Property Services
Agency businesses, Building Management South East and Building Management
South &amp; West.
Mr Osborne, brought in to chair the company through Pell Frischmann, claimed
the joint venture is the UK's largest facilities management company, with
pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 20m for the year to March 1994 on sales
of Pounds 450m.
Unkindly dubbed 'Clever Trevor', Mr Osborne, one of the best known figures
in the UK property industry, is anxious to put the unhappy experience of
Speyhawk behind him. At the time of the receivership 46 banks were owed more
than Pounds 350m secured on assets of Pounds 200m. Mr Osborne said:
'Building and Property is the story - not me.'

<TEXT>
Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 54,000 were announced by Northamber, the
supplier of computer hardware and software, for the half year to October 31.
Losses last time were Pounds 495,000 restated.
Mr David Phillips, chairman, said the result reflected the benefit of the
closure of Studley in Ireland, which lost Pounds 258,000 in the first half
last year and more than Pounds 1m in the full year.
On trading he said that competition continued to intensify and gross margins
declined again in the period.
It was clear, he stated, that the 1993-94 year could be another difficult
year for the sector.
Turnover improved to Pounds 45.7m compared with Pounds 45.3m which included
Pounds 3.05m from discontinued operations.
Losses per share were 0.3p (2.2p).

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Gibbs Mew ahead to Pounds 1.6m as cask ale
sales jump 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based brewer and commercial property company, has
built upon the revival shown in last time's second half. The USM-quoted
group yesterday reported a marked improvement in profits and earnings per
share and its first increase in the level of interim dividend since 1990.
Profits before tax for the six months to October 2 amounted to Pounds 1.6m,
against Pounds 317,000 in the corresponding period and Pounds 1.17m for the
last full year. Comparisons were restated for FRS 3.
Mr Tom Hedderson, appointed non-executive chairman in October following the
death of Mr Peter Gibbs, who had headed the company since 1967, said the
group had 'produced real growth and profit despite economic and trading
conditions that remain extremely fragile and exceptionally competitive'.
The increase, he said, reflected the integration of UK D and the move away
from high volume low margin business. Turnover totalled Pounds 18.4m (Pounds
11.8m); adjusted for UK D sales, however, the figure fell by some Pounds
1.5m.
The brewery division was the main engine of growth with volume sales of
cask-conditioned ales ahead by some 25 per cent.
The interim dividend is raised 25 per cent to 3.75p (3p), payable from fully
diluted earnings of 16.99p (2.44p).

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Bio-technology losses widen to
Pounds 8.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Bio-technology, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday announced
losses of Pounds 8.81m for the six months to October 31, against Pounds
4.72m.
The company blamed the 87 per cent increase on escalating costs of
developing a new generation of anti-cancer and anti-Aids drugs.
Mr James Noble, finance director, said the results were within budget but
warned that further losses were inevitable as the company continued clinical
trials of drugs which would not go on sale for at least three years.
The range of drugs being tested by the company includes new treatments for
cancer, HIV, acute shock and asthma.
Mr Noble claimed most biotechnology companies incur losses while they
develop such drugs, and British Bio-technology was no exception.
The results also included second quarter figures which showed turnover, on
continuing operations, of Pounds 693,000 (Pounds 1.2m). Losses amounted to
Pounds 4.61m (Pounds 1.83m) and losses per share worked through at 12.7p
(5.1p).
Losses are expected to worsen next year with the launch of clinical trials
in the US.
These trials will be conducted by a new subsidiary in Maryland which will
oversee drug development and seek regulatory approval in the US.
'We're moving into the most expensive stage of development and we will need
to raise more money,' Mr Noble said.
The company expects to make a share placing in 1994 and hopes to forge
alliances with large pharmaceutical manufacturers to cover development costs
of its patented drugs.
Turnover for the six months declined from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 2.83m,
mainly reflecting the disposal of British Bio-technology Products, its
research reagent and assays subsidiary, which was sold in July to Techne
Corp of the US.
Interim losses per share widened from 14.3p to 24.3p.

Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, the US-based international insurance broker,
is to acquire Clay &amp; Partners, one of the UK's biggest actuarial firms.
A&amp;A paid Clay's partners with 2.27m shares of A&amp;A common stock, valuing the
firm, which provides employee benefits and related consulting services to
corporate clients, at Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m).
The deal is A&amp;A's biggest since it acquired Reed Stenhouse in 1985 and
signals growing interest among international insurance brokers in the skills
of actuaries, which are increasingly important in commercial insurance and
linked consultancy business.
The world's biggest broker, Marsh &amp; McLennan, acquired William M Mercer, the
UK's biggest firm of actuaries, in 1986.
Clay employs 90 qualified actuaries, ranking third equal in size in the UK
with Bacon &amp; Woodrow. Its practice complements the more regionally
diversified consultancy business of Alexander Consulting Group, the A&amp;A
consulting subsidiary.
Mr Brian Kennedy, chairman and chief executive of ACG in Europe, said the
new business - Alexander Clay &amp; Partners - will be made up of 650
professional and support staff.
He said Clay's 'actuarial strength complements ACG's existing human resource
management consulting services.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition costs cut Cape to Pounds 6.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cape, the building products and industrial services company, reported
pre-tax profits down by 6 per cent to Pounds 6.1m in the six months to
September 30, against Pounds 6.5m.
The company blamed interest payments of Pounds 600,000, compared with
receivable of Pounds 100,000. Net borrowings at the period end were Pounds
8.5m following the Pounds 8.25m acquisition in January of Darchem
Contracting.
Group operating profits rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 6.7m. The figure was
after a Pounds 1m loss at Socap, the French insulation business.
The loss followed an investigation which discovered that the subsidiary's
profits had been overstated.
Mr Michael Farebrother, chief executive, said yesterday: 'The management
responsible for the problems in the French company have been dismissed.'
Socap's activities have been cut and the workforce reduced by 100.
The financial mis-statements were corrected by a Pounds 5.9m adjustment to
shareholders' funds in the balance sheet to March 31, he added.
Socap's poor performance contributed to a 20 per cent decline in operating
profits of the industrial services division to Pounds 3.3m. Turnover fell 10
per cent to Pounds 83.6m.
The problems were offset by the building and architectural products
division, where operating profits rose from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 4.1m and
turnover increased Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 35.3m.
Cape's results were also held back by a Pounds 200,000 increase to Pounds
800,000 in the compensation provision for former workers suffering from
asbestosis.
Group turnover declined by 7 per cent to Pounds 118.9m (Pounds 127.9m). The
interim dividend is maintained at 3p, payable from earnings per share down
from 8.2p to 7.6p.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey improves 6% - Car catalyst
side casts shadow over mid-term performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group, lifted profits before
tax by 6 per cent from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 35.1m in the six months to
September 30 1993.
The interim dividend goes up from 3.2p to 3.4p.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said the group had performed well.
The result was widely predicted but analysts came away from a meeting with
management disappointed by the performance of the car catalyst business,
where turnover was up only 2 per cent, and the share price dipped 3p to 496p
in an otherwise rising market.
Some analysts also suggested that JM had been a good defensive stock in the
recession but was unlikely to gain as much as other companies from the
recovery.
Earnings per share rose 21 per cent, from 12.1p to 14.6p, after a one-off
Pounds 3.7m saving on ACT from the group's enhanced scrip dividend
alternative.
Mr Davies gave little away about the second half.
He said there were some 'encouraging' signs of growth in the US economy but
recovery in the UK remained fragile and JM was experiencing poor conditions
in other European markets.
Platinum group metals prices are important to JM because it takes a
percentage commission from Rustenburg of South Africa.
Mr Davies pointed out that, although rhodium prices had recovered from their
lowest levels, 'any significant improvement in platinum group metals prices
is unlikely without sustained economic recovery.'
The materials technology division provided the highlight of the half-year
and continued its recovery with a 53 per cent improvement in operating
profit to Pounds 13.5m.
Operating profit at the catalytic systems division was slightly ahead at
Pounds 13.2m; in the colour and printing division it was up 19 per cent at
Pounds 5m, while the precious metals division's operating profit was down by
Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 10.1m.
Mr Davies revealed that, after a successful two-year collaboration, JM had
signed a license agreement with Sandoz Pharma, the Swiss group, for a class
of anti-viral compounds which have a novel mechanism of action against the
virus that causes Aids.
The compounds were identified at JM's biomedical research facilities and
have been patented.
Mr Davies also pointed out that. although 50 per cent of JM's profit was
earned outside the UK, where it is based, only a small proportion was earned
in the growth markets of Asia.
The company was attending to this: a Pounds 25m facility had been opened in
Japan and the group was 'well down the road' towards establishing a car
catalyst manufacturing plant 'somewhere in south-east Asia.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Anglo United reduces deficit to Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo United reported a sharply reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.5m for the
six months to September 30, helped by a 'significant recovery' in its
Coalite smokeless fuel business.
On sales from continuing operations of Pounds 236m (Pounds 244m), profit
before interest was Pounds 5.7m, against a Pounds 6.4m loss in the
comparable period.
Interest payable of Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 16.2m) meant that losses at the
pre-tax stage narrowed from Pounds 22.6m to Pounds 6.5m.
The results for the first half of 1992 were hit by the Pounds 11.2m costs
connected to its bank restructuring, abortive disposals and loan write-offs.
Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said that in the period under review efforts had
been focused on improving divisional performance.
The Pounds 2m profits advance to Pounds 4.8m in the smokeless fuels division
had been achieved mainly through cost reductions. These had offset reduced
demand for coal from electricity generators and for the various industrial
services provided to British Coal.
Lower demand from agrochemical producers hit the liquid fuels and chemicals
division, which had an operating loss of Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 200,000).
Mr Cottam said operating profits from other businesses rose to Pounds 1.3m
(Pounds 1.2m), excluding Dundee, Perth &amp; London Shipping, sold in March.
Losses per share were cut to 0.8p (7.1p).

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: LWT considers making bid for Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television is considering making a bid for Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees, the financially-troubled ITV company in which it holds a 14 per cent
stake.
Following Carlton Communication's agreed conditional bid for Central this
week, attention is turning to the future of LWT, the most attractive
takeover target after Central.
Granada, which early this year bought 20 per cent in LWT, is being put off
by the latter's hefty 593p share price and is also reluctant to move before
a proposed ITV ownership rule change is approved by parliament.
The debate on the rule change, which outside London will allow one ITV
company to hold two broadcasting licences, is scheduled for next Wednesday.
Granada's results are due on the same day.
Sir Christopher Bland, LWT chairman, is believed to be determined not to
accept a takeover if he can find an alternative that makes financial sense
for shareholders.
Every possible target is being analysed at LWT, but despite the obvious
difficulties Yorkshire-Tyne Tees has not been ruled out and is still being
considered seriously.
The main problems include the need to divest Tyne Tees and demonstrate that
Yorkshire (in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 14 per cent
stake) could be quickly returned to profit.
Uncertainty in the City over a possible bid could lead to a fall in the LWT
share price, which could in turn make it easier for Granada to pounce.
Senior managers at Tyne Tees would, however, be interested in a buy-out,
although it is unclear whether such a deal could be financed.
The Yorkshire-Tyne Tees results are expected on December 14 and are likely
to show pre-tax losses of about Pounds 5m, mainly because of over-trading
and discounting of advertising.
The problems are likely to be tackled in the 1992-93 accounts and Lazer, the
LWT advertising sales team which formally takes over the Yorkshire sales
business on January 1, will be able to sell 100 per cent of the
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees airtime.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees is capitalised at only about Pounds 90m, compared with
LWT's market capitalisation of some Pounds 600m.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Argyll joins store price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll Group yesterday became the third of the UK's big three retailers to
admit that the trading climate was becoming more difficult in UK food
retailing and that it was altering its strategy.
The group, which includes the Safeway, Lo-Cost and Presto chains, reported
an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 205.1m to Pounds 217.3m.
It warned, however, that trading would be difficult in the second half with
increased price competition from Sainsbury and Tesco.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, said Argyll had adopted a three-point plan.
Safeway has launched an 'everyday low pricing' campaign, cutting the prices
of about 200 own-label and branded goods. The group has also cut its planned
capital spending from Pounds 650m to Pounds 550m and is reviewing its policy
on depreciation of land and buildings, which is likely to result in a Pounds
40m profits hit this year.
Mr David Webster, deputy chairman, said Safeway had not lost sales to the
growing band of discounters such as Aldi, Netto and Kwik Save, but had been
affected by a chain reaction.
The spread of discounters offering very low prices had forced superstore
operators Asda and Gateway to cut their prices to compete, which in turn had
forced Sainsbury and Tesco to respond.
This, he said, had destabilised the market, but he believed it would
eventually regain its equilibrium. In the meantime, the bigger chains were
best-placed to withstand the increasing competition.
'Chains with advantages of scale and efficiency, with big own brands, and
who are prepared to tough it out, are in a much stronger position than new
entrants.'
Group sales were up 11 per cent to Pounds 3.15bn (Pounds 2.84bn). Sales at
the Safeway chain increased 13 per cent to Pounds 2.55bn with new stores
contributing 12.7 points of the increase. With inflation at about 2 per cent
for the year, like-for-like sales were down about 1.7 per cent.
Operating profits at Safeway increased 21 per cent to Pounds 187.5m (Pounds
155.3m).
News from the Presto and Lo-Cost chains was less positive. Turnover
increased 3 per cent to Pounds 601m, but operating profit fell 15 per cent
to Pounds 23.7m. This was due mainly to a fall in profits at Lo-Cost, which
Mr Webster admitted had been hit by competition from chains such as Aldi and
Netto.
Group earnings were up 6 per cent to 14.1p (13.3p), and the interim dividend
is raised to 3.75p (3.55p).

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pearson acquires Extel Financial for Pounds
73.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the publishing and media group, yesterday agreed to buy Extel
Financial, the financial information group, from United Newspapers for
Pounds 73.5m.
There was considerable interest in Extel, which pushed the purchase price
beyond the expected Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m, but it is believed that Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, was the only bidder willing to buy all five
divisions of Extel Financial, including the lossmaking Financial Systems
side.
The purchase price, which has delighted United, includes repayment of an
Pounds 11.8m inter-company loan.
Pearson, which announced in July it intended to concentrate on its media
interests, said the buy would accelerate its expansion 'into electronically
delivered information markets not only in Europe but also in the US and
Asia.'
Extel Financial's businesses range from financial and corporate information
on securities to financial news and services for investment admin-istration
and analysis.
According to Pearson, Extel's 1992 sales were Pounds 34.5m and pre-tax
profits, excluding pension credit, Pounds 5.6m before losses of Pounds 2.8m
in Financial Systems, a division providing investment accountancy systems
and services. Pearson believes the losses can be cut sharply next year.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the deal was
'good news for United and a considerable challenge for Pearson.'
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United, said that after provision for
goodwill the sale would realise a net gain of more than Pounds 25m.
Extel, whose managing director is Mr Martin Brooks, a former Financial Times
executive, will continue as a separate operating subsidiary with the
Financial Times Group.
Mr Fred Perkins, managing director of Financial Times Information Services,
said Extel was in almost every area complementary to FTIS services such as
the Profile data base.
As part of the deal Pearson also gets a 50 per cent share of a joint venture
with Agence France Press which operates the AFX electronic financial news
service.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: New Rothmans and Vendome lose appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An appeal by New Rothmans and Vendome Luxury Group to have their shares
included in FT-SE Actuaries share indices has been turned down by the appeal
committee.
However, the committee said it 'would strongly hope that a means may be
speedily found whereby New Rothmans and Vendome Luxury Group may be included
in the UK indices.'
The shares were excluded by the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Steering
Committee because the companies do not conform to the definition of UK
companies.
A working party will now start to review the share indices ground rules on
the inclusion of shares in companies with cross border capital structures.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: GEC expected to acquire choicest parts of
Ferranti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even though GEC yesterday abandoned its 1p a share rescue bid for Ferranti,
Britain's biggest manufacturing group is still expected to pick up the best
of what remains of Ferranti's defence electronics businesses.
Indeed GEC could well save money by buing those Ferranti operations it wants
from the receiver instead of footing an Pounds 11.4m acquisition bill and
assuming responsibility of Ferranti's net debts, contingent liabilities and
overdue creditors' payments totalling about Pounds 155m.
The dismantling of Ferranti actually began in 1989 following the discovery
of huge fraud in International Signal and Control, the US subsidiary which
Ferranti acquired in 1987.
The ISC fraud blew a massive hole in Ferranti's balance sheet and forced
Ferranti's management, led by Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman, to embark on a
Pounds 500m asset sale programme to try to keep Ferranti afloat. In the
process its workforce was cut from 22,000 to less than 3,700 and bank debts
were reduced from Pounds 689m in 1989 to about Pounds 100m at the end of
September.
GEC picked the prize fruit of the Ferranti empire after the ISC debacle,
paying Pounds 310m in 1990 for its radar division.
The business included the project leadership for the radar to equip the
European Fighter Aircraft. Last year, GEC-Marconi bought the company's
missile business for Pounds 38m.
In its offer document for Ferranti issued at the start of November, GEC
identified four other areas where a combination of both group's operations
would result in business units 'better placed to win orders for defence
equipment at home and overseas.' These are combat management systems for
surface ships and submarines; air defence command, control and
communications systems; ship and submarine sonars; simulation and training
products.
It is assumed that these are the businesses which GEC might be interested in
acquiring from the receivers. Among these assets Ferranti's sonar operations
were folded into a joint venture with Thomson-CSF, the French defence group,
in 1990 and its investment was valued at Pounds 25.7m in the latest
accounts.
Putting a value on Ferranti's other assets is difficult, particularly since
much of the potential value to a purchaser probably lay in the experience of
its workforce which may now be dissipated.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sorrell sells 40% of WPP holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the heavily-indebted marketing
services group, has sold about 40 per cent of his shares in the company.
A total of 848,917 shares were sold by Mr Sorrell on November 18 at 92 1/2
p, leaving him with 1.3m shares out of WPP's issued equity capital of 434m
shares.
Mr Sorrell is the first director to turn seller of the shares since they
began a robust recovery from their all-time low of 22 1/2 p in October 1992.
He and some fellow board members had been periodic buyers of the shares
during the sharp upturn.
Mr Sorrell bought 100,000 shares at 34 1/2 p in September 1992, while other
directors acquired stock the following month.
Mr Sorrell acquired a further 100,000 shares at 55p this January.
WPP's share price peaked at 105p in mid-September, following the sale by
banks of most of the ordinary shares they received by converting preference
shares in the company.
SG Warburg, the stockbroker, bought 46.9m shares at 93p and placed them at
94p with 60 institutions in the UK, US and Europe.
The shares yesterday closed 3p up at 91p.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Strong second half lifts Bass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong second half performance by Holiday Inn operations in the US and
Asia/Pacific helped Bass, the UK brewing, hotels and leisure group, lift
full year pre-tax profits 7.4 per cent to Pounds 508m.
The results were ahead of market expectations and the shares added 34p to
537p.
Mr Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive, said it appeared unlikely that
trading in the first half of the present financial year would benefit
significantly from the economic environment.
'However, the management actions we have taken will produce improvements
over the year and the business is well placed to gain from any increased
consumer spending in our markets.'
Operating profit for the year to end-September increased marginally to
Pounds 603m on turnover which grew by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 4.45bn.
Holiday Inn profits rose 15.3 per cent to Pounds 128m (Pounds 111m). The
results reflected a substantial turnround after a first half decline. In
North America second half dollar profits were 15.5 per cent higher, with
revenue per available room 3 per cent ahead, and in Asia/Pacific profits
rose 41 per cent.
Overall, a net 89 hotels were added to the system which now comprises 1,774
hotels.
Brewing profits fell 8.2 per cent to Pounds 156m, hit by price competition
and charges of Pounds 18m for reorganisation, increased bad debt provisions,
and the change to end product duty. Net margins fell from 10.9 per cent to
9.8 per cent.
UK beer volumes, however, rose nearly 1 per cent to 8.38m barrels and market
share grew 0.5 per cent to 23 per cent.
Profits from Britvic soft drinks fell to Pounds 35m (Pounds 41m) as
recession, poor summer weather, and price competition reduced sales volume
by 5 per cent.
Pub profits, reflecting a reduction in the estate of about 520 outlets, were
4.2 per cent lower at Pounds 205m. But profit per managed house, driven by
an increasing contribution from food sales, was 5 per cent higher.
Leisure operations raised profits by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 74m with a
strong performance by Barcrest, the amusement machine business, which led
the UK market with a 43 per cent share, and improvements from Coral betting
shops and Gala bingo clubs.
Earnings per share grew 2.8 per cent to 36.3p and a final dividend of 14.35p
lifts the total 4.8 per cent to 19.8p.
COMMENT
Bass has seen a remarkable improvement in the second half and deserves
credit for increasing its share of the beer market with only a limited drop
in margins. But since the market is likely to remain highly competitive
there must be doubt about whether the company can cut costs far enough to
avoid further margin erosion. Hotel profits were actually down by 2 per cent
in dollar terms. While the US hotel business is showing good underlying
growth, the European market is depressed and further progress in the US may
depend on the rate at which new franchises are added. Brokers' profit
estimates for the current year of about Pounds 530m put the shares on a
forward multiple just over 14 times. That would make them expensive without
the support of a historic yield of 4.6 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Water advances 4.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Water said its non-regulated businesses made an small but
encouraging contribution to pre-tax profits, which grew by 4.2 per cent to
Pounds 74.8m in the six months to September 30, against Pounds 71.8m.
The interim dividend is lifted 8 per cent to 7.6p (7.05p). The interim
payment will exceptionally be made on April 6, to take advantage of the
reduction in the rate of advance corporation tax effective from that date.
Turnover rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 259.4m (Pounds 239.5m), in which there
was an overall increase in main charges income from the core business of a
little more than 5 per cent, and an increase of nearly 75 per cent from
non-regulated activities.
The downward trend in industrial and commercial water consumption continued
and this seemed likely to be maintained as more customers sought economies.
Investment in water services totalled Pounds 112m in the first six months,
almost 20 per cent below last year's record level. Investment totalling
Pounds 260m was planned for the full year, which Yorkshire said was
sufficient to maintain progress towards compliance with the company's
quality and environmental obligations.
Non-regulated activities contributed Pounds 2.9m to operating profits of
Pounds 83.8m. A further Pounds 63m was invested in the non-regulated
activities during the period, including the purchasing of a third leasing
company in July for Pounds 51m. The operating profits were evenly split
between leasing, property and environmental activities.
Net debt rose Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 225.9m, giving gearing of 18.3 per
cent, up from 11.2 per cent.
Earnings per share were 36.1p (34.4p).
COMMENT
Yorkshire's shares closed 25p higher at 585p, boosted partly by a rising
market. However, the company helped give the whole sector a lift by talking
again about the scope for reducing manning levels over the next five years,
which will be speeded by a new management structure. The shares are on a
prospective yield of about 5 per cent, which puts them in the middle of the
pack. Yorkshire has done well on the costs front and seems to have chosen
interesting areas for diversification, such as medical incineration.
However, the shares are likely to drift, along with the rest of the sector,
until the regulator gives a clearer indication in July of the pricing regime
which will apply from 1995 onwards.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Stammers set to resign second post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lionel Stammers is expected today to resign as non-executive director of
BBA, the car components group - just 24 hours after stepping down as
non-executive director of BTR, the industrial conglomerate.
Mr Stammers is believed to have decided to quit both posts after concerns
arose about possible future conflicts of interest between the groups.
He wanted to behave in an even-handed manner over any potential conflict of
loyalty.
It appears BTR is still smarting over the departure of one of the industrial
conglomerate's most promising executives, Mr Roberto Quarta, 44, who last
month left to become chief executive of BBA.
Mr Stammers's resignation from BTR yesterday severed a 29-year connection
with the group. BTR said the possibility of future conflicts of interest
with a competitor meant his resignation had been announced 'with regret'.
Mr Norman Ireland, BTR's chairman, stressed he was not suggesting any
impropriety by Mr Stammers, who he accepted had played no part in Mr
Quarta's selection. He had the highest regard for Mr Stammers, a former
joint chief executive of BTR's European region and an executive director
until 1988. Mr Ireland said: 'There's nothing in the air between us - it's
just a situation that arose.'
However, since Mr Stammers joined BBA's board in 1989, the scope for a
conflict of interest is scarcely new.
BTR watchers will be left wondering what role had been planned for Mr
Quarta, the US-born son of an Italian tailor who was seen as a future
candidate to succeed Mr Alan Jackson as chief executive.

Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's private property and trading group
which finalised a Pounds 1.2bn debt restructuring in September, has repaid
Pounds 150m of debt early, writes Maggie Urry. The payment, made by Heron
Corporation, was due on March 31 next year and Pounds 25m of it had been
repaid by September.
The payment was made largely from disposals of properties which have been
sold at values higher than those ascribed to them in the refinancing plan.
Heron cut its debt in the restructuring through a swap of some loans into
equity. The next debt repayment is Pounds 160m March 1995.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dairy Crest ahead to Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board's dairy products division which is due
to float in the new year, recorded a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 17m for the half year to September 30.
Profits were struck after Pounds 2m (Pounds 4.4m) of exceptional
rationalisation costs.
Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said Dairy Crest was 'very much looking
forward to industry deregulation and flotation.'
The flotation is expected to value the group at between Pounds 250m and
Pounds 300m.
Mr Houliston said details of the move were under active discussion.
In the past three years much had been done to prepare the business to be 'a
robust and sustainable' company when it was exposed to a free market in
milk, when the MMB is abolished on April 1, and to being a public company.
Mr Houliston said that although he believed that Milk Marque, the buying
group the MMB has proposed to succeed itself, was the safest way of moving
into the new system, the company's prime consideration was to guarantee its
milk supplies at competitive prices.
In the half year turnover fell from Pounds 575m to Pounds 526m, as the
volume of milk available for manufacture fell by 6 per cent and Dairy Crest
had to absorb price increases of 12.8 per cent for liquid milk.
Turnover from continuing operations rose 1 per cent to Pounds 412m (Pounds
409m). The group sold five bottling dairies which supplied doorstep milk
deliveries, a market currently down by more than 10 per cent.
Operating profits from continuing businesses rose 14 per cent to Pounds
17.7m (Pounds 15.5m).
The consumer foods division increased operating profits by to Pounds 9.2m
(Pounds 6.6m), but the food services side fell from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds
8.5m.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Huntingdon falls to Pounds 8.79m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Severe price competition and weak demand in some areas saw pre-tax profits
at Huntingdon International, the life sciences and engineering services
company, fall from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 8.79m in the year to September 30.
The board remained confident about long term prospects but expected 1994 to
be another difficult year. Earnings growth in the second half of 1993 was
unlikely to continue through the first quarter of 1994.
A maintained final dividend of 1.9p is proposed for an unchanged total of
2.775p. Earnings fell to 7.4p (11.5p).
Sales, net of subcontracting costs, rose to Pounds 156.1m (Pounds 139.8m).
Operating profits were Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 16.7m). Mr Christopher Cliffe,
finance director, said the company had endured 'one of the most difficult
years in its history'.
There was a Pounds 3m exceptional charge for restructuring the US
engineering and environmental business which forced the company to make a
trading statement in March.
However, the company's strongest business, life sciences, had seen growth in
confirmed contracts net of cancellations for the first time in three years.
The division had resisted price pressure, margins had held up and even
improved, Mr Cliff said.
The first full year contribution from Travers Morgan, the
construction-related project management company bought in December 1991, had
been struck during a year of survival in the midst of fierce competition in
its largest UK market.
Net debt rose to Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 39.7m) partly because of the large
amount denominated in dollars. Gearing at the year end was 69.9 per cent
(70.9 per cent).
For the second year in a row the company saw a net cash outflow, of Pounds
2.2m (Pounds 4.6m). In 1992 Huntingdon paid Pounds 11m for Travers Morgan.

Yesterday's sharp decline in GEC's share price, sparked by Lord Prior's
warning of more or less flat earnings for the current year, may have been
overdone. There is no doubt, however, that coupled with the group's
lacklustre results for the first half, the warning prompted an abrupt change
of market sentiment.
Looking further ahead the picture is somewhat brighter, as the group should
begin to reap the benefits of its heavy investment in electronic systems and
power systems, two of its three principal businesses.
Profits in the electronic systems division, for example, were down by Pounds
11m to Pounds 79m but orders, up 2 per cent since March at Pounds 4.9bn,
exceeded sales of Pounds 1.14bn.
Orders were received for avionics systems for Tornado aircraft for Saudi
Arabia, sonar systems for Trident and the laser warner for the Eurofighter.
The decline in profits in electronic systems was caused by heavy development
costs necessary before product sales, according to Lord Weinstock, GEC
managing director. The costs of interactive in-flight entertainment systems,
for example, had risen and provisions had been made. Work on the Eurofighter
was progressing, but longer development cycles provoked higher spending, he
said.
Pre-tax profits in the components - semiconductor chips - area were flat at
Pounds 6m. The company's profitability is tied to volume sales of products
such as computer disk drives for which it makes special circuitry.
Power systems showed a slight rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 77m to
Pounds 79m. The order book, at Pounds 6.6bn, was 8 per cent higher than at
the March 31 year end. The company has been selected by the Korean High
Speed Construction Authority to negotiate the high speed train contract for
the Seoul-Pusan line, valued at Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.61m). It has also
won orders worth more than Pounds 300m for London Underground's Jubilee Line
extension.
Telecommunications, the third of GEC's principal businesses, showed a
significant drop in profits to Pounds 44m (Pounds 61m). Orders received,
however, were up 32 per cent.
Continental Europe, where GEC has about one third of its business, remains
the company's chief problem area, but the trio of businesses in the US,
Gilbarco, Videojet and Picker, turned in record sales and profits.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Argyll to write down its stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retail group Argyll warned yesterday its profits would be reduced by
about Pounds 40m this year by its decision to start depreciating its store
values. The move could knock tens of millions of pounds off other food
retailers' earnings.
Argyll, which owns the Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost chains, also admitted
price competition was putting pressure on its gross profit margin, and had
persuaded it to cut capital spending this year from Pounds 650m to Pounds
550m.
Its announcement came as it reported a 6 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits to Pounds 217.3m. Stripping out Pounds 2.1m property
profits, the figures were at the lower end of expectations, and the shares
slid 23p to 256p.
Argyll's decision to depreciate buildings over 40 years, and review its
depreciation policy on fixtures and fittings, followed growing pressure from
the City.
Fears about sustainability of margins and returns on capital had raised the
question of whether superstore assets should be depreciated over their
useful lives. Analysts had warned that food retailers might otherwise be
forced to make big one-off write-downs.
If Argyll's main competitors decide to follow suit, their larger property
portfolios mean they could suffer from even bigger depreciation charges.
Analysts suggested J Sainsbury's earnings could be reduced by as much as
Pounds 60m or Pounds 70m, and Tesco's by about Pounds 70m, if they adopted
Argyll's policy.
Tesco has hinted privately it may follow Argyll, but Sainsbury has
consistently denied any need to depreciate its superstores.
'It doesn't really matter whether the others follow suit,' said Mr Frank
Davidson, analyst at James Capel. 'All investors now, when looking at the
earnings of Tesco and Sainsbury, will work out what they would have been on
Argyll's devaluation basis.'
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, insisted Argyll could withstand growing price
competition by exploiting its scale, efficiency and the strength of its own
label.
In spite of the price pressure, the operating margin at the main Safeway
chain increased in the first half from 7.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent, and
market share from 5.6 per cent to 5.9 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Ladbroke hit by twin set of doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ladbroke fell 20 1/2 p to 151p yesterday after news that Mr
Michael Hirst, head of the group's Hilton International hotel subsidiary,
had sold more than half his shares and that the company would take advantage
of the new foreign income dividend scheme, hitting pension fund investors.
Ladbroke said last night that 'amicable discussions' had been taking place
with Mr Hirst about his future with the group but that no decision had been
reached.
The group said Mr Peter George, who takes over as group chief executive in
January, had talked to Mr Hirst about bringing in a chief executive to
strengthen the management of Hilton International - Mr Hirst is cur-rently
both chairman and chief executive.
The company announced last Tuesday that Mr Hirst had sold 125,000 shares at
161p each on 26 November. This leaves him with 115,067 shares. He was
unavailable for comment.
Ladbroke said yesterday that it would take advantage of the introduction of
foreign income dividend (FID) legislation when paying its final 1993
dividend in July 1994.
A switch to paying FIDs will mean a significant loss in income to pension
funds as FIDs do not carry the 20 per cent tax credit of normal dividends
and which tax-exempt investors can reclaim.
The FID scheme is an attempt to help companies that pay surplus advance
corporation tax (ACT) because of a high proportion of profits from overseas.
Ladbroke said it had surplus ACT of Pounds 30m.
Some analysts were angry that the FID announcement appeared to be
circulating during yesterday afternoon, although it was only announced
through the Stock Exchange after the market had closed.
Ladbroke said it had made the announcement to some journalists at about 2pm
because it did not believe it was price sensitive. It had asked the exchange
to make the announcement on the advice of its brokers, Smith New Court and
Warburg Securities. The group said the exchange had also said it did not
believe the statement was price sensitive but Ladbroke had asked for a
formal announcement to be made anyway.

FT  02 DEC 93 / New threat to Volvo merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo's ambitious plans to merge with France's Renault were under renewed
threat last night after the Swedish group's third-largest shareholder joined
a growing chorus of opposition.
The call by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken Funds, which controls 5.7 per cent
of Volvo's voting capital, for the merger to be postponed brought to seven
the number of Swedish institutional shareholders that will not support the
deal at a shareholders' meeting on Tuesday.
Volvo's share price rose steeply yesterday on speculation that the merger
would fail. The most-traded B share closed at SKr444, up SKr30.
With only two Swedish institutions independent of Volvo pledged in favour of
the merger, opponents called on Volvo not to proceed. Volvo declined
official comment, but a senior executive said: 'We are of course taking the
situation very seriously.'
Votes committed against the merger still trail those in favour by a margin
of between 10 and 6 per cent of the votes. But the Yes camp includes
Renault's 10 per cent holding and the opposition now holds a clear lead
among the independent institutions. Volvo has said it is reluctant to push
through the deal on a narrow majority.
Renault said that while yesterday's developments were obviously unwelcome it
had no new plans before the shareholder vote. A French government official
adopted a similar stance, adding that the French side had done all that it
could to reassure Swedish investors.
Yesterday doubt was also cast on the decision of one of the supporting
institutions. The board of the Fourth Fund state pension fund, the biggest
Volvo shareholder after Renault, is set to reconsider its narrow 8-6 vote in
favour of the merger at a meeting tomorrow. Today attention will focus on a
decision expected from the SPP insurance company which holds 4.5 per cent of
the Volvo votes.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive of the insurance company Skandia, another
large shareholder opposed to the merger, said in a newspaper interview
yesterday that Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, should resign.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Don't you just love being in control: Richard Giordano's
move to British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Giordano's decision to become chairman of British Gas on January
1 suggests that the 59-year-old American, who was at one time Britain's most
highly paid executive, is not about to have his career placed on the back
burner.
His appointment to succeed Mr Robert Evans, the present chairman, will be as
a non-executive. But British Gas have made it clear that the position will
be his 'main job'. It carries with it a salary of Pounds 450,000, compared
with the Pounds 380,000 paid to Mr Evans, but there will be no bonus or
share options.
Mr Giordano said yesterday that he wanted British Gas to 'focus on adding
value for the 2m loyal shareholders and institutions' - a sentiment welcomed
in the City, where analysts know him well as the former chairman and chief
executive of BOC, the industrial gases group. One observer said the
appointment marked British Gas's evolution, with 'senior management becoming
more worldly'.
Few expressed fears that his non-executive status would mean a limited
commitment to the job. Most said that, based on past performance, it would
be out of character for Mr Giordano to take a back seat.
The former lawyer joined BOC in the late 1970s when it took over the US
company Airco, of which he was president. He remains on BOC's board and
other non-executive directorships include RTZ, Lucas, Reuters and Grand
Metropolitan, where he will remain deputy chairman - the other posts are up
for review.
The presence of a strong commercial figure at the top of British Gas should
help to remove analysts' concerns that the senior management and board of
directors is top heavy with insiders. Such a situation, they say, sat
uncomfortably with British Gas's strategy of diversifying away from its
heavily regulated business in the UK into competitive international markets.
With Mr Giordano's appointment, two of the top three positions will be
occupied by executives with outside experience. Mr Cedric Brown, chief
executive, has worked his way through the British Gas hierarchy. But Mr
Philip Rogerson, finance director, joined British Gas from ICI last year.
The task which faces the trio is not altogether clear, however, aside from
the obvious fact noted by Mr Giordano that the company is 'entering a period
of great change'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is
expected to decide shortly on whether to implement a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission recommendation that British Gas be broken up into separate
trading and pipeline companies. He must also decide whether to end its
monopoly in the residential market.
Given that the government decision could be handed down as early as this
month Mr Giordano's task will be not so much to influence the government's
thinking on the industry as to make commercial sense of whatever official
policy emerges.
Aside from adding an international gloss to British Gas, Mr Giordano will
bring to bear specific skills and experience gained at BOC. Analysts point
to similarities between BOC's market position in the 1980s and British Gas's
current predicament. Both enjoyed a near monopoly position in a
quasi-commodity domestic business. And both have chosen a strategy of
international diversification with an emphasis on adding value.
An area in which Mr Giordano is likely to make an early impact is British
Gas's expansion into undeveloped international markets. BOC had strong links
with Asia, an area which British Gas has also targeted, both for its
exploration and production possibilities as as well as for opportunities to
provide gas for power generation schemes and industrial use.
Mr Giordano is also likely to have a substantial effect on a corporate
culture which critics say is still steeped in the company's public sector
roots. Many of Mr Giordano's boardroom colleagues are the product of a
regional power structure which some analysts say has given rise to
quasi-autonomous empires. 'There could be a lot of friction between him and
what is still in some ways a sleepy and bureaucratic company,' said one.
The pace at which power becomes concentrated at British Gas's Thameside
headquarters in London may be one of the best ways of assessing Mr
Giordano's progress, according to one industry expert.
Company officials stress, however, that internal opinion, from Mr Brown
downwards, is solidly behind the choice of Mr Giordano. 'It's good to have a
real heavyweight who wants to make the company more profitable,' said one
official.
His appointment has reduced some of the uncertainty surrounding the
business, but whatever the value added by Mr Giordano, it is still the UK
government which is firmly in control of British Gas's destiny.

FT  02 DEC 93 / GEC shares fall on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in The General Electric Company fell 13p to 320p yesterday - in a
market that hit a new closing peak - after a warning by the chairman Lord
Prior that profits this year would show little improvement over 1992.
GEC's shares were marked down despite interim profits and dividends which
advanced in line with City expectations. It marked the cooling of market
sentiment towards the electronics giant, regarded as an unexciting but
reliable performer.
The City had anticipated group profits would be weighted towards the second
half and was expecting about Pounds 935m in pre-tax profits for the full 12
months. Analysts yesterday cut full-year forecasts to no more than Pounds
900m.
Interim profits fell in nearly every business area, and the cables division
incurred a trading loss as a result of weak demand and cheap imports.
Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director, said the company was in continuing
discussions with British Aerospace, which were expected to lead to the
announcement of at least two joint ventures in the near future. Talks which
could have led to a merger of the two groups' defence interests were called
off earlier this year.
Pre-tax profits at the halfway mark were slightly up at Pounds 360m,
compared with Pounds 356m, while turnover advanced 3 per cent to Pounds
4.39bn, against Pounds 4.26bn. Earnings per share inched up from 8p to 8.2p.
A dividend of 2.81p will be paid, 4.85 per cent ahead of the year before.
The group's order book improved to Pounds 13bn, from Pounds 11.9bn a year
earlier, while total net cash stood at Pounds 2.43bn, against Pounds 1.8bn.
Lord Prior, chairman, said most of the businesses had performed
satisfactorily in poor trading conditions, adding: 'While profits will, as
expected, be weighted towards the second half of the current year, the
directors consider in the light of the current trading conditions that they
are unlikely to be substantially higher than for last year.' In the year to
March 1993, the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 863m on revenues of
Pounds 5.6m.
The group's pessimism is based on recession in mainland Europe; trading in
Germany and Belgium had been particular poor, Lord Weinstock said, with
France only marginally better. The company spent Pounds 499m on research and
development in the first half.

The European Union, which at its last five summits has acknowledged its
failure to bring Euro-doings 'closer to the citizen', is being offered the
chance to plug another communications gap - by setting up an EU observatory
to watch for unidentified flying objects.
The proposal comes from the energy, research and technology committee of the
European Parliament, which wants to turn France's Sepra space study unit in
Toulouse into a fully fledged Euro-institution.
The Italian nuclear physicist Mr Tullio Regge, who is responsible for
producing the committee report, is understood not to believe in the
'metaphysics' of UFOs. The committee, however, notes that Sepra has reported
2,300 cases of UFO sightings in the past 15 years. Some were hoaxes, some
could be explained rationally, but more than two-fifths could not easily be
explained.
A Belgian institution called Sobeps has logged 1,500 sightings based on
reports to the gendarmerie, while the Italian air force reported 32
sightings last year.
Some EU officials wonder whether Europe's putative ability to communicate
with extra-terrestrials would compensate for its inability to reach its own
citizens.
Were the plan really to take wing, it might further complicate Europe's
integration process. The eventual prospect of intergalactic integration, for
instance, might severely tangle controversial Euro-issues such as
subsidiarity - whether measures are most effectively taken at local,
regional, national, pan-European, international, and now, interstellar
level.
On enlargement, more parochial officials among the existing 12 member states
are already chary about taking into the Union four new Nordic and alpine
countries from the European Free Trade Association, referring to them as
'Eftans'.
It may be argued that it is premature to expect such member states to adjust
to the idea of linking up with Martians so soon after Eftans.
But the European Parliament committee insists that Europe should stop
looking inwards and raise its gaze to new potential neighbours. 'The
possibility that aliens have established a base in the asteroid belt cannot
be ruled out,' it says.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Government admits to errors in documents on IRA contacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government admitted last night that mistakes were contained in
secret documents released on Monday detailing exchanges with Provisional IRA
leaders.
The admission followed confirmation that Mr John Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds will tomorrow make a concerted attempt to bridge differences
between London and Dublin over a constitutional settlement for the province.
The meeting will come amid signs of mounting strain in relations.
Conceding the errors last night, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, emphasised they were the result of transcription and typing
errors and did not alter the sense of the messages.
In particular, he said the corrections cast 'no doubt whatsoever' on the
authenticity of the original message received from the IRA leadership in
February saying the conflict was over. Republican leaders deny such a
message was sent.
However, the effect of 11 corrections to a document in which the government
set out its conditions for beginning talks with Provisional leaders - a
version of which was released by the government and Sinn Fein this week - is
that the Sinn Fein account is now accepted as essentially correct.
The admission, which may further tarnish the government's credibility over
Northern Ireland, comes less than a week after it admitted it had been in
prolonged contact with the IRA, despite previous denials. Unionist MPs are
expected to be pounced on the government's admission in the Commons today.
The IRA last night made the claim, denied by Downing Street, that the
government had proposed secret talks in March in Scotland or Scandinavia.
It said: 'We wish to confirm that . . . the British government made a
definitive proposal for full-blown delegate meetings between their
representatives and Sinn Fein.' It claimed the government asked for an
unannounced suspension of activity to help accommodate the meetings.
Last night both London and Dublin were playing down expectations of what the
'working' summit between the two prime ministers would achieve.
At least one additional meeting between the two leaders - at next week's
European Council in Brussels - might well be needed before a joint
communique could be agreed. The two prime ministers will be accompanied
tomorrow by senior ministers.
The main sticking point is understood to concern Dublin's insistence on
including acceptance of the principle of self-determination for the people
of all of Ireland in a joint communique.
According to officials in Dublin this would imply an all-Ireland referendum
on any changes to Northern Ireland's constitutional status, although these
would also need majority consent in Ulster. London is understood to be
worried that Unionists would find a formulation involving an all-Ireland
referendum unacceptable.
At Westminster the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee
moved a step closer after a group of MPs published recommendations on which
parties should be represented.

Those Ferranti shareholders who thought Mr Eugene Anderson was bluffing now
know differently. The company's chief executive warned that Ferranti would
go down if GEC's bid failed. Now GEC has pulled out, presumably because the
due diligence process found something nasty in the woodshed. GEC investors
who thought the bid more than reflected Ferranti's value may well be
relieved. Lord Weinstock can now pick up interesting pieces at a one-man
auction. And potential defence entrepreneurs might ponder Ferranti's folly
of paying good money for hush-hush businesses when asking hard questions is
considered bad manners.

FT  02 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Things are not looking good at Ladbroke. While City attention was focused on
Tuesday's budget speech, the company announced that a senior director had
sold just over half his stake. Then yesterday it dribbled into the market
the news that, while others are still cautiously awaiting the small print,
it is leaping at the chance to pay a foreign income dividend. Only after the
market had closed and its shares had already fallen 12 per cent did it issue
a formal statement through the Stock Exchange. Ladbroke's assessment that
the announcement was not price sensitive looks curious when the foreign
income dividend will reduce the return to institutions who will be unable to
claim a tax credit.
The main market worry is that the company appears to be scrabbling around
for ways of maintaining an unsustainable dividend instead of working to
reduce its Pounds 1.5bn borrowings and repair its balance sheet. There may
well be an innocent explanation for the share sale by Mr Michael Hirst, a
respected hotelier who runs Ladbroke's Hilton division. But the market is
nervous after the Queens Moat debacle. Perhaps yesterday's violent reaction
will convince Ladbroke that it does not pay to be so coy.

FT  02 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Argyll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll's decision to depreciate its freehold assets and scale back its store
opening programme helps clarify some of the uncertainties bedevilling the
food retailing sector. Some other grocers are likely to follow Argyll's
lead, ensuring their stated earnings will stall - or even fall - over the
following few years. The market had implicitly assumed as much and
confirmation could even come as a relief. Attention may now switch to other
valuation criteria, which suggest food retailers possess more value than
reflected in their stock market worth. It certainly appears anomalous that
Argyll yields 5.5 per cent while it boasts such generous dividend cover.
Argyll has not yet accepted the logical conclusion that it should cut its
opening programme still further and return more cash to shareholders. Such a
volte face would perhaps be too great coming just a year after it committed
itself to accelerating capital spending. Were it any smaller, that might
make Argyll vulnerable to a bid. A predator would certainly have the
financial leeway to make brutal asset write-downs and halt capital spending,
releasing a torrent of cash flow. Retailing rivals would find it hard to
justify opening more superstores in such circumstances, restoring price
equilibrium to the market.

FT  02 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: GEC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning is hardly the ideal end to the good run which GEC's shares
have enjoyed over the past year. Some of the mix of reasons offered are
perhaps understandable - particularly poor conditions in the cables market
and difficulties with customised chips. Others, such as cost overruns on
development projects, are hardly the kind of problem normally associated
with Lord Weinstock.
Still, in the longer term there are grounds for optimism. With projects like
the European Fighter Aircraft in development, defence margins are being
squeezed now but may recover, despite shorter production runs and potential
postponements. In power systems, technology may also allow contracts to be
won at higher margins than in the past, particularly with strong worldwide
demand for gas turbines and fast trains.
The UK government's oft-repeated assertion that it wants private help with
infrastructure projects may also finally start to move now that Sir Alastair
Morton is starting to shove. Since GEC seems keen to use part of its cash,
projects like the Channel tunnel rail link might well be attractive. Forming
a structure which would encourage the company to fund the refurbishment of
the West Coast main line might be harder, even if an order for GEC Alsthom
trains were to follow. Meanwhile, steering the company through the world
recession towards such prospects is a task equal to the management's
traditional talents.

It is strange that a Budget lauded for being tougher than expected should
drive UK equities into such a frenzy. Worries about an attack on their tax
privileges have kept pension funds on the sidelines, but it is difficult to
believe that their return was responsible for yesterday's 2 per cent rise in
the FT-SE 100 index. Investors caught short of stock going into the Budget
are more likely culprits, in which case equities might now settle back.
Relief that budgetary balance is being pursued through lower spending rather
than higher taxes is certainly not a cause for celebration on the scale seen
yesterday. Either way the impact will be deflationary. With the public
sector constrained and tax rises slowly squeezing consumers, the corporate
sector will have to perform exceptionally well for the chancellor's growth
targets to be met. There is always scope for another cut in interest rates,
but results from GEC and Argyll are reminders that companies are hardly
brimming with confidence.
The upward march of gilts looks more convincing. The position of gilts
relative to overseas markets limits the scope for progress ahead of next
week's Pounds 3bn auction. The yield differential between 10-year gilts and
German bunds is already close to its recent limit. If the chancellor can
maintain his new-found credibility, though, international investors will
come to accept a smaller premium. Lower gilt yields could then provide some
support for equities, too.

The British government's credibility on Northern Ireland was severely
tarnished last night when it admitted that mistakes were contained in secret
documents released on Monday detailing exchanges with Provisional leaders.
The admission followed confirmation that Mr John Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds will tomorrow make a concerted attempt to bridge differences
between London and Dublin over a constitutional settlement for the province.
The meeting will come amid signs of mounting strain in their relations.
The Northern Ireland Office was last night at pains to emphasise that
mistakes in the documents were accidental and the result of transcriptional
typing.
The admission, which is expected to be pounced on by Unionist MPs in the
Commons today, followed threats by Sinn Fein to 'set the record straight'
amid claims that some of the British documents were bogus.
Separately, the IRA last night made the sensational claim, strongly denied
by Downing Street, that the government had proposed holding secret talks
with it in March in Scotland or Scandinavia.
It said: 'We wish to confirm that . . . the British Government made a
definitive proposal for full-blown delegate meetings between their
representatives and Sinn Fein.'
It claimed the government asked for an unannounced suspension of activity to
help accommodate the meetings.
Both London and Dublin were last night playing down expectations of what the
'working' summit between the two prime ministers was likely to achieve,
billing it as the first of two or three important sessions that could take
place before Christmas.
At least one additional meeting between the two leaders - at next week's

would also need the consent of the majority in the province. London is
understood to be worried that a formulation involving an all-Ireland
referendum would be unacceptable to Unionists.
Downing Street hinted last night that it regarded Ulster Unionist acceptance
of the content of any joint communique as crucial, saying: 'It is getting
words that can command support throughout Northern Ireland - that's a key
factor.'

Those who set deadlines at Barclays have often come to regret it. Remember
the slogan of Sir John Quinton's era - 'Number One by '91'?
The ensuing burst of poor lending led to huge bad loan provisions, Sir
John's departure as chairman, and the management ructions that have since
dogged the bank.
Now we have a fresh date. Martin Taylor, the youthful new chief executive,
says in an interview with Banking World that he has given himself two years
after he starts full time in January to make an impact. 'If at the end of
two years - and two years is a deliberate timeframe - the business has no
direction, then that will be my fault,' he says.
Things will be fixed by '96?

FT  02 DEC 93 / Observer: Battering Ramsden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are those who think that Harry Ramsden's is the Coca-Cola of the world
fish and chip industry because its success is based on a secret recipe for
its batter - unchanged since Harry opened his first chippie in Leeds in
1928.
Hence there might be some concern about the news that Ramsden's - which
sells over 2,300 tons of chips and 940 tons of haddock in its eight shops -
is putting its name to a new type of batter developed for one of United
Biscuits' frozen food businesses.
However, John Barnes, Harry Ramsden's chairman, reassures Observer that his
secret is safe. But if he's doing so well, why get into bed with a potential
rival?
'Two million packets of frozen fish sold in supermarkets every year with our
name on them, that's why,' says Barnes, who sounds like a Yorkshireman -
even if he doesn't speak like one.

Rarely does Britain's Department of Trade and Industry show imagination. But

which recently notched up the second biggest loss in UK corporate history -
a bright spark has been at work.
For the DTI has selected Patrick Phillips QC as one of its inspectors on the
case - and Phillips knows about moat houses. Each summer he organises a
historical recreation of Tudor domestic life at his restored stately home,
Kentwell Hall, complete with moat and 200 suitably dressed Elizabethans.
Queens Moat executives may have cause to fear that Phillips' love of the
16th century encompasses another favourite Tudor practice: head-chopping.

It's a good job you can't judge a book by its cover. Otherwise the
rushed-out analyses of the UK Budget from James Capel, Credit Lyonnais Laing
and UBS economic research units should by rights have been binned
immediately.
The UBS cover shows a tattered Ken Clarke trumpeting 'Hey Big Spender' -
hardly appropriate given the nature of the measures he announced. James
Capel's glossy goes in for a Christmas feel, with Ken as Mr Scrooge being
handed - inappropriately enough - a piece of paper with VAT on it.
But at least they escaped the wild fantasy dreamed up by the team at Credit
Lyonnais; that shows Ken as Freddy Kruger, the cinematic monster who has
knives in place of fingers, with the caption 'Nightmare on Downing Street'.
Given City and public reaction to the Budget, far from presenting John Major
with a nightmare, Ken seems to have offered him the chance of his first full
night's sleep in ages.

What an absurd British institution Budget day is. The real Budget is not the
chancellor's speech - which is a political showcase - but the Financial
Statement and Budget Report, popularly known as 'the Red Book'. This is now
143 pages. Yet it is issued only just before 5pm when the chancellor sits
down in the House of Commons. And to tell a secret, the first editions of
most newspapers have to be ready two or three hours later.
Thus it all turns into a great obstacle race; and a magnificent job is done
in the circumstances. Editors congratulate their staffs; and the Treasury
has even been known to congratulate editors. It is no doubt very British to
turn a heavyweight political and financial occasion into a sporting contest.
But how absurd and how unnecessary.
A seriously unified Budget would be in two parts. The first would contain
the main tax and spending decisions. The second, a couple of days later,
would contain the detailed expenditure decisions and, if necessary, the more
technical changes emanating from the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise.
Both would be issued at 9am. And if courtesy to the Commons meant that the
latter body met in the morning, it would do MPs no harm.
As usual I went to the House - not to witness a parliamentary occasion but
because it gave me the chance of picking up my copy of the Red Book a few
minutes earlier. What struck me from the question time exchanges before the
Budget was how little debate there really is.
The Labour leader, John Smith, asked the prime minister why Britain's budget
deficit was worse than that of Japan, the US, Germany and seven other
countries. John Major made no attempt to answer, but reeled out different
facts about exports, unemployment and growth. The opposition leader in turn
ignored these and denounced 'mismanagement' of the deficit. The prime
minister then rather easily responded by asking what Labour would cut. No
one answered anyone else; nor was expected to. Ministers and their shadows
are judged by how snappily they reel off prepared briefs, irespective of the
question asked. A European federal assembly could not be worse.
* * *
The best summary of the political economy of the Budget comes from the
accompanying chart. What would the proverbial Rip Van Winkle, awakened from
the late 1920s, make of it? He would, first, have to be told that the gap
between government expenditure and tax revenue does not all represent the
budget deficit, but that some of it represents nationalised industry
profits, oil revenues and other receipts.
Having swallowed this much, Mr Van Winkle might assume that a Labour
government had come into office around 1979-80, determined to lever the tax
burden upwards. He would see a temporary recession-induced fall-off in that
burden in the early 1990s, which the government was correcting as soon as it
could. Seeing, however, that public spending was also under gradual downward
pressure, he would come to an additional conclusion. This was that Philip
Snowden - the highly orthodox Labour chancellor whose budget-balancing
economies at the onset of the Depression brought down the 1929-31 Labour
government - was, after all, still in office.
* * *
Further study of the Red Book confirms one's initial impression. Take
together Norman Lamont's 1993 Budget, which covered taxation only, and
Kenneth Clarke's November Budget. Then compare 1993-94 with 1996-97. We see
a planned fiscal tightening of Pounds 20bn per annum, or 3 per cent of GDP.
Of this, Mr Lamont's Budget contributed Pounds 9 1/2 bn. Of Mr Clarke's
additional Pounds 10 1/2 bn some Pounds 6bn comes from higher taxes and
Pounds 4 1/2 bn from reductions in earlier spending plans.
The spending side is tricky to assess. Nearly half comes from lower
government debt interest and cyclical social security, which reflects lower
inflation and the modest economic recovery so far rather than heroic tussles
with the spending departments. Most of the rest is accounted for by a lower
reserve for contingencies. This is normal enough. But the bottom line
consists not of cuts but of determination to make existing spending
guidelines - including the freeze on departmental wage bills - effective.
* * *
What of the principles of economic policy? There were none in the Budget
speech; and I do not entirely blame Mr Clarke for avoiding doctrinal
hostages to fortune. But there are none so theory-bound as those who think
they are pragmatic; and it is a commentator's duty to look at the criteria
for policy.
Three main planks can be discerned. There is short-term economic forecasting
 -which becomes more important every time a chancellor tries to talk it
down. Second, there is the budget-balancing view of fiscal policy and,
third, a naively monetarist attitude to interest rates and inflation.
The economic forecasts are still based on adding up obvious components of
demand - all put into volume terms with inflation taken out. The
relationships are based on what might be called anti-Victorian values. If
people try to be more thrifty and save more, then output and employment are
reduced. Lady Thatcher would have had a fit if she had realised how the
forecasts were drawn up.
It would be hypocrisy for me to disagree with the underlying logic - except
for the treatment of inflation, which is not now central. My objection is to
the substitution of crystal ball gazing for thought. The panel of
independent forecasters (not, not the 'wise men') has turned out to be a
giant step backwards. The Treasury uses the panel quite explicitly in the
Red Book to show that its own predictions are near to, but slightly more
pessimistic than, the average of the independents on both output and
inflation.
None of this is much use, however. For when the forecasters have made the
most harmful errors, they have usually erred together; and if the Treasury
simply wants to show how near to the consensus it is, why bother to have an
in-house team at all?
The policy doctrine in force is, however, the opposite of what might be
inferred from the forecasting methods. Something very like the old Treasury
view, which Churchill - to his later regret - advocated in the 1920s,
prevails. This is that the object of fiscal policy is to balance the budget
and that the government cannot or should not stimulate demand and output by
spending more or taxing less. Indeed, Mr Clarke has frequently said the
upturn is not as vigorous as he would like, and then spoken in the next
breath of the need to put the public finances in order - which means cutting
both public and private spending. There is nothing peculiarly British in
this combination of under-consumptionist forecasting and fiscal puritanism.
It is a notable feature of IMF reports.
The Treasury now publishes variants, showing that with even slightly slower
growth than envisaged, public sector borrowing would be much higher. But of
the policy implications - whether to tighten for fiscal reasons or lessen to
stimulate the economy - we are not told a single thing.
Finally, there is the view that the Bank of England has a special hot line
to inflation which it can fix by shifting interest rates without any
intermediate effect on economic activity. I used to shudder at this view, as
a caricature of monetarism, which discredited what was valuable in that
doctrine. But this caricature is very close to the words of the Budget
speech.
A similar black magic view is held by many of those now advocating an
independent Bank of England as a panacea - as if the Bank could directly
eliminate inflation without affecting the rest of the economy. A better
reason for Bank independence is to make that institution accountable, which
it is not at present.
As Adam Smith said, there is a lot of ruin in a nation. Whatever the
headline doctrine, the Bank of England tries to manage nominal demand and
does not just drive for zero inflation at all costs. There are also more
self-correcting mechanisms in the world and British economies than
forecasters envisage. Moreover, there are political inhibitions on fiscal
rectitude.
But I still worry that if there were a Great Depression - or even a
prolonged stagnation - neither the Treasury model, nor the forecasting panel
would expect it; and that the policy response would be between inadequate
and perverse.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Public sector pay freeze
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday's Budget has set tough targets for UK public spending over the rest
of the decade. More than Pounds 15bn has been lopped off general government
expenditure for the next three years. The cumulative increase in spending
between 1993-94 and 1998-99 will be held to less than 4 per cent, compared
with a rise of almost 13 per cent in the six years from 1980-81. Mr Clarke
and Mr Major are thus more ambitious in expenditure plans than Mrs Thatcher
and her chancellors ever dared to be.
In pursuing these targets, an important role will be played by a clampdown
on public sector pay. For government departments, running costs will be held
at this year's level of Pounds 20bn for the next three years. Provision for
pay throughout the rest of the public sector has been set on a comparable
basis. Providing it can be made to stick, this freeze is likely to make the
largest contribution to the Pounds 5.7bn cut in public spending forecast for
1994-95.
The approach is at the centre of the continuing attack on waste and
inefficiency in the public services, according to Mr Michael Portillo, the
chief secretary. He believes that efficiency savings of 2 to 3 per cent a
year can be found throughout the public sector. Some of this can be used to
increase the pay of employees, though part must be ploughed back into the
service itself.
Catch-up exercises
This is a blunt weapon for improving the efficiency of public services. Yet
it may be the only one left in the government's armoury. White-collar civil
service numbers have changed little over the past 10 years. The number of
local government employees is almost identical to that of 1979. And most
health service managers have made little use of their greater freedom to
reduce staff costs. Similar organisations in the private sector have made
great improvements in efficiency in recent years, often driven by cuts in
staff costs imposed during difficult times. The same approach is needed in
the public sector.
However, the experience of pay policies which apply only to the public
sector suggests that some consequences may be less benign. If efficiency
savings are not found quickly enough, pay in the public sector tends to lag
behind the private sector, making it harder to attract good people into the
public services and undermining standards. These pressures have then
invariably led to expensive catch-up exercises to restore comparability,
just at the point that private sector settlements are tailing off and so
putting extra pressure on companies to match the high headline pay increases
awarded to the public sector.
Sensible decisions
This time it may be different. The framework for greater decentralisation of
public sector pay determination is now largely in place. Some local
authorities and health organisations have used their greater freedom to be
flexible on pay and staffing. From next April, some government departments
and the larger agencies will have responsibility for the pay of their staff.
And the government appears to accept that extra money may have to be made
available for groups such as the police, teachers and nurses, where
efficiency savings are unlikely.
The introduction of accruals-based resource accounting for government
departments will also give civil service managers the tools they lack to
make sensible decisions about costs, resources and priorities. So too will
the Treasury's relaxation of the annuality rules, which discourage managers
from making savings by clawing back the money. But it must be asked whether
public sector management systems are sufficiently well-developed or robust
enough to meet the challenge they have been set. Enormous efficiency savings
will be needed to compensate for a real fall in the pay bill of as much as
10 per cent over the next three years.
The cash-limiting of running costs is an excellent discipline in reining in
public service costs. But earnings in general rise faster than prices over
the medium term, even in periods ministers describe as 'inflation-free'.
Holding the increase in cash limits so far below the rate of inflation risks
an explosion, perhaps in 1995-96, with a general election in prospect.
Ministers have set the right course, but they will need to tack a little if
they are to reach it.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Russian democracy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On October 4, when forces loyal to President Boris Yeltsin were still
battering the remains of the Russian parliament into submission, western
governments were quick to express their support for him. They were right to
do so, because Mr Yeltsin was clearly preferable to his opponents.
Parliament had degenerated into a rabble, taking its lead from an alliance
of communists and fascists. Mr Yeltsin at least offered some hope of
coherent government. He also promised to make the people the final arbiters
of the conflict.
This latter point was stressed in a solemn declaration issued by European
leaders four days later: 'We attach the utmost importance to the earliest
possible holding of free and fair elections which will give the Russian
people the possibility to express themselves clearly on their future and
create conditions for the adoption of the required new constitution.'
In the event Mr Yeltsin telescoped that process. He has called on the
Russian people, in 10 days' time, both to elect a parliament and to adopt a
constitution under which that parliament would serve. This involves a
contradiction. Some opposition parties are campaigning not only against Mr
Yeltsin's government but also against the draft constitution, which -
modelled on that of the fifth French republic - gives the president very
extensive powers. Were they to succeed in defeating the constitution,
theoretically they would also invalidate their own election.
Official warning
Last week Mr Yeltsin seized on that contradiction (which is actually of his
own making) to threaten his opponents with loss of their free air time for
party political broadcasts if they continued to use it to attack the
constitution, rather than explain their own programmes. This week Mr
Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister and chairman of the
commission organising the referendum, went further, demanding on the same
grounds that two leading opposition parties be disqualified outright and two
centre ones be given an official warning.
Evidently Mr Yeltsin and some of his aides are worried that the constitution
may be defeated, or (more likely) that the 50 per cent minimum turnout may
not be reached. They should realise that the best way to ensure a good
turnout is to have a lively debate, and that their attempts to interfere in
the electoral process can be counterproductive. At least the main
pro-government party, 'Russia's Choice', realises this: its leaders hastened
to explain, rather quaintly, that Mr Shumeiko had spoken 'only' in his
official capacity, and not as a candidate of their party.
Misplaced scepticism
Mr Yeltsin and his advisers should also realise that their outbursts are
prominently reported in the west, and contribute to a widespread western
scepticism about the depth of their commitment to democracy and the 'free
and fair' quality of the current electoral process. That is unfortunate
because the scepticism, especially on the latter point, is largely
misplaced. What is surprising about the election campaign, given all the
circumstances, is its freedom and vigour. In a perverse way Mr Yeltsin and
Mr Shumeiko have provided new evidence of this: opposition parties have
ignored their warnings, and Mr Shumeiko's call for their banning has been
summarily rejected by the electoral commission.
Party political broadcasts have also been used for scathing attacks on the
government, some of which would fall foul of libel laws, or indeed of
anti-racist legislation, in many western countries. Opposition newspapers,
most of which have been allowed to reappear after the brief clampdown
imposed in October, are similarly outspoken. Only the most overtly racist,
such as Dyen, remain banned. It is true that Russia's Choice is better
financed than its competitors. But in which western democracy could that not
be said of a strongly pro-business party?
Perfect formal democracy is a rare bird, very unlikely to be sighted in a
country as large and hard to govern as Russia, which has no democratic
tradition and is trying to come to terms simultaneously with the dissolution
of its empire and the collapse of its economic system. All things
considered, the process we are now witnessing is a much closer approximation
to it than anyone had a right to expect.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Fatal attraction to wrong decisions: A lack of luck and
judgment at Ferranti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferranti's final collapse into receivership yesterday raises some
depressingly familiar questions. The company's history is one of
technological triumph dragged down by commercial incompetence. Not all the
blame lies with management. In the past 20 years the UK government's
handling of Ferranti has veered between lame-duck subvention and dogmatic
faith in competition, with little space for market solutions in between.
There is a kind of melancholy duty about recalling Ferranti's record in the
field of innovation. In the early 1960s it developed the Atlas computer,
which challenged the largest machines available from IBM. In the same
decade, it was one of the pioneers in numerical controls for machine tools.
In the 1970s it developed the first European microprocessor, and in the
early 1980s took a world lead in so-called ASIC (application-specific
integrated circuit) chips, sold to Black &amp; Decker for drills, Sinclair for
computers and Leica for cameras.
All of this came to nothing. The computer business was sold to the British
computer maker ICL, now part of Fujitsu of Japan. The technology for
numerically controlled machine tools now rests in the hands of Japanese,
American and German manufacturers. ASIC chips were eventually abandoned, on
the grounds that the required investment was too big and the likely return
too small.
The obvious question is what Ferranti could or should have done instead. It
is hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for any company which loses its
nerve after a series of strategic reverses. Indeed, to be risk-averse in
those circumstances may be no more than sober realism. But one conclusion
stands out. If a company cannot afford the going rate of investment in its
industry, or no longer has the stomach to bet the ranch on a new technology,
it is in the interests of employees, shareholders and industrial efficiency
that it should resign its independence while the going is good.
Ferranti did the reverse. Its catastrophic acquisition of International
Signal and Control in 1987 was the hammer-blow from which the company never
recovered. It may seem unfair to generalise on the basis of ISC, a company
so bizarrely fraudulent as to deserve a place in the commercial history of
the 20th century. Even at the time, though, it was apparent that Ferranti
was taking a risk of a different kind. Determined to retain its
independence, it took on a company of such notorious secrecy and opacity
that no sane competitor would risk a hostile bid for the combined entity.
The essential point is that while ISC finished Ferranti off, the original
business was sliding downhill on its own account. Even as the fraud unfolded
in the late 1980s, Ferranti itself was periodically in loss. Its
technological ambitions were pathetically diminished. Amid the world
revolution in telecommunications, Ferranti's answer was to invest small sums
in low-cost telepoint technology, which in the UK has already proved a dead
loss.
Long before the ISC debacle, Ferranti had taken another fatal strategic
decision. If the risks and rewards did not stack up in the world of
commercial competition, the answer was to seek safe haven in the cost-plus,
nationalistic world of defence. This left the company open to the risk that
defence spending would turn down, as happened after the collapse of the old
Soviet Union. It also exposed it to another serious risk: that fashions and
ideology would change in British industrial policy.
Having been bailed out with taxpayers' money in 1975, Ferranti thus found
itself 10 years later at the mercy of a new ideology which said that if
Britain was to depend on domestic suppliers of defence equipment, it would
at least guarantee competition between those suppliers. It was in vain for
Lord Weinstock of GEC to point out to the Ministry of Defence that companies
like Ferranti and Plessey were no longer big enough to carry the burden of
research and technology. In the interests of competition, they had to be
left to fend for themselves.
The irony thus is that Ferranti could probably not have surrendered its
independence had it wanted to: not at any rate in the mid-1980s, when it
really mattered. The UK government has since reversed its stance, so that
GEC has bought the essential bits of Plessey and will doubtless have
official blessing to snap up the remaining defence bits of Ferranti from the
receivers. If business, like war, needs luck as well as judgment, poor old
Ferranti has had the worst of both.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Recipe for reform lacks dash of spice: Elections have
strengthened India's PM but he still needs to rally support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ghost of the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque, which has haunted India
for a year, has been laid to rest.
The verdict from six state elections held last month is clear. Though vote
counting has yet to be completed, the electorate has rejected the militancy
propagated by the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party.
Supporters of the BJP, the main opposition to the ruling Congress (I) party
in parliament, unleashed widespread violence and political unrest after they
stormed the mosque last December, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths. At
the time of the riots the BJP's support was rising. Before Ayodhya, the BJP
controlled four of the six states. Now it will run just two.
The BJP's defeat comes as a relief to the Congress party and Mr P V
Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who even a few months ago feared the BJP
might do well enough in the state polls to give unstoppable impetus to its
demands for an early general election.
The outcome is thus the prospect of greater political stability for the
government than seemed likely earlier this year. Mr Rao, who was under
attack from within his own party for failing to combat the BJP with any
vigour, has seen his softly-softly approach vindicated. Now he can look
forward to leading the party and the country at least until the next general
election due in 1996.
Mr H K L Bhagat, the Congress party president, says: 'The results have
strengthened the party and strengthened the prime minister.'
Businessmen have also welcomed the poll result as it provides some assurance
of political stability at a time of economic change; so too have stock
market investors who yesterday sent the Bombay Stock Exchange's index up
59.71 to 3,292.85 on the first trading day following the election results.
Mr Tarun Das, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, a
leading employers' organisation, says: 'Stability at the political level is
good news for the economy and for investors, including foreign investors.'
However, the fact that the government is now relatively stable does not mean
that it is popular. The election results show that Indians remain
disillusioned with their national political leaders. The fall in BJP support
was not matched by any surge in enthusiasm for Congress. Without such
enthusiasm, Mr Rao and his party will find it difficult to carry out
controversial policies - notably the economic liberalisation he started in
1991.
The appeal of Mr Rao's Congress party has worn thin nearly 50 years after it
came to power as a nation-builder, leaving Indians looking for a new
direction among their political leaders. Some have found it in the BJP's
brand of Hindu nationalism, though, as the state polls show, others, such as
those who voted for the populist coalition in the largest state of Uttar
Pradesh, are repelled by the party's militant Hindu nationalism.
Nearly one third of Indian voters were eligible to vote in the state
elections which took place in four states - Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Himachal Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh - where the BJP had previously held
power; and in two other small states - the city of Delhi and the
north-eastern state of Mizoram.
Congress benefited from the anti-BJP vote mainly in the states where it was
the only credible alternative - Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, where
it overturned BJP majorities, and Rajasthan, where it reinforced its
position as the largest opposition party.
But in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state and the heartland of north
Indian politics, the anti-BJP vote was captured not by Congress but a
powerful third force in the form of the alliance between the Samajwadi party
and the Bahujan Samaj party, representing mainly the deprived lower castes.
Congress won just 28 seats in the 425-member state assembly which it once
dominated.
The BJP may be down but it is not out. It remains the single largest party
in Uttar Pradesh with 176 seats. It retained control of Rajasthan and won
Delhi, where state-level polls were held for the first time in 40 years.
Mr K R Malkani, the BJP's spokesman, says the party needs to broaden its
support. He claims it suffered because it was wrongly portrayed as a
one-issue party committed to claiming the site of the Ayodhya mosque for a
Hindu temple. 'We have to explain ourselves better to the average man.'
Many middle-class Indians have sympathy for the BJP because they see it as a
vigorous alternative to an over-conservative, tired-looking Congress. One
leading busi-nessman says: 'If the BJP can develop a non-religious agenda,
it could yet be the party of the future.'
However, at least until the 1996 national elections, it is Congress which is
in power. It will have opportunities for legislative action as early as
today, when parliament meets for its winter session. It is already preparing
the next tranche of its economic reforms for publication in the 1994-95
budget in February.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the reform-minded finance minister, has indicated the
budget will bring further reductions in customs duties, tax reforms and
measures to ease private companies' entry into insurance and other
industries dominated by state enterprises. He may also further liberalise
foreign exchange controls.
However, the political obstacles to further radical reform remain daunting.
Congress generally is willing to accept economic liberalisation - such as
customs duty cuts and incentives for exporters and foreign investors - but
only if it can be achieved without too much political hardship.
But, with a few honourable exceptions, MPs are loath to contemplate more
painful measures - such as relaxing tough labour laws which prevent
companies sacking workers and cutting jobs in the overmanned public sector,
which absorbs about two-thirds of India's organised labour. As Mr P
Chidambaram, a pro-reform MP and former commerce minister, says: 'There is
support for reform. But a critical mass of support is absent.'
Mr Manmohan Singh believes that a pro-reform consensus is steadily growing
both in Congress and in the country at large. Economic reform was not an
issue in last month's state polls, not least because the BJP generally
supports liberalisation. But Janata Dal and other parties of the left which
have been strong critics of pro-market reform fared badly at the elections.
MPs have good reason to be wary of radical reform. In the mountain state of
Himachal Pradesh, the outgoing BJP administration pursued exemplary
pro-market economic reforms - including trimming state spending, cutting
subsidies for apple farmers and introducing a no-work, no-pay rule for civil
servants who went on strike (which they often did). The result was electoral
disaster.
But Mr Chidambaram believes that support for reforms could grow with a
stronger lead from New Delhi. Even cost-cutting in state-owned industry and
other controversial measures are possible, he says.
At the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mr Das agrees: 'Reforms are on
Manmohan Singh's agenda. I believe the prime minister will now let him get
on with it.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Difficult education issue
side-stepped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr A P C BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on the expansion of student numbers in UK higher education
does not provide an accurate account of its funding implications for the
universities ('Student population reaches 1m', November 23). There is no
sense in which the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals regards the
current level of higher education funding as 'adequate'.
There has been a severe squeeze in the unit of funding over the past few
years, with increased resources falling far short of the rapid growth in
student numbers. Among the most obvious consequences of this squeeze are a
marked decline in the relative pay position of academic staff, a serious
maintenance backlog and a general decline in the quality of the student
experience. The fall in the unit of funding continues with the announcement
on Tuesday that further annual 'efficiency gains' of 4 per cent will be
imposed in the next two financial years.
Constraints on public expenditure have also resulted in the government's
decision to cap the student intake at present levels for a three year
period. However, on the basis of international comparisons, there is
certainly no reason for complacency about current levels of participation in
UK higher education. Without further sustained expansion, the aspirations of
many potential students, including those coming up through the
still-expanding further education sector, are unlikely to be met.
Increasing participation in higher education from 30 per cent to 40 per cent
of the 18-19 age group would require additional funds in excess of Pounds
1bn a year. Further resources would also be needed to compensate for years
of under-investment. In present circumstances, funding at these levels might
well require a direct contribution from the beneficiaries of higher
education towards the cost of their tuition.
The CVCP regrets that the government has stepped away from this difficult
issue in its Budget announcement and appears to be content to rest on what
has been achieved so far.

Sir, In your Budget '93 special, you stated: 'The projected public sector
pay freeze on which all the figures are predicted remains a heroic
assumption.'
The chancellor said that pay increases for public sector staff would have to
be paid for by greater efficiency.
The workload in the fire service has increased by 65 per cent. We are
operating without the approved number of firefighters in post. For these
people, and millions of others trying to deliver essential services to the
community, heroism is a daily duty.
They deserve better than a further two years of pay restraint in order to
rescue an incompetent government.

   From Mr BILL MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am glad that, amid all the theatrical oohs and aahs which have
greeted the chancellor's magic deficit disappearing tricks, your leader ('Mr
Clarke shows his skills', December 1) has reminded us that this is a tough
Budget. It will be particularly tough for the low paid, the unemployed and
those struggling to survive with the backing of the tattered remains of our
welfare state.
This has been no ordinary Budget to balance revenue and expenditure. It
underlines the government's fundamental shift to indirect taxation aimed at
allowing wealthier Tory supporters to enjoy a disproportionate share of the
national cake.
The message is: if the wealthy don't need it, let's scrap it. If they do
need particular services, let's find a way of ensuring they pay less than
they can afford while others pay proportionately more of their income.
With three new taxes - insurance and airport taxes, and a threatened tax on
motorway travel - combined with increased indirect taxation on petrol and
cars, it is clear that living costs will rise in consequence. That means the
poor will pay more, and for reduced services.
This strategy represents a clear attack on the interests of ordinary working
people. Until it becomes possible to change that strategy, trade unions will
pursue their members' interests by seeking wage increases which take account
of the damage the Budget will do to standards of living.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why provision of motorway service on
M40 was delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT KEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letter from Miss Pirie (November 26) highlights the absence of
services on the M40. I would like to make clear that my department proposed
three motorway service areas for the M40, intending to open them at about
the same time as the road. All three schemes, however, provoked objections
which led to lengthy public inquiries and substantial delays in provision.
Planning clearance was eventually refused for one of the sites, but it was
granted for the other two and construction is now under way; both are due to
open next year.
In the meantime temporary facilities, open 24 hours a day, are signposted
from the motorway at Junction 10 and between Junctions 13 and 15.
Following a commitment in the Citizen's Charter, future motorway service
areas will be promoted by the private sector rather than the department. I
understand that at least three planning applications for further service
areas on the M40 are currently under con-sideration.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Book Review: Economic eggheads unscrambled

<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<TEXT>
LOST PROPHETS
By Alfred L Malabre Jr
Harvard Business School Press
272 pages Dollars 27.95
He's sick of the lot of them. Alfred Malabre would refrain from using such
coarse language. But, after 35 years of business and economic re-porting for
the Wall Street Journal, his opinion of professional economists seems pretty
low. His advice to the public and policymakers: stop listening to these
charlatans and follow your gut instincts.
Malabre's long service in the economic trenches gives him a valuable sense
of perspective. He points out that the omnipresent economic 'guru' is a
relatively recent phenomenon. Politicians and industrialists did not always
hang on economists' every equation. When he joined the Journal staff in
1958, the paper did not employ any economists. It rarely ran an article
about economics on its feature pages. If reporters used terms such as
'balance of trade', they had to define them because readers were assumed to
be 'economic ignoramuses'.
This was not an oversight on the Journal's part but a reflection of the low
demand for the insights of economists. In those days, few of Wall Street's
top firms bothered to employ professional economists: Salomon Brothers, for
example, did not set up an economics department until 1961. Economists were
just as rare at leading US corporations. The National Association of
Business Economists had not been created. The economy, however, was doing
just fine.
Malabre fears economists have sold the public a false bill of goods. Through
the use of computers and high-powered mathematics the profession has created
a largely fraudulent aura of scientific competence. At the same time
practitioners have made large sums by pretending to be able to predict the
economic future. Yet their forecasts have proved anything but accurate.
Moreover, economists have made grandiose claims for a succession of mutually
inconsistent theories - Keynesian economics, monetarism and supply-side
economics. In the author's view, none lived up to expectations and each
created as many problems as it solved.
Malabre's first swipe is at John Maynard Keynes. His theories, he argues,
had absolutely nothing to do with the US's superior economic performance
after the second world war - for the simple reason that Keynesian professors
did not begin to exert much influence in Washington until the election of
John F Kennedy in 1960. In the 1940s and 1950s policymakers still followed
the old rules - balanced budgets, sound money and so on.
The author marvels at the extraordinary hubris of the Keynesian gurus
(mostly from Cambridge, Massachusetts) of the 1960s: the Paul Samuelsons and
Walter Hellers. Many Keynesians seemed convinced that scientific 'demand
management' could abolish the business cycle. Yet as soon as Kennedy and
Johnson tried to put their ideas into practice everything came unstuck.
Their legacy was not endless economic expansion but the inflationary
crack-up of the 1970s and the budget deficits that still haunt the US.
The next craze - monetarism - was no better. Indeed, Malabre recalls with
shame how 'super salespeople' such as Milton Friedman duped him. Friedman
assured Malabre in long discussions that there was a reliable short-term
link between monetary growth and inflation, but somehow forgot to mention
that the velocity of circulation (the rate money changes hands) could vary.
Malabre recalls with shame how Friedman 'virtually dictated' articles to him
which ran at length on the Journal's front page. Yet the relationship
between money and inflation proved more complex than Friedman claimed; by
the late 1980s central banks were not sure they could define money, let
alone control its growth.
Malabre reserves his strongest invective for 'supply-side' economics - the
theory that tax cuts would generate so much growth they would pay for
themselves. He always regarded this as 'nonsense of the worst sort' but had
to watch helplessly as the Journal's influential editorial page became prime
sponsor of the new gospel. He argues the theory was so daft it could never
have won political support without the tireless advocacy of Journal writers
such as Jude Wanniski and Robert Bartley. It led, he claims, to record
budget deficits, a collapse of US savings and investment and a reduction in
the economy's potential growth rate.
The lesson from these debacles, says Malabre, is that economists must learn
to be humble. They are not scientists. They cannot predict the future. They
have at best a limited understanding of the economy. Their policies are hard
to implement and often backfire in unexpected ways. Policymakers, meanwhile,
should be less gullible and recognise that the economy has a natural rhythm
 -the business cycle - which they can do little to tame. They should
concentrate on the simple things, like keeping their budgets in balance.
Malabre hints that the economics profession, at least in the US, may now be
losing ground. He reports that many companies have reduced their economic
staff since the mid-1980s: Citibank, for example, once employed more than 50
economists but now makes do with only a handful. At Harvard, government has
overtaken economics as the most popular undergraduate major. President
Clinton's economics team consists mainly of lawyers rather than economists.
All this suggests economists may now be paying a price for their exaggerated
claims to omniscience.
It was time somebody took a shot at economists. Malabre has got his revenge
on the eggheads who lectured him for so many years. But his critique, though
highly entertaining, is probably too damning. Most economists subscribe to a
core of theory - mostly micro-economic - that is useful and that should be
heeded by politicians. It is the egotistical forecasters and 'super
salespeople' that give the profession a bad name.

endorsed
</HEADLINE>

   From Mr VIACHESLAV A SKRYGHIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The position you have taken with regard to Russia's self-proclaimed
role as 'peace-keeper' within the republics of the former Soviet Union in
your editorial, 'Russia and its neighbours' (November 22), is commendable to
we who live directly within Russia's sphere of influence.
While there is little question that Ukraine and Russia are culturally,
linguistically and economically interrelated and that continuing such ties
will be beneficial to both nations, it is also crucial that the
international community recognises the existence of Russian proclivities to
undermine stability in the region. These proclivities are the result of
Russia's attempt to regain its former superpower status and are evidenced by
many of its recent policy statements, including that which your editorial
examines.
It is comforting to know that some of Russia's actions which attempt to
shroud its inclination to dominate the affairs of sovereign nations are
recognised as such by the international community and are appropriately not
endorsed.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Derby Day' winner - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a real long shot, but in the end a clear winner. The Yorkshire
Theatre Company's Derby Day by Brian B Thompson is all that we have learned
not to expect from the contemporary fringe theatre in London. True, like the
principal horse involved, it has a slowish start. After that, it has all the
traditional virtues of laughter, suspense, a touch of sentimentality and
even a social conscience.
One of the reasons for admiring it is that it is so unexpected. Derby Day
comes from no recognisable stable. It contains a lot of blunt Yorkshire
humour, then moves to Newmarket where the way of life is quite different,
but still essentially male-dominated.
The adopted daughter of a widowed trade unionist has moved south to become a
jockey. I shall not reveal whether or not she wins the Derby; for that is
part of the suspense, and anyway the result depends on a stewards' inquiry.
Yet even from that brief outline you should see that there are serious
subjects underlying the comedy.
Derby Day combines old-fashioned drama with new-fashioned acting and
staging. There is a cast of four, and no props except the odd box and fence.
The actors play the horses as well as the jockeys, trainers, owners, BBC
commentators and other hangers-on. They do the horses by emitting a series
of grunts and moving forwards and backwards as each race takes its course.
A touch of fairy tale enters when the Kentucky horse Lone Dancer (one of
several roles by Christopher Halliday) turns out to be able to talk, but
mainly to the girl jockey.
The horses can, of course, talk to each other, as they do before the start
of the big race. One of them is called 'Theboydonegood'. 'No horse with a
cheap and nasty name,' says a horse named Bunbury, 'has ever won the Derby.'
Still, Theboydonegood makes the early running.
Thompson throws in pots of extraneous jokes. 'You didn't catch Clem Attlee
in the bookies,' says the trade unionist. The whole piece is extraordinarily
good-natured. In the one scene of violence where the male jockeys turn on
their girl rival, the punching and kicking is mimed rather than acted out.
Much London theatre could learn from that restraint.
It is tempting to give all the acting laurels to the diminutive Rosalind
Paul as the heroine, and certainly this is a magnificent performance. Yet
she also has the most sympathetic part. The boys do pretty good as well: not
only Halliday, but Bruce Byron and Andrew McIlwee in various other parts.
This is an outstanding group directed by Toby Swift.
Derby Day runs at the Cockpit until December 18. There must be some other
London theatre with a similar open stage capable of picking it up.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Arts: A cradle for new music - Andrew Clark visits Vienna,
home of Europe's largest contemporary music festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may no longer be a hot-bed of the avant-garde, but Vienna is still home
to all that is modern and contemporary in music. That much is confirmed by
Wien Modern, founded by Claudio Abbado in 1988 and now the biggest, most
popular contemporary music festival in Europe. It is an extraordinary
achievement. The festival virtually takes over Vienna's concert life for
four weeks, drawing full houses night after night. This year's event was
more wide-ranging than the previous five, and no less palatable.
Vienna has advantages. As well as being a city of musical entertainment, it
has always been a cradle for new music, from Schubert to Schoenberg, and
composers still form an important part of the local music establishment. It
has two ensembles whose raison d'etre is to interpret modern music: the
excellent Klangforum Wien - Vienna's answer to the London Sinfonietta - and
the Austrian Radio Symphony Orchestra. And the city government backs Wien
Modern to the tune of Sch10m (Pounds 625,000).
Such foundations do not guarantee the viability of a large-scale festival;
the key seems to be the way Wien Modern sells itself. It builds its
programme around four established composers, but leaves room for subsidiary
themes. It encourages a youthful audience by spotlighting a younger Austrian
composer and offers the complete set of 40 concerts for the all-in price of
Sch650 (Pounds 40). It does not restrict itself to the new or avant-garde,
but sets these in the context of a postwar retrospective. And it unites the
city's two main concert promoters - the Musikverein and the Konzerthaus. No
wonder Wien Modern is a success.
This year, there were mumblings that four weeks were too long, that some of
the visiting ensembles were of indifferent quality. A more sustainable
complaint was that Abbado, as artistic director, should be less of a
figurehead and more of a participant. He conducted just one short work; more
is promised next year.
My own impressions left such quibbles in the shade. The four main composers
were Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Toru Takemitsu, Krzysztof Penderecki and Erich
Urbanner. Zimmermann died a generation ago, but the concerts I heard
underlined how advanced his music sounds even today. Takemitsu is virtually
unknown in central Europe, so this was a chance for Vienna to catch up. The
60th birthday tribute to Penderecki suggested there may not be such a marked
difference between his early and later output as previously thought. The
inclusion of Urbanner, born in 1936 and unknown outside Austria, seemed more
of a sop to local interests.
Zimmermann at his most dynamic, sinewy and down-to-earth was represented by
the early Violin Concerto (1949), played with tremendous spirit by Ernst
Kovacic. Antiphonen for solo viola and 25 instrumentalists (1961) was at
once more absorbing and perplexing, its oblique collage of sound experiments
and multilingual texts challenging the imagination but offering little to
the heart. It formed the centrepiece of a Klangforum concert conducted by
Hans Zender, whose own Furin No Kyo ('Songs about wind and bells') -
beautifully vocalised by Julie Moffat - bore the stamp of a Zimmermann
clone. Zender should stick to conducting, at which he is expert.
Of the younger generation of Austrian composers, the spotlight fell on Georg
Haas, whose microtonal Descendiendo was a delicate filter of isolated sounds
and sudden, massive climaxes, confidently scored for large orchestra. It is
an unmistakable product of the Viennese school, currently dominated by
Friedrich Cerha - whose own Langegger Nachtmusik III (1991), conducted by
Cerha himself, gobbled up all the resources that the Austrian Radio Symphony
Orchestra could muster.
Cerha will never be able to free himself from the language of Berg, but
Langegger was more uninhibited than anything else of his I have heard. It
incorporates some spicy African and Arabic influences, and supplements the
main orchestra with an instrumental group in the body of the auditorium - as
echo, counterpoint, conversational partner and rival band. Probing the
relationship between space and sound is nothing new: from Gabrieli to
Gruppen, there are plenty of ground-breaking precedents. But Cerha has
offered his own valid contribution.
The Docklands Sinfonietta brought Harrison Birtwistle's Three Movements with
Fanfares (1965) - a fount of brilliant, tightly-compressed ideas - and
Jonathan Harvey's Easter Orisons (1989), a unbroken skein of sound which
takes on a momentum of its own and rewards patient listening. In this
context, it was hard to take Takemitsu seriously. Nostalghia, a tribute to
the late Andrei Tarkovsky, mirrors the slow, funereal world of his film.
Tree Line sounded so familiar - so Debussyan - that it is a wonder no-one
has accused Takemitsu of plagiarism.
Sian Edwards conducted performances of commitment and refinement. Her
orchestra's visit was part of a British mini-invasion of Vienna over the
past fortnight. Independent of Wien Modern, the Northern Sinfonia gave two
guest programmes featuring music by John Casken and Nicholas Maw. A new
production of Kenneth MacMillan's Manon has just given the Staatsoper ballet
its biggest success of recent seasons. And this weekend Simon Rattle makes
his debut with the Vienna Philharmonic.

THE HAWK (15)
David Hayman
BOUND AND GAGGED: A LOVE STORY (18)
Daniel Appleby
LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD (U)
Alan Resnais
TALE OF THE FOX
Wladyslaw Starewicz
The Hawk is a British screen thriller that strives so hard for efficiency
that it winds up jettisoning its characters for a fast, smooth ride. Set in
a quiet Manchester suburb, it tells the story of a frustrated housewife
(Helen Mirren) who gradually comes to suspect that her straying husband may
in fact be The Hawk, a serial killer who has been dispatching women very
similar to herself with alarming alacrity. As the clues begin to accumulate,
she tries to make her fears public, only to have her own past history of
mental illness cast doubt on her reliability as a witness. As is usually the
case in these sorts of stories, she is left on her own to investigate
whether or not her suspicions are correct.
The best thing about this film is that everyone seems to know they are
working to a tried and tested formula. It is a largely seamless production,
unpretentious and fast-moving, only coming unglued at the end with a
gratuitous sprint to the demolition lot in pursuit of that vital clue. David
Hayman's direction is crisp and Mirren's performance is as subtly regal as
ever.
The problems lie in Peter Ransley's script. He seems so intent on its
mechanics that he neglects the ghost in the machine - fully rounded
characters. To be sure, clues accumulate, red herrings wriggle by, a big
climax is achieved. But where is the motivation, the psychological nuance?
The killer's mind remains an enigma even after his identity is revealed,
while Mirren's past mental illness is shown to be post-natal depression,
hardly likely to cast her suspicions into doubt now that her youngest child
is seven or eight. And minor characters, especially the relatives who
harbour the killer, are two-dimensional villains.
These are maddening shortcomings, since they could have been rectified in
the time it takes to pan along a grimy Manchester street. In the end, the
film remains a distinctly cool, grimly functional affair. Any satisfaction
to be had by watching the did-he-or-didn't-he plot unfold remains north of
the neck, leaving the heart and the guts untouched.
The best thing about Bound and Gagged: A Love Story is its title, which
promises the sort of kinkiness and black humour in the work of Almodovar or
David Lynch. Unfortunately, the film proves to be neither sexy nor funny. In
fact, it is hard to figure out exactly what were the thematic intentions
behind this stylised, off-key road movie to nowhere.
The plot is not without a certain skewered potential - rebellious bisexual
Elizabeth (Elizabeth Saltarrelli) kidnaps her lover Leslie (Ginger Lynn
Allen) when the latter proves unable to make the break from her abusive
husband (Chris Mulkey). Accompanied by Cliff (Chris Denton), an
inefficiently suicidal nerd, they set off across the American heartland with
the wronged and wrongful husband in pursuit. Their destination is the ranch
of a veteran de-programmer (Karen Black), who, Elizabeth hopes, will be able
to 'cure' Leslie of her dependency on her husband in particular and men in
general.
Despite the plot's potential wackiness, writer/director Daniel Appleby
proves incapable of finding either the right comic or erotic pitch to make
this strange story work. Since little attempt is made to establish an
emotional bond between viewer and characters, much of the film is downright
unpleasant. Appleby spends so much time trying to make matters stylishly hip
that they wind up not being much of anything at all. The humor is crass,
relying on kicks to the groin and smashed heads, while there is a decidedly
unfunny sub-plot involving wimpy Chris's estranged wife and her Native
American lover. A bunch of guff about dependency and personal freedom is
wheeled out in the final frame in a belated attempt to render meaning, but
by then most viewers will have abandoned this road trip for the first bus
back home.
When Last Year in Marienbad was first released 32 years ago, it proved the
sort of movie that could divide audiences as effectively as a slab of
falling masonry. Some hailed Alain Resnais's second film as a masterpiece
which helped liberate cinema from the shackles of narrative dogma, while
many others dismissed it as self-indulgent tripe. What is interesting in
viewing it now is that it inhabits neither of these extremes, standing
instead as a necessary if not exactly enduring stage in the history of
French cinema, a 90-minute purgation of its storied past in favour of the
New Wave.
For those who have not experienced it, the storyline is both maddeningly
simple and inscrutably complex. Set in a German castle which serves as a
retreat for the wealthy, Resnais's elegant and beautifully-shot film
choreographs the movements of two would-be lovers as they try to piece
together their past, present and future, all the while menaced by the
woman's jealous husband. But any such summation is ultimately reductive in a
film where locations can change in the middle of a conversation, where time
is irrevocably out of joint, and where textual repetition takes the place of
linear exposition.
Viewed in itself, the film is now a distant enigma, an ageing riddle there
seems little reason to solve. But when placed in the context of cinema
history, it begins to make sense. Resnais and writer Alain Robbe-Grillet
were not trying to tell a story or even create a genre, but were rather
taking a hammer to the work of the masters who had preceded them. By setting
the film in a retreat for the upper classes, Resnais deliberately evoked the
work of Ophuls and Renoir, only to tear it into glorious shreds. It is as a
piece of sumptuous vandalism, and not in establishing any aesthetic criteria
for subsequent filmmakers, that Last Year in Marienbad proves revolutionary.
Thus only those wanting to understand the evolution of French cinema will
feel gratified by this beautiful relic's re-release.
A French relic with more accessible charms is Wladyslaw Starewicz's Tale of
the Fox, a pioneering 1931 masterpiece of animation. It took the director 10
years to prepare and 18 months to shoot this 60-minute jewel - and it shows.
From its small, exquisite puppets to its sophisticated sense of wry humor,
this fairy tale oozes care, rivalling anything done in animation since. It
reminds you that all the digital technology and computer wizardry in the
world cannot beat a solitary injection of passion and humanity.

ITV programme chiefs keep on claiming that, although they have scrapped This
Week, Viewpoint and First Tuesday, their current affairs output is as good
and serious as ever; that they are covering much the same ground as before;
and that their chief concern is not the maximisation of ratings. Perhaps
they simply don't have time to watch their own output.
Having given us The Big Story with such humdingers as Is Wacko Jacko A
Pervert? and Blues And Twos where we were invited to follow the camera under
the lorry to peer at the old lady trapped there, today they begin Hollywood
Women (9.00). This, they tell us, provides 'a fascinating no-holds barred
insight' into four areas: Glitz And Glamour (today) Sex And Success, Money
And Power, and Fear And Violence.
Interviewees include Bo Derek, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Zsa Zsa Gabor.
Channel 4 has chosen to delay its acknowledgement of World Aids Day by 24
hours and is running more than three hours of programmes from 9.00,
beginning with the second part of the better-than-average documentary The
Plague.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Celestina', the bygone blockbuster - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Arguably Europe's first blockbuster' is how the advance blurb describes
Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina (1499, with over 60 re-prints before 1600).
The story it tells is all about love - in particular, carnal love
overwhelming courtly love. Its title character is a bawd who makes profit by
using sorcery. She helps one man, Calisto, turn his unreciprocated courtly
love for Melibea into reciprocated passion.
The tale is satirical, and it ends bitterly. Passion leads to date rape,
while the financial greed involved in Celestina's schemes leads to her death
and that of her envious assistants. Calisto's heartless enjoyment of Melibea
backfires on him, and leads to his accidental death: whereupon Melibea,
still ardent for him but still sore that he ever deflowered her, takes her
own life. Love] Love the sweet poison, love the dear wound - 'Love, thou has
the power to kill thy subjects.'
I adore all this kind of stuff. But, never fear, Jilly Cooper and Co: this
ex-blockbuster is not likely to knock you off the best-seller lists these
days. Certainly not in this Actors Touring Company version, translated by
James Mabbe and co-adapted by Max Hafler and Nick Philippou. (Philippou
directs.) As performed here, the story simply becomes mildly camp. The noble
characters speak in 'thees' and 'thous', whereas the vulgar people's talk is
decidedly modern ('I'd rather neck with a leper'). This alternation becomes
far-fetched, and the switch between 'thou' and 'you' occurs once in
mid-sentence: 'Thou makest me believe you.'
Each of the six actors has to represent at least two characters. The
role-swapping is fun, and the performance is energetic, but nothing much
stirs beneath the lively surface. Each character is simply an obvious
'type'. As the play proceeded, I grew interested by Mia Soteriou's vivid but
unexaggerated account of two opposite roles, the virtuous maid Lucretia and
Celestina's scheming daughter Elicia; and Lucy Whybrow as a shrill,
plaintive Melibea and the gutsy good-time girl Areusa.
But Ann Firbank plays Celestina as just an obvious crone. Sebastian Harcombe
overdoes all Calisto's external features - glassy smile, pretty gestures,
tremulous declamation - while never exposing any real erotic drive.
The more serious the tale grows, the more enjoyable the performance becomes.
You want to know what will happen next.
But love? It was never in evidence for a moment.
At the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, W6, 081-741-2311, until December 11

Barrie Stephens (above), who has built Siebe into Britain's biggest
engineering company in the space of 20 years, has picked up his first
non-executive directorship since he announced that he was splitting his role
as chairman and chief executive of Siebe. An industrial engineer who has
spent his whole life in the engineering industry on both sides of the
Atlantic, he has been appointed a non-executive director of the troubled
Simon Engineering.
The appointment is a coup for Simon which, despite its illustrious history,
is a fraction of Siebe's size and has been beset by management upheavals and
financial problems. Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman of Vickers, sits on the
boards of Siebe and Simon and is understood to have helped recruit Stephens.
The latter will be 66 next month and while he will remain a non-executive
chairman of Siebe, is handing over the chief executive's job to Allen Yurko.
Meanwhile, Alan Jarvis, who was replaced as Simon Engineering's finance
director last October, has resigned from the board.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Technology: Strong feelings over patent dispute - The
multimedia industry may soon turn into a legal minefield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US computer software companies are up in arms over the granting of a basic
patent on multimedia databases to Compton's New Media, a small software
company best known for its development of an electronic multimedia
encyclopedia that is sold on a CD-Rom, similar to an audio compact disc.
Compton's has shocked the industry by announcing that it has been granted a
patent that covers any computer-controlled system that searches through a
database and retrieves text with images or audio or video information.
The company is seeking royalties amounting to 1 per cent of revenues from
sales of multimedia products ranging from personal computer databases to
interactive television. It has said that it will reduce or eliminate
royalties on the patent to software developers that use Compton's as a
distributor.
Many in the software industry are convinced that Compton's claim to have
invented a novel process for searching multimedia databases is false. 'This
patent basically claims that Compton's invented multimedia,' says Philip
Dodds, executive director of the Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA), a
trade association representing more than 260 companies in the rapidly
emerging multimedia industry.
Compton's patent covers a search system process that is common and
considered non-proprietary, the industry group maintains. Compton's patent
now seems certain to be challenged in the courts. Several industry groups
including the IMA and San Francisco's Multimedia Developers Group are
banding together in an effort to get the patent overturned.
Compton's, however, is determined to assert its patent rights. 'We simply
want the public to recognise Compton's NewMedia as the pioneer in this
industry, promote a standard that can be used by every developer and be
compensated for the investments we have made to make multimedia a reality
for developers and end users,' said Stanley Frank, president and chief
executive.
The dispute has raised strong feelings in the software industry because it
comes just as multimedia products appear set to break into the mainstream of
personal computing. Dozens of software companies have launched CD-Rom titles
for home and school use and sales of PCs complete with stereo sound and
video capabilities are booming.
The fledgling multimedia industry could soon turn into a legal battleground
says G. Gervaise Davis III, a partner in Davis &amp; Schroeder, a
California-based law firm specialising in intellectual property issues.
Thousands of multimedia patent applications have been filed in the past few
years, he notes.
However, the row over Compton's multimedia patent is only the latest example
of a much broader problem with software patents. Critics charge that
software patents covering basic ideas are stifling the creativity of the
small companies that have led innovation in the software industry by
limiting access to fundamental ideas.
Until seven years ago, the US Patent Office did not grant patents on
software. Since then, more than 10,000 software patents have been granted,
but there are as many as 15,000 software patent applications waiting for
approval.
Yet the US Patent Office is ill-equipped to examine properly these claims,
industry critics charge. The agency lacks the expertise or resources to
fully research 'prior art' that can invalidate patent applications. As a
result, several sweeping patents have been granted for basic computer
processes that are not novel, the IMA complains.
A group of US firms including Apple Computer, IBM, Digital Equipment, Lotus
Development and Microsoft have formed the Software Patent Institute, which
is building a database of software inventions for the Patent Office's use in
an effort to avert software patent disputes.
But Compton's patent issue is spurring industry pressure for broader
reforms. The IMA has called for the formation of an industry commission to
review pending patents and provide the Patent Office with the expertise it
currently lacks.
Some are also calling for changes in US patent laws to give patent
challengers an opportunity to make their case before a patent is granted.
Currently, in the US, patent filings are secret until approval is granted.
This means that anyone wishing to dispute a patent must either challenge the
patent in the courts or ask the Patent Office to re-examine the patent.
Both are lengthy and expensive procedures. In the meantime, the challenger
must pay royalties to the patent holder or run the risk of being liable for
triple damages for willfully infringing the patent.
Such disputes are nothing new in other sectors of the high-technology
industry such as semiconductors and computer hardware, where patents have
long been recognised as a primary means of protecting intellectual property
rights that enable innovators to recoup their investments in technology
development.
Yet in the software industry, patent rights are a relatively new phenomenon
and one that few developers have previously encountered. Although many may
see the dispute over Compton's patent as a threat to innovation, it may well
prove to be a catalyst for broader understanding of intellectual property
rights in the software industry and improvements in the patent process that
will eventually benefit all software developers.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Technology: Charged up for battle - The war between
re-usable and disposable batteries is getting fiercer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas is coming and the credit card bill is getting fat. Come New Year
and the expense will continue with the never-ending demand for batteries to
power games computers, remote control racing cars or the latest in walking,
talking dolls.
Increasingly advanced technologies and the growing demand for 'green'
products, however, means that 1994 could be the year when it becomes
fashionable to recharge spent batteries rather than consigning them to the
dustbin.
Traditionally, rechargeable batteries have commandeered just a fraction of
the market, 2 per cent of consumer battery sales in volume terms in 1992.
The result is that 12bn batteries every year end up in landfill sites
worldwide.
Several products launched this year have not only fuelled consumer interest,
but sparked a war of words in the seemingly staid world of the battery
maker.
The third largest US battery maker, Rayovac, which owns the Vidor battery
company in the UK, has thrown down the gauntlet with Renewal, a re-usable
alkaline battery system which will be on sale in the US for Christmas.
Until now only nickel-cadmium batteries have been re-usable - not alkaline
batteries, which make up the bulk of the disposable battery market from
manufacturers such as Duracell or Ever Ready.
The renewable alkaline batteries can be used at least 25 times, but only the
special Rayovac brand can be used in the Renewal charger and they cost about
twice as much to buy as disposable or 'primary' batteries. The two Renewal
chargers costs Dollars 15 (Pounds 10) and Dollars 30.
The Renewal batteries have the advantage over their nickel-cadmium
counterparts that they can be charged to 1.5 volts - the same as primary
batteries. They are also ready charged on the shop shelves, so desperate
parents can slot them into battery-powered toys without waiting hours. And
there is no 'memory' problem, where a battery will only fully recharge if
the battery is completely spent.
Rayovac believes a further advantage is that they lose power gradually, so
that consumers are warned that they need to charge the battery as the tape
in the personal stereo begins to slur. Nickel-cadmium batteries lose power
suddenly.
Manufacturers of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries, such as Ever Ready,
which is the market leader in the UK, believe their technology is still the
best on offer. They hit back at detractors who say that because
nickel-cadmium batteries supply a constant 1.2 volts they are unsatisfactory
for use in the most power-hungry toys, such as video games machines. Both
disposable batteries and rechargeable alkaline ones begin to lose their
power as soon as they are used, so it is not long before the power drops
below 1.2 volts, they point out.
Each nickel-cadmium battery can be recharged 1,000 times, making them very
economical. Japanese electronics specialist Panasonic is so convinced of the
future of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries in Europe that it has
recently launched its first rechargeable product, called Rechargeable Nick.
Two R6 Rechargeable Nick batteries, say Panasonic, will power a personal
stereo for three years, provided that the batteries are removed and
recharged every night. The alternative is to use 540 disposable batteries.
A more controversial method of recharging batteries was launched in the UK
in August when Kleeneze Holdings, which produces the Innovations catalogue
found in many of the UK's Sunday newspapers. The company introduced a
machine which recharges all the commonly available primary batteries -
alkaline or zinc chloride. Only the button types which power watches and
cameras cannot be put in the Battery Manager.
Although the Battery Manager was first on to the market, Andy White, product
development manager at the Innovations Group, says that there are 40 or 50
international patents outstanding on similar developments.
Most battery chargers work in a similar way, essentially a technology
devised in the 1940s. When a battery is used the metal from the electrode is
dissolved in the electrolyte and dissipated. To recharge the battery the
metal particles are plated back on to the electrode - in the same way as
silver plating cutlery.
The variations in the way the machines work centre around the speed and
power at which the batteries are recharged and the control mechanisms used
to prevent the batteries exploding. The control mechanisms in the latest
chargers incorporate microchips to ensure consistency.
Reaction to the Battery Manager from primary battery suppliers was swift. A
spokeswoman for Ever Ready says the company is still concerned about the
safety of recharging primary batteries which are sealed, so preventing the
escape of gases produced in the process. Consumers who re-charge their Ever
Ready primary batteries in a Battery Manager automatically invalidate their
guarantee if things go wrong, she says.
'Once a year someone in the world claims to have found a way of recharging
primary batteries,' says a sceptical Peter Galazka, European marketing
manager for Duracell. 'Innovations is the latest in a long line of them.'
Galazka is also concerned that the Innovations product could cause confusion
and persuade consumers to recharge primary batteries in machines designed to
charge nickel-cadmium batteries. That could easily result in the batteries
leaking and in extreme cases, exploding.
Nevertheless, in the four months since its launch, sales of the Battery
Manager have been brisk, with 200,000 chargers ordered. Previous to that, by
comparison, Ever Ready reckons that only 66,000 nickel cadmium battery
chargers in total were sold in the UK.
Innovations has been a victim of its own success, however. Sales of the
Battery Manager have been so brisk that Innovations has only been able to
ship 70 per cent of the chargers ordered, says White.
Whether the new breed of battery rechargers will dent the ever-growing
market for primary batteries is debatable. Galazka believes that consumers
will be disappointed with the performance of recharged batteries, in
particular about the time each battery lasts between charges.
All the battery and recharger manufacturers acknowledge that the biggest
problem is consumer inertia and the 'hassle factor' as Galazka puts it.
'Actually,' says the Ever Ready spokeswoman, 'people are just lazy.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / People: Smith benefits from split role at Argyll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Argyll, the food retailing group comprising Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost, is
splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive, currently filled by Sir
Alistair Grant, and promoting Colin Smith, finance director since 1989, to
the chief executive's position.
Sir Alistair, who became chief executive in 1986 and added the chairman's
role in 1988, will continue as full-time executive chairman. David Webster
continues as deputy chairman with responsibility for corporate finance and
development and strategic planning.
Argyll says Sir Alistair, who is nearly 57, was keen to 'play in' a new
executive before he reached the retirement age of 60, and bring in someone
else to participate in trading and investment decisions that may have an
impact beyond that date.
'We will split the job as you would expect,' said Smith (above right)
yesterday. 'It will be my responsibility to conduct operations, while
Alistair will be executive chairman. He is the boss at the end of the day.'
He added that 'everybody's style is different. Mine will be different from
Alistair's, who had a background in marketing, while mine was on the finance
side. My style will probably be different from what it was when I was
finance director. I will need to get much more closely involved with the
operations.'
Smith, 46, has a degree in commerce from Liverpool University, and began his
career with Arthur Andersen in 1969. From 1976 he spent three years on
consultancy assignments, and joined Argyll Foods as financial controller of
its meat division in 1979.
He was rapidly promoted, being appointed finance director of Argyll Stores
division in 1983 and to the board of the Argyll Group in 1984.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Accountancy Column: Last call for smaller company annual
audits - The opportunities and potential hazards of the government's
proposed abolition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's first unified budget this week may not have had much effect on
beer drinkers or newspaper readers, but it will certainly make its impact on
small companies and professional accountancy practices around the country.
Almost as an aside in the middle of his lengthy speech on Tuesday, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, spared a thought for the
drawbacks of the current statutory audit requirements.
After two previous failed attempts by government in the past few years to
relax the rules for annual audits of limited liability companies, draft
legislation could now be ready by as soon as next year.
This will lift the requirement for a full audit each year for an estimated
500,000 of the 1.1m limited liability companies across the country. All
those with a turnover below Pounds 90,000 a year - some 300,000 - will be
exempt; most with a turnover below Pounds 350,000 a year - a further 200,000
businesses - will be verified by a report by an independent accountant less
exacting than an audit in future.
Interestingly, while most of the work on the small company audit has been
conducted by officials at the Department of Trade and Industry, all the
glory has been claimed by Treasury ministers.
It was Mr Norman Lamont, the previous chancellor, who first hinted at
government sympathy for reform in his budget speech in March. It was his
successor, Mr Clarke, who was given the task of announcing the decision -
and who claimed he had been fully in support of the idea while at the DTI.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister of corporate affairs at the DTI, was left with
the more technical task of unveiling a consultative document this April -
although the first indications that the DTI was again considering the issue
came through his predecessor, Mr John Redwood, in February last year.
That stoked the fires at a wide range of lobbying groups, which began months
of campaigning and preparation of briefs long before any official documents
left the DTI headquarters to ask for their views.
It rapidly became clear that the mood had changed since previous attempts at
reform. The usual candidates arguing for abolition at a higher level came
forward, not least the small businesses organisations and much of the
accountancy profession, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
They said, as they had in the past, that the audit was costly, irrelevant
and not best suited to the needs of smaller companies. What was the point of
a supposedly independent audit conducted very often by the sole practitioner
who had prepared the books and provided advice to the company?
Equally, why have the auditor reporting to the shareholders on the conduct
of the directors when the two groups were very often the same?
By the time the DTI consultative document was issued, it was becoming
difficult to find objectors to the principle of reform. It received an all
but unprecedented number of 500 responses, nearly all in favour of reform.
For example, the British Bankers' Association had been swayed, in spite of
concerns that its members wanted to be able to rely on audited accounts
before approving loans.
Even the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants - which includes
some 4,000 members auditing the smallest companies - began to backtrack. Mr
David Bishop, last year's president, had sometimes had to speak through
gritted teeth against his own personal views, to argue that the privilege of
limited liability must be accompanied by the obligation of the audit.
That attitude had softened by the spring, although the association
maintained its position that any deregulation should be accompanied by
measures to make it easier for many thousands of companies trapped with
limited liability for tax reasons to be able to disincorporate. No such
measures were announced in the budget.
More significant were the silences. Officials at the Inland Revenue and HM
Customs and Excise were suddenly no longer murmuring about the reliability
of unaudited accounts. They were under pressure from the deregulators that
they did not place that much reliance in published accounts, and have powers
of far wider access to financial information during tax inquiries.
That said, the details announced in the budget go considerably further than
those recommended by the DTI in the spring. Its consultative document called
for abolition of the audit for companies below the annual turnover threshold
above which registration for value added tax: which was just raised in the
budget to Pounds 45,000.
The new limit for complete exemption is twice that level, and for the lesser
requirement of a 'compilation report' by an independent accountant is nearly
eight times as high. It is likely that these figures will remain fixed,
while the tax limits tend to rise year by year.
These higher levels caught many people by surprise, not least the Certified
Association. It issued a statement warning: 'Removal of the audit
requirement will also remove accountability . . . (and) may give rise to
concerns with regard to the public interest.'
Even so, the association seems resigned to the changes. Mr John Moore,
deputy president and a small practitioner based in Belfast, says: 'If the
Chancellor has made our bed we will lie on it and arrange the duvet to be as
warm and comfortable as possible.'
'I am certainly not concerned in terms of our own practice,' he says. 'We
are happy to be released from the time to do the statutory audit. It was a
bit of a bind. This will leave clients with more funds to seek other
accountancy services.'
A lone campaign will continue against reform by the Institute of Credit
Management. 'We view these proposals with serious concern,' says Kate
Beddington-Brown, assistant to the director general. 'They will probably
prove counter-productive to smaller companies.
She says the institute's members are sceptical of the assurance that will be
provided by the independent accountant's report, and are less likely to
provide strong credit-ratings to unaudited accounts.
A number of details have still to be finalised. There has been considerable
agonising in Whitehall over the nature of the independent accountant's
report. If it is to remain reasonably rigorous, how far will it differ from
the existing audit requirement?
The DTI must consider how to prevent fraud and to retain assurance that the
figures are reliable, although - as it recommended - abolition of the audit
will still require unanimous shareholder approval.
Equally, there are concerns also among practitioners about exactly what
obligations they would be taking on by assuming this new role.
Standards-setters may yet have to lay down precise guidelines.
But the DTI is committed to reform. It will introduce the reforms as
secondary legislation, without the need for an act of parliament, which it
says will be in place by the middle of next year.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Rewards for the
loyal shopper - Wooing and keeping customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots the Chemists was this week putting a brave face on what must be
judged, at the very least, a public relations embarrassment. Its
vouchers-for-sports equipment scheme is not in the same league as Hoover's
free flight fiasco of a year ago. But it does highlight some of the dangers
inherent in the current rash of customer loyalty schemes, designed to
attract and reward regular spenders.
Between September and November Boots issued 36m vouchers to customers - one
for every Pounds 5 spent at its stores - which could be exchanged by schools
for sports equipment. A total of 22,000 schools throughout the UK registered
for the scheme and started eyeing equipment in the Boots' catalogue for
which they hoped parents would collect tokens.
Unfortunately, the vouchers were worth so little individually that customers
threw them away; when the required volume of vouchers failed to get through
to schools there was a stream of complaints. Boots has recently announced it
would halve the number of vouchers needed for each piece of equipment.
Such a miscalculation is just one of the traps to be avoided by companies
tempted to join the customer loyalty industry.
Existing schemes range from Air Miles (run by a British Airways subsidiary),
now believed to be collected by one in 10 UK households, to tie-ups between
petrol stations and retailers. Premier Points, for example, are collected at
Mobil and redeemed at Argos.
One of the largest schemes is yet to come. AT&amp;T Istel, an information
technology subsidiary of the US communications group, is currently
negotiating with UK retailers to set up in the spring an 8m-member loyalty
card programme. The company will manage the scheme on behalf of
non-competing toy, grocery, petrol, DIY, electrical and clothing retailers,
restaurants and hotels.
Customers can pick up points whenever they use a participating outlet and
will be able to redeem them for a range of discounts, goods and services.
AT&amp;T Istel will manage the database of card members and participating
companies will get shared access to the data, allowing them to mail each
other's customers. AT&amp;T Istel plans to spend Pounds 8m marketing the scheme
in each of the next three years.
Arguably there is little new about customer loyalty programmes - the
'dividends' offered by the co-operative society shops, Green Shield stamps
and store cards were all antecedents of the current schemes. But industry
observers say recent interest is unlikely to abate. The recession has made
companies question the cost-effectiveness of traditional mass-marketing
techniques, and turn to more focused methods, according to Stephen Taylor,
Air Miles' marketing director. In good times, the fact that advertising is
not as targeted or as effective as might be desired 'doesn't really matter,
because you're establishing your brand name', he says.
The economic benefits of keeping existing customers loyal, rather than
focusing on the short-term recruitment of new customers, has also received
much attention. The longer the 'life' of a customer, the more initial
recruitment costs will be spread. With an 80 per cent annual retention rate,
for example, a customer base will need renewing once every five years; by
increasing the retention rate to 90 per cent, the base need only be renewed
every 10 years.
'Customer loyalty appears to be the only way to achieve sustainably superior
profits,' Frederick Reichheld, a director of the consultancy Bain and
Company, wrote in the Harvard Business Review earlier this year. One of the
examples he used was the life insurance business, where, Reichheld says, 'a
five percentage point increase in customer retention lowers costs per policy
by 18 per cent'.
The latest research from Cranfield School of Management, published this
week, which looked at shopping patterns in 10 large shopping centres across
the UK, found that loyal shoppers spend up to four times more in their
first-choice store than those who are 'promiscuous' in their shopping
habits.
The payoff for keeping customers is clear, but it cannot be assumed that the
current craze for the card, token and voucher-based loyalty schemes is
necessarily doing the trick.
Says Tim Denison from Cranfield who, together with Simon Knox, carried out
the retailing research: 'How effective loyalty schemes are is still in
question.' It is not known, for example, whether customers behave tactically
towards the schemes, reaping a few advantages and then moving on to a new
offer. Denison points to a lack of monitoring by companies, and accounting
practices which fail to highlight which customers are most worth keeping.
Taylor suggests that deferred discount programmes - which offer discounts
after points have been accumulated - can 'work, ultimately, against the
whole notion of a customer loyalty programme' by devaluing the brand.
Schemes such as the Mobil-Argos tie-up may not devalue the brand, adds
Taylor, but they can easily be copied. Inflation of the currency, of the
type that led, in part, to the eventual demise of Green Shield stamps, may
then follow.
Mobil, which says it was first into the market with the plastic 'swipe'
card, rather than tokens or stamps, confirms Taylor's view.
'It's like shooting at a moving target,' says Mobil's spokesman Roger
Newstead. Premier Points gave an initial boost to sales, but competitors
pinched the idea within a short time and now it is hard to identify to what
extent the scheme has increased or maintained those sales, he says. Mobil
knows it needs some sort of promotion all the time, otherwise sales drop.
Clearly the danger is that competitors engage in what Taylor describes as a
'zero sum game' where everybody will be 'spending money on programmes just
to keep the playing field level, rather than to have an advantage'.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cutting down on the
credits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zapping - switching between different television channels by viewers - is
the TV advertiser's nightmare, particularly when it happens during or just
before a commercial break.
Anything which induces a viewer to opt out of expensively purchased airtime
is therefore of interest to those who have the job of deciding where
advertisements should be placed.
The latest viewer research, conducted by the ITV Network Centre for the
independent television companies in the UK, shows that surprisingly few
viewers switch over during the break itself; the main culprit seems to be
the credits at the end of programmes.
The study indicates that by the time the credits reach best boy or chief
gaffer, viewers are highly likely to have reached for the remote control,
zapped and then missed the ensuing ads.
Only too aware of the increasing competition from cable and satellite and
the need to keep advertisers sweet, the ITV companies have immediately
responded to the research by announcing a reduction in the length of
credits.
The aim now will be to cut credits to 20 seconds at the end of a programme
which lasts an hour or less - ITV companies say that many programmes exceed
the current unofficial guideline of 30 seconds.
The research also reveals that breaks of five minutes or more lose viewers.
The study concludes: 'The findings are unequivocal - if ITV is to maximise
the audience to commercial breaks, as many breaks as possible should be less
than five minutes in duration.' More frequent, but shorter breaks,
therefore, seem on the cards.
Longer term, the threat for advertisers is that viewers decide not only to
zap, but to edit out the breaks altogether by using the video-recorder
technology that already exists to eliminate the breaks.
In this way they order what they want to watch, rather than waiting for it
to be served up.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Home, sweet hotel
home - The US is going to new lengths to attract tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you wake up in a hotel where the television news is reported in Japanese,
the breakfast menu features miso soup and green tea and your concierge slips
the Japan Times under the door, you could be forgiven for thinking that you
were in one of Tokyo's finest resorts.
But you are just as likely to be in America. With 19.5m overseas visitors
expected to flood into the US this year, hotels are going to new lengths to
attract foreign travellers.
'The whole point is to make your guests feel as at home as possible,' says
Jo-Anne Cavanaugh, international sales director for Marriott Hotels. 'If
they enjoy their experience with you, they will come back again.'
Although many tourists travel abroad to sample alternative cultures, hotel
sales managers in the US are finding that by adopting some of the services
and customs exercised in other countries, their guests feel less
disorientated and return to the same destination time and again.
For this reason Gary Zodrow, executive vice-president of HBR Hotels, based
in San Francisco, California, makes special arrangements for foreign
visitors, who make up 55 per cent of his clientele.
'If we have French guests, we order softer croissants, special breakfast
rolls and jams,' says Zodrow. 'If we are hosting Germans, we make sure
German beer is stocked in the bar.'
Other hotels go to greater lengths, particularly for the Japanese. According
to the US Travel and Tourism Administration, they are expected to comprise
21 per cent of all overseas visitors to the US in 1993.
For example, many hotel chains now offer Jan (Japan Assistant Network),
which provides translation services for business travellers, plus
information for holiday makers about local restaurants, shopping facilities
and tourist attractions.
Some hotels also subscribe to Scola, a 24-hour international news channel on
cable television that tunes into news desks worldwide to cover events
directly from source.
Hotel Nikko, in San Francisco, owned by Japan Air Lines, not only offers its
Japanese guests news from home and coverage of the Nikkei stock index, but
also caters for international conferencing through Photo &amp; Sound, an
in-house audio visual company that provides real-time translation of
business meetings.
Hotels have also initiated finer modifications for specific foreign
visitors.
The Marriott, for example, provides longer length bath robes for Japanese
guests. 'The Japanese are very modest people, they appreciate a little more
coverage,' explains Cavanaugh. Meanwhile, the Westin St Francis Hotel
researches the status of its guest list prior to check-in and accommodates
higher ranking individuals on higher floors than their subordinates - in
line with traditional Japanese protocol.
But despite these attempts to draw foreign trade, many leading chains are
reporting decreased custom from certain nationalities, including the
Japanese.
Alain Ane, assistant general manager at the Hotel Nikko, claims Japanese
tourists make up 25 per cent of the hotel's guest list.
But that figure is 10 per cent down on last year - and falling. Partly due
to the recession in Japan, Ane believes that declining Japanese patronage is
also attributable to recent negative press about the US.
Shootings of German and British tourists in Florida, the slaying of a
Japanese student in October last year and the Los Angeles riots following
the Rodney King incident, have done a great deal to engender fear and
apprehension in travellers to the US.
'It's embarrassing,' says Zodrow. 'America used to provide such a wonderful
and safe environment for travellers. Now we give a third-world impression of
safety.'
At least those willing to brave the streets of America, for business or
pleasure, may rest assured their visit will be home from home.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Payments for EU programmes cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The drive to cut government spending next year has been helped by a large
cut in payments to Brussels to fund European Union programmes, including
farm subsidies.
Payments to the EU in 1994-95 were set in the Budget at Pounds 1.35bn, a cut
of Pounds 1.3bn on the Pounds 2.65bn envisaged in the March Budget.
However, the cut is more than compensated for by higher UK spending on EU
projects this year and in 1995-96. In these years payments have been boosted
by Pounds 1.04bn and Pounds 890m respectively.
Under the new plans, Britain is due to channel Pounds 2.45bn to EU projects
this financial year and Pounds 2.89bn in 1995-96.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Tax relief on extortion banned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has placed a complete ban on companies claiming tax relief on
extortion payments.
The 1993 Finance Act introduced legislation to prevent tax relief on any
payments contrary to the Prevention of Corruption Acts and the Prevention of
Terrorism Acts.
The additional proposals announced on Tuesday by the chancellor impose a
wider ban on extortion payments to terrorists or other criminals which are
illegal.
The government said the total expected to be saved was less than its
'negligible' definition of Pounds 5m a year.

The government has increased funding for the promotion abroad of tourism to
the UK, and reduced proposed cuts in the budget of the English Tourist
Board, which encourages UK residents to take holidays in England.
Government funding of the British Tourist Authority - which promotes Britain
to overseas visitors - is to rise from Pounds 32m in 1993-94 to Pounds 34m
in 1995-96, Pounds 500,000 higher than government projections published a
year ago. The English board, which aims to improve facilities, is to see its
funding fall from Pounds 13.9m in 1993-94 to Pounds 10m in 1995-96. However,
this figure is Pounds 1m higher than previous government plans.
The authority and the board yesterday said the increases were 'mildly
encouraging'.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Industry gloomy on investment prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low levels of manufacturing investment are likely to continue in spite of
Budget measures to help small businesses, Midlands business leaders warned
yesterday, Paul Cheeseright writes.
Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the Engineering Employers' Federation
in the west Midlands, said: 'The major disappointment is the lack of any
direct incentive to further investment prospects. The temporary 40 per cent
capital allowance rate has not been re-affirmed.'
Mr Geoff Nicholls, east Midlands chairman of the Confederation of British
Industry, said: 'The allowance should have continued because of the
depressed nature of the investment scene.'
Companies held back from new investment not only because of the business
climate but also because of the pressure on margins. 'Everybody is very
clear that the pressure on margins is going to continue,' Mr Nicholls said.
However, Mr Nicholls said the chancellor 'has avoided damaging the rather
nervous growth prospects'.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Government to ease retirement burden on
women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will try to offset some of the adverse effects of raising the
state pension age for women by making it easier for home carers to obtain
larger pensions when they retire.
Women will be able to earn entitlement to benefits while caring for children
or the disabled for up to 19 years, three years longer than at present. The
State Earnings Related Pension Scheme can also be modified so that women
with no more than 20 years of employment who have had caring
responsibilities in other years will be eligible for a full Serps pension.
The government in addition will enlarge state pension benefits for those who
defer the date they begin drawing benefits and allow women who reach
retirement age before their husbands to obtain better benefits.
The details were contained in a white paper on equalising state pension ages
released yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. On
Tuesday Mr Kenneth Clarke announced that women will have to wait until
reaching the age of 65 - the same as men - before being eligible to draw
state pensions. The change will be phased in gradually from 2010 to 2020. No
one currently over the age of 44 will be affected.
Tables published yesterday show that the first group of women to be affected
are those born in December 1952, who cannot receive state pensions until
they are 62 years and eight months.
The consultation document notes that companies which pay bridging pensions
to men who retire at 60 must also consider paying the same pensions to women
or phase the payment out altogether.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Early solution unlikely over late payment
 -Plans to tackle overdue debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifteen years after the Law Commission first called for a statutory right to
interest payable on overdue corporate debts, the government has launched a
fresh debate on how best to tackle one of business's biggest headaches. It
promises to be a tough argument to resolve.
With the economy emerging from recession and demands on working capital set
to rise, there is a fresh urgency behind government efforts to find a
solution.
Most companies and every business organisation acknowledge the severity of
an overdue payment problem that is now endemic in the UK and across most of
Europe. It can be immensely time-consuming, plays havoc with cashflow and
each year it kills off countless smaller enterprises.
The UK is now almost alone in Europe in not having resorted to legislation
to try to ease the problem. But invoking the law in other countries of the
European Union appears to have had minimal impact, and there is disagreement
in the UK on whether to continue to use education and persuasion or to start
using a big stick.
This week's post-Budget consultative document says ministers are 'prepared
to give positive consideration to the introduction of legislation'.
But when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Portillo,
Treasury chief secretary, met Tory backbenchers in the Commons after
Tuesday's Budget, they were left in no doubt that deep reservations persist
within the parliamentary party about the value of legislation.
Wide differences also exist in the business community. The Forum for Private
Business is demanding a legal right to punitive interest to help reduce what
it says has become an average payment time of 81 days.
But Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive of 3i, the venture capital group,
believes a right to interest on late payment would simply institutionalise a
bad habit. 'I strongly believe we need a suitable code of conduct and that
central and local government must take a lead in offering a good example on
prompt payment to everyone else,' he said.
Critics of statutory interest say it would simply lead to big customers
imposing longer credit periods and coercing suppliers into waiving the right
to interest, while smaller businesses could find themselves with double
interest burdens - for borrowing on working capital and payments on overdue
invoices.
Ministers say they have already tried to set an example, requiring
government departments to monitor payment performance and publish the
results. Prime contractors of government also have to commit themselves to
paying subcontractors on time and, from this week, all government contracts
will normally nominate a 30-day payment period.
The consultation paper raises other options, including a maximum statutory
credit period, an idea backed by the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce. But ministers dismiss the idea as neither desirable nor
practicable.
The document also raises the possibility of a new British Standard on prompt
payment and says preliminary talks held between government officials and
outside groups have raised no objections.
Companies would have a choice of whether or not to adopt the standard. It
would, however, have to be very widely adopted to be effective, and the
ultimate threat of withdrawal of British Standard certification might prove
less than intimidating to companies for which paying late has become a way
of life.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Audit change arouses anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit-rating agencies yesterday reacted with surprise and anger to the
chancellor's proposals to remove the annual audit requirement for smaller
companies.
In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Institute of Credit Management warned
that smaller companies would find it more difficult to obtain credit and the
potential for fraud would be increased.
Mr Clarke's proposal to waive a statutory audit for limited liability
companies with an annual turnover below Pounds 350,000 contrasted with
proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry in the spring to exempt
those with turnovers below Pounds 37,600.
The institute warned that credit granters would be less willing to rely on
unaudited financial information.
The letter said: 'To relax the audit requirement at the low level proposed
in the consultative document would have been serious enough. To propose
extending the regime to companies with a turnover of up to Pounds 350,000
could be positively dangerous.'
About 500,000 of the 1.1m limited liability companies which currently must
obtain an annual audit would be exempted under the government's plans.
There would be no requirement for companies with turnover below Pounds
90,000 - twice the new threshold for companies to register for value added
tax. Those above this level but with turnover below Pounds 350,000 a year
would need only a compilation report by an independent accountant.
Any companies below this limit which are public limited companies, part of a
group structure or subject to statute-based regulation, such as the
Financial Services Act will not be exempt from the audit.
The exemptions would still require unanimous approval by shareholders in the
companies - but in many cases the directors are the shareholders.
All limited-liability companies would still be required to maintain proper
books and records and to file annual accounts with Companies House.
Lord Strathclyde, minister for small businesses at the DTI, said the
government would provide details of the measures early in the new year and
put them into force by the middle of 1994.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: 95% of families will be poorer, Labour
claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused the Conservatives of becoming 'the high-tax party'
and said 95 per cent of families would be worse off.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the Budget Red Book showed that
the tax burden would rise from 34.25 per cent of national income this year
to 38.5 per cent by 1998-99.
'The Tories have now presented the British people with the biggest tax
demand in history - overall a tax rise over the next three years of Pounds
24bn,' he said.
Mr Brown accused the prime minister of breaking his promise at the 1992
general election that taxes would come down 'year on year'.
He told the Commons: 'This Budget finally broke any residual trust that even
the most ardent Tory could have in this government over taxation policy.'
Labour concentrated its fire on claims that the government had broken its
promises not to raise income tax, value added tax, and National Insurance
contributions.
Shadow ministers also highlighted the impact on public services of the
decision announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to cut public
spending by Pounds 8bn over three years.
However, Conservatives accused the opposition of failing to spell out how it
would have reduced the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement
without raising taxes or cutting spending.
The Labour attack was further blunted when Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow
social services secretary, claimed that the 50p a week provided for
pensioners by the VAT compensation scheme was insufficient.
'This is not full compensation. It is Mr Clarke calculating the minimum he
must pay to survive. He may have bought off some of his own rebels but he
can't buy off the old and the cold with 50p,' Mr Dewar said.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, prompted roars of
Conservative laughter by producing a newspaper article written two weeks ago
in which Mr Dewar called for compensation of 50p a week.
Labour also failed to respond to the chancellor's announcement that a freeze
on central government pay bills is to be extended by two years until 1997,
affecting 5m public-sector workers.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, accused Mr Clarke of
'stealing' Labour's ideas for childcare allowances, closing tax loopholes
and improving small businesses' cashflow through curbs on late payments.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: TUC warns of big public-sector job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 270,000 public-sector jobs will be lost during the next two years
as a result of the chancellor's public spending plans, the Trades Union
Congress said yesterday. It said local government services would be the
hardest hit.
The TUC also estimated that the take-home pay of the average worker,
assuming a 4 per cent pay rise, would be cut by 2 per cent in real terms
because of the effect of inflation and tax increases.
The TUC said the cut for 'scapegoated' public-sector workers would be even
bigger.
'Mr Clarke's assault on the public sector is worse than anything we saw in
the Thatcher decade,' said Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary. 'His
assumption that the public services can carry on for the next three years
with reduced funding and fewer staff is totally unrealistic.'
By extending for a further two years the freeze on public-sector pay already
planned for 1994-95, the government is forcing public-sector workers to
choose between big job cuts and big pay cuts, the TUC said.
It said it was the government's 'undeclared intention' to save Pounds
3bn-Pounds 4bn a year on the public-sector pay bill.
'The anticipated savings from the reductions are intended to bridge the gap
between the Pounds 5.1bn projected underspend in government expenditure
totals,' it added.
Pay analysts, such as Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation, say
the wage gap between the public and private sectors is likely to widen. But
the government appears to believe that at a time of high unemployment this
will not necessarily cause people to shift to the private sector.
The five pay review bodies - which cover about 2m of the 5m public-sector
workers - will warn the government that the pay policy will hit morale in
the sector. But the position of the review bodies themselves looks
increasingly provisional.
The review bodies, covering such sectors as the army, doctors and dentists,
nurses and teachers, have already seen their pay-setting authority
undermined by the 1.5 per cent limit for 1993-94. Despite this, the
teachers' review body still met and produced a report on restructuring.
Since the announcement in September of the pay-bill freeze for 1994-95, the
five bodies have continued to hear evidence from unions and employers and
are expected to produce reports in January.
'They will come to their own independent judgments,' said Mr Mike Cahill, of
the review bodies' secretariat.
So far there have been no resignations over government pay policy from the
40 people who sit on the review bodies, but the latest move could provoke
some reaction.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Tories unite to swallow Dr Clarke's bitter
medicine - Philip Stephens finds a new mood of accord in the Conservative
party as the chancellor's tax and spending measures are absorbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party has now to make up its mind. After the first-night
applause for Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget came the inevitable second, more
considered, thoughts.
After waving their House of Commons papers in delight as the package was
unveiled, Tory MPs began to look more closely at the implications.
The broad judgment remained the same. Mr Clarke had produced as clever a
political package as most could have hoped for to begin digging the
government out of that dreadful hole. There have not been many occasions
since the general election when MPs from the right and left of the party
could appear together on television and say roughly the same thing.
But it will not be painless. Higher income taxes, new levies on insurance
and air travel, higher petrol prices, and cuts in mortgage interest relief
are not the stuff of popularity in the Tory shires.
Nor will deep cuts in defence spending, further erosion of the contributory
principle behind the welfare state or cuts in student grants enhance the
government's popularity.
Defence cuts will be a problem and the rumblings were already apparent
yesterday. The nasty implications of the overall squeeze for local authority
spending and the level of the council tax will be obvious later today with
the announcement of next year's grant for local authorities.
All this is on top of the hefty tax increases already put in place by Mr
Norman Lamont.
The realisation is beginning to dawn. You cannot take another Pounds 18bn
off public borrowing - as Mr Clarke intends to by 1997-98 - without causing
political distress.
It hardly provides an auspicious background for the local elections next May
and the poll for the European Parliament a month later. Mr John Major's
future may well still hinge on the results.
But this is a take-it-or-leave-it Budget - as well as what Mr Clarke likes
to call a commonsense Budget. His pitch yesterday was that it was the last
dose of the bitter medicine that the Tory party must take to recover from
the malaise it has suffered since the general election.
If it is swallowed quickly, then the Pounds 50bn borrowing hole will begin
to disappear. Then the government has a chance at least of political
revival. Who knows, Mr Clarke's arithmetic might even allow for the odd 1p
off the basic rate of income tax before the next general election.
If on the other hand Tory MPs live up to their recent reputation as badly
behaved schoolchildren and recoil from the taste, then, as Mr Clarke might
put it, 'all bets are off'.
The chancellor is in confident form. The virtue of his Budget was that it
demonstrated grip and sense of purpose. He would not pretend that a ragbag
of measures had added to the rationality of the tax system. Nor that the
squeeze on public spending is risk-free. But he offered a plan with a
reasonable chance of reducing borrowing to tolerable levels without offering
too many targets for the disgruntled and rebellious on his own backbenches.
He decided early on after arriving at the Treasury that borrowing would have
to come down much faster. A public sector borrowing requirement of 8 per
cent of national income seemed too much like an accident waiting to happen.
The eventual balance between the Budget's spending cuts and tax increases,
however, was fortuitous. Mr Clarke's cabinet colleagues behaved more
responsibly than we have come to expect of them. The EDX cabinet committee,
charged with sharing out the smaller public spending cake, ran smoothly. It
left enough spare cash to defuse the threat of a backbench rebellion over
value added tax on domestic fuel.
Now the Clarke/Portillo double act - the One Nation chancellor and his
Thatcherite chief secretary - will come into play to sell the package.
Mr Clarke is dismissive of some of his deputy's more ambitious plans to
reduce the size of the welfare state. For months now Mr Michael Portillo has
been floating the possibility that people might opt out of the state pension
scheme or other universal benefits. The chancellor brushes that ambition
aside: 'A welfare state is a key part of the British tradition . . . I
regard the state pension as a key part of the welfare state.'
But Mr Clarke is smart enough to realise that Mr Portillo's credibility with
the unreconstructed Thatcherites on the Tory back benches will be essential
to maintain support for the Budget package. He will make the most of it.
While the chancellor soothes his natural supporters on the left about his
intentions towards the welfare state, Mr Portillo will try to persuade the
right that the true path of virtue puts fiscal rectitude first and tax cuts
second.
The signs last night were that it will be a powerful combination. For at
least 24 hours now the Conservative party has looked as if it has decided at
last that it wishes to remain the party of government.
The only problem is that the real world stretches beyond Westminster. Mr
Lamont and Mr Clarke between them have imposed the biggest tax increases in
modern history. The squeeze on spending will lead inevitably to a further
deterioration in the quality of public services.
When they queue for ever-less-frequent trains and see the hefty new
deductions from pay packets next April, voters may not take much comfort
from the fact that Tories judged it a clever package.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After the Budget: Markets bullish on interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial markets went into the Budget with a half-point cut in base
rates under their belts and strong expectations of another reduction - to 5
per cent - by early 1994.
The Budget further encouraged those expectations. The markets moved
vigorously in expectation of more monetary easing over the next few months,
despite cautious comments from the chancellor.
Long-dated government bonds rose by more than a point, continuing their
post-Budget rally. Yields at the long end have dropped 20 basis points since
Monday, reflecting City belief that long-term borrowing costs will continue
to fall.
But Mr Clarke was eager to give the impression that lending rates would not
come down rapidly. In a post-Budget briefing, he emphasised that any
decision to cut rates had to be based on a range of monetary indicators and
the medium-term inflation outlook.
'I was very glad to reduce interest rates last week but I won't do it again
unless and until I am satisfied the conditions exist,' he said.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, was similarly
cautious, dismissing the idea that public spending was a significant 'engine
of growth' and stressing that conditions were in place for 'sustained,
prolonged and rather unspectacular growth'.
However, the markets' behaviour expresses their conviction that the budget -
in taking an axe to the public sector borrowing requirement - opened the way
for sustainable, lower interest rates.
The Treasury forecast an underlying rate of 3.25 per cent for the retail
prices index excluding mortgage interest payments in the fourth quarter of
next year, a downward revision of its March forecast.
Even so, decisions about cuts in interest rates - based as they are on a
continuing assessment of monetary conditions - may be slower in coming than
the markets expect.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After the Budget: Portillo committed to lower taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday restated his
rightwing credentials in the wake of the Budget by setting out his
commitment to lower taxation.
Mr Portillo, a long-standing opponent of tax increases, was taunted by
Labour MPs during a debate on the chancellor's decision to increase taxes by
Pounds 1.7bn next year.
He said the government was determined to keep 'the most fundamental promise
of all, and that is to deliver sound public finances'.
Mr Portillo said it was essential for the government to reduce the burden of
debt interest payments and pave the way for lower taxation 'in due course'.
He reminded Conservative backbenchers that Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe
delivered a tax-raising Budget in 1981, which provided a base for the
economic recovery of the mid-1980s. 'I share the chancellor's judgment about
the speed at which he reduces the public sector borrowing requirement,' he
said.
'I congratulate him that he has been able to achieve the reduction he seeks
with so much emphasis on the control of public spending and so little on the
raising of taxes, particularly in the year ahead.'
Mr Portillo said that sustained lower taxation could be achieved only
through improved competitiveness, which required a fall in public spending
as a proportion of national income. 'We must reduce the proportion of
national income that is spent by the government,' he said. 'The chancellor
has pointed the way in which that is going to be achieved.'
Mr Portillo also dismissed Opposition claims that the Budget arithmetic
depended on 'smoke and mirrors' to balance government revenue and
expenditure.
He told Labour MPs: 'We are taking serious action to put right the problem.
You continue to pretend that no serious action needs to be taken.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Lecturers slam threat to cut holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lecturers in further education yesterday reacted furiously to 'interference'
in contract negotiations by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, after a
Budget that could mean they must accept halved holidays next year to gain a
pay rise.
Mr Patten said Pounds 50m was to be withheld from the Further Education
Funding Council, 'to be released when there has been satisfactory progress
within colleges towards more flexible contracts of employment'.
The council has funded colleges since they were removed from council control
in April.
It now seems certain that the government's public-sector pay policy will be
rigorously enforced, with lecturers receiving a pay rise next year only if
they sign a new 'flexible' contract drawn up by the Colleges' Employers'
Forum.
The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education
(Natfhe) is in a dispute with the forum over the contracts, which would cut
annual holiday entitlement from 14 weeks to seven and add an hour to the
working day.
Lecturers in seven colleges have voted to take action, while ballots are
pending in 14 others.
Mr Derek Betts, head of policy for Natfhe, said Mr Patten should not have
interfered in 'delicate' negotiations which are due to continue until the
end of this month. He added that the 3 per cent growth in further education
spending to fund a projected 8 per cent growth in student numbers was
'derisory'.
The Association for Colleges, representing principals, also reacted with
alarm. Ms Ruth Gee, chairman, said: 'Colleges were promised autonomy. The
increased degree of centralisation through the retention of Pounds 50m by
the funding council is not a move we welcome. Colleges are accountable for
their spending, and a degree of help from the government is essential.'
But Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the Colleges' Employers' Forum,
welcomed Mr Patten's move.
He said: 'Natfhe have brought this policy upon themselves. Their recent
round of strikes in defiance of the current negotiations with the employers
has delivered a clear message to the government. They have let down their
members and they have let down the sector, and they will live to regret
their strike action.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: IFS queries tough curb on public
expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is proposing a public-spending squeeze
far tougher than anything achieved in the 1980s, Mr Andrew Dilnot, director
of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said yesterday. Questions must be
raised, he said, about the feasibility and desirability of these plans.
One consequence, under plausible assumptions about local authority spending,
is that council tax bills from local authorities might have to rise by 15
per cent. Otherwise local authority pay or services would have to be
severely cut, he argued.
The government plans to increase the real level of the non-cyclical elements
in public spending, contained in the 'new control total', by a cumulative
amount of only 3.8 per cent between 1992-93 and 1998-99 (see chart).
By contrast, between 1980-81 and 1986-87, when Baroness Thatcher was prime
minister, - and Lord Howe and Lord Lawson were chancellors of the exchequer
 -comparable spending rose by 12.5 per cent in real terms.
The government also plans to reduce real non-cyclical spending by 1.3 per
cent between this year and next, before it starts to rise once more in line
with former chancellor Mr Norman Lamont's plans. Mr Dilnot said it was far
from obvious that such a cut was the best way to squeeze greater efficiency
out of the public sector.
Local authority spending could lead to political difficulties soon. Total
central government support for local authorities is set to decline by 2.4
per cent in real terms between 1993-94 and 1994-95.
Mr Michael Ridge of the IFS noted in particular, that the revenue from the
uniform business rate was set to decline from Pounds 11.6bn in 1993-94 to
Pounds 10.7bn in 1994-95, an 11 per cent fall in real terms.
Mr Dilnot was particularly critical of the government's failure to set
priorities. He said that too much emphasis was placed on control of
public-sector running costs, mainly pay, which is to be fixed in nominal
terms for three years, implying a real fall of almost 10 per cent.
Furthermore, government plans implied that the shares of national income
being spent on health and education would fall even though people would want
to spend a higher share of their growing incomes on them.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Unified Budget brings discipline to
cabinet negotiations - The new system helped the Treasury claw back power
and prestige within Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until this week Britain's new unified Budget had a generally bad press.
The decision by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, to combine public
spending and revenue decisions in one Budget late in the year, in place of
the Autumn Statement on spending and the March Budget covering taxation, was
criticised on several counts.
Many commentators, seeing government spending plans seemingly cast in stone
for three years at a cabinet meeting in July, condemned the new system for
apparently failing to allow debate within the cabinet on the relative merits
of spending and taxation.
There were fears that the new Budget could dampen consumer confidence ahead
of Christmas and, in current conditions, put recovery at risk. Some Tory
politicians, doubtless remembering past glories, argued that a November
Budget destroyed the possibility at some point in the future of the
government announcing big tax hand-outs and calling a snap spring election.
But yesterday, as the Treasury dusted itself down after the exertions of
Tuesday, both Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Portillo,
the chief secretary, said the unified Budget had helped cut public spending
below previously planned totals in the two coming financial years.
Talking to journalists, Mr Clarke admitted that he 'had a slight change of
mind' about the prospects for cutting public spending after taking over as
chancellor in May.
His first reaction was that the pre-set control totals for 1994-95 and
1996-96 were so tough that it was an achievement to win cabinet support for
them in July. As the autumn unfolded it became clear that it might be
possible to cut them further.
Mr Clarke said that putting tax and spending together into the same Budget
'had a big effect' in winning cabinet support. Although negotiations on
spending and taxation did not take place together, the unified Budget
created a 'context' in which spending ministers were aware that tax
increases would be a necessary alternative to any failure to control
spending. 'It got lower expectations into the system,' the chancellor said.
Mr Portillo said that the unified Budget, combined with the process of
negotiating changes to spending plans within a control total that could not
be breached, built 'a very strong collective willpower' among cabinet
members on the need for spending cuts. Discipline had 'become a habit', he
said.
However, Mr Clarke's ability to cut next year's control total by Pounds
3.6bn to Pounds 251.3bn and lop Pounds 1.5bn off the 1995-96 control total
to Pounds 263bn also owed much to the way the negotiations were carried out
between the Treasury and spending departments.
The chancellor began the Budget process at the end of July when, at a
meeting with Treasury ministers and senior officials at the government's
grace-and-favour mansion at Dorneywood, he determined to cut the PSBR by a
'substantial' proportion of GDP.
This decision guided the Treasury in its negotiations with the spending
departments. As the talks progressed it became apparent to the Treasury that
the overall numbers for tax revenues and spending were moving in relation to
each other, enabling Messrs Clarke and Portillo to push down the control
total for 1994-95.
They arrived at the final figure for next year's control total after
refusing to allow any transfer to departmental budgets from the Pounds 7bn
contingency reserve originally budgeted for the coming financial year. 'The
public spending was conducted as a zero-sum game without recourse to the
reserve,' commented one official.
When the Treasury halved the reserve for 1994-95 to Pounds 3.5bn, the Pounds
3.5bn of funds that were liberated were available to cut the control total.
This year's spending round was completed by the end of October, leaving Mr
Clarke a month to draw up his final tax plans.
The government's spending plans, unlike its tax measures, were settled
through a process in which the chancellor and the chief secretary shared
power with other senior ministers in the EDX cabinet committee chaired by Mr
Clarke. But the final outturn, with the control totals cut from previous
levels, will have clawed back for the Treasury some of the power and
prestige within Whitehall that was lost in September last year when Britain
was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism.
In these circumstances, Messrs Clarke and Portillo are unlikely to tamper
with the system of the unified Budget, which they believe helped the
Treasury achieve this success.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: MoD boosts army manpower ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence yesterday bowed to political and military pressure
by again raising its ceiling for future army manpower, and announcing plans
to buy up to 259 Challenger 2 tanks.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, also committed the government to
purchasing new helicopters for the RAF, including the UK-Italian EH101 in
which Westland is a partner, and announced that tenders were being invited
for up to seven new minehunters.
Mr Rifkind told the cross-party Commons defence committee he was setting up
a 'defence cost study' to look at ways of reducing the forces' spending on
back-up services to meet heavy cuts in the defence budget from 1996.
His statement to the committee was aimed at fending off criticism that the
financial cuts will damage the forces' fighting capability.
Combined cuts over the next three years are estimated at almost Pounds 1.8bn
which, compared with previous plans, is significantly larger than forecast.
Previous plans had only been made public for the first two of these years,
now reduced by Pounds 260m and Pounds 520m respectively. The Pounds 22.79bn
provision for 1996/97 is reckoned to be Pounds 1bn less than the MoD had
planned.
Plans for army strength have changed for the second time this year. In
February, Mr Rifkind agreed to increase the mid-1990s target total by 3,000
to 119,000. He said yesterday that front-line units would be strengthened by
a further 3,000 personnel.
In what he called 'an adjustment of priorities', allowance would be made for
an increase in overall manpower if these numbers could not be fully offset
by reductions in back-up jobs. Regimental mergers will not be affected.
A contract for additional Challenger 2 tanks is to be negotiated with
Vickers in preference to earlier plans for updating existing numbers of
Challenger 1. About Pounds 800m is thought to be budgeted for the order,
which is expected to be concluded next year.
Mr Rifkind said the army had opted for a 'smaller but unmixed' tank fleet
and hoped the decision would assist Vickers' exports. Some 300 Challenger 1
tanks in service since 1983 will become redundant.
Mr Rifkind also announced that contracts would be negotiated to provide the
RAF with a mixed support helicopter fleet of EH101s and Boeing Chinooks. The
EH101 has so far been ordered only for the navy.
Tendering for additional Sandown class minehunters will be restricted to UK
yards including Vosper Thornycroft which built the first five of the class.
Mr Rifkind said lower expectations for inflation and pay increases would
account for Pounds 570m of the planned budgetary savings while the transfer
of 69,000 service married quarters to a private-sector housing trust would
yield several hundred million pounds.
He said he was confident the budget targets for the next two years could be
reached without damaging front-line strength.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Whitehall faces accounting reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has pledged to introduce plans for a radically different
system of financial reporting for Whitehall during the first half of next
year.
During his Budget speech on Tuesday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
called the existing system of accounting in central government 'archaic' and
said far-reaching changes would be introduced.
The changes will move the public sector closer to the style and content of
information presentation used in the private sector and will echo reforms
being introduced by a number of other central and local governments around
the world. Mr Geoff Foster, a principal in the government services and
economics division of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'This means
government accounts will begin to feel more like those of the rest of the
world.'
He said it would permit the separate functions within each government
department to be held accountable, and distinguish the roles of agencies as
purchasers, providers and policymakers.
'At the moment they are all mixed up,' he said. 'The changes will allow
readers to see the real resources consumed in providing services and see how
they are allocated.' At the heart of the changes is a shift from 'cash' to
'accruals' accounting. This will show for the first time non-cash items such
as depreciation, superannuation and insurance.
There will also be wider changes with implications for the future management
of government departments.
They will focus on outputs and results and will require information on
assets, cashflows and service agreements.
The Treasury's proposals for accounting reform will consider how best to
present financial information in each department, and consider the
implications for public expenditure, planning and control. Discussions are
still at an early stage, but the intention is to implement the changes over
the next three to five years. They should trigger substantial fees for
accountancy consulting firms.
Yesterday's reform coincided with the arrival of Mr Andrew Likierman, a
professor at the London Business School, to take up his appointment as head
of the government's accountancy service and adviser on accountancy in place
of Sir Alan Hardcastle.
Mr Likierman has considerable experience within the public sector and has
written on accruals accounting.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Training moves up political agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's sudden interest in the idea of apprenticeships is not just
a new vocational training wheeze. When the prime minister recently
speculated about reinventing apprenticeships, after a decade in which they
have almost become extinct, the response from some employers was loud and
enthusiastic.
This is why, despite the strict public spending climate, the money available
for the training of school-leavers is expected to rise substantially over
the next three years. This increase is only partly the result of falling
numbers.
Currently the department spends about Pounds 700m a year on Youth Training
(YT), mainly in the form of subsidies to employers to take on
16-to-18-year-olds, all of whom are guaranteed a YT place. But the training
offered by employers to the 210,000 YT trainees is highly variable and YT is
still regarded by many employers and trainees as a way of keeping
unemployment down.
The apprenticeship scheme would, in effect, be a higher grade YT, subsidised
with a training credit carried by the trainee. But such is the opprobrium in
which YT is held that one training expert said yesterday: 'If the apprentice
idea is seen as YT Mark 2 it will kill it.'
The idea is that the employer and the trainee would sign an 'apprenticeship
compact' setting out what each expected from the other. The compact would
include targets for achieving National Vocational Qualifications level three
 -the vocational equivalent of A levels - as opposed to the lower NVQ level
two which YT trainees are supposed to attain.
The Department of Employment is coy about saying exactly how much money will
be made available for apprenticeships when it is offered to school-leavers
in 1995, although it does say that the money per trainee is likely to be at
least double the YT level.
'There will be a substantial increase on what YT trainees are currently
getting but it also depends on how many employers are interested and how
much they are ready to put up,' said one official. 'Employers are saying
they want this, so we are saying: 'We'll put up if you'll put up',' the
official added.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, and his officials see the
apprenticeship scheme as an economic rather than an unemployment measure,
designed to fill the big gap between basic YT training and academic
qualifications. 'This is about increasing the number of technicians and
first line supervisors with a modern apprenticeship system - not like the
old time-restricted, male only, trade-union dominated apprenticeships,' says
Mr Hunt.
There are two main doubts about the plan. First, whether the training credit
scheme, open to all school-leavers in 1995, will be a sensible way to fund
it, and second, whether the government and employers can convince young
people and their parents that it is a better option than staying on at
school or aiming for university.
The government believes it has hit on something which will attract broad
political and industrial support. Since the war Britain has lagged behind
countries such as Germany in high-skill vocational qualifications. But in
the 1980s the number of apprenticeships slumped as the government abolished
most of the industry training boards. Britain currently has about 250,000
people who classify themselves as undergoing an apprenticeship, compared
with about 2m in Germany.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: M25 targeted for 'shadow tolls'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has targeted Britain's busiest motorway, the M25 around
London, as the first project for which it proposes to pay 'shadow tolls' to
private investors.
Under the scheme, investors would be repaid out of public sector funds
according to the number of cars using the road rather than by tolls paid
directly by motorists.
Ministers had been opposed to 'shadow tolls' because they felt that
insufficient risk was being taken by the private sector. However, in
Tuesday's Budget speech Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced a
policy change.
The Transport Department intends to hold 'early discussions with the
construction industry and others to identify appropriate schemes'.
Most of these other schemes are expected to involve widening and
improvements rather than new building. The first contracts could be awarded
within 18 months.
In the longer term, the government intends to install an electronic system
for charging motorists for using motorways.
The Treasury dropped its opposition to shadow tolls in return for the
transport department accepting such a system of electronic charg-ing.
Spending on the national road network is planned to fall from Pounds 2.09bn
in this financial year to Pounds 1.96bn in 1995-96. Companies interested in
taking part in shadow toll schemes would be asked to bid for the tender to
widen a particular motorway. The company that asked for the smallest payment
from the government for the traffic using its lanes would normally be given
the contract.
Construction companies, which have been lobbying the government to accept
shadow tolling, welcomed the change of heart but said they would need to see
the small print of the plan before acclaiming it.
Plans to proceed with involving private companies in a Pounds 400m-Pounds
600m modernisation of the west coast mainline railway from London to
Scotland were announced by the government yesterday. Companies are to be
asked 'within the next few days' to bid for a contract to draw up
performance specifications for the line, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, said.
Once detailed specifications have been agreed, the private sector will be
invited to bid late next year to carry out the work on the track and
signalling. Bids will be sought late next year.
Meanwhile, Sir Wilfrid Newton, London Transport chairman, said yesterday
that government funding would meet only half of the money needed to maintain
and modernise London's Underground system over the next three years.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Lilley spells out reform of benefit system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, yesterday outlined the
government's plans to rein in the growing cost of welfare spending by
reforming the structure of the benefit system.
In one of the most wide-ranging reforms of welfare policy for many years, Mr
Lilley told the Commons how he plans to reform the distribution of a range
of state subsidies including invalidity benefit, housing benefit and support
for the unemployed.
He also announced plans to combat benefit fraud, and gave details of how the
state pension scheme will be equalised for men and women at age 65.
The reforms were intended to 'strengthen our welfare state, to adapt it to
modern needs, and to make it affordable into the next century'. The social
security system must not outstrip the nation's ability to pay for it, he
said.
Mr Lilley revealed that the total cost of compensation for the imposition of
value added tax on fuel - one of the most contentious issues for the
government - would amount to Pounds 1.25bn a year by the time the measures
fed through. Over three years, the total additional help for VAT on fuel
would be Pounds 2.5bn.
One of the key reforms is a change in invalidity benefit, claims for which
have doubled over the past 10 years.
The government yesterday published a consultation document on a tougher
medical test to accompany a new incapacity benefit to replace invalidity
benefit. This will focus only on medical issues - the current test takes
into account such factors as an applicant's age and skills.
The new tests mean the end to the system by which family doctors decide
whether a prospective claimant is fit for work.
They set out 16 categories of disability and claimants gain severity scores
for various tests. For example, on walking, the severity scores range from
25 points for 'cannot walk at all' to 3 points for 'can walk 400 yards
without stopping'.
On manual handling, severity scores include 25 points for being 'unable to
handle a book so as to read it'; 9.5 points for 'cannot pick up and carry a
5lb bag of potatoes in either hand separately'; 4.5 points for 'cannot lift
and push an unladen wheelbarrow'.
Incapacity benefit, unlike invalidity benefit, will be taxed. This change
will not apply to existing claimants when the new scheme is introduced, but
they will be subject to the new medical test when their cases are reviewed.
Mr Lilley said that plans to combine unemployment benefit and income support
into a new jobseeker's allowance would also reduce the bureaucracy and
anomalies affecting the present scheme.
Applicants will receive the allowance for six months, rather than 12 months
under existing unemployment benefit. Long-term unemployed people will become
eligible for a jobfinder's grant of Pounds 200 to help cover the costs of
resuming employment.
The government also announced that it would create a Fraud Board to step up
prevention and detection of fraud.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After the Budget: West coast rail bids to be invited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to proceed with much-delayed moves to involve private companies in a
Pounds 400m-Pounds 600m modernisation of the west coast mainline railway
were announced by the government yesterday.
Private companies are to be asked 'within the next few days' to bid for a
contract to draw up performance specifications for the line, which runs
between London and Glasgow, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary,
said. That work is expected to take nine months.
Once detailed specifications have been agreed, the private sector will be
invited to bid late next year to carry out the work on the track and
signalling. Work on the line will start in 1995 and take between seven and
10 years.
The companies concerned will earn a return on their investment in the form
of service payments from Railtrack, the company which has been set up to own
and manage British Rail's track and signalling.
The level of fees will depend on the quality and reliability of the service
they offer and be subject to penalties and bonuses.
Involving private companies will take no longer than if the project had been
financed from public funds, Mr MacGregor said.
But the work will have to take into account the need to keep services
running on the line. No government funding will be put into the project.
Government funding will meet only half of the money needed to maintain and
modernise London's Underground system over the next three years, Sir Wilfrid
Newton, London Transport chairman, said yesterday. Despite Department of
Transport efforts to spare it the worst of spending cuts in the Budget, the
Underground will still not be given enough money to maintain 'a decently
modern metro', he said.

FT  02 DEC 93 / After the Budget: Whitehall faces accounting reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has pledged to introduce plans for a radically different
system of financial reporting for Whitehall during the first half of next
year.
During his Budget speech on Tuesday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
called the existing system of accounting in central government 'archaic' and
said far-reaching changes would be introduced.
The changes will move the public sector closer to the style and content of
information presentation used in the private sector and will echo reforms
being introduced by a number of other central and local governments around
the world.
Mr Geoff Foster, a principal in the government services and economics
division of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'This means government
accounts will begin to feel more like those of the rest of the world.'
He said it would permit the separate functions within each government
department to be held accountable, and distinguish the roles of agencies as
purchasers, providers and policymakers.
'At the moment they are all mixed up,' he said. 'The changes will allow
readers to see the real resources consumed in providing services and see how
they are allocated.'
At the heart of the changes is a shift from 'cash' to 'accruals' accounting.
This will show for the first time non-cash items such as depreciation,
superannuation and insurance.
There will also be wider changes with implications for the future management
of government departments.
They will focus on outputs and results and will require information on
assets, cashflows and service agreements.
The Treasury's proposals for accounting reform will consider how best to
present financial information in each department, and consider the
implications for public expenditure, planning and control.
Discussions are still at an early stage, but the intention is to implement
the changes over the next three to five years. They should trigger
substantial fees for accountancy firms in consulting service.
Yesterday's announcement of the reform of accounting presentation coincided
with the arrival of Mr Andrew Likierman, a professor at the London Business
School, to take up his appointment as head of the government's accountancy
service and adviser on accountancy in place of Sir Alan Hardcastle.
Mr Likierman has considerable experience of accounting issues within the
public sector and has written on accruals accounting.
Accruals accounting is already used by the New Zealand government. In
Australia, it has been introduced at federal level and for the state
governments of New South Wales and Victoria. The US and Canadian authorities
are both considering its introduction.
In the UK, versions are already in place in many of the executive agencies,
in local authorities and in former state companies.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Benefits fraud rises to Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Detected fraud against local authorities has risen from Pounds 17.5m to
Pounds 25m over the past three years, the Audit Commission says today in a
report.
Most of the fraud is committed by people abusing the benefits system,
particularly for housing and local tax benefits. Benefit fraud accounts for
96 per cent of the 54,000 cases, and now makes up Pounds 20m of the total.
Corruption is relatively rare, with only 143 proven cases in the past three
years. But the commission stresses: 'Even the suspicion of corruption can
damage trust in authorities, and all suspicions must be rigorously
investigated.'
The commission is setting up a fraud unit to spread information on how to
fight the problem and has published a management paper for authorities. It
recommends wider use of information technology to cross-check information
held by different authorities.
Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the commission, said: 'At present people are
right to have confidence in the administration of local government funds.
But local government is facing many changes and today's high standards could
be at risk.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Patten backs Flowers recommendation for longer academic year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday endorsed plans to lengthen the academic year, while
lecturers suggested that the Budget's drastic measures to curb expansion in
student numbers rendered it irrelevant.
An independent committee headed by Lord Flowers, the former vice-chancellor
of London University, recommended that universities should switch to an
academic year of three 15-week semesters with each student studying for only
two of them each year. This would allow a rise of 50 per cent in student
numbers. Even if student numbers did not expand, the committee would still
recommend the longer year because the reduction in the time spent at
universities by students would save money.
The first semester would start early in September. While Lord Flowers said
A-level results would be needed only two or three days earlier than they are
produced now, lecturers' unions said that three or four weeks was more
realistic.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said: 'The report builds on current
trends in higher education by responding to the needs of its customers for
more flexible patterns of teaching and learning. By outlining a new
structure for the academic year it offers welcome new flexibility for
students and staff, as well as increases in the numbers who can be taught
while maintaining high quality.'
Education department sources made clear that any question of raising extra
funds from students through 'graduate taxes' or income-tax-related loans had
been abandoned for at least three years. Means-tested grants will be cut by
10 per cent a year with loans from the government-funded Student Loans
Company increased to compensate. Expansion in numbers would cease for three
years, with the government predicting a fall of 3.5 per cent next year.
Dr Ken Edwards, chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals, attacked Budget clause which cut the tuition fees universities
receive for each applicant recruited. He said: 'These plans do nothing to
satisfy the enormous and growing demand for higher education and run counter
to the government's philosophy of responding to market forces.'
He said the government should aim to provide 40 per cent of the population
with higher education (up from the current 32 per cent). Individual
institutions must now decide whether to adopt the new year.
A statement by the Natfhe and AUT lecturers' unions said: 'This government
has yet again pulled the rug out from under the feet of those trying -
however misguidedly - to plan for the sector.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Welsh Office accounts queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Audit Office has qualified the Welsh Office accounts on roads
expenditure for the fifth successive year. It has also qualified its
accounts on training programmes, where it estimates payment errors of Pounds
5.96m, and on the community charge.
Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, says in a report published
today: 'Significant amounts of advances (to local highways authorities) made
before March 1991 are the subject either of overdue claims or of claims
bearing qualified audit certificates.' He concluded there was 'material
uncertainty as to the final amounts properly chargeable'.
Sir John said he was encouraged by Welsh Office systems improvements which
meant advances were now being recorded satisfactorily.
The Welsh Office responded by saying there had never been any suggestion of
misappropriation of funds in any NAO report on roads. It said that only
Pounds 4m of claims out of over Pounds 430m paid between 1974 and 1990 were
still to be resolved.
Responsibility for training in Wales transferred from the Department of
Employment to the Welsh Office in April last year. Mr Bourn said weaknesses
in financial control by the employment department in previous years had
largely continued in Wales in 1992-93.
'Erroneous payments to Training and Enterprise Councils continue at
significant levels,' he said. The main problems included lack of documentary
evidence by the Tecs to support claims and arithmetic errors.
The Welsh Office said it had set up a team to monitor improved controls.
On the community charge, Mr Bourn said the Welsh Office had made erroneous
overpayments in March 1993 to four authorities totalling Pounds 963,000. The
Welsh Office said the money had since been recovered.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Councils' rules on homeless may be relaxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering making it easier for local authorities to
fulfil their duty to house the homeless by allowing them to place people
permanently in accommodation now categorised as temporary.
The move - aimed partly at providing a stimulus for the private rental
sector - would form part of the sweeping reform of homelessness legislation
announced by Sir George Young, housing minister, at October's Conservative
party conference.
The government's preliminary proposals are expected to be published early
next year.
One effect of the plans might be to clear the way for homeless lone mothers
to be housed in alternative accommodation such as hostels instead of council
houses or flats.
The government may seek to portray such a move as removing an unjustifiable
incentive for parents to turn unmarried pregnant teenagers out of the family
home in full knowledge that they would go to the top of the list for council
flats.
In his conference speech, Sir George said there was a need to distinguish
between providing a safety net and a device for jumping the housing queue.
He said: 'By guaranteeing speedy access to secure accommodation at low
rents, the law rewards those who come under it and penalises those who
don't'
Curbing the availability of council housing for lone mothers has become a
popular call on the Conservative right. Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, used his conference speech to signal that moves in this direction
were a better way of combating the breakdown of the family than changing the
welfare system.
Local authorities are now allowed to house the homeless in temporary
accommodation such as private rental units or bed-and-breakfast accomodation
while they are waiting for a permanent dwelling such as a council house or
flat to become available.
Ministers have been anxious for some time to enlarge the private rented
sector. Sir George believes it is a 'paradox' that British pension funds
have shown willingness to invest in high-quality rented flats in Paris and
New York but not in Britain.
Sir George announced in October that he was discussing action needed to
secure the investment of 'serious long-term money' in rental accommodation
with pension funds and insurance companies.
Of individuals who rent accommodation in Britain, about three-quarters do so
from a local authority or housing association.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Levitt sentence defended: Fellow group director is fined
Pounds 750 and disqualified for 18 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The judge in the trial of Mr Roger Levitt yesterday defended his decision to
impose a community service order on the former financial services salesman.
Mr Justice Laws gave further detailed reasons for the sentence while
imposing a Pounds 750 fine on the fourth defendant in the case, Mr Alan
McNamara.
Mr McNamara, a former commercial director with the Levitt Group, was also
disqualified from being a company director for 18 months.
The judge stressed that the sentences were strictly in line with the charges
to which Mr McNamara, along with Mr Levitt and Mr Mark Reed, the Levitt
Group's former managing director, had pleaded guilty.
These related only to the deception of Fimbra, the regulatory body that
over-saw the Levitt Group. Fimbra officers had been given false documents,
including fee-notes, invoices and minutes of a board meeting, which all
purported to show that Pounds 21m injected into the company by Mr Levitt had
been earned as a result of advisory work.
The judge told Mr McNamara yesterday: 'You do not fall to be sentenced for
cheating anybody out of any money whatsoever - as I hoped I had explained
last week.'
In imposing the service orders on Mr Levitt and Mr Reed, the judge said the
fraudulent trading they had admitted to occurred in the closing stages of
the Levitt Group saga. 'The persons, including banks and private individuals
who had lost money as a result of the affairs of the business, had already
lost it by the time false documents were put up to Fimbra,' he said.
Mr McNamara pleaded guilty last week to recklessly providing false and
misleading information to the regulators under Section 201 of the Financial
Services Act. The judge said this was a less serious offence than that
admitted by Mr Levitt and Mr Reed since it did not involve dishonesty.
The judge said Mr McNamara was in a different category from Mr Levitt and Mr
Reed. He had been 'swept along' by others, notably Mr Levitt.
However, he rejected the argument by Mr Howard Godfrey QC, for Mr McNamara,
that a conditional discharge was the appropriate sentence. Mr McNamara's
offence was too serious, he said.
'The regulatory authorities cannot do their work for the protection of
investors, whose individual funds may be modest, if they are unable to rely
on information given to them because it turns out to be wholly false,' he
said.
Mr McNamara was originally charged with fraudulent trading alongside Mr
Levitt and Mr Reed. This was reduced to breaching the Financial Services Act
as part of the Serious Fraud Office's plea-bargaining.
Had this been the original charge against Mr McNamara he would have pleaded
guilty to it three years ago, Mr Godfrey told the court.

FT  02 DEC 93 / BT to lose control of issuing numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications will lose control of the allocation of phone
numbers early next year under plans announced yesterday by Oftel, the
industry regulator.
The announcement came as Flextel, a small Cheshire-based company, launched a
personal numbering service which it claimed was the first such service to
charge only the calling party.
Flextel is offering subscribers personal numbers they can take with them
when they move. Telephone subscribers who move generally need to change
their number unless they are remaining in the same area.
Oftel said yesterday it would set up a numbering administration unit to
start work in January, taking over responsibility for allocating blocks of
numbers and 'nationally significant codes'.
The move is in line with Oftel's policy of divorcing control of the national
numbering system from BT to ensure fairer competition with Mercury and the
increasing number of new operators.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said: 'Numbering is an essential
element in the development of a competitive market in new telephone services
in the UK.'
He said BT had tried to be even-handed in allocating numbers, but the new
arrangement would 'reduce the risk of premature disclosure of commercially
sensitive plans for new services requiring a number allocation'.
BT said the plans were 'as expected', and that it had 'long been reconciled
to losing responsibility for numbering'.
Of more concern to BT are investigations of its directory inquiry service
and directory advertising service, which includes Yellow Pages. The Office
of Fair Trading is examining the first and Oftel the second.
In both cases competitors claim that BT gains an unfair advantage from
possession of the national numbering database. Reports are expected early
next year.
The report on directory advertising could lead to a reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Flextel, which holds a government telecommunications licence, is gearing its
service to small and medium-sized businesses without private networks, which
are anxious not to have to change their numbers when moving offices.
Personal numbers offering low-cost portability on a day-by-day basis are
likely to be on offer within a year. A service is already on offer in the US
and at least one private company, Numbering Viewed Worldwide, is developing
a commercial service for the UK.
The main hurdle is finding a mechanism for users to update a database linked
to the phone network that does not require a long call to an operator.
Oftel predicts that personal numbers will become 'an area of rapid growth',
and is encouraging entrepreneurs into the field. Cambridge Cable also offers
a service.
Mr William Goodall, Flextel's managing director, said one in seven phone
numbers was changed each year, so personal numbers would be 'a powerful tool
enabling businesses to plan for both expansion and office relocation without
risking the loss of customer contact'.
The bulk of the cost of Flextel's personal numbers fall on those phoning
them, who have to pay a premium rate of 15p per minute in peak hours. All
calls, including local calls, are charged at that rate. There will be an
annual fee of Pounds 24 per number.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Welsh pit told to double its output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday intensified its drive for efficiency by announcing
plans to close its mine service centre at Ashington, Northumberland, and
demanding a doubling in production from a reduced workforce at its Tower
colliery in Wales.
The corporation said it would have to review its position at Tower if the
targets were not met.
Unions at the pit, previously considered one of the 19 core collieries,
interpreted this as a threat to close it.
Unions in the north-east were told that British Coal wanted to close the
Ashington centre next February following the rapid contraction of mining
capacity throughout the country. Closure would mean the loss of 212
engineering jobs.
Two service centres would remain: one in nearby Tursdale and the other in
Bestwood, Nottinghamshire.
A recent decision to close Wearmouth colliery has left just one deep mine in
the north-east - at Ellington. That has reduced work for the Ashington
centre, which repairs and refurbishes underground vehicles and tunnelling
equipment. British Coal said falling demand for coal had also pushed
workloads down.
At Tower, near Hirwaun, Mid Glamorgan, managers said they wanted 37
redundancies from the 240-strong workforce and a doubling of production to
11,000 tonnes a week by Christmas.
British Coal said no bonus payments would be made unless the manpower and
production target was met.
Mr Tyrone O'Sullivan, National Union of Mineworkers branch secretary, said
that no more men wanted to take redundancy.
Meanwhile, miners at Silverdale pit in Staffordshire were voting on whether
to accept the colliery's planned closure and take redundancy payments of up
to Pounds 44,000 each. A vote in favour of closure was expected.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Bristol waterfront project wins extra funds in Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Extra funding in the Budget has cleared the way for Bristol Development
Corporation to develop its 30-acre flagship site next to Temple Meads
railway station.
Regeneration of the waterfront site close to the city centre - being
marketed as Quay Point - has been held up because the corporation has been
unable to afford a crucial 8.5-acre parcel of land owned by Royal Life
Insurance.
The corporation is seeking a partner to develop a 2m sq ft commercial centre
at Quay Point, including offices, hotel and leisure and retail space. It
described the site as a Pounds 400m gateway project with the potential to
create 8,000 jobs.
A compulsory purchase order for the Royal land was confirmed by the
government in January last year, and an attempt by Royal to have the order
rescinded was rejected by the High Court last July. However, the corporation
lacked the money to proceed with the purchase. It is enacting the order in
the light of the Budget announcement of additional government funding.
The amount of the grant has not been disclosed because the compensation for
Royal has to be negotiated. But the funding is understood to be above Pounds
2m.
Mr Miles Collinge, chief executive of the development corporation, said
yesterday: 'The timing couldn't be better. The market is continuing to move,
and move very positively for us. We are receiving very significant
speculative offers.'

A total of 100 jobs will be created in Wolverhampton following the decision
by MK Electric of Edmonton, north London, and Merlin Gerin, a French-owned
company in Telford, to form joint-venture company Ajax Electrical. Ajax will
invest Pounds 5.6m in a new electrical switchgear factory.
The investment has been sweetened by Pounds 650,000 of regional selective
assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry. Wolverhampton City
Challenge provided Pounds 100,000 to refurbish an existing factory of
Federal Electric, a Merlin subsidiary, next door to the proposed Ajax plant.
This safeguards 84 jobs.

FT  02 DEC 93 / M&amp;S signs big power contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer has signed a contract with Northern Electric for the
supply of electricity to 160 stores, around half M&amp;S's stores around the
country, David Lascelles writes.
The deal, worth more than Pounds 10m a year, is one of the first of a new
generation of contracts intended to take advantage of the next step in the
de-regulation of the electricity market next year.
The contract represents an estimated 200GWh of electricity a year. It takes
effect next April 1, when anyone with demand of more than 100kWh a year can
shop around for electricity rather than be tied to the local supplier. Only
consumers of 1MWh or more have this freedom now.

FT  02 DEC 93 / ICI wins engineering prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI yesterday won the Royal Academy of Engineering MacRobert Award, the UK's
premier prize for innovation in engineering, for developing a new
refrigerant to replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Andrew
Baxter writes.
The Pounds 50,000 award, which attracted more than 50 entrants, was
presented at the Science Museum in London by the Duke of Edinburgh.
It recognises ICI's achievement in developing KLEA 134a and opening three
production plants worldwide - a Pounds 250m investment that has given the
company a leading share in a worldwide market potentially worth more than
Pounds 1bn.
ICI brought together engineers and chemists for the project in 1987, using
teamwork to accelerate the development process. Its latest plant, in Japan,
opened last week only five years after the team identified the refrigerant's
molecule.
The engineers sharing the award were (from top) Frank Maslen, John Scott,
team leader Denis Henderson and Rachel Spooncer.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Fuel duty changes raise fears for EU energy plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget may have jeopardised European Union plans to ratify the global
warming treaty agreed at last year's Rio Earth Summit, Mr Tim Yeo,
environment minister, has acknowledged.
At the two-day EU environment ministers' meeting beginning today in
Brussels, the UK will reaffirm its opposition to a co-ordinated Europe-wide
tax on fuels. The steady annual increases in fuel duties announced in the
Budget emphasise the UK's determination to go its own way in setting taxes,
Mr Yeo said.
Proposals for a co-ordinated energy tax, weighted towards high-carbon fuels,
have been at the heart of the EU's plans for meeting its commitments under
the Rio convention. The EU pledged to bring carbon dioxide emissions,
implicated in global warming, back to 1990 levels by 2000.
For the EU to ratify the convention, its member countries need to agree a
plan for cutting carbon emissions.
'It is inconceivable that the Treasury will change its mind,' Mr Yeo said.
The Treasury has opposed a carbon-energy tax because of fears that it would
put a heavy burden on industry. 'It will be interesting to see if the EU can
find a way through that,' Mr Yeo added.
If the meeting fails to agree on a plan to cut carbon emissions, the UK may
ratify the Rio treaty on its own, he said.
The government has indicated that it might support a 'framework' which
allowed countries to adopt a carbon-energy tax if they chose.

FT  02 DEC 93 / End to unlimited liability at Lloyd's urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior figure at Lloyd's of London yesterday cast doubt on the insurance
market's 300-year-old tradition of unlimited liability for its Names - the
individuals whose assets support the market.
It follows the successful admission to the market of investment trusts and
companies backed by corporate investors in the past few months.
Mr Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman of the market, said Lloyd's should next
year 'stand back and consider' whether it should admit new Names with
unlimited liability.
'You shouldn't have two classes of shareholder,' said Mr Hiscox, who has
headed the market's successful drive this year to attract corporate capital.
Sixteen investment trusts and companies have already raised more than Pounds
800m in capital and are eventually expected to provide more than Pounds 2bn
of capacity (the amount of premiums syndicates are allowed to underwrite)
next year.
Individual Names, who are theoretically liable for losses down to their last
personal possessions, still provide the bulk of the market's capital, with
about 19,000 underwriting Pounds 8bn next year. But their numbers have
declined sharply in the past few years.
More than 13,000 Names have resigned or been forced out of the market by
losses of more than Pounds 5bn since 1989. In spite of rising premiums and
good prospects for profitability, only about 50 new Names have so far signed
up to join Lloyd's for 1994. This decline is expected to continue during the
rest of the decade, partially reflecting the gradual rise in the average age
of Names, which is now 58.
Unlimited liability 'causes too much grief', insisted Mr Hiscox. 'Every 30
years or so we have blown Names out of the water; I just don't want anybody
in future to have to sell their homes to meet losses.'
Many existing Names are expected to choose participation on a limited
liability basis as soon as they are able to transfer liabilities incurred by
syndicates with 'open years'.
Syndicates leave years of account 'open' because of uncertainty about the
scale of future claims. Lloyd's aims to transfer several billion pounds of
liabilities stemming from 1985 and earlier years of account to a new
reinsurance company which it hopes to form within the next two to three
years.
Most Names, however, will participate at Lloyd's in members' agents pooling
arrangements or Mapas, a kind of unit trust allowing them to reduce risks by
spreading their investments across a much wider range of syndicates than is
possible for typical individual Names.
Mr Hiscox said Lloyd's agents might seek to convert Mapas into limited
liability companies after the formation of the new reinsurance company.
Separately, Lloyd's yesterday put the final touches to a settlement offer
for loss-making Names, expected to amount to about Pounds 900m. The offer
will be sent to over 21,000 Names and made public next week.
The Names, who are claiming Pounds 3.5bn in compensation from their agents,
will be offered varying amounts of compensation depending on their
syndicates and their chances of legal success.
It is understood that as much as two-thirds of the amount of compensation -
between Pounds 500m and Pounds 600m - could be channelled to Names who were
members of Feltrim and Gooda Walker syndicates, allowing for settlement at
the rate of about 50p in the pound.
Compensation will also reflect other factors. Names involved in legal action
are expected to be offered greater sums, especially if they have court
dates. The worst-hit Names, who were in heavy loss-making syndicates, should
also receive above-average compensation.
Finance for the settlement will come from three main sources.
Errors-and-omissions insurers, which cover agents against legal awards for
negligence, are expected to pay up to Pounds 400m while Lloyd's is expected
to make a contribution of at least Pounds 400m from its central fund. Some
Lloyd's agents and brokers will also contribute.

FT  02 DEC 93 / DTI official admits he was 'cavalier' on Iraq exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government official agreed yesterday that he had been 'cavalier' in
overriding the Foreign Office when he approved a temporary export of machine
tools to Iraq.
The admission was part of a catalogue of omissions and failures to take
action over warnings about the military uses of British machine tools which
emerged at a hearing of the Scott inquiry into arms-related exports to Iraq.
Mr Anthony Steadman, former head of the Department of Trade and Industry's
export licensing unit, told the inquiry that he had not waited for Foreign
Office approval before he decided to license the export of machine tools for
an exhibition in Baghdad.
Lord Justice Scott said to him: 'As far as the DTI was concerned, the
importance of trade was more important than concerns of the FCO.' Mr
Steadman agreed, but said he had approved only a temporary licence.
'It was fairly cavalier, wasn't it?' said Lord Justice Scott. 'Yes,' replied
Mr Steadman, adding 'I didn't wait for the FCO to give their decision,
that's true. I couldn't wait because the export would have been out of
date.'
Lord Justice Scott told him: 'You could have waited. The export would have
been missed but you could have waited.'
Mr Steadman said he had circumvented procedures on an earlier occasion when
he had approved the temporary export of other machine tools to a trade fair
in Baghdad in 1989. 'It did seem a sensible approach, given the cumbersome
nature of the control procedures we had to go through.'
Refusal to allow the shipments would have damaged British industry, he said.
Mr Steadman earlier admitted to the inquiry that he had approved machine
tool licences after receiving a clear intelligence warning that they were
for the Iraqi missile programme. He said he could not recollect seeing the
report even though he knew a copy had been made for him.
He blamed the omission on 'intense and relentless' pressure of work in the
unit. Lord Justice Scott told him he did not understand why the licence
application had not been dismissed out of hand at the outset.
The hearing was told that Mr Steadman failed to notice warnings in a series
of Intelligence reports, sometimes because he had not seen the reports and
sometimes because he had not noticed the relevant information.
In one case, he said, he had failed to spot the name Matrix Churchill - the
company at the centre of many of the reports - even though it had been
spelled out in block capitals.
He told Ms Presiley Baxendale, counsel for the inquiry, that he had kept one
intelligence report, contrary to normal practice. But he had not noticed
Matrix Churchill information in it.
'I know it seems a conundrum but I didn't pick it up,' he said.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Standards tightened for auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants must be able to show that they have met adequate auditing
standards if their fees are questioned by a client under ethical rules
approved yesterday by their professional body.
The rules place the onus on auditors to demonstrate that they have met audit
regulations, especially those governing quality control.
The details were approved by the three councils controlling the ethical
committees for the chartered accountancy bodies for England and Wales,
Scotland and Ireland.
The rulings fall substantially short of more radical options considered by
the committee, including placing a lower limit on the level of fees that can
be charged.
The widespread practice of 'low-balling' or predatory, intensely competitive
pricing for audits has raised concerns among smaller practitioners that the
quality of auditing was impaired. The committee said it found no evidence of
this happening.
'There is nothing inherently wrong with keen pricing, but that doesn't
change the requirement to do an effective audit,' said Mr Jock Worsley,
chairman of the committee.
The new ethical rules call for transparency in fee levels before a contract
begins, and forbid accountants from using contingency fees in audit work or
other reporting assignment with professional opinions.
A separate ruling, to strengthen independence, states that any partner must
not work on the same audit for more than seven years at a time, and then
have a five-year 'quarantine' before taking charge again.

FT  02 DEC 93 / On patrol in the heart of republicanism: Jimmy Burns joins
British troops on their daily duties on the streets of west Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace seemed far removed from the minds of the soldiers of 42 Marine
Commando yesterday as they made their way nervously through the back streets
of republican west Belfast.
Around midday, a company of about 40 men split into teams, some on foot
patrol, some in armoured Land Rovers, and zigzagged through the Springhill
estate, not far from the home of Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams.
The Catholic west of the city is an area of high unemployment and entrenched
political allegiances. The area resonates with symbols. A republican flag
flies over a building site; a mural proclaims: 'You can kill a
revolutionary, but you can't kill a revolution' over portraits of Che
Guevara and James Connolly, one of the republican leaders executed by the
British after the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin.
Along the street of flags and murals, the marines struck attitudes of
disciplined aggression, covering the area in as short a time as possible in
the sights of their automatic rifles.
Very briefly, there was time for tourism. A soldier photographed a colleague
in front of a memorial in memory of 26 dead local IRA volunteers and other
civilians who had died at the hands of the security forces and loyalist
paramilitaries. The memorial, dedicated to 'Irish freedom,' had been
unveiled by Mr Adams.
The streets were otherwise deserted except for a young man and his child
standing at the open door of his small terraced house. 'This is normal for
us. Not a day goes by when the Brits don't come round. I wish they'd just
leave us alone,' the man said.
One of the marines took an imaginary pot shot through his rifle sight and
confessed to being bored. 'It's been too quiet and we've got the rest of the
day left,' he said. Another tried to make conversation with an old woman but
a barking dog intervened and he beat a tactical retreat, uttering a loud
expletive.
The marines have only recently begun their latest Northern Ireland tour,
joining more than 10,000 other troops in the province.
Security sources said yesterday the threat from the IRA and loyalist
paramilitaries remained high in the absence of a political settlement in the
province. They believe much hinges on the outcome of the Dublin-London peace
initiative.
It is widely accepted that the IRA will only declare an extended ceasefire
if the Dublin talks lead to the making of political concessions to the
nationalist community.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Customers report banking errors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A fifth of bank and building society customers have suffered mistakes in
standing orders or direct debits, says a poll published in Which? the
Consumers' Association magazine.
The magazine says that the poll, which involved more than 3,500 people who
responded to a random postal survey, showed that the code of banking
practice had not succeeded in improving services.
The most prevalent complaints were of money being incorrectly taken from an
account, reported by one in seven; and of incorrect charges being imposed,
reported by one in eight.
Midland Bank and National Westminster Bank are rated worst for overall
satisfaction, while Abbey National, First Direct, Girobank and Yorkshire
Bank are rated best.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Lucas moves will cost up to 280 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas, the international engineering group, yesterday started a series of
factory moves which will mean the loss of up to 280 jobs in the Cheltenham
area of Gloucestershire.
The group announced that manufacture of engine control systems at what was
the Dowty Fuel Systems plant in Cheltenham would move to factories in
Birmingham. That will create 100 new jobs in Birmingham and the 380
Cheltenham employees will be encouraged to apply.
The Cheltenham factory will be used by Lucas Bryce, which manufactures
diesel fuel injection systems. The lease on the Lucas Bryce plant at
Hucclecote, Gloucestershire, will expire soon and its 330 employees will
move to Cheltenham.
However, the new Lucas plant at Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, is expecting to
recruit more staff.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Labour averts northern breach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of a breakaway by Labour's northern region from the national
party receded yesterday when the area's representatives met the party's
national executive committee, Chris Tighe writes.
The region, fearing a loss of its identity, had fiercely opposed plans to
cut costs by merging it with the Yorkshire region, and had threatened to
ballot its 30,000 members later this month on the proposal.
The NEC said yesterday that, after its meeting with representatives of the
northern and Yorkshire regional executives, agreement had been reached on
the merger.
The meeting had agreed that a merged executive committee would be elected by
a regional conference and that an interim committee, with 20 members from
each area, would draw up draft rules for the new region.
Labour's head office said: 'The meeting recognised the need to conform to
the Labour party rules and to annual conference decisions.'
The northern representatives said: 'The NEC has moved away from
confrontation.'

dealing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said
yesterday in Belfast that documents relating to secret contacts between the
government and the IRA were 'positive proof of the double dealing and lying
of the secretary of state', Jimmy Burns writes.
He also alleged that the IRA had threatened to kill him because of his
opposition to its possible involvement in the peace process. Security
sources said they had no evidence of that.

FT  02 DEC 93 / MMC recommends curbs on Stagecoach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled yesterday that the acquisition
by Stagecoach Holdings, the fast-growing bus company, of a bus depot in
Lancaster could operate against the public interest.
It recommended that Stagecoach should give undertakings limiting its ability
to retaliate against new bus operators entering the market.
Perth-based Stagecoach said the commission had not found evidence that it
had restricted competition, and it would be happy to hold discussions with
the Office of Fair Trading. The operations affected by the report produced
revenues of less than Pounds 2m out of the company's total Pounds 175m
turnover.
The reference to the monopolies commission arose after Stagecoach bought a
bus depot and 12 buses from Lancaster City Transport in August for Pounds
700,000. Stagecoach, which feared that a bid for the entire company would
prompt a monopolies reference, offered more for the depot than other bidders
had offered for the entire company, and the municipally owned bus company
subsequently went into voluntary liquidation.
The OFT will seek undertakings from Stagecoach that if it reduces fares or
increases its bus frequencies to fight off competition, it will not
subsequently raise fares or reduce services if the competitor withdraws. It
will also attempt to gain an agreement that it will not introduce a more
frequent service than a new competitor on any route.
Mr Derek Scott, Stagecoach finance director, said: 'We are very frustrated
at the inquiry because we have been investing and we have not put up fares.
The undertakings they want are for the most part not unreasonable.
'We are unhappy about not being able to run a more frequent service than
competitors. That seems to be re-regulating what has been de-regulated.'
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission report is the fourth on Stagecoach in
three years and OFT is also investigating allegations of anti-competitive
behaviour by the company's Fife Scottish Omnibuses subsidiary.
Mr Scott said: 'It seems a lot, but there are 400 bus company complaints a
year to the OFT. We have 6 per cent of the bus market and regard it as an
occupational hazard.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Mayhew takes responsibility for mistakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, accepted 'full
ministerial responsibility' last night for a series of errors in secret
documents released by the government this week detailing exchanges with
Provisional IRA leaders.
The government admitted to 18 errors in the 39 pages of papers. Most of the
mistakes were in a single document: a nine-paragraph message to Provisional
leaders on March 19 - the eve of the Warrington bombing - setting out the
government's conditions for beginning talks.
A version of this message was also released this week by Sinn Fein. The
effect of last night's corrections is that the government now admits the
Sinn Fein version was accurate in virtually every respect.
Late last night, in a letter to Northern Ireland MPs and parliamentary
spokesmen, Sir Patrick said the errors had arisen from the speed with which
the dossier of messages had had to be completed.
Many of the mistakes involved the omission or substitution of a single word
but in the government's report of a message from Provisional leaders, sent
on August 14, a sentence was left out. This read: 'The purpose of a dialogue
about peace is to bring all organised violence by all parties to the
conflict to an end.'
As many as seven of the errors occurred in a single paragraph of the March
19 message to the IRA. The government attributed these to a mistaken
transcription from a late draft of the document. There have been suggestions
that the government's original version of this paragraph appeared to confirm
that Provisional leaders initiated the chain of messages by asking for the
government's advice on how to bring the Northern Ireland conflict to a
close, while the Sinn Fein version cast doubt upon it.
The government's original version included the wording: 'We note that what
is being sought at this stage is advice.' It has now accepted that the Sinn
Fein version - 'What is being sought at this stage is advice'  - is
accurate.
Provisional leaders have denied that it made any request for advice.
Sir Patrick said: 'Since my statement in the House on Monday, allegations
have been made by the IRA leadership that it was the British government who
initiated the exchange of messages and was seeking advice. These allegations
are entirely false. The first message was the one received on 22 February
originating from the IRA.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Assets frozen over metals bribe claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An Isle of Man court yesterday froze assets of five companies alleged to be
involved in bribing Russian officials to rig the New York strategic metals
market.
The court hearing was part of litigation begun in New York in 1990 by
Interlink Metals and Chemicals, of New York, against ICD Merchandise,
registered in Delaware. ICD trades in New York and has been renamed
Industrial Products.
Interlink claimed Dollars 75m damages in the New York court for loss of
business. It claims that ICD sought to monopolise the New York market in
Russian metals by paying bribes to agents of Russian trading companies. The
bribes were paid through a web of British Virgin Islands companies set up in
and administered from the Isle of Man, Interlink claims.

FT  02 DEC 93 / British Coal tells Welsh pit to double production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday intensified its drive for efficiency by announcing
plans to close its mine service centre at Ashington, Northumberland, and
demanding a doubling in production from a reduced workforce at its Tower
colliery in Wales.
The corporation said it would have to review its position at Tower if the
targets were not met.
Unions at the pit, previously considered one of the 19 core collieries,
interpreted this as a threat to close it.
The moves come ahead of the government's privatisation of the industry, with
publication of a bill possible today.
Unions in the north-east were told that British Coal wanted to close the
Ashington centre next February following the rapid contraction of mining
capacity throughout the country. Closure would mean the loss of 212
engineering jobs.
Two service centres would remain: one in nearby Tursdale and the other in
Bestwood, Nottinghamshire. The Ashington centre was opened in 1959 and
specialises in servicing and repairing engineering equipment for the mining
industry.
A recent decision to close Wearmouth colliery has left just one deep mine in
the north-east - at Ellington. That has reduced work for the Ashington
centre, which repairs and refurbishes underground vehicles and tunnelling
equipment. British Coal said falling demand for coal had also pushed
workloads down at Ashington.
At Tower, near Hirwaun, Mid Glamorgan, managers said they wanted 37
redundancies from the 240-strong workforce and a doubling of production to
11,000 tonnes a week by Christmas.
British Coal said no bonus payments would be made unless the manpower and
production target was met.
It said it wanted Tower to succeed and it maintained that the pit had a
future if it could perform at required levels.
Mr Tyrone O'Sullivan, National Union of Mineworkers branch secretary, said
no more men wanted to take redundancy because there were no other jobs in
the area, an unemployment blackspot.
Meanwhile, miners at Silverdale pit in Staffordshire were voting on whether
to accept the colliery's planned closure and take redundancy payments of up
to Pounds 44,000 each. A vote in favour of closure was expected.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Gore in appeal to Latin America
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Vice President Al Gore called yesterday for a new partnership between the
US and Latin America based on open trade, respect for sovereign rights and
co-operation on common social and environmental problems.
He said President Bill Clinton would invite to the US next year all the
democratically elected heads of the countries in North, Central and South
America and the Caribbean to a western hemisphere summit. The meeting 'will
codify our shared principles and set forth a vision of economic and cultural
progress'.
Mr Gore's speech to 5,000 Mexican business people was billed as a
significant statement by the Clinton administration on US-Latin American
relations after congressional approval of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
The proposed summit would find 'creative solutions to regional problems',
including promoting trade and investment, expanding democratic political
culture, and protecting the environment throughout the hemisphere, the
vice-president said.
However, Mr Gore did not propose any new free trade agreements in Latin
America, which may disappoint some countries wishing to follow Mexico's
path. Instead, he merely said that the US's 'commercial and financial future
will become increasingly integrated with the Americas, not only with Mexico
and Canada, but with Central America, Caribbean and South America'.
'Nafta was a starting point for dealing with the common challenges of the
Americas,' of which free trade was only one element, Mr Gore argued. He
hailed the side agreement on labour and environment, describing it as a
'revolution in itself' and called for similar co-operation throughout the
hemisphere.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey suggests big oil zone near Falkland Islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early findings from seismic surveys conducted this year in the south
Atlantic around the Falkland Islands suggest a possibility of finding oil
across a zone 25 per cent larger than the British North Sea.
The British Geological Survey, which advises the island's government, said
its reading of preliminary data from the two surveys suggested the region
had a good potential for finding oil. Confirmation, however, would require
exploratory drilling.
Mr Nigel Fannin, principal geologist in the survey's petroleum geology
group, based in Edinburgh, said the data suggested a sedimentary basin of
potential oil-bearing rocks of 200,000 sq km around the island, compared
with 160,000 sq km of such formations in the British North Sea. 'We have
been very encouraged by what we have seen,' he added.
The two seismic surveys concentrated on areas to the south, west and the
north of the islands, where the water is shallower than to the east.
Mr Fannin said the rocks and geological formations both appeared similar to
those of the North Sea. Other conditions would also be similar: the water
was 500 metres deep or less, and the sea state and weather would be similar
to that experienced in the northern zones of the North Sea.
However, Britain's Foreign Office played down the significance of the
findings. It said full seismic data would only become available next year
and many further steps would be needed before it was known whether
commercial quantities of oil existed.
Mr Fannin said the data should be complete by early next year, and the
survey expected to be in a position to advise the island government on
licensing for exploratory drilling by next summer.
A licensing regime has yet to be established and remains a sensitive issue,
with the sovereignty of the islands still disputed between Britain and
Argentina. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, has kept open the
possibility of co-operation on oil exploration.

<TEXT>
One of Argentina's nine Supreme Court justices resigned yesterday after a
week of intense political pressure on him to quit.
Mr Rodolfo Barra said he left because of Argentina's 'process of
constitutional reform'. One of five justices appointed by President Carlos
Menem after he took office in 1989, he was close to the government.
Turmoil in the Court is due to demands by the ruling Peronist and opposition
Radical parties that at least three court justices resign.
On Tuesday, Mr Antonio Boggiano resigned as court president after five
colleagues said they no longer recognised his authority, after charges that
he had tried to replace a court ruling against the central bank with a
favourable one.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Airlines agree truce in LA airport fees row
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A potential shutdown of Los Angeles airport was averted yesterday when
representatives of the airport authority and the big US airlines reached a
temporary deal over higher landing fees.
The airlines agreed to pay the airport's new fees under protest until a
final judgment by the courts or federal agencies on whether the new fees
were reasonable.
Los Angeles airport authorities had announced a tripling of their landing
fees this summer, and had threatened to shut down the airport at midnight on
Friday for airlines that refused to pay up.
With the exception of Qantas, all the main US and foreign airlines had
balked at the higher fees, and a lawsuit against the increase is waiting
before a federal court.
Both sides were summoned by Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation
secretary, for talks in Washington this week aimed at averting disruption of
the US's third busiest airport, which serves around 120,000 passengers a
day.
Under the terms of the deal signed yesterday, the airport agreed not to
raise its fees again before July next year and to repay the higher fees if
the court judgment goes against it. Even after tripling its fees, Los
Angeles will be far from the most expensive airport in the country. The
increase to Dollars 1.56 per 1,000lb, or about Dollars 900 for a Boeing 747,
still leaves Los Angeles charging far less than the three New York area
airports or Chicago's O'Hare.
Mr Richard Riordan, Los Angeles's new mayor, promised in his election
campaign to raise money from the airport to pay for more police officers.
But he has backed away from this, which would be an illegal diversion of
funds because Los Angeles received federal grants to help pay for capital
improvements at the airport.
US airlines pay more than Dollars 3bn a year in landing fees, and, although
this makes up only about 4.5 per cent of their costs, some carriers fear
that other airports country could be encouraged by Los Angeles's example to
raise their fees.
A separate case, in which airlines complained that higher fees at Grand
Rapids airport in Michigan violated a federal law requiring them to be
reasonable, was argued this week before the US Supreme Court.
The airlines, which are already in shaky financial condition after years of
rising costs and cut-throat competition, are afraid of being milked by
cities anxious for new revenue sources.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Purchasing index points to US growth
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of rising confidence in the US manufacturing sector and a strong
gain in construction spending yesterday provided further evidence of buoyant
economic growth in the current quarter.
The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the manufacturing outlook - rose
to 55.7 per cent last month against 53.8 in October.
The new orders component of the index soared to 64.8 per cent, one of the
strongest results since the Reagan boom of the late 1980s.
This was the third consecutive monthly gain in the overall purchasing index
and the strongest reading since the beginning of the year, when factory
output was lifted by a surge of demand at the end of 1992.
Figures above 50 per cent indicate that the manufacturing economy is
expanding.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose by
2.5 per cent in October and 9.8 per cent compared with the same period last
year. This was the sixth consecutive increase in construction spending, the
longest string of increases for seven years.
Trade figures yesterday confirmed that the speed-up of growth is causing a
deterioration of the US external account. In the third quarter, the
merchandise trade deficit rose 5.5 per cent to Dollars 34.4bn (Pounds 23bn),
the biggest quarterly deficit for six years.
Officials also announced a slight revision to third-quarter growth figures.
Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent rather
than the 2.8 per cent previously reported. Growth of consumer spending and
business investment was revised up, but the positive impact on growth was
more than offset by upward revisions to the US trade deficit.
'The figures confirm that this quarter will be very strong,' said Mr Bruce
Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, the US financial services
group. He predicted growth at an annual rate of '4.5 per cent or perhaps
even higher'.
Many forecasters, including Mr Steinberg, expect the pace of growth to
moderate early next year to an annual rate of 3 per cent or slightly less
because consumer spending has outstripped growth of personal incomes,
pushing the savings rate to a near record low.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Chile may have to cut 1994 budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE may have to cut its 1994 budget because of the continued sharp impact
of the international downturn, according to Mr Juan Villarzu, the man widely
expected to be named finance minister after general elections on December
11.
Mr Villarzu, economic co-ordinator for presidential frontrunner Mr Eduardo
Frei, said the next administration would 'probably be obliged to revise the
1994 budget which was made when copper prices were higher. . . and with the
expectation of 5 per cent growth'.
Chile had planned a 5.4 per cent budget increase next year to Dollars 11.4bn
(Pounds 7.6bn).
Weak prices for Chile's principal exports - copper, cellulose and fishmeal -
meant that growth next year would probably be around 4 per cent, he said.
The next administration would seek to implement a 'slightly different
monetary and fiscal mix' by bringing in a temporary tax, possibly on petrol,
which would allow an easing of interest rates. Such a combination would
encourage investment and slow the appreciation of the peso.
Mr Villarzu is likely to pursue broadly similar policies to those of the
current finance minister, Mr Alejandro Foxley, a fellow Christian Democrat.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL pressure on Argentina's Supreme Court to resign intensified
yesterday following Mr Antonio Boggiano's resignation on Tuesday as court
president.
Mr Boggiano quit after five of his colleagues said they no longer recognised
his authority, following accusations by two fellow justices in September
that he had tried to replace a court ruling against the central bank with a
favourable one. However, he will remain a member of the nine-member court.
The ruling Peronist and opposition Radical parties are demanding that at
least three court justices resign immediately.
A purge of the Supreme Court is one of the Radicals' conditions for
supporting reform of the constitution, which is needed to allow President
Carlos Menem to stand for re-election when his six-year term ends in 1995.
Mr Eduardo Duhalde, the influential Peronist governor of Buenos Aires
province, said yesterday that their resignations 'are overdue, there is no
longer any space for anything else'.
Last week, three cabinet ministers demanded resignations in the court. Mr
Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said all nine should be impeached by
Congress. He has publicly accused two justices of corruption.
Supreme Court justices are appointed for life to insulate them from
political interference. But their reputation has been severely damaged by
repeated allegations of corruption, incompetence and submission to the
government.
Nonetheless, there is widespread belief that a purge could further undermine
the rule of law.
The Radicals argue that the Supreme Court lost its independence when Mr
Menem appointed five pro-government justices shortly after he took office in
July 1989.
Mr Raul Alfonsn, the Radicals' leader, demands that the government force the
resignation of at least three of the court justices as a gesture of good
faith before Friday's Radical party conference, which is to ratify talks
with the government.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Canada set for gradual recovery: OECD survey warns that
prospects depend on US growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada can look forward to a gradual economic recovery next year, with
rising productivity and subdued inflationary pressure, according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's annual survey of
the Canadian economy.
But the survey warns that prospects depend heavily on the pace of recovery
in the US, which is by far Canada's biggest export market, and on success in
coming to grips with towering federal and provincial budget deficits.
The OECD forecasts 3.9 per cent real growth in gross domestic product in
1994, up from 2.7 per cent this year and 0.7 per cent in 1992. The recovery
has so far been based mainly on strong export growth. This is forecast to
continue in the year ahead, but should be accompanied by substantially
higher household spending and business investment and a strong housing
market rebound.
Inflation, measured by the GDP price deflator, is projected at a modest 1.8
per cent in 1994, compared with 0.8 per cent this year. However, the
unemployment rate will drop only marginally to 10.9 per cent from 11.2 per
cent.
The OECD cautions that 'heavy government borrowing has left the economy
vulnerable to changes in financial market sentiment, leading to increased
short-term interest rate volatility and higher long-term credit costs'. It
adds that continuing fiscal discipline in the public sector 'appears crucial
to the maintenance of easier monetary conditions and the achievement of
lower long-term rates'.
A feature of Canada's recent performance has been a surge in productivity,
with businesses adjusting remarkably quickly to such structural changes as
the 1989 free trade agreement with the US, privatisation and tax reform.
'The better domestic cost performance along with exchange-rate depreciation
has significantly improved international competitiveness,' the OECD
concludes.
But the report says that the prospects for long-term growth would be
enhanced by further reforms, including the dismantling of inter-provincial
trade barriers, lower farm subsidies, and improved education and healthcare
systems.
Canada's generous social-security net is also singled out as a source of
concern. The new Liberal government has indicated in recent weeks that it
plans to overhaul the entire social security system.

Los Angeles serves as an important hub for flights between the US and the
Asia-Pacific region, with around 2,000 take-offs and landings a day.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Falkland Island oil hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Foreign Office yesterday played down the significance of a survey
suggesting a good chance of finding oil in the South Atlantic around the
Falkland Islands.
Mr Phil Richards of the British Geological Survey, which carried out a
seismic survey around the islands this year, said yesterday: 'The potential
is good all around the islands. But we will not know exactly how much oil is
there until someone starts digging.'
The zone around the islands with the type of geological formation most
likely to contain oil was 50 per cent larger than the British section of the
North Sea, the survey said.
But the Foreign Office said any new information could only be preliminary,
since full seismic data would only become available next year. It further
emphasised that seismic studies in themselves could not ensure the presence
of oil.
A round of exploratory drilling and more seismic tests were planned. Only
after drilling could the presence of oil be guaranteed.
Even then, it would be uncertain whether oil was available in commercial
quantities, particularly given the difficult conditions in the waters around
the islands, whose sovereignty is disputed between Britain and Argentina.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said this year that co-operation on
oil exploration with Argentina remained a possibility. Oil company
executives have said large-scale investment of oil development in the region
would require a more explicit agreement on sovereignty than exists at
present.

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Franco-German telecom alliance to be
extended

France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the French and German state
telecommunications operators, appear set to announce ambitious plans for
further co-operation next week. They will reveal their intentions next
Tuesday in Brussels, the same day that European Union telecommunications
ministers meet in the Belgium capital.
Both companies have an existing alliance, called Eunetcom, to provide 'one
stop' services for multinational companies.
Industry observers believe they are planning to extend their co-operation,
most likely by merging core activities in spheres other than domestic
'voice', including international services and data communications. A future
exchange of equity stakes also appears to be a possibility.
Although the Franco-German telecom plans are not on the ministers' agenda
next week, any significant merging of activities by the two operators will
require the approval of the European Commission for its competition
implications.
In Bonn, Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry and telecommunications minister
and Mr Wolfgang Botsch, his German counterpart, yesterday gave their support
for increased co-operation in a joint statement issued during the
Franco-German summit.
The two ministers said the alliance 'could lead to an exchange of capital as
soon as the two companies changed their legal status'. Deutsche Telekom is
slated for privatisation next year. The French government, however, has
delayed plans to change the legal status of France Telecom in the face of
strong trade union opposition.
Both ministers also defended the co-operation plans, saying that 'they
respected the rules of competition'.
However, other European telecommunications operators, notably British
Telecom, are concerned that the alliance will isolate them and impede fair
competition as the EU's telecommunications markets are liberalised over the
next five years.
AT&amp;T, the US telecoms giant, has been engaged in talks with the French and
German companies about a possible relationship with its 'Worldsource'
international venture launched this summer. But the current plans are not
believed to include the US carrier in the immediate future.

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Mitterrand and Kohl in Gatt pledge

<TEXT>
France and Germany yesterday pledged themselves to make 'real efforts' to
promote a compromise agreement in the Gatt trade negotiations in the coming
days, insisting that both the European Union and the US had to make
concessions.
President Francois Mitterrand of France and Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl
both agreed that compromise was essential, and that no country - meaning
France - should be isolated in the negotiations.
Speaking after the latest Franco-German summit meeting in Bonn, Mr Kohl
warned that a deal was necessary, not only to guarantee the future of free
world trade, but also for the future cohesion of the European Union.
At the same time Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, repeated
his insistence that an initial deal must be done by next Monday, to give him
time to present it to the French national assembly. He also warned that any
agreement must be unanimously accepted by the 12 members of the European
Union: 'There is no question of any member state being isolated,' he said.
'If anything is isolated, it would be the European Union itself.'
The words of both Mr Mitterrand and Mr Balladur suggested a willingness on
the part of France to make concessions, provided the US government gave
ground on the key questions of farm trade, films and television.
'We must keep on making real efforts to reach a compromise that will allow
the signing of an international agreement,' Mr Mitterrand said at a press
conference after the summit. 'We are ready to make these efforts, but we are
not alone. This must include the US.'
Mr Balladur said the Gatt negotiations amounted to the first great test for
the European Union, after the Maastricht treaty came into effect. The union
had to show it was capable of acting as a single international entity.
The French premier, whose own political reputation is most at stake if the
Gatt deal is rejected in France, said he needed 'eight to 10 days' after
agreement on an initial text between European and US negotiators, to present
the document to both the French president and the parliament. That would
mean a deal by next Monday, to allow French approval by the US Congress
deadline of December 15.
On his return to Paris yesterday, Mr Balladur told parliament that there was
still no progress on France's demands on a new world trade organisation,
market access, agriculture, steel, culture, and textiles. He rebuked members
of his own coalition who have urged him to show more courage in doing a Gatt
deal, but hardly in terms that ruled out compromise.
Mr Kohl was anxious not to make any statement which could be seen as
interference in the heated French domestic political debate, but merely to
stress the importance Germany still attaches to a deal.
'It is our common goal to ensure that Gatt reaches a positive conclusion,'
he said. 'For this it is necessary that both sides, on this side and on the
other side of the Atlantic, show they are capable of compromise.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Japan seeks protection from discriminatory
deals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan yesterday sought multilateral protection from pressures, mainly by the
US, to strike bilateral deals on trade and investment discriminating against
Tokyo's interests.
A senior Japanese official yesterday asked the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development to issue a declaration 'prohibiting bilateral
negotiations by any OECD country' leading to one-sided trade and investment
measures.
Mr Noburu Hatakeyama, special adviser to the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (Miti), complained to an OECD conference on 'the globalisation
of industry' of recent US pressure to get Japanese electronics companies to
buy up to 20 per cent of their semi-conductors from foreign sources, and for
Japanese-owned car companies in the US to favour parts from US-owned
manufacturers over other sources.
Mr Hatakeyama, a former vice-minister of Miti, said he hoped that a
ministerial OECD meeting next year would take a general stance against such
discriminatory pressures. He claimed quite wide support from other
delegations, but acknowledged some like the US regarded it as 'idealistic'.
OECD declarations have no binding force on member countries. 'But if we keep
stressing the importance of prohibiting bilateral negotiations which result
in very discriminatory decisions, ultimately this kind of political
declaration will get support, and bit by bit many OECD countries, including
the US, will abide by it,' Mr Hatakeyama said in an interview.
The Miti adviser also praised Mexican legislation, passed in the wake of US
approval of the North American Trade Association, to give other countries
the same freedom to invest in Mexico as the US and Canada will have through
Nafta.
As part of a new round of US-Japanese talks, begun in July while Mr
Hatakeyama was still vice minister of Miti, 'the US has recently asked us to
issue guidelines to our industry established in the US to purchase parts
from 'traditional' - by which they mean American - suppliers, rather than
Japanese auto component manufacturers established in the US,' he said.
Washington, he complained, was even asking Tokyo to favour the import into
Japan of car parts from US companies over those which could be supplied by
Japanese-owned companies in the US.
If successful, the Uruguay Round will help remove certain 'trade-related
investment measures' such as those which require investors to promise to
export a certain share of their production, and remove discrimination in the
service sector. 'But this Gatt round will not deal with discrimination in
industrial or agricultural investment', he said. 'That is a big hole, which
perhaps the OECD can help fill'.

SA Express, the fledgling South African regional airline, has ordered 12 de
Havilland Dash-8 aircraft from Bombardier, the Canadian transport group.
The order, worth USDollars 150m, (Pounds 100.6m) marks both a commercial and

of sanctions against Pretoria.
SA Express is a new airline 51 per cent owned by black South African
interests, led by Thebe Investment Corporation, and 49 per cent by Lardel
Holdings of Ontario. A group of Canadians, with experience in regional
airline operations, will initially form the senior management.
SA Express has an option on an additional six turboprop Dash 8s. De
Havilland, which is jointly owned by Bombardier and the government of
Ontario, has sold a total of 392 Dash 8s, of which 359 have been delivered.
The Sydney Steel plant in north-eastern Nova Scotia has won a new lease on
life with the help of China and its over-burdened rail system, Robert
Gibbens writes from Montreal.
After months of negotiations, MinMetals, a Chinese government trading
agency, will help keep the basic steel and rail-making plant alive for a
minimum of three years in partnership with the provincial government. Most
of the heat-hardened alloy steel rail being produced will go to China.
Sydney Steel, known as Sysco, was taken over by the province in 1967 after
Hawker Siddeley Canada threatened to shut it down because of heavy losses.
The provincial and federal governments have since spent more than Dollars
1bn to modernise it and cover operating losses.
In 1990 it was converted into a high-technology rail making operation for
nearly CDollars 300m, (Pounds 152.2m) and providing jobs for 700.
Sysco lost CDollars 279m after a special charge in the year ended March 31,
1993, but expected a small operating profit this year. Basic steel output
will be 233,000 tonnes.
MinMetals and the province will each provide CDollars 15m in operating funds
for the next three years.
The province will assume Sysco's debt and pension obligations. If Sysco
remains profitable, MinMetals will buy it outright for CDollars 30m cash at
the end of three years and undertake to keep it open, the government said.
The deal is due to be signed by the end of next month.

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Farmers fear being forced to leave the
land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European farmers' organisations warned yesterday that, unless important
changes were made to the proposed Uruguay Round farm deal, a third of
Europe's 10m-11m farmers would be forced to leave the land.
The Committee of Agricultural Organisations (Copa) and the General Committee
for Agricultural Co-operation (Cogeca), grouping farmers' organisations in
all 12 EU member states, said in Geneva that the current draft agreement on
farm trade reform would more than double the amount of productive land left
fallow, halve farm incomes and cripple the rural economy.
Their complaints were echoed in more strident form by French farmers' groups
and the European Farmers Co-ordination, representing small farmers across
Europe, who plan a big demonstration in Geneva on Saturday against the
proposed reforms.
However, Mr Hans Kjeldsen, president of the International Federation of
Agricultural Producers which brings together farming organisations from over
50 countries, said yesterday that a failure of the Uruguay Round this time
would be 'a disaster for farming worldwide' because of the risk of increased
protectionism and trade war.
At the same time, farmers needed reassurance that a Gatt accord would
sustain 'a more dynamic and sustainable role' for agriculture. 'If we want
to maintain rural life, we need viable farmers,' he added.
Both Mr Kjeldsen and the representatives of Copa and Cogeca were in Geneva
to see Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, amid speculation that the
meeting in Brussels yesterday and today between Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade
commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, could produce a
revised farm accord.
Mr Augusto Bocchini, Copa president, said yesterday that the present draft
Uruguay Round farm deal would go well beyond reform of the EU's Common
Agricultural Policy and unilaterally penalise European agriculture. It would
cut European exports of farm products by about a third, on average, and lead
to a considerable increase in imports, while excluding the EU from
participating in any expansion of world farm trade. Total compensation
payments now envisaged under CAP reform would have to double to maintain
present income levels for those farmers still managing to survive, he said.
Echoing demands made by France for changes in last year's US-EU Blair House
accord on farm subsidies, Copa and Cogeca are urging a reordering of the
timetable for cuts in the volume of subsidised exports, so that the impact
is felt more evenly over the six-year transition period.
The two organisations also want an indefinite 'peace clause' that would
prevent the US and others from challenging EU farm policies during the
reform process, effective safeguards against price and currency fluctuations
and restraints on imports of cereal substitutes.

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: A Round sceptic seeking a square deal - A
US official negotiating a Gatt package which once he did not believe in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeffrey Garten, the new US Commerce Department undersecretary for
international trade, will make his debut as a trade negotiator in the
Uruguay Round talks in Geneva tomorrow in what he deems 'the most inclusive
international negotiation ever attempted'.
An avowed believer in 'an open market-oriented trading system', his brief
will be to defend the US anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws,
considered by many US trading partners as little more than covert
protectionism. He will also oversee the interests of two of the most
protected US industries - textiles and steel.
One of the Clinton administration's 'innovative pragmatists', Mr Garten was
taken on to help move the US Commerce Department from the bureaucratic
backwaters to the cutting edge of trade and economic policy. No one who
knows him doubts that this genial former merchant banker has the mental
agility for the job.
Mr Garten argues that the US trade laws are essential to assure American
companies that 'there is a degree of fairness in the international trading
system, especially since the US market is more open than others'. The Round
cannot win congressional approval if the trade laws are in any way 'diluted'
and, besides, the amount of trade effected is 'an insignificant portion of
imports' - less than 5 per cent.
Mr Garten cut his negotiating teeth on Latin American debt restructuring in
the early 1980s. He has also arranged dozens of deals between Asian and
American companies as director of Shearson Lehman Brothers' Japan office.
Mr Garten has also written about foreign and economic policy in leading US
newspapers and foreign affairs magazines and in a book on past and future
relations between the US, Japan and Germany.
At times his views have got him into trouble. It was while he was at
Shearson Lehman and the Uruguay Round was being launched that he expressed
doubts about the Round in the Wall Street Journal. This proved to be a
public embarrassment to one of the Round's greatest backers, Mr Jim
Robinson, then chairman of American Express, which owned Shearson Lehman.
Against all the optimism of the times (the Round was to be completed in 1990
after four years of talks), Mr Garten argued that the negotiations would be
too complex, involved upheaval in too many domestic policies and had little
to do with US trade problems at the time.
'The big trade issues had to do with currencies,' he says. 'The dollar was
just coming down. There was talk about de-industrialising the US. The Round
would not deal with the issues that were killing us.'
All that has now changed, he he says, since the Clinton administration has
set the course for budget deficit reduction, worker retraining, technology
policy and efforts to stimulate investment. Now the Round provides a link
between trade and domestic economic and social policies, he says.
Furthermore, a successful Round will bring into the trading system in a more
integral way the developing countries, which hold the greatest growth
potential for US companies. 'That means the emerging markets have enhanced
obligations. They also have to have a fair shot at access to the
industrialised country markets.'
As for Europe, Mr Garten sees it as a diminishing opportunity for US
companies. Writing in Foreign Policy magazine last summer he foresaw the
loss of American leverage in negotiations with Europe 'as a result of
Europe's reduced need for American military protection' and as
intra-European trade rises faster than transatlantic commerce.
'There is no chance that Europe will cede its national markets willingly,'
he adds. 'A strong defensive response, characterised by slower-than-usual
approach to trade liberalisation and selective but heavy government
intervention is more likely.'
For all its desirability, with all the momentum going for a deal, Mr Garten
does not under-estimate the difficulties. 'The number of trade-offs among
different categories is potentially mind-boggling,' he says. 'You have so
many countries involved . . . at different stages of development. You are
negotiating apples and oranges and pears.'
In the end, he insists, the Clinton administration will not take a deal that
falls short of its goals. 'It would be a mistake to think the administration
will sign an agreement simply because it's the Uruguay Round and this has
been a central part of economic strategy and we see trade liberalisation as
a major part of job creation.
'There are some very major obstacles to cross; it will take a Herculean
effort to do it.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US-Russian trade in manufactured products
soaring
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US-Russian trade in manufactured products is soaring this year, while
American trade agencies are being flooded with requests for export finance
and insurance, according to Mr Jeffrey Garten, the US Commerce Department
undersecretary of international trade.
As co-chairman of the Business Development Council, a US-Russian Commission,
Mr Garten was in Moscow yesterday helping to dismantle obstacles to US trade
and investment.
In the first eight months of this year, US exports to Russia rose by 165 per
cent to Dollars 1bn.
While Russia's exports to the rest of the world declined, its American
exports leaped by 287 per cent to Dollars 729m. US enthusiasm for business
ties to Russia, strong when the cold war was winding down, began to cool
when the difficulties of doing business became apparent. However, encouraged
by US government programmes, more than 400 American companies have set up
shop in Russia, Mr Garten said.
Applications for trade insurance to the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation are 'off the charts', Mr Garden said.
The same is true for financing from the US-Export Import Bank and the Trade
and Development agency, which finances feasibility studies.

The Gallup Organisation, the world's largest survey research group,
announced yesterday that it had become the first western company to receive
a licence to operate a market research company in China.
Until now, commercial market research in China has been conducted from
abroad by contracted research or small consultancy companies.
The new operation, Gallup China, is a joint venture between Gallup, which is
based in New Jersey, and Carrie Enterprises, a state-owned but US-managed
import-export company. With headquarters in Beijing, and planned branch
offices or satellites in Shanghai, Guangzhou and 16 other cities, Gallup
China will conduct market research surveys on behalf of US, European and
Asian clients, including Chinese companies.
The company however, will not conduct any political research, although Mr
Richard Buckholder, director of worldwide operations, said it would be a
'natural development' to move into political polling.
Gallup China has already won three contacts to conduct surveys in China
worth Dollars 100,000.
Gallup expects to invest Dollars 10m-Dollars 20m in its Chinese operation,
which is initially licensed to operate for 20 years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ivory Coast's ruling party acted yesterday to cover deep cracks opened by
the contest to succeed President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who is gravely ill,
Reuter reports from Abidjan.
By a show of hands, the Political Bureau of the Democratic party endorsed
the constitutional claim of Mr Henri Konan Bedie, speaker of parliament, to
take over when Africa's longest-serving president dies or stands down.
The decision appeared a setback for supporters of Prime Minister Alassane
Ouattara and opposition parties which are against the constitution's article
11. This states that Mr Bedie, as speaker, takes over until elections in
1995 if the president dies, resigns or is incapacitated.
But it remained to be seen if the unprecedented political tension in the
West African country would abate as a result.
Mr Houphouet-Boigny, 88, has been in power since independence from France in
1960. Western governments led by France and the US are growing nervous about
the future of a country once held up as a model of political stability and
relative prosperity. The economic crisis in the world's number one cocoa
producer is worsening. Civil service salaries are being paid up to three
weeks late.
The main opposition party, the Ivorian Popular Front, is opposed to Mr
Bedie's claim to be interim president and has called for a transitional
government.

Ms Christine Shelly, deputy spokesman, said the memorandum of understanding
was reached at a meeting in Washington on Tuesday and yesterday of the
US-Jordanian-Israel Trilateral Economic Committee, an outgrowth of peace
accords among former enemies in the Middle East.

<TEXT>
The Israeli army rushed troop reinforcements to the West Bank yesterday
after Palestinian gunmen shot dead an Israeli woman on the main street of
the town of al-Birah.
Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist movement which opposes the autonomy deal
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation due to take effect
in the territories on December 13, took responsibility for the murder. It
vowed to continue attacking Israelis in revenge for the recent killings of
some of its leaders by Israeli troops.
Speaking in Brussels, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, noted:
'Every incident like this. . . damages the belief of many in Israel that
peace is possible.' Nonetheless, Mr Rabin, who continues his European visits
with a trip to London today, said he intended 'simultaneously to fight
terror and to move forward in implementing' the autonomy accord.
Yesterday's shooting took place when the car carrying a Jerusalem
kindergarten teacher to her school in the West Bank's Beit El settlement
broke down on the outskirts of nearby al-Birah. Gunmen opened fire on the
vehicle with automatic weapons.
In protest, Jewish settlers briefly blocked a main West Bank road, and have
vowed to block all thoroughfares in the territories for several hours today,
paralysing Palestinian movement.
At a meeting with Israeli army officers, settler leaders accused the
military of failing to protect them. They have already announced plans to
set up their own security force to guard settlements once the autonomy
period begins, and yesterday they unveiled a programme of dozens of new
settlements, in defiance of government policy, in order to frustrate
Palestinian efforts to create an independent state in the occupied
territories.
The Gaza Strip, where clashes on Tuesday left one Palestinian dead and more
than 60 injured, was calmer: the army suspended its hunt for 'wanted'
Palestinian militants, and declared the area a 'closed military zone' to
keep journalists away.
Reuter adds from Brussels: Mr Rabin yesterday met Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
Belgian prime minister, and won early European Union support for upgrading a
1975 co-operation agreement with the 12-member bloc. Mr Rabin said Israel
was interested in updating its relationship with the EU in a bid to advance
Israeli industry and agriculture.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bharatiya Janata party, India's Hindu militant opposition party, whose
supporters last year stormed the Ayodhya mosque, yesterday looked set for
its third defeat in six state elections held last month.
With counting virtually complete, the BJP seemed set to lose control of the
central state of Madhya Pradesh to the ruling Congress (I) party.
The BJP has previously conceded defeat to Congress in the northern state of
Himachal Pradesh. In Uttar Pradesh it faces defeat at the hands of a
coalition led by the Samajwadi party and the Bhagan Samaj party, a populist
alliance. The BJP is likely to retain control of Rajasthan and has won a
clear victory in the city of Delhi. Counting in the small state of Mizoram
in the north-east has yet to start.
The results are a serious setback for the BJP, which had hoped the Ayodhya
mosque's destruction last December would help the cause of Hindu
nationalism. Instead voters have deserted the party, partly in protest at
the violence and unrest which the sacking of the mosque provoked and partly
because of the administrative performance of BJP state governments.

<TEXT>
New Security Council sanctions against Libya came into force yesterday to
put pressure on Tripoli into surrendering two men accused of bombing Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, in which 270 people died,
Reuter reports from the UN.
The Security Council, at the urging of the US, Britain and France, adopted
the new sanctions on November 11. But it gave Libya a grace period until
they went into effect at 5.01am GMT yesterday.
The sanctions freeze Libya's financial assets abroad but exclude future
funds derived from oil, natural gas or agricultural commodities exports.
Sanctions in force since April 1992 ban all civilians' flights to and from
the country and the sales of aircraft parts and arms. They can be suspended
if Libya surrenders the two accused for trial in Britain or the US in
connection with the bombing.
Libya also must satisfy demands of a French magistrate investigating the
mid-flight bombing of France's UTA Flight 772 over Niger in 1989 in which
171 people died.

FT  02 DEC 93 / ADB changes loan strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Asian Development Bank will link future lending to policy liberalisation
that will make the economies of borrowing countries more open, Mr Mitsuo
Sato, the new bank president, said yesterday.
Mr Sato, who took over from Mr Kimimasa Tarimazu, who retired on November
24, told a press conference that during his term the ADB would encourage
more of its member countries to 'shift to greater democratisation, to
market-oriented economy, and to greater openness (of their economies) to the
outside world'.
The Manila-based ADB counts among its members the high-growth 'tiger
economies' of east Asia, most of which, however, have been identified with
authoritarian governments or protective economic policies.
Before his election to the ADB top position, Mr Sato was deputy president of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. He is credited with opening up membership of the
exchange to foreign groups. He had served previously in Japan's Finance
Ministry.
Mr Sato stressed, however, that the new strategy would be manifested in
'policy dialogues' with borrowing member countries. It would not be a strict
condition similar to those imposed by the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund in their own lending criteria. He said these policy
discussions would focus solely on economic matters and 'not in general
terms.'
While opposition lingers over a capital increase for the ADB, Mr Sato said
yesterday he was confident the bank's lending programme for the coming year
would not decline as had been feared by some groups.
'We have agreed on the need to raise capital,' he said, although certain
'policy questions' remained to be sorted out.
'There is a clear consensus among board members that an agreement will be
reached by the end of the year.'
In the first nine months of the year, ADB lending totalled nearly Dollars
2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn), an increase of 11 per cent from the year before.
Equity investments amounted to Dollars 16.4m, up 3 per cent. In the whole of
1992, total lendings reached Dollars 5.1bn, up 6.9 per cent from the
previous year, while equity investments and underwriting came to Dollars
15.8m, down 44 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Left-winger takes Labour leadership in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Helen Clark, a former university lecturer who was elected early yesterday
as leader of New Zealand's opposition Labour party, has indicated that she
wants to turn Labour back to its socialist roots, and has spoken of the need
to raise taxes to help the underprivileged.
A left-wing group, led by activist women party workers, achieved their aim
of seeing Ms Clark elected. The caucus vote, by 26 to 19, ended a gruelling
and bitter battle to oust Mr Mike Moore, who argued that Labour should be a
centrist party, with appeal to all sections of the community.
Mr Moore, who was consistently rated among New Zealand's most popular
politicians, argued that those who plotted against him overlooked his role
in holding the party together after its devastating 1990 loss, leading to
its near win in the general election three weeks ago.
In an apparent effort to retain the backing of Moore supporters, many of
whom back the shift to the right of recent years, the party caucus voted to
appoint Mr David Caygill as deputy leader. Mr Caygill is on the right of the
party and as finance minister in 1988 and 1989 after the sacking of
reformist Sir Roger Douglas continued to promote monetarist economic
solutions.
The appointment of Mr Caygill is seen as a further blow to Mr Moore, who
wanted Dr Michael Cullen, Labour's finance spokesman, to be deputy leader.
It is being widely questioned how Mr Caygill will be able to accept the
left-wing agenda that Ms Clark is promoting. During the election Mr Caygill
spoke against any significant watering down of legislation which deregulated
the labour market, and is also believed to oppose tax increases.
The party divisions and deep rifts that opened during the battle to oust Mr
Moore, are leading to growing beliefs that Labour cannot survive for long in
its present form, and that the right-wing group may form a new party.
There is also talk that some right-wing MPs from the ruling National party
may join such a group, in anticipation that they would achieve a degree of
political power under the German proportional voting system which will be
used in the next election.
Adding to the confusion, Mr Moore also said last week that if he was
defeated he would consider forming a 'new' Labour party, although yesterday
he pledged that he would continue to support Labour.
Ms Clark is the first woman to lead a main New Zealand political party. She
said yesterday the party needed to find ways to work together in the spirit
of consensus politics. 'Above all we need to build a compassionate Labour
party which serves the needs of all New Zealanders.'

FT  02 DEC 93 / Malaysia seeks Keating apology
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A row over remarks by Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, about his
Malaysian counterpart, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, shows signs of worsening. Mr
Keating had called Dr Mahathir recalcitrant for not attending last month's
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle.
Yesterday, Mr Ahmad Badawi, Malaysia's foreign minister, said Australia's
high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur had been called to the Foreign Ministry
and a protest had been made. A similar protest was lodged at Mr Keating's
office by the Malaysian High Commission in Canberra.
While Dr Mahathir seemed at first to play down the issue, his ministers have
been increasing their attacks on Mr Keating and have demanded a public
apology. Mr Samy Vellu, energy and telecommunications minister, said
yesterday that he had directed departments under his ministry to review
business ties with Australia.
Australian businessmen and investors in Malaysia are concerned about the
consequences of a prolonged row. Malaysia has become one of their most
important overseas markets. Trade between the two countries was worth
MDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 1.76bn) last year, with the balance well in
Australia's favour.
Australia also earns substantial amounts from an estimated 8,000 Malaysian
students in the country, and Malaysians are among the leading buyers of
Australian property.
Mr Mohamad Rachmat, Malaysia's information minister, has already announced a
ban on Australian television programmes and advertising material. The
state-controlled broadcasting service would also broadcast only negative
views about Australia.
Dr Mahathir did not attend the Seattle meeting because he said Apec was in
danger of becoming dominated by the US and being turned into a structured
trading group like the European Union.
At the summit, Mr Keating, clearly exasperated at frequent questions by
Australian journalists about Dr Mahathir, said he did not care about the
Malaysian prime minister's position.
'I am sick of questions about Dr Mahathir. . . Apec is bigger than all of
us. . . Australia, the US, Malaysia, Dr Mahathir and other recalcitrants.'
In a subsequent television interview he hinted that demands for an apology
by Malaysia were based on feigned indignation and suggested that Kuala
Lumpur owed multiple apologies to Australia for various unspecified slights.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Beijing unveils plan to overhaul tax system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday unveiled a drastic overhaul of its tax system aimed at
simplifying collection procedures and boosting the central government's
dwindling share of revenues.
Mr Zhang Zhongcheng, a top official of the National Tax Administration, told
an international seminar in Beijing the changes would complement Chinese
economic reforms which have produced dramatic growth without a corresponding
increase in government revenues.
'Fiscal reform must favour the power of the central government to implement
tax laws,' he said. Total tax revenue has dropped sharply in the past decade
from 26.7 per cent of gross national product in 1979 to 15.8 per cent in
1991.
Among the main features of China's new tax regime, which is to be phased in
from January 1, are:
A uniform 33 per cent tax rate on all enterprises to replace the 55 per cent
now levied on large and medium-sized state concerns. Preferential taxes for
foreign enterprises and joint ventures would not be affected initially, but
eventually would be brought into line with the corporate rate.
The imposition of a value added tax in line with international practice. VAT
will be applied at a uniform rate of 17 per cent on all goods in
circulation, but an additional excise would also be levied on luxury items
such cigarettes, alcohol and beauty products, along with gas and petrol.
Personal income taxes are to be overhauled to introduce a uniform system
that will apply to foreigners, Chinese citizens and a category described as
'private entrepreneurs'. Nine tax rates are to be imposed ranging from 5 per
cent on a base income of 800 yuan (Dollars 140) per month up to 45 per cent
on higher incomes.
Special taxes will be levied on the extractive industries such as the mining
of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and what are described as 'non-metallic
deposits'. This would be in addition to VAT.
Charges on property transactions will also be levied, along with taxes on
stock exchange dealings, inheritances and insurance. Tax laws dealing with
Chinese and foreigners will be unified under a 'unified personal income tax
law'.
Mr Zhang sought to reassure foreign investors that their tax advantages
would be preserved under the new regime, but he did not go into detail.
'We think, to attract foreign capital and foreign methods and to accelerate
China's economic development, preferential tax treatment applied to foreign
investment enterprises are absolutely indispensable,' he said. 'Tax reforms
will not change that.'
China faces enormous difficulties collecting taxes in an economy undergoing
rapid transformation. The central government lacks the sophisticated
mechanisms and manpower required to impose a strict regime. Another problem
is a shortage of accountants.
Tax avoidance and evasion is widespread. Competition between the centre and
provinces in tax collection - the two are often engaged in a fierce struggle
for a share of revenues - is another factor bedevilling efforts to bolster
central government coffers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean government denied yesterday the arrest of the head of
Hanhwa, the country's ninth largest business group, signalled a crackdown on
leading conglomerates, or chaebol.
Mr Kim Seung-youn, Hanhwa chairman, is the nation's first incumbent chaebol
leader to be prosecuted. He is charged with illegally diverting funds to buy
property in the US in violation of foreign exchange laws.
He is the third prominent businessmen to be prosecuted since the reformist
President Kim Young-sam was inaugurated in February.
Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of Hyundai, was recently convicted of
illegally diverting corporate funds for his failed presidential campaign
against President Kim last year.
Mr Park Tae-joon, founder of Pohang Iron and Steel, the world's third
largest steelmaker, fled to Japan in March after he was charged with
illegally using corporate funds to support Mr Kim's conservative political
opponents.
Hanhwa's Mr Kim also has close ties with the president's opponents within
the ruling Democratic Liberal party.
Critics have accused the president of engaging in a political vendetta
against his foes by ordering investigations of the business leaders.
President Kim has criticised the chaebol for benefiting from links with the
country's former military dictatorship and proposed measures to reduce their
dominant position in the Korean economy. The Hanhwa chairman's arrest
surprised observers since the president has recently adopt a more
conciliatory approach toward the chaebol.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Japanese sales of vehicles fall further in November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The severity of the downturn in Japan's vehicle market was underlined
yesterday by figures showing that new vehicle sales in November fell 7.7 per
cent, the eighth consecutive monthly decline.
According to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association, passenger cars
suffered a 7 per cent decline in spite of the introduction by several makers
of new models in the autumn. Truck sales were down nearly 9 per cent,
reflecting the overall weakness in economic activity.
Mr Futoh Fujii, vice president of Nissan, noted in an interview last week
that the Japanese car industry could face a 'double dip recession'.
Such concerns were supported by the weakness of demand in November, which is
the peak year-end sales period as it comes before consumers receive their
bonuses in December.
Failing a November pick-up, car makers will probably have to wait until the
spring for the next opportunity for demand to gather pace, a Honda official
said.
The downturn in the domestic market has come as exports have also been
forced lower, largely as a result of the yen's strength and sluggish demand
particularly in the European Union.
Japanese manufacturers have had to scale back production plans significantly
in order to adjust inventories. Mazda had a two-day closure last month, and
Nissan will follow suit this month.
Honda plans to halt production for four days between this month and next
April and to reduce output by about 10,000 units.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Japan paying prices of recession: The gloom in Tokyo's
consumer electronics shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lights are going dim in Akihabara, the neon-festooned electronics
district of Tokyo, consumer test-bed for world-beating gizmos like the
Walkman and the compact disc player.
Akihabara, where the Japanese splash out 5 per cent of their Y6,000bn
(Pounds 38bn) a year spending on consumer electronics, is a sensitive
indicator of consumer sentiment. In some places, the recession has hit so
hard that the lights have gone out.
One is Hirose Musen, one of the four small chains to have closed there in
the past four months. A picket line of former employees shivered outside one
of Hirose Musen's shuttered shops last week, with their backs to a lifeless
neon sign, politely requesting their jobs back.
A stroll through some of the other 500 stores in the area makes it is easy
to see why Hirose Musen's owners closed their three Akihabara shops. Noodle
bars tucked under railway arches nearby appear to be attracting more custom
than the gaudy arcades of Akihabara's main outlets. Many report that sales
this year are down at least 10 per cent and some, like Nakaura, are so
desperate they have sent out salesmen to make house-to-house calls.
Prices are at the bottom. In good times, Akihabara sales tickets show two
figures; the manufacturer's price, which has a line through it, plus the
sale price, the point from which one is expected to open bargaining.
These discounts were not as generous as they looked, since they were
strictly controlled by suppliers. But last week, sale prices too were scored
through with thick black lines. Discounts on a given brand name varied
between shops, indicating that suppliers' grip on margins has weakened.
Discounts include 40 per cent off miniature televisions at Y11,800 and 25
per cent off digital audio tape machines, down to Y55,800.
The range of gadgets is as dazzling as ever, as suppliers and shops try in
vain to revive consumers' jaded tastes. But general consumer spending in the
year to the end of September was down 0.4 per cent, compared with a rise of
2.8 per cent in the same month last year, according to the Economic Planning
Agency.
The problem is that people are earning less as their companies slash costs,
and are at the same time saving more to rebuild wealth eroded by the fall in
land prices. Real incomes only rose by 1.2 per cent in the year to
September, while savings as a proportion of disposable income rose to 18.2
per cent last year, from 17.9 per cent in 1991, says the EPA.
On top of this, Akihabara has its own problems. What remains of diminished
demand is shifting away from traditional consumer electronics, white goods
and components - and stabilising or growing slightly in computer games,
computers, compact discs and tapes.
Even worse, Akihabara has lost its already questionable reputation for the
lowest prices, thanks to the arrival of aggressive discount stores in
suburbs such as Shinjuku and Ikebukuro. They are winning market share.
Discount stores generally are expecting double-digit sales growth this year,
according to a survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper.
Akihabara's stores have responded in varying ways. One of the larger ones,
Shintoku, threw out its old stock and filled one of its four shops with Sega
computer games last November. It turned another into a CD and video cassette
store, called Shintoku Soft Terminal. The strategy was not enough to erode
Shintoku's mounting debts and the store filed for bankruptcy last month with
liabilities of Y6.96bn, Akihabara's biggest collapse.
Laox, the biggest store, has been more successful. It had expanded out of
Akihabara before the recession hit and has become rich enough to use the
downturn to expand market share, by taking over one of its struggling
neighbours.
Laox has also led an Akihabara trend, to devote more space to selling
computers, from which the district now derives about 30 per cent of sales
and to concentrate more on supplying a service than giving discounts. As
part of the same trend, a shop closed by Asia Musen, another recent
Akihabara casualty, was taken over by Sofmap, a retailer of used personal
computers.
This is, however, a risky strategy. The profit margin on computers is even
smaller than that on consumer goods, points out Mr Harrison Bates, retail
analyst at James Capel Pacific. Akihabara is heading for a tough Christmas.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Mixed signals from China on Hong Kong: Patten prepares move
towards democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is issuing conflicting signals over Hong Kong even though failure to
reach agreement in Sino-British talks is expected today to lead Mr Chris
Patten, the colony's governor, to announce he is pressing ahead with the
first stage of his proposals for broader democracy.
Mr Patten is expected to tell legislators that he will introduce a bill
dealing with 'straightforward' issues concerning Hong Kong's elections next
year and in 1995, leaving the most contentious aspects open for further
discussion with Beijing if talks should continue.
Although Chinese officials have warned against this step, there has been a
softening in their rhetoric by comparison with other difficult periods in
relations over Hong Kong. The threat that no more talks would take place if
Mr Patten proceeds has so far been absent from their comments.
Meeting businessmen from Hong Kong, Mr Lu Ping, director of Beijing's Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, made no reference to talks ending if Mr
Patten put his bill to Hong Kong's Legislative Council.
However, it also emerged yesterday that Britain's confidence that China
would honour the 1984 Joint Declaration on Hong Kong was shaken in the
latest round of talks in Beijing at the weekend.
It was understood that Beijing told British negotiators China would
reintroduce appointments to Hong Kong's local government if Mr Patten
abolishes this system and has all seats elected.
According to the Hong Kong Economic Journal, a leading business paper, Mr
Christopher Hum, head of the UK team, pointed out this went against the
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law which vest such power in the Hong Kong
government that succeeds Mr Patten's administration.
The Chinese remark was seen as potentially undermining the Joint
Declaration's statement that after sovereignty reverts from Britain to China
in 1997, Hong Kong will enjoy a 'high degree of autonomy', with 'Hong Kong
people ruling Hong Kong'.
Despite the apparent breakdown of the talks, British officials point out
that China has agreed to attend a meeting in London next week of the Joint
Liaison Group, the body charged with working out details of the 1997
transfer.
Beijing has not yet responded to London's request for a further round of
talks on political development, the officials said.
Mr Tsang Yok Sing, a pro-Beijing Hong Kong politician, said in a radio
interview from the Chinese capital that talks could proceed as long as Legco
took no final decisions.
Mr Zhou Nan, Beijing's top official in Hong Kong, assured Hong Kong
political figures visiting Kunming that China would do its best to preserve
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability even if Britain acted unilaterally on
the political front.
Lord Howe, the former UK foreign secretary who negotiated the Joint
Declaration, said yesterday that it was overridingly important for Britain
and China to renew their commitment to a common course leading to agreement
over Hong Kong.
Responding to questions from a parliamentary select committee, he said it
was important for Britain to maintain consistency in dealing with China, but
declined to be drawn into discussing the specifics of the current impasse.

FT  02 DEC 93 / UK women lag in 'Euroleague'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women in Britain live less long and are less likely to become MPs or
ministers than almost anywhere else in western Europe, according to the
European statistics office Eurostat.
They have to cope with lower levels of maternity benefit than in most other
European Union states, and a larger gap compared with male wages.
The Eurostat report, published yesterday, paints a mixed picture of the
social and economic position of European women. Female unemployment is
higher than male in every EU country apart from Britain. The female rate is
more than twice the male level in Greece, Belgium, Italy and Portugal.
British women's relatively low unemployment is partly explained by greater
opportunities for part-time work.
In nearly every other category, British women are at or close to the bottom
of the Euroleague. Ms Jill Chesworth, spokeswoman for the Equal
Opportunities Commission, an independent body set up to counter sex
discrimination, said the findings confirmed British men and women alike were
getting 'a raw deal' as a result of UK economic decline.
Life expectancy for UK women is 78.6 years, ninth lowest in the EU.
Maternity benefits are paid for a shorter time and at a lower level than in
any other EU state.
British women seem particularly prone to become single mothers: of women
aged 20-39, 10.1 per cent are living alone with children, more than in any
other EU member. The corresponding figures elsewhere range from 2.3 per cent
in Italy and 2.4 per cent in Greece to 7.7 per cent in Germany and 7.1 per
cent in Belgium.
North European women suffer from a larger gap between male and female wages
than in the south. In the retail trade, British and German women employees
earn respectively 36 and 30 per cent less than their male counterparts. In
Portugal and Greece - where the overall level of wages is much lower - the
differential is 20 per cent.
The Eurostat survey says women account for only 7 per cent of total members
of the UK government. The proportions elsewhere range from 8 per cent in
Luxembourg and Greece, and 10 per cent in Portugal, to 21 per cent in
Denmark and 24 per cent in the Netherlands.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Madrid confronts unions head on
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government is determined to confront the unions and deregulate
the labour market despite the threat of a general strike next month and
foreign investor nervousness about growing industrial unrest, a senior
minister said yesterday.
Mr Pedro Solbes, economy and finance minister, insisted at a conference in
Madrid organised by the Financial Times and Expansion newspaper that the
strike would have 'no impact on what the government intends to do' and that
it would 'in no way affect the exchange rate'.
Unions have called for a 24-hour walkout in the second half of January to
force the government to withdraw legislation aimed at loosening fixed
employment guidelines and making it easier to sack staff. The government,
which argues that Spain's labour market rigidities are directly responsible
its unemployment levels - the highest in the European Union - is to approve
the deregulation measures tomorrow
Mr Solbes said the cabinet would approve a decree law, with immediate effect
that would end the government's monopoly on job placements for the
unemployed and remove legal impediments to apprenticeship schemes and
part-time employment.
The government hopes as many as 900,000 18-25-year-olds will be able to
enter the job market under these measures. The jobless figure stands at 3.5m
or 23 per cent of the labour force, according to the national statistics
office.
The peseta, which has been under heavy selling pressure, remains the weakest
currency in the European monetary system's exchange rate mechanism although
it held steady yesterday at Pta82.18 to the D-Mark. It gained slightly
against the dollar closing at Pta140.95.
The government-union showdown in Spain comes at the end of a fruitless
three-month attempt to negotiate a 'social pact' with unions and employers
on wage restraint and labour market reform. The talks were called off
officially on Tuesday.
The measures are opposed by the unions who accuse the government of creating
'junk jobs'. Organised labour is even more hostile to a draft law, also to
be unveiled tomorrow, which will alter statutory labour rules on a maximum
eight-hour working day and a daily 12-hour minimum rest period, change
collective bargaining procedures, streamline job classifications and ease
relocations.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Turkish tax net tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A programme of tax changes designed to close Turkey's budget gap and offset
expected losses from the move to a customs union with the European Union in
1995 were unveiled yesterday by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister.
The changes, which parliament will have to rush through in the next few
weeks to take effect in the 1994 tax year, include a new consumption tax,
increases in effective corporation tax, increased tax allowances for the
lower paid, and administrative reforms to reduce tax evasion.
'For some people not to pay tax while those on the minimum wage pay their
tax automatically every month is a shame, a sin and an injustice,' Mrs
Ciller said, warning that the names of tax evaders would be exposed. The
reforms aim to raise the tax take by 2 per cent of gross national product
next year and 3 per cent in 1995.
The parliamentary budget commission is expected to conclude the 1994 budget
discussions this week, before taking the draft to the full house for
approval.
The budget, which has been calculated assuming parliamentary backing for the
new tax reforms, envisages a deficit of TL192,000bn (Pounds 9.3bn), on
spending of TL819,000bn.
The reforms reduce the number of exemptions which allow corporations to
reduce their tax liabilities. Under the new system, companies will pay
corporation tax at a minimum rate of 20 per cent. Tax incentives are to be
introduced for companies going public.
The new consumption tax is specifically aimed at offsetting lost revenues
resulting from the move to lower import tariffs and the scrapping of the
mass housing fund as Turkey implements a customs union with the EU in 1995.
The announcement, which Mrs Ciller made during a nationwide television
address, coincides with publication of figures showing gross national
product growing by 7.9 per cent in the third quarter. Growth was strongest
in the services sector.
After 12 per cent GNP growth in the second quarter, economists are
projecting growth for the whole of 1993 at around 8 per cent, which should
result in higher than budgeted tax receipts for the government in the
current year.

FT  02 DEC 93 / 'Wise men' favour open skies policy: EU report says airlines
must cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European airline industry must end the debate over its future and get
down to practical cost-savings measures if it is to have any assured future,
according to the committee of 'wise men' set up by the European Commission
to look at the financial crisis in civil aviation.
The committee, headed by former Belgian transport minister Herman De Croo,
presented an interim report to EU transport ministers in Brussels on
Tuesday, and is due to finalise its recommendations by mid-January.
The meeting widened the rift between a French-led coalition looking to spare
their flag carriers the sharper measures of the EU air transport
deregulation put in place over the past seven years, and a more or less
equal UK-led group of member states seeking to preserve and extend the 'open
skies' regime and ban state aids to national airlines.
But Mr De Croo told the ministers that 'the European airline industry cannot
afford continuing such a largely ideological debate with only sterile
results. What we need are practical measures that work and bring about
incentives for cost savings.
'The European airline industry can no longer afford selling a product,
produced at European cost levels, at world market prices,' the report says,
rejecting any solution which rolls back liberalisation.
The committee's preliminary findings state that:
Europe's airlines have long combined above average growth with below average
profitability, a phenomenon it describes as 'possibly unique'.
On average, the industry has a considerable cost disadvantage compared to
its main international competitors, with flag carriers' operating costs at
45 per cent above their US rivals. 'A significant part of this gap stems
from lower productivity,' the report says, pointing out that salary levels
do not substantially differ between Europe and the US.
Airlines in Europe pay higher airport and air traffic control costs, while
chronic congestion adds to overall costs.
They also pay higher financial costs, because of exchange rate risks, less
favourable conditions for tax-lease arrangements, and 'the higher efficiency
of US capital markets.
However, the report notes that financial difficulties have not hit all
sectors of the industry equally. Charter and cargo services have done
remarkably well during the recession. Independent carriers increased jobs in
1990-92 by 10 per cent, while employment at flag carriers fell 4 per cent,
with more redundancies in prospect. The latter are losing market share in
and outside the EU, the report notes.
The options, Mr De Croo said, are 'major cost-cutting on all fronts or
declare bankruptcy', or to let the taxpayer pick up the bill through state
aids. 'If we do nothing a combination of all three options will occur.'
The interim report does not rule out public funding to aid industry
restructuring, but its tone clearly strengthens the liberal camp in EU
aviation.

For the first time more Finns oppose membership of the European Union than
support it, according to a Gallup poll published by the Helsingin Sanomat
newspaper. Finland applied for membership in March, 1992.
In Norway a Gallup poll this week put EU support at 21.8 per cent, with 51.6
per cent opposing. The latest Sifo poll in Sweden puts the No vote at 48 per
cent, compared with 30 per cent in favour.
According to the new poll in Finland, 41 per cent of Finns would vote No to
EU membership if a referendum were held now. This compares with 36 per cent
in favour and 23 per cent who are undecided.
There is no doubt that the latest vote has been influenced by widespread
disappointment over the EU's response to Finland's demands on agriculture,
the key issue in the country's membership discussions.

<TEXT>
Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a former Christian Democrat budget minister and
one of the party bosses in Naples, yesterday admitted in a Milan court to
receiving L5bn (Pounds 2m) in illicit funds from the Ferruzzi-Montedison
group.
Mr Pomicino, until recently protected by parliamentary immunity, is the
first senior minister to have admitted receiving illicit funds. The
admission was part of evidence in the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial
consultant close to the Socialist party who is charged with helping the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group distribute money to obtain political favours.
According to Mr Pomicino, the funds were handed over in the form of treasury
bills. These were then cashed by Mr Franco Ambrosio, the Neapolitan
businessman who controls Italgrani, the grain group.
Mr Pomicino said the funds were used for campaigning; but more than L1bn was
passed on to Mr Salvo Lima, the powerful Christian Democrat politician who
represented Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former premier, in Sicily. Mr Lima was
murdered last year in a Mafia assassination and has since been identified as
having Mafia links.

<TEXT>
Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the French national assembly, last night
called for radical changes in the European Union to widen its membership to
Russia, to create a European Security Council, and to relaunch the European
economy with interest rate cuts and massive public borrowing.
Mr Seguin, who led the French anti-Maastricht campaign, shares much of the
Euroscepticism prevalent in London.
But, in his speech last night to a Paris university audience, he pushed the
thesis of a wider-rather-than-deeper European integration further than any
British conservative minister would dare or probably want.
He called for the EU to consolidate peace in Europe by extending membership
to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Capping his 'Grand Europe' vision would be a
European Security Council, modelled on the UN with four or five main
European powers able to send peace-keeping forces throughout the continent.
He proposed a downgrading in most EU institutions, with the Commission
losing its right to make proposals and the European Parliament confined to
ratifying legislation elaborated by national parliaments.

The Belgian presidency of the European Union yesterday served notice that
Europe was ready to use force against local warlords blocking humanitarian
aid in Bosnia.
The warning followed talks in Brussels between Mr Jacques Delors, president
of the European Commission, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, which paved the way for next month's visit by President Bill Clinton
to Europe and a Nato summit.
The talks were a clear effort to patch disagreements earlier this year,
principally over US support for arming the Bosnian Moslems against the
Serbs.
In Geneva, Bosnia's three warring factions reported progress after deciding
to extend negotiations on the republic's ethnic division for another day. Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said progress had been made on a
Serb insistence of partition of Sarajevo, the capital.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign ministers of the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe yesterday postponed a decision on Russia's bid for a CSCE mandate
for its 'peacekeeping' operations in the former Soviet Union.
However, they did ask the CSCE secretariat in Vienna to draw up a set of
rules as a basis for the sanctioning of military intervention by Russian
forces. These are likely to emphasise the timely dispatch of armed monitors
to potential trouble spots and the setting up of parallel political
dispute-settling processes.
Former Soviet states have been arguing that approval for Russian military
peacekeeping in former Soviet territories would constitute a new 'Yalta
agreement', creating two security zones in Europe. But western diplomats
argue that the west is unlikely to provide troops to address the security
risks in Transcaucasia and central Asia.
With elections in Russia looming, ministers also wanted to avoid any hint of
rejecting the Russian proposals. But Mr Anatoli Zlenko, the Ukrainian
foreign minister refused to be restrained by electoral considerations when
he strongly rebutted the attack on Ukraine's nuclear policies made on
Tuesday by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister.
Dismissing Russia's claim that Ukraine's slow and partial ratification of
the US-Soviet Start 1 agreement was re-creating a nuclear risk in Europe, Mr
Zlenko said 'everyone knows that the nuclear button remains in Russian hands
and that Ukraine has no intention of obtaining operational control'.
Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: France and Germany yesterday called for the
Western European Union, as the arm of common defence policy in the European
Union, to become a vehicle for bringing the countries of eastern Europe
closer to western defence structures - but stopping short of full Nato
membership.

<TEXT>
The first significant deal in west Germany's 1994 pay negotiations has
resulted in insurance workers settling for a 2 per cent across-the-board
award.
According to officials of the DAG white-collar union, a one-off payment and
travel subsidies will boost the total value of the 15-month package to about
3 per cent.
The agreement, reached during Tuesday night, is the first concrete evidence
to support hopes of deflationary wage rises in the new year. West German
inflation is widely forecast to average around 3.5 per cent in 1994, dipping
steadily as the year progresses.
A tendency towards more moderate union demands has played an important part
in encouraging the Bundesbank council, which meets today, to continue its
programme of cautious interest rate reductions.
The traditionally moderate DBV bank workers' association this week requested
a 4.5 per cent increase for the new year. The real test for negotiators
starts next week, when engineering and metal industry employers are due to
open talks with the IG Metall union, which has posted claims for between 5.5
per cent and 6 per cent.
However, economists note that the industrial sectors represented by IG
Metall have shed around 400,000 jobs in the past two years, and doubt that
the membership has the heart to resist employers' pressure.
A month-on-month increase of just 0.1 per cent in west German import prices
during October and a 1.5 per cent fall compared with the same month last
year, reported by the federal statistics office yesterday, also indicated
continuing reductions in inflationary pressure.
Meanwhile, industrial output figures suggested that the past year's decline
is slowing. Production fell a provisional 0.4 per cent during October,
according to the economics ministry.
This followed a sharp upward adjustment for September, when output was
unchanged from August.
Combined figures for September and October, a measure used to iron out
short-term fluctuations, showed production up 1 per cent on July and August.
Only consumer goods and food and luxury products registered declines.

The Georgian government and representatives of the secessionist region of
Abkhazia yesterday agreed to exchange prisoners of war and allow refugees to
return, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
A memorandum of understanding reached after two days of United
Nations-mediated talks also invited the UN to send an international
peacekeeping force to Abkhazia to police the uneasy ceasefire.
Abkhaz rebels seized control of the region last summer after a civil war in
which thousands died.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Moscow looks set for Baltic withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia appears ready to rethink its regional military presence in the
Baltics after it recently proposed to withdraw from all but one of its
strategic bases in the Baltic states.
In recent bilateral talks with Latvia and Estonia, which resume tomorrow,
Russia offered to return the nuclear submarine training base at Paldiski,
Estonia, as well as the Ventspils satellite listening post and Liepaja naval
base by next August, or soon after.
Although no agreement has been signed, western diplomats note a change of
tone in the long-running negotiations, and place special weight on the
explicit offer to leave Liepaja.
A military expert said this means Russia must now reduce its Baltic Sea
naval fleet since the some 50 vessels at Liepaja cannot be restationed in
Baltiisk, the Kaliningrad port, or Kronstadt, near St Petersburg, which are
both full.
However, Russia wants to keep the early warning radar station in Skrunda in
Latvia under military control for six more years, until a similar facility
is built in Baranovich, in Belarus.
Mr Valdis Birkavs, Latvian prime minster, said Latvia could accept civilian
control for 18 months, but only with 'international guarantees'.
Roughly 16,500 soldiers are left in Latvia and Estonia. Russia's defence
ministry is said to want some troops from the Baltic rim moved to 'hot
spots' in the trans-Caucus and central Asian states.
Until then, however, neighbouring states are worried about the troop
build-up in Kaliningrad, where more than 100,000 soldiers plus equipment are
concentrated.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Hint of new deal for foreign capital
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior minister yesterday pleaded with western investors to increase their
stake in Russia, promising a much friendlier regime after parliamentary
elections this month.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy prime minister, told a meeting of US
business people that Russian industry needed many billions of dollars of
foreign capital to modernise itself. The aluminium industry, he said, needed
Dollars 6.6bn (Pounds 4.4bn), oil and gas refineries in the far eastern
province of Sakhalin alone needed Dollars 10bn, while the list of demands
for oil and gas industry equipment stood at Dollars 17.5bn.
He said the government would call on the parliament, elected after December
12, to pass legislation creating free economic zones and concessionary
agreements, as well as to rescind 'ill-grounded barriers to the activities
of foreign companies in Russia'.
He said the percentage of wholly foreign-owned companies in the overall
number of joint ventures had grown from 19 per cent in 1992 to 40 per cent
in 1993 - though the amount of private foreign capital invested remained
low, at around Dollars 2bn. Against a background of falling production,
foreign-owned enterprises had increased their output of light industrial
products and had helped restore oil production.
He said foreign investors should be directed to the priorities of oil
production, agriculture, high technology and military conversion.
Meanwhile, economics ministers, meeting Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian
premier, approved a 'tough' budget - with further spending on the energy
sector of Rbs1,500bn (Pounds 870m), to be compensated for by raising
unspecified revenues of an equivalent amount.
The ministers heard that gross domestic product fell 12 per cent in 1993,
compared with 20 per cent last year; that inflation had slowed to 15 per
cent in November from 21 per cent in October; and that the budget deficit
for the year would be 10 per cent of GDP.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Russian reformists denounce call to ban Communist party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's Choice, the leading reformist group in the Russian election
campaign, has sharply criticised Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy
prime minister, for calling for the banning of the Communist and other
parties for their attacks on the draft constitution.
In doing so, it has distanced itself from Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president - who had threatened to deprive parties of television airtime for
criticising the draft.
The move, which puts Russia's Choice in the same camp as other conservative
and reformist parties - both in opposing a ban and the loss of airtime -
shows that it has decided it may be better to demonstrate opposition to the
president rather than to democratic practice.
Meanwhile the latest poll - by the 'Mnenie' organisation - showed both main
reformist parties, Russia's Choice and the Yabloko group of Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky, losing ground compared to their position in mid-November. The
poll also showed a surge of support for the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic
party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. However, the poll is of doubtful value as
it recorded nearly 50 per cent of respondents as 'Don't knows'.
Publication of further polls will be banned from today until election day,
December 12.
Mr Shumeiko's call for a ban on the communists has been rejected by the
electoral commission. However, the call electrified the pre-election
atmosphere; it followed a warning by President Yeltsin of the loss of the
free broadcasting for all 13 groups contesting the election. Mr Yeltsin had
also proposed that the two chambers of parliament meet in two buildings far
apart - a proposal also criticised by Russia's Choice as hindering
efficiency.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister who heads the group, said
on Tuesday night that criticism of the constitution was no grounds for
banning a party. Mr Gennady Burbulis, a former close aide to Mr Yeltsin and
another leader of Russia's Choice, yesterday apologised for Mr Shumeiko,
condemned his call and said it did not reflect the position of Russia's
Choice.
Mr Gary Kasparov, the chess champion who is a Russia's Choice candidate,
went further, saying that 'the whole group will suffer' for Mr Shumeiko's
action, which he said was 'irresponsible'.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Russian 'peacekeepers' raise imperialism fears: Doubts are
growing over Moscow's 'army abroad'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe mulls over the new
Russian military doctrine which provides for the stationing of Russian
troops in the 'near abroad', Colonel Ivan Maleevitch, in the remote republic
of Tajikistan, is laying plans.
As spokesman for the newly-created 25,000-strong Russian and Central Asian
'peacekeeping' force, he is already plotting to paint his vehicles blue.
'We need to do this to show that we are proper peacekeepers,' says Col
Maleevitch, who is charged with explaining Russia's military presence in
Tajikistan, the scene of a bloody 18-month civil war between the government
and Islamic rebels.
His task will be delicate. With the Russian army now actively engaged in the
Caucuses, Moldova and Tajikistan, fears that Russia could be engaged in a
new military imperialism under the 'peacekeeping' guise have been one of the
key issues dogging the CSCE meeting.
In Georgia, Russian troops are guarding the railways in defence of the
Georgian government, and in exchange have received permission to run five
military bases, including three Black Sea ports. This has prompted Mr Tengiz
Chachava, the 'ambassador' in Moscow of Georgian rebel leader Mr Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, to claim that 'it should be clear to all countries now that
what is at stake in Georgia is the resumption of Russian rule'.
In Azerbaijan 200 Russian military advisers are covertly supporting the
Azerbaijani government in exchange for a share in Azerbaijan oil fields for
Russia's state oil group Lukoil, according to Azeri officials.
But it is the 700-mile Tajik-Afghan border which could prove critical in
defining Russia's policies in the 'near abroad', not least because the area
is already an embryo for any future CIS-wide peace-keeping force.
To try to allay western fears, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister,
recently suggested that the operations be given a United Nations or CSCE
mandate, insisting that 'Russia's withdrawal from its peacekeeping role
would threaten the former Soviet Union with a Yugoslav scenario'.
The proposal has already provoked outrage from some Baltic and central
European countries as well as some UN officials, who point out that the UN
stipulates that 'peacekeepers' cannot be taken from adjacent countries.
Nevertheless the proposals have received a more tolerant hearing in Britain,
France and Germany, where there is a grudging acceptance that Russia has
legitimate security concerns on its borders - and that a Russian-held peace
might be better than no peace since the UN is in no position to provide
peacekeepers.
However, as western diplomats admit, the problem is that Russia's
longer-term policy in these areas remains unclear, with the Russian army and
Russian foreign ministry apt to speak with different tongues.
Mr Kozyrev, for his part, insists that Russian troops are needed in
Tajikistan, for example to protect the 200,000 Russians in Tajikistan and
prevent the rebels based in Afghanistan from spreading 'Islamic extremism'
into its southern flank.
In Dushanbe General Boris Pyankov, acting commander of the peacekeeping
force, denies that Russia has any 'imperialistic' aim, pointing out that all
the Russian forces, including the locally based 201 division, are now under
a joint command structure.
This structure, drawn up between Russia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan
and Uzbekistan in August, envisages a six-month peace-keeping term,
renewable at the Tajik government's request.
But this multilateral control is largely a diplomatic figleaf - most of the
heavy weapons remain in the hands of the Russians. With the Russian troops
now in effect propping up the Tajik government, Mr Abdumalik Abduladjanov,
the Tajik prime minister, admits that the troops are likely to be in the
country 'for a long time'.
So far western observers in Dushanbe have retained a discreet silence on the
issue. 'I don't think the United Nations will come out openly with official
support. But I think they will give a tacit nod,' explains one diplomat.
Even if the west accepts Russia's role on the border, it is likely to insist
on strong international scrutiny, which may involve a demand that the troops
maintain a dialogue with both sides. There has been little evidence of this
recently in Tajikistan or Georgia, and in Moldova the Russian forces have
openly sided with the local Russians.
With the mission in Tajikistan likely to be unwinnable, questions also
remain about Russia's patience. After 25 Russians were massacred by the
opposition on the border in summer, Russian leaders know public opinion in
Russia could become less tolerant. . On the ground Russia's presence has
already made the opposition virulently anti-Russian.
'Russia will pay for this in the future - we blame the Russian government
for this,' says Davlat Usmon, opposition leader from his stronghold in the
Pamirs. And in Afghanistan itself, opposition forces are already reported to
be offering Dollars 350,000 for the head of a Russian commander.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Markets surge as Budget boosts hopes of recovery: Stocks and
bonds record highest daily gains since ERM departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, PETER NORMAN, PETER JOHN and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets rose sharply yesterday on the back of hopes that this
week's Budget would help the UK recovery without stoking inflation and that
a cut in interest rates was on the way.
The London stock and government bond markets recorded their biggest daily
gains since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 as
investors gave a vote of confidence to the spending cuts and tax rises
announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on Tuesday.
In hectic trading, the FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares jumped 66.3 to
3,233.2, a new high, while long-dated gilts gained nearly 2 points helped by
large purchases from UK institutions and investors in continental Europe and
the US.
Stocks in BT, British Gas and the privatised water and power companies were
especially buoyant. Construction companies and some retailers also gained on
the view that those sectors had received favourable treatment in the Budget.
The optimistic sentiment was helped by comments from Mr Clarke that the
economy was strong enough to withstand the tax increases and spending cuts
announced on Tuesday.
He said that the growth forecast of 2.5 per cent next year was 'modest and
realistic' and that the measures to bring down the 1994-95 fiscal deficit
from an expected Pounds 44bn to Pounds 38bn would help to bolster business
and consumer confidence.
Although Mr Clarke did not encourage hopes of a cut in interest rates from
the current level of 5.5 per cent, the pound fell on speculation that such a
move might come in the next two months.
In London, sterling closed against the D-Mark at DM2.5425, down half a
pfennig, while against the dollar it lost nearly half a cent to end the day
at Dollars 1.4805. In New York, the pound fell further to close at Dollars
1.478.
Markets took a positive view of Mr Clarke's decision to cut Pounds 3.6bn
from next year's public spending control total and his tax changes which
will raise Pounds 1.67bn in 1994-95 on top of the Pounds 6.7bn already
announced.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities, the
London investment house, said the market had been enthusiastic about the
theory that the moves would put the nation's finances in better shape but
not harm the recovery.
Exceptionally high trading in futures derivatives, which track likely share
movements, spurred much of yesterday's heavy buying. Business in the futures
contract which represents the FT-SE 100 Index was worth more than Pounds
2.5bn, about twice as much as on a normal day.
A less favourable view came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an
independent research group, which said the two Budgets, in March and on
Tuesday, would reverse the tax cuts of the 1980s and reduce household
incomes by an average of 3.5 per cent. Middle-class families would be
especially badly affected.
Shrugging off such sentiments, Mr Clarke said it would be 'quite easy' to
get the tax changes announced on Tuesday through the House of Commons.
He said the forecast 2.25 per cent increase in consumer spending next year
would be supported by increased consumer confidence, falling savings and the
continuing effects of the past year's mortgage interest rate cuts, which
transferred cash to people with a relatively high propensity to spend.
However, he gave no encouragement to speculation about a further interest
rate reduction beyond last week's cut in base rates to 5.5 per cent from 6
per cent.
He underlined that any judgment to cut rates had to be based on a range of
monetary indicators and the medium-term outlook for inflation.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Optimism grows for accord on trade
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union and US leaders signalled yesterday that they were prepared to
be flexible to achieve a breakthrough in their long-running talks on trade
liberalisation.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said he was optimistic about
an agreement after meeting Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade
commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative.
The suggestion of new-found flexibility came as negotiators in Brussels,
flanked by large contingents of advisers, set out on a race to reach a
comprehensive bilateral deal by tonight. The talks were last night moving
forward 'little by little', according to Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president, who also met the chief US and European negotiators.
Mr Christopher warned that failure to complete the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would not just hobble the world
economy but would damage the transatlantic relationship. The stakes 'are
absolutely immense', he said. 'We have a responsibility to meet flexibility
with flexibility.'
His remarks echoed sentiments expressed in Bonn after a two-day summit
meeting between French and German leaders.
President Francois Mitterrand of France and German chancellor Helmut Kohl
agreed that compromise was essential.
Sir Leon and Mr Kantor appeared cautiously optimistic that they would be
able by tonight to deliver to a special EU meeting of foreign and trade
ministers a package of tariff cuts and farm trade proposals that will pave
the way for successful completion of the Uruguay Round.
One negotiator said: 'We are at the stage where people are making honest
assessments. Public characterisations showing how tough we are for domestic
audiences are not the point.'
The talks are regarded as critical if the long-stalled Uruguay Round
negotiations are to be completed successfully by the deadline of December
15. If they succeed, their market access deal could embrace tariff cuts on
manufactured goods such as non-ferrous metals, semiconductors, wood and
paper products, ceramics and glass, and leather goods.
Even more sensitively, it could embrace late US concessions on the year-old
Blair House accord limiting EU exports of subsidised farm goods, and EU
commitments to raise imports of agricultural products.
Negotiators have suggested that agreements are not yet in hand for services
trade, anti-dumping policies and rules regulating subsidies.
Any agreement reached today will be presented by Sir Leon directly to the
special meeting of EU finance and trade ministers. It will simultaneously be
delivered to Gatt in Geneva, where negotiators from the other 114
participants in the Uruguay Round will meet tomorrow to consider the deal.
Gatt officials hope the agreement will lead to improved offers from other
countries, in tariff cuts and in opening their markets to trade in services.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Ferranti calls in receivers after GEC drops offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferranti International, the UK-based defence electronics group and
high-technology leader, went into receivership yesterday when the General
Electric Company withdrew a 1p-a-share rescue offer after examining
Ferranti's books. The move puts at risk 3,700 jobs at factories and offices
around the country.
Although GEC gave no explanation for its decision, it had made its offer
conditional on finding nothing 'materially adverse to the financial
condition or prospects of Ferranti'.
Ferranti's board met yesterday and said in a statement: 'Having carefully
considered with its advisers the alternatives available to it, the board of
Ferranti has now invited the company's bankers to appoint receivers.'
There was speculation that GEC's detailed 'due diligence' inquiries showed
that Ferranti was in worse shape than expected. But other observers noted
that GEC will probably be able to 'cherry pick' any Ferranti assets it wants
for bargain prices from the receivers - without having to assume Ferranti's
debts.
The move marks the end of a three-year battle by Mr Eugene Anderson,
Ferranti's chairman and chief executive, to keep the company afloat.
He joined in 1990 after the discovery of a fraud at International Signal and
Control, the group's US subsidiary, which Ferranti acquired in 1987.
At its peak in the wake of the ISC acquisition, Ferranti had a market value
of Pounds 1bn and was a leading force in the global defence market, with
26,000 employees in a dozen countries and an order book worth more than
Pounds 1.5bn.
Ferranti subsequently disclosed, however, that it had been the victim of
massive fraud. Mr James Guerin, ISC's founder, who had become deputy
chairman of Ferranti, is now serving a 15-year sentence for financial fraud
and illegal arms sales.
The fraud, coupled with the recession and declining defence spending, hit
Ferranti hard. In spite of massive asset sales and job cuts, which reduced
the workforce to just 3,700, the group continued to lose heavily.
Ferranti had been looking for an equity partner for several years and GEC
was finally persuaded to offer a token 1p a share, or Pounds 11.4m, early
last month when it became clear Ferranti could no longer survive as an
independent company.
The 15 banks, led by National Westminster, which are owed about Pounds 100m,
announced that Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen had
been appointed.
Ferranti's shares were suspended at 1p before the start of trading
yesterday. The company's 48,000 shareholders are unlikely to receive
anything.
Although Ferranti still operates successful businesses and had an order book
of about Pounds 165m at September 30, it also has debts and liabilities of
at least Pounds 155m.

FT  02 DEC 93 / Clarke warns of low annual pay rises for public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday called for a permanent break with Britain's
postwar pay bargaining culture as he warned that 5m public sector workers
could expect only 'very modest' increases for the next three years.
In confident mood after the favourable reaction on the Conservative
backbenches to Tuesday's Budget, the chancellor said that higher pay awards
in the public sector could only be financed by efficiency savings.
He offered a strong hint that this would mean a ceiling on pay increases for
most public sector workers of 1 or 2 per cent a year. But other cabinet
ministers suggested that workers in 'politically sensitive' sectors such as
the police, nurses and teachers might expect more.
Mr Clarke's budget package continued to draw wide support from both the
right and left of the Conservative party, despite rumblings among some
backbench MPs about the impact of planned defence cuts.
He moved swiftly to counter angry opposition charges that deep cuts in
benefits for the unemployed and for those on invalidity unveiled by Mr Peter
Lilley marked the beginning of an assault on the welfare state.
Brushing aside the ambitions of some of his rightwing colleagues to shrink
the size of the public sector, Mr Clarke said the basic state pension would
remain a permanent fixture.
He dismissed recent suggestions by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to
the Treasury, that the government might encourage people to 'opt' out of the
basic pension and other fundamental entitlements.
The chancellor's tough line on pay came amid mounting anger among trades
unions that relatively low-paid public sector workers would bear the brunt
of the Budget's squeeze on Whitehall budgets.
Overall, the cuts in the spending targets for the next three years were
judged by Mr Andrew Dilnot, the director of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies, to represent a far tougher policy than anything achieved in the
1980s.
But Mr Clarke insisted that low inflation had transformed the environment in
which wage bargaining would take place and said those in work had to take
account of the interests of almost 3m people who were unemployed.
Arguing that Britain would not have a better opportunity 'in my lifetime' to
achieve permanently low inflation, Mr Clarke challenged the culture of the
1960s and 1970s which had led to the annual pay round.
The new environment had undercut the case for the annual wage round, which
had been started when inflation was at levels which made workers 'markedly
poorer' if their pay was not increased every year.
There were now 'large parts of the private sector' where the whole idea of
the annual pay rise was no longer relevant.

FT  01 DEC 93 / N Korea in new nuclear treaty threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea threatened yesterday to withdraw from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty unless the US conducts a new round of talks with
Pyongyang.
North Korea suspended its threat to pull out of the treaty in July after
holding two rounds of negotiations with Washington on a possible improvement
in relations.
But the US has said a third session will not occur until Pyongyang agrees to
accept routine international inspections of its nuclear facilities and
agrees to resume inter-Korean talks.
North Korea appears to want unilateral talks with the US, without involving
South Korea, in an attempt to win diplomatic recognition and economic aid
from Washington.
South Korean officials accuse Pyongyang of trying to break co-operation
between Washington and Seoul on the nuclear issue by holding separate talks
with Washington.
The statement by the North Korean foreign ministry appeared to be a response
to the declaration issued by the presidents of the US and South Korea in
Washington last week that Pyongyang first had to accept nuclear inspections
and inter-Korean talks before contacts with the US would be resumed.
'We want a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue. But if
the US. . . ends the dialogue, there would be no reason for us to stop our
decision to withdraw from the NPT from taking effect,' the North said.
It also said it was prepared to withstand economic sanctions and other
consequences if the current negotiations to resolve the nuclear issue
collapsed.
'When we decided to withdraw from the NPT, we were prepared for all possible
consequences that our decision entailed. We've compled all preparations to
defend our independence in the face of the worst situation like a war.'
Pyongyang urged Washington to accept a package deal in which the two sides
would make simultaneous concessions to resolve the nuclear issue.
South Korea persuaded the US to reject the package deal concept and instead
focus on winning initial concessions from the North.
However, South Korea's bargaining strategy was criticised this week by its
foreign ministry's Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security.
It implicitly endorsed a package solution, explaining that it would avoid
the 'positional bargaining' that normally occurs in inter-Korean
negotiations.
'There is the belief (between the two Koreas) that withdrawing from an
original position or compromising means defeat or loss of face,' a factor
that has bedevilled past inter-Korean negotiations, the institute said.

FT  01 DEC 93 / General strike call hits peseta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish peseta came under selling pressure yesterday after the country's
two main trade unions confirmed they would call a one-day general strike in
January in protest at the government's resolve to press ahead with labour
market reform without their agreement.
The currency closed in Madrid at Pta82.18 to the D-Mark after having fallen
to Pta82.3 earlier yesterday.
The leaders of the two main unions, the the socialist General Workers Union
(UGT) and the communist Workers Commissions (CCOO) said they would decide on
an exact date for the stoppage at meetings on December 9 and 10.
The strike call is a direct challenge to the political authority of prime
minister Felipe Gonzalez's minority Socialist government. It reflects not
only union anger at reforms that promise to make it easier and cheaper to
hire and fire workers, but also broader union frustration at their inability
to influence policy.
Market analysts were unsure yesterday how badly the peseta might be affected
between now and the strike but a common belief was that the country would
probably not be pushed into another devaluation.
A half-day general strike in protest at jobless benefit cuts failed badly in
the spring of 1992. While a strike call this time might attract a greater
following, the government says it has no intention of softening its proposed
reforms. These are due to be approved at the weekly cabinet meeting in
Madrid this Friday.
The government has been sponsoring efforts to reach agreement on a wide
range of social policy since the general election which Mr Gonzalez narrowly
won last June. The prime minister calculated correctly that while unions,
employers and the government were talking, the markets would ease pressure
on the peseta.
These talks formally ended yesterday with no agreement and Mr Gonzalez,
anticipating failure, had been warning for some weeks that he would impose
his reforms - and begin taxing unemployment benefit for the first time -
with or without a deal.
The unions have taken this as an excuse to accuse the government of
negotiating in bad faith and in the last few weeks strike action had become
inevitable in order for politically ambitious union leaders to save some
face. This will probably be achieved by bringing the country to a halt for a
day in January but is unlikely to make much difference as the government has
been promising to try to bring new labour regulations into force by the end
of this year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Foreign orders lift German gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The gloom enveloping German industry lifted further yesterday with reports
of rising foreign demand in the key mechanical engineering and electrical
and electronics sectors.
New orders for plant and machinery rose in October for the first time since
March 1992, according to the VDMA industry association.
While there was little sign of recovery in the domestic market, where
November engineering orders were 3 per cent lower than a year earlier, the
association said foreign demand surged a real 17 per cent.
A comparison of the three months to the end of October, a measure which
reduces the distorting effects of single large orders, showed total new
orders down 5 per cent on a year earlier. A 6 per cent increase in export
demand was more than cancelled out by a 12 per cent drop in German orders.
Meanwhile, Mr Franz-Josef Wissing, chief executive of the ZVEI association,
representing electrical and electronics companies with annual sales of
DM200bn (Dollars 118bn) said yesterday the low point of the recession had
been reached.
Improving trends in electrical exports, first detected in the spring, had
consolidated in the third quarter, Mr Wissing said.
Foreign orders had climbed almost 7 per cent in the three months to the end
of September compared with an aggregate rise of less than 2 per cent for the
first three quarters.
Foreign demand for electronic components, an important early indicator, had
risen 18.5 per cent in the third quarter, while power generation and
distribution orders were up 11 per cent.
A 25 per cent slump in domestic demand for measuring and automation
technology in the year to the end of September, highlighted the severe
difficulties still being experienced by some parts of the electrical
industry.
However, a sustained improvement in the mechanical engineering sector, an
important area for automation technology manufacturers, could help improve
the situation.
Mr Wissing said capacity utilisation had fallen further to 78 per cent.
Together with continuing pressure on prices this was eating into the
industry's profits.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the former European Union environment commissioner,
said yesterday he had won assurances from the European Commission that
legislation to protect wildlife would not be sacrificed in the review of
Euro-directives to weed out those that do not meet subsidiarity criteria.
Mr Ripa di Meana, who left Brussels last year to become Italian environment
minister, before resigning and becoming a leader of the Greens in Italy,
said he had returned to Brussels to 'sound the alarm' against any roll-back
of environmental legislation.
Wildlife organisations claim that leaks to the European Parliament of draft
Commission proposals show that Brussels is willing to yield on parts of
legislation protecting seals, whales, elephants and species of wild birds.
Mr Ripa di Meana said these were precisely the kinds of measures that
'triggered sympathy, consensus and identification with Europe' among its
citizens by 'stressing what Europeans have in common rather than what
divides them'.

The Belgian presidency of the European Union has called for a serious
pan-European debate on the sensitive question of how to harmonise national
extradition procedures within the Union. EU justice ministers discussed
extradition at their meeting yesterday. EU leaders will consider the issue
at their summit in Brussels next week.
Mr Melchior Wathelet, Belgian justice minister, said: 'We have to clean up
our extradition laws. We have adopted a resolution saying that all our
taboos must be put on the table for negotiation.'
He said in some countries extradition laws were more than a century old and
needed to be reformed to take into account political and legal changes. For
example, Belgian extradition requests are rejected by certain EU member
states because Belgium retains the death penalty, although it is never used.
He hoped there could be some overall agreement to modify national
extradition rules by the end of 1994.
EU justice ministers also agreed that plans to broaden the scope of Europol,
the new Europe-wide police unit, should be finalised by October.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Poll ban held off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<TEXT>
The Russian election commission last night postponed a decision on a call
from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a first deputy premier, to ban the Communist
party and the Democratic party from further participation in the election
campaign because of their criticism of the draft constitution.
The draft, which will be voted on in a referendum to be held on the same day
as the elections - December 12 - has become increasingly controversial since
President Boris Yeltsin threatened to deprive parties of the right to appear
on TV if they criticised it.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Personal annuities on par with staff schemes -
Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax rules for approved pension schemes are to change. One aim is to make
personal pension scheme annuities taxable on the same basis as pensions paid
by occupational pension schemes.
Another is to improve arrangements for monitoring the tax affairs of
occupational pension schemes to ensure that the conditions on which tax
reliefs are given continue to be met. The government also wants to remove a
requirement for the Inland Revenue to approve the form of certain annuity
contracts before they can be marketed to occupational pension schemes by
insurance companies.
The Inland Revenue said yesterday that the purpose of the changes was to
improve the operation of the tax regime for approved pension schemes.
At the moment, annuities paid by approved personal pension schemes are
treated as annual payments, so that basic rate income tax is deducted from
each instalment. For some people on small incomes too much tax is deducted
and they have to reclaim the tax overpaid.
Mr Clarke intends to change the basis of the charge for those annuities from
Schedule D to Schedule E, bringing them within the PAYE system and allowing
the correct amount of tax to be deducted from each annuity payment. This
change will bring the taxation of personal pension annuities into line with
those payable under occupational pension schemes, and will apply in general
to annuities paid after April 6, 1995.
Once pension schemes have been approved for tax purposes they are monitored
by the Inland Revenue's Pension Schemes Office to see if they continue to
comply with the conditions on which tax approval was granted. The Commons
Public Accounts Committee has recommended improvements to the nature and
extent of these compliance checks. In response to the PAC report
post-approval compliance work has been expanded.
The purpose of the Budget proposal is to improve the effectiveness of this
compliance work. The Finance Bill will provide for regulations to be made
which will define clearly the identity of the person who is responsible for
looking after the tax affairs of an approved scheme, and specify more
clearly the records which that person must keep.
The Bill will also introduce a monetary penalty on people who make false
statements in order to obtain the benefits of the pensions tax reliefs.
One of the ways in which trustees of an occupational pension scheme can
secure the benefits to be paid to a person who leaves the scheme before
retirement age is through an approved deferred-annuity contract (often
called 'buy-out contracts'). Under the Budget proposal, the requirement that
these buy-out contracts must be in an approved form will be removed from
July 1 1994. This will bring the tax rules into line with the requirements
of the Third Life Insurance Directive (one of a series of directives
implementing the single market in financial services throughout the European
Union).
New procedures, which have been discussed with pensions representative
bodies, will ensure that the present flexible options available to pension
scheme members can continue.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Jobseekers' allowance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday described the proposed new Jobseeker's Allowance -
to replace income support and unemployment benefit from 1996 - as 'a
simpler, clearer system for unemployed people and a more effective way of
helping them back to work.'
Three pilot schemes were announced: the Jobfinder's Grant, for those finding
a job after being out of work for two years or more; an extended jobsearch
and assessment course for young people, and a scheme involving providing the
jobless with caseworkers to help identify the best way out of unemployment.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Extension to gift replacement - Tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The period for replacement of lifetime gifts of property qualifying for
business or agricultural relief has been extended from one to three years
for charges arising as a result of deaths on or after today.
The Chancellor's intention is to bring the replacement period for business
and agricultural relief into line with that for capital gains tax rollover
relief.
Where someone receives a lifetime gift of business or agricultural property,
the property can be sold and, provided it is replaced within a year,
business or agricultural relief will be available in the normal way. The
extension to three years is in line with that for capital gains tax rollover
relief.
Sections 113 and 124 Inheritance Tax Act 1984 provide that when a lifetime
gift of property qualifying for business or agricultural relief is made less
than seven years before the donor's death, the donee loses relief if he or
she sells the property within that period. However, relief is still
available if the donee acquires a qualifying replacement property within one
year of the sale. The new rules will give donees more time to do so.
The Chancellor also proposes to make two improvements in the taxation rules
affecting debts given up by creditors in the context of voluntary
arrangements made under the 1986 Insolvency Act.
The rules will be amended to make it easier for a creditor to obtain relief
for trade debts given up as part of a voluntary arrangement. For the debtor,
the amount given up by a creditor will no longer be brought into charge to
tax.
The Chancellor's intention is to remove tax barriers to voluntary
arrangements, which can allow businesses to continue to trade through a
period of financial difficulty. The changes will take effect from today.
First, the present rules governing the computation of taxable trading
profits may sometimes prevent full relief being given for debts released by
creditors in the context of a voluntary arrangement. In future, a trade
creditor will not be denied relief solely because the creditor could have
been expected to recover more of the debt by putting the debtor into
liquidation or bankruptcy. The change will apply to debts released from
today.
Second, the effect of the present rules is that if a deduction for a debt
has been given against a debtor's trading profits, and subsequently a
creditor formally gives up all or part of that debt, the amount given up is
added to the debtor's trading profits and is chargeable to tax. From today,
debts given up as part of a voluntary arrangement under the Insolvency Act
1986 will not be brought into the charge to tax in this way.
The cost of the two measures will depend on the number of debts given up
under voluntary arrangements but is not expected to be large.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Change in resource accounting method - Red Book
details
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor of the exchequer has announced proposals for an important
change in the way government departments account for public money which will
provide a better measure of the resources which departments are using. The
approach will be similar to that employed in the private sector and in those
parts of the public sector - including executive agencies and the National
Health Service - which already make use of accruals-based accounting.
In a resource accounting framework
expenditure represents the cost of resources consumed each year, taking into
account the depreciation of assets and the cost of capital, and changes in
the level of creditors and stocks;
income represents what is received each year, taking into account changes in
the level of debtors.
Resource accounting should be viewed as a development of cash accounting,
not as an alternative system. It can thus be used to generate as much
information on departments' cash flow as is necessary for essential public
expenditure planning and control purposes.
The proposed move to resource accounting is part of the development of a
more strategic relationship between the centre of government and departments
and agencies, following principles originally set down in the Financial
Management Initiative in 1982. Linked to parallel changes in a department's
organisational structure and management information systems, resource
accounting will help departments manage their finances and resources more
effectively, and facilitate the further development of measures of
departmental output and performance.
It is proposed that departments should introduce resource accounting over
the next 3-5 years. The chancellor will publish detailed proposals in the
first half of 1994. In the meantime, further work is being done with
departments to establish:
the framework of accounting principles and conventions, based on private
sector practice, that is required;
the handling of various practical issues (information technology systems,
staff training, etc) associated with developing resource accounting in
departments;
the implications for public expenditure planning and control arrangements;
and
the parliamentary implications of any changes.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Private finance given key role - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced that motorway tolling would be introduced
once the electronic technology was ready.
In the meantime, the Department of Transport plans to promote new-style
contracts to allow private contractors to design, build, finance and operate
roads.
The promoters of private sector roads will receive 'shadow toll' payments
from the government in relation to the level of traffic which uses the new
or improved roads.
The department of transport expects to award the first contracts in about 18
months.
Yesterday's Budget also marked a modest shift in the balance of transport
spending away from roads and towards rail and underground.
If the government succeeds in attracting private finance for new large
infrastructure projects, then public transport should benefit even further.
Spending on British Rail and London Underground will be maintained at higher
levels than in the 1980s but there will be a modest reduction in the
provision for the road programme, the chancellor announced.
The average cost of road contracts has fallen by 25 per cent since 1989 so
programmes can be carried out at less cost, he said.
The reduction in the cost of investment programmes has accounted for most of
the fall in the Department of Transports spending estimates from Pounds 18bn
in the three years to 1995 to Pounds 17bn in the three years to 1996.
The capital investment programme nevertheless still includes Pounds 8bn of
planned spending on roads, Pounds 3bn for London Transport and Pounds 3bn
for rail, including Pounds 1.8bn earmarked for Railtrack, which will own and
operate track and signalling.
That means that 40 per cent of transport spending goes to buses, rail and
underground although they account for only 14 per cent of passenger
journeys, the department said.
According to the department's three-year projections, spending on the
national roads network will now fall from Pounds 2.09bn in this financial
year to Pounds 1.96bn in 1995-96.
Spending on rail will fall from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 975m while London
Transport will rise from Pounds 722m to Pounds 930m. London Transport will
be allowed to keep the proceeds of the sale of London Buses.
The three main public-private sector projects to be announced yesterday were
for the modernisation of the West coast mainline with the help of between
Pounds 400m-Pounds 600m of private sector funds, the building of a Pounds
200m air traffic control centre in Scotland, and a Pounds 150m extension of
the Docklands Light Railway to Lewisham.
Two further public/private sector initiatives which were announced are for
British Rail and Railtrack to be allowed to retain and to invest half of the
proceeds of rail privatisation, up to a maximum of Pounds 200m. The
government will also seek further private finace for the Civil Aviation
Authority's investment programme.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Support for loan scheme - Student grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative MPs gave firm support to the decision to increase the scope of
the higher education loans scheme and reduce student grants.
The changes were strongly criticised by opposition MPs. They claimed poorer
students would be deterred from higher education, while others would be
forced into debt.
Mrs Angela Knight, a Conservative MP with a special interest in education,
said it was right and proper that students should contribute to their living
costs.
'We give a world class university education in this country which gives
students qualifications and the opportunity to get much better jobs.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, said the changes amounted to
a breach of contract between the government and existing students, who would
be left 'high and dry at a time of increasing hardship'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Modernisation of west coast rail planned - Pounds
600m cost of updating Victorian link with London will be privately financed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today the government will announce plans for a Pounds 600m privately
financed modernisation of Britain's west coast railway line,to the relief of
industrialists in north-west England and Scotland.
An original Victorian artefact, the line links London with the industrial
cities of Birmingham and Manchester and the ports of Liverpool and Glasgow.
However it has too many bends, unstable banks in cuttings, old rail bridges
over roads, road bridges over rails, and outmoded brick tunnels.
These have prevented high-speed trains using the line, keeping typical
journey times up at 2 hours, 40 minutes or more between Manchester or
Liverpool and London.
The result is a deterrent to inward investment and relocation, according to
agencies responsible for wooing footloose industry.
The prospects of using the UK as a land bridge to the rest of the European
Union via Liverpool and the Channel Tunnel are also affected.
There was a warm welcome for yesterday's announcement at KPMG Peat Marwick's
budget-watching party, where most north-west industrial leaders gathered.
Industrialists were cynical, however, at the prospects of funds being
readily forthcoming.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Recruitment: The most sensitive selection tool - Skilful
interviewing still offers advantages that more scientific methods of
assessment lack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Please suppose - unless, of course, you happen to be one - that you are an
expert recruitment interviewer. Suppose also that you are vetting two men
for a selling job, first A then B, both shown to be suitable by well reputed
tests of reasoning and personality, as well as by their claimed experience.
In their interviews, they behave as follows:
A is impassive, rarely nodding in response to your questions and remarks. He
also seems nervous, speaking mostly in a rather high-pitched voice, which
occasionally slips into a lower tone that sounds more natural, and several
times stumbling over words even though he speaks slowly.
B is more genial, frequently smiling, nodding and otherwise showing great
interest in what you say, an impression that he strengthens by looking you
straight in the eye. His own speech is relaxed and fluent, and he is adept
at circumventing potential disagreements.
Being an expert interviewer, you know what each of them is probably up to.
That much is clear from the research findings set out in the book Successful
Selection Interviewing*, whose *Blackwell, Pounds 19.95.
lead author is Neil Anderson of Nottingham University. The signs are that
both candidates are falling short of total honesty, albeit in different
ways.
A has the classic marks of the 'deceiver', who is telling lies. B is
probably just being economical with the truth. He has the mien of the
'ingratiator' who seeks to make you like him, and so blind yourself to
evidence of his faults.
In both cases, your expertise enables you to confirm the signs as the
interviews proceed. But the important question is what weight you should
give to their different types of deviousness in deciding which one to
appoint to the job.
While inexpert interviewers would be likely to reject both, your
professional reading has covered various studies that show that a tendency
to be less than wholly honest is a boon in some occupations. Besides
politics, they include selling - the type of job you need to fill.
Since that applies especially to the sort of deviousness used by B, the odds
are that his ingratiating behaviour is a plus. Moreover even the bald lying
done by A in the interview doesn't necessarily make him a bad bet.
After all, he was depicted as suitable by the psychometric tests, and the
well-reputed types of personality test include lie-detectors that research
has proved to be highly effective. So the prima facie evidence is that A did
not tell lies in his written answers to the test, but changed to distorting
the truth only when talking with you face-to-face. And while that in itself
is hardly a golden recommendation, it raises questions that you as an expert
interviewer will want to explore.
For example, did you slip up professionally by doing something early in the
meeting that made him decide to lie? If not, did anything happen between the
test and your first seeing him that might have had the same effect. . . and
so on?
All of which illustrates that when it comes to selecting people for jobs,
interviewing offers a capability that is increasingly overlooked. As Dr
Anderson observes, in their enthusiasm for more modern methods such as
psychometric tests, professional recruiters as well as researchers in the
field now tend to look down on interviewing as being merely a less reliable
method of essentially the same kind.
But while that may be so in the case of bad interviewing, it is not true of
the skilful sort, which is a different sort of tool. Unlike tests that
merely detect human oddity, good interviewers can tease out the reasons
behind it. What's more, they can influence an outstanding candidate into
joining their company instead of going to work somewhere else.
Now to the table alongside, which shows a few of the findings of Day
Associates' latest survey of pay and perks in City of London banks. Carried
out early last month, it is based on data from 124 employing outfits and
includes 307 jobs, high to low. Anyone wanting the full report, priced at
Pounds 220, should contact Joe Clark at Suite 2.31, Whitechapel Technology
Centre, 75 White-chapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel (0)71 375 1397, fax (0)71-375
1723.
The table's first four columns of figures cover basic salaries. The lower
quartile refers to the person a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of
all in the same type of job, the median to the person midway, and the upper
quartile to the one a quarter from the top. Then we have the average salary,
followed by the percentage of it typically received as an added bonus.
Lastly comes something different. Whereas my previous extracts from Day's
surveys have given data on company cars, this time I've focused on the car
allowances in growing vogue. Even so, the percentages in the upper part of
the table are made to look unrealistically high by the fact that the survey
samples for the best-paid posts, as well as for the personnel directors'
job, are small.

FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: BICC strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC was the outstanding performer in the heavy electricals/contracting area
of the market. Dealers focused on the government's commitment to three new
major infrastructure exercises: the Lewisham extension of the Docklands
Light Railway, the West Coast electrification project and the construction
of a new air traffic control centre in Scotland.
'The removal of budget uncertainties over UK road spending has left the way
clear for BICC to hit 450p,' said Mr Mustapha Omar of Williams de Broe, the
stockbroker. BICC ended 22 higher at 404p.
Selected drinks stocks enjoyed a pre-Budget bounce, with analysts predicting
that the decision not to raise excise duties on most drinks will be good for
short-term sentiment.
Bass, reporting results today, advanced 10 to 503p and Grand Metropolitan,
with figures out tomorrow, put on 4 at 413p. Guinness moved forward 9 to
469p and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 12 to 500p.
There was a mixture of relief and disappointment among stores analysts. The
lack of VAT increase or extension came as a relief to many stocks, although
too late to affect yesterday's action. Booksellers such as WH Smith 'A', 5
higher at 490p, and J. Menzies, off a penny at 541p, could be subject to
some relief.
However, some analysts expressed disappointment that there was not more of a
boost to consumer spending. On the other hand, many now believe that the
lack of nasty surprises yesterday leaves the way clear for a strong seasonal
run-up to Christmas.
The clearing banks and the merchant banking sectors staged a smart leap
forward ahead of and during the Budget speech, with both areas regarded by
analysts as beneficiaries of what was initially viewed as 'a market-boosting
Budget'.
Barclays, up 14 at 584p, and Lloyds, 13 stronger at 593p, spearheaded the
high street banks. A substantial profits upgrade by one broking house drove
Kleinwort Benson sharply higher and prompted equally strong performances
from other leading merchant banks, which were additionally boosted by
another sparkling performance by the equity and gilts markets.
Kleinwort shares raced up 15 to 523p, SG Warburg jumped the same amount to
857p and Hambros advanced 17 to 372p. Smith New Court, one of the leading
trading houses in the City, climbed 16 to a record 410p ahead of interim
figures expected on December 7.
The regional electricity companies' interim dividend race got under way,
with Eastern Electricity sprinting into a strong lead and surprising all but
the most optimistic utilities analysts by posting a 20 per cent rise in its
half-year payment. Most analysts' forecasts were bunched around the 6.2p
dividend mark, which would have represented a 13 per cent increase, although
UBS was bang on in forecasting the 6.6p.
Eastern's generous payment saw the shares appreciate 8 to 596p, prompting
rises from all the other recs. South Wales, the next of the recs to announce
interim figures, on December 7 along with Midlands Electricity, rose 7 to
648p and the latter 5 to 612p.
Water stocks, on the other hand, tended to lose ground, partly because of
switching operations into the recs. Anglian slipped 4 to 530p.
Broadcasting shares continued to be buoyed by bid premiums following
Carlton's Pounds 768m agreed offer for Central Television on Monday. The
former added 34 at 831p, while the latter surged 73 to 2546p. LWT, strongly
rumoured to be the next target, jumped 12 to 591p. Granada Group, the likely
predator, put on 10 at 473p. Scottish TV rose 23 to 489p.
Poor results from Dawson International sent the shares tumbling 37 to 136p
and also hit Coutaulds Textiles, 8 cheaper at 207p.
Analysts reported a generally satisfactory meeting with Glaxo and the shares
moved up 5 1/2 to 676 1/2 p.
There was strong support for Cadbury-Schweppes as the stock benefited from
several broker recommendations. The shares surged 14 1/2 to 465 1/2 p.
Unilever was also in demand, gaining 16 at 1137p, with NatWest Securities
and Strauss Turnbull said to be recommending the shares.

FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Composites falter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The imposition of a 3 per cent duty on premiums on general insurance,
excluding reinsurance and marine and aviation business, triggered a general
markdown of the composite insurers.
However, Mr Peter Constable, insurance specialist at Robert Fleming
Securities, said the Budget, overall, would have only a minimal impact on
the composites, which would be boosted by positive implications for gilts
and equities from the chancellor's assumptions on GDP. 'The sector has had a
good run and may possibly give back some of those gains,' he added.
The recent spate of buy recommendations in the composite sector continued to
drive General Accident shares, which settled 20 1/2 higher at 667 1/2 p on
heavy turnover of 2.1m. Commercial Union, however, closed marginally easier
at 606 1/2 p, while Guardian Royal Exchange could manage only a 1 1/2 gain
at 208 1/2 p. Royal Insurance settled 6 up at 305p, and Sun Alliance was
similarly firmer at 369 1/2 p.
Confirmation of recent market speculation that there would be no big shift
on pensisons and life assurance was seen as a further big plus for the life
stocks, where Legal &amp; General moved up 4 1/2 to 521p.

FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airline stocks hit by levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airline stocks suffered a torrid five minutes at the market finale yesterday
as the chancellor announced the imposition of an airport tax from next
October. Dealers quickly marked down related shares as investors rushed to
sell, with backwardations - a situation when offer prices on the screen are
below bid prices from other marketmakers - in both British Airways and BAA.
Transport analysts were unwilling to estimate the effect of the measure on
BA, the UK's largest carrier, although some suggested that yesterday's
electric response was overdone, adding that the shares had enjoyed a good
run in recent weeks.
BA shares, initially higher, finished a net 8 down at 420p. On Wall Street,
BA continued to slide. Airport operator BAA's sharp rise during earlier
trading in London was scythed by the 4.25 pm announcement, the stock closing
just 2 up at 929p, after 939p.
Elsewhere, tour operator Airtours weakened 6 to 435p, while rival Owners
Abroad slipped 3 to 75p.
Benefiting from the fallout was P&amp;O, the ferry company, which forged ahead
17 to 608p. The stock also gained from a survey indicating consumer concern
over using the Channel tunnel.

FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index braced to challenge
its peak - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's first unified Budget was warmly received on the London stock
market yesterday. Share prices moved ahead sharply during the speech from Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and traders predicted that
the FT-SE 100 Index will challenge its all-time peak of 3,199 when trading
commences this morning.
Lower than anticipated tax increases and a hard line on public spending
provided 'the best possible combination for both equities and government
bonds', commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. The stock market was
particularly pleased that there was no sign of the feared attack on the
pension funds, in the shape of changes in advance corporation tax or foreign
dividends, and the brewing, publishing and book retailing sectors were
jubilant at favourable VAT and excise duty references in the Budget speech.
Optimism in the equity market was boosted by a strong rise in government
bond prices, which had been fairly quiet until the chancellor began to
speak.
Among the few less happy areas were airline and overseas tourist stocks,
which suffered from the chancellor's tax moves. Share quotations for both
British Airways and BAA fell briefly into confusion as the Budget speech
appeared on the trading screens. Non-life insurance stocks were restrained
by the imposition of 3 per cent duty on general insurance premiums, but
analysts were wary of tracking individual companies until the picture
becomes more clear.
At the official close, the FT-SE Index was 31.1 up at 3,166.9, with Mr
Clarke still speaking in the House of Commons. There was no further official
trading in equities last night but the December contract on the Footsie
reached 3,190, indicating that the FT-SE Index itself would open 15-20
points higher this morning.
The stock market was moving ahead from the opening of business yesterday
morning and showed a gain of 25.4 on the Footsie at mid-session.
Profit-takers then moved in ahead of the Budget speech, trimming the Footsie
gain to 11.7 points before Mr Clarke rose to his feet.
The recovery came quickly, with the Footsie putting on around ten points in
the first ten minutes of the chancellor's speech. At best, the Footsie was
up by 32.9 points, with most of the best news coming too late for share
trading.
Traders expect a strong opening today in brewery shares, with Bass at the
head, and in paper and book retailers such as WH Smith. Stores and consumer
issues are also likely to open stronger after firmness in sterling following
the Budget speech appeared to confirm expectations that base rates can be
cut again before Christmas. There were also gains among the stocks of quoted
marketmaking firms, which benefit from high levels of interest and turnover
in the stock market. Several leading marketmakers were believed to be taking
strongly bullish stances last night.
Throughout the session, merchant bank issues continued to forge ahead as
analysts weighed the implications for sector profitability of the continued
strength and activity in financial securities markets.
Seaq trading volume, curtailed by the pause ahead of the chancellor's
speech, fell to 576.4m shares from the 687.8m of the previous session.
Retail or customer business on Monday was worth Pounds 1.53bn, maintaining
the prolonged run of highly profitable levels of trading in UK equities.

FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives markets provided one of the few areas in which would-be
investors in UK equities could register their opinion of the Budget speech
yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
The December Footsie future was active in after-hours' trading, successfully
warding off minor profit-taking to show a final reading of 3,190, a premium
of 20 points against the official close on the cash market.
With fair value now estimated at around 2 points, even less in some
quarters, the contract was signalling a strong start for share prices today.
Trading volume, brisk ahead of Mr Clarke's speech, increased sharply as he
addressed the House of Commons, and the December contract finally returned
total turnover of just above 20,000 deals, the highest for many months.
Many of the late deals reflected position-taking by equity marketmakers
ahead of today's opening of business in the stock market. Earlier in the
session, the contract had moved from 3,150, with a pause for profit-taking
in the early afternoon. Traders expressed caution at the close, commenting
that equity prices would be vulnerable today if there were any sign of
demand slackening.
In traded options, business was moderate, and died away before the
chancellor spoke. Volume of 45,791 contracts compared with 47,118 on Monday.
The Euro FT-SE option topped the actives list, recording 3,834 deals.
Among individual stock options, Lasmo (3,215 lots traded) had another busy
day as oil prices weakened. British Steel (2,722), BP (2,611) and GEC
(1,256) were also active.

FT  01 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good economic news leaves
equities mixed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices were mixed yesterday as Wall Street struggled to shrug off a
setback in the bond market and focus instead on evidence of improving
economic conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.15 at 3,683.95, but
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.11 easier at 461.79. In
the secondary markets, the American SE composite lost 0.66 at 460.03, but
the Nasdaq composite gained 2.85 at 754.39 after reversing an earlier
downward trend. NYSE volume was 286m shares.
The uncertain mood which has dominated Wall Street recently was underscored
by investors' jittery reaction to the first in a series of economic reports
this week which are expected to indicate robust growth during the final
three months of the year.
Stock prices dipped immediately after the release of the Conference Board's
index of consumer confidence, which surged to 71.2 this month, compared with
a consensus forecast of about 60. Separately, the index of business activity
by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago showed one of the
biggest monthly gains in the survey's 25-year history.
The fresh data served to exacerbate anxieties among bond traders, who fear
the economy's gathering strength could be a signal of higher inflation. In
late trading the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue had fallen nearly a
point to 99 9/32 , yielding 6.298 per cent.
But the mood on Wall Street was not as bleak as in the bond market, and
equity prices began to inch higher as the morning progressed. By early
afternoon the Dow Industrial index was up nearly 20 points, before slipping
to leave a more modest gain at the close.
With crude oil prices firming after hitting a three-year low on Monday,
energy shares regained lost ground. Exxon was Dollars 1 better at Dollars 62
3/4 and Amoco gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 . Atlantic Richfield,
up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 103 3/4 , and Mobil, Dollars 1 1/8 firmer at
Dollars 76 1/8 , were given an extra lift when investment analysts raised
ratings on the issues.
By contrast, transport companies, which are the heaviest users of petroleum
products, gave back some of their recent gains. AMR, parent of American
Airlines, lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 66 7/8 and Delta shed Dollars  7/8
to Dollars 58 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 27 1/8 after
better than expected earnings for the third quarter. Technology Solutions
added Dollars 1 at Dollars 9 after its directors approved a stock repurchase
plan.
Canada
Toronto showed no clear trend in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index, after
Monday's drop, closed 9.9 ahead at 4,180.2, but falls led rises by 423 to
383 after volume of 57.6m shares valued at CDollars 709.8m. Golds and
conglomerates rose 1.55 and 1.33 per cent respectively.

FT  01 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong rebounds 1.3%
as index futures surge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the Pacific Rim markets were helped ahead by Tokyo's firmer tone.
HONG KONG staged a strong rebound, with the Hang Seng index 112.44, or 1.3
per cent, higher at 9,125.21, as the market was buoyed by a surge in index
futures. But turnover contracted to HKDollars 4.55bn from Monday's HKDollars
5.58bn.
The index tumbled on Monday amid fears that the government might introduce
Governor Chris Patten's political reform package at a meeting of the
Executive Council yesterday. Reports that the council had given the go-ahead
for the introduction of part of the democratic reform bill came after the
market closed.
Bank of East Asia topped the actives list, climbing HKDollars 1.75 to
HKDollars 44. HSBC rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 85.50 and Hang Seng Bank
added HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 58.50.
After the market closed, the government announced that it had awarded new
telecommunications licences to units of Hutchison, Wharf and New World.
Hutchison was steady at HKDollars 31, Wharf was up 40 cents at HKDollars
26.90 and New World gained 40 cents at HKDollars 27.30. HK Telecom, which
will lose its monopoly on domestic conventional telecommunications in 1995,
rose 30 cents to HKDollars 14.70.
TAIWAN finished lower on profit-taking after Monday's 5.3 per cent surge,
although optimism after the ruling Nationalist party's victory in elections
last week continued to support shares.
The market index shed 30.61 to 4,353.90 in a large turnover of TDollars
47.2bn. Heavy profit-taking, particularly in financials, was attributed to
recent weakness in Tokyo and Hong Kong.
SEOUL took a turn for the better, after four straight sessions of declines,
on renewed demand for export-orientated blue chip manufacturing issues. The
composite index rose 6.52 to 811.06 in Won687.6bn turnover, up from Monday's
Won618.8bn.
Demand for the blue chips was attributed to better than expected
third-quarter GNP growth, improving industrial output and current account
surpluses for the second consecutive month.
NEW ZEALAND was easier as investors paused to assess the new cabinet,
although a late buying spurt took the market off its low for the day. The
NZSE-40 capital index finished 20.93 down at 2,021.62, having dipped to
2,008.80 earlier.
Turnover was still reasonably high at NZDollars 85.75m.
The late demand was largely confined to Fletcher Challenge, which
appreciated 7 cents to NZDollars 4.07, Carter Holt Harvey, which ended only
3 cents off at NZDollars 3.43, and Telecom, a net 9 cents down at NZDollars
3.90.
AUSTRALIA was marginally weaker after bargain hunters lifted the market off
early morning lows. The All Ordinaries index finished 0.9 off at 2,009.4
after a day's low of 1,994.8.
Among leading shares, News Corp rose 15 cents to ADollars 9.83, while BHP
shed 10 to ADollars 16.40.
SINGAPORE closed easier, but afternoon sentiment was lifted by the healthy
rebound in Tokyo and investors returning to buy speculative Malaysian shares
traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 2.78 at
2,096.14 after setting an intraday low of 2,090.73.
KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by strong demand for utilities, with sentiment
boosted by the rebound in Tokyo and Hong Kong. The composite index climbed
24.35 to 996.45.
Tenaga and Telekom firmed 80 cents each to MDollars 16.40 and MDollars 19.20
respectively.
KARACHI advanced after seven successive days of falls, the KSE 100-share
index firming 8.35 to 1,691.79.
BANGKOK closed at the day's high after local mutual funds bought bank,
finance and brokerage shares in the afternoon. The SET index gained 14.44,
or 1.11 per cent, at 1,309.95 in thin turnover of nearly Bt8bn.
JAKARTA ended on a mixed note, although sentiment was positive on selected
stocks. The official index was 1.68 lower at 518.78.
SHANGHAI B shares continued to lose ground amid worries that the market
would head even lower on fears that US fund managers were losing some of
their appetite for Asian stocks. The B index slipped 1.31 to 81.42.

FT  01 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent caught in
consolidation mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were many stories but few themes among the markets yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT came off its intraday high but the DAX index still showed positive
form as it closed 14.34 higher at 2,057.77. The index moved between a high
of 2,061.45 and a low of 2,050.60.
Attention continued to be directed towards Thyssen which is due to release
its results today. The shares added DM5.00 to DM237.50 as one German broker
lifted its recommendation on the company.
Going in the opposite direction was Heidelberger Zement, off DM15 at DM1,165
as it reported a slight rise in nine month turnover.
AMSTERDAM advanced a notch helped by a strong recovery in the shares of
Royal Dutch which has been dropping back in recent days on the falling price
for world oil. The CBS Tendency index added 0.8 or 0.6 per cent to 136.9 as
the international put on Fl 3.50 to Fl 194.70.
Philips took a dip, off 70 cents to Fl 37.40, on reports which suggested
further difficulties with partners involved in CD-I technology.
MILAN edged higher although the advance was restrained a weaker lira and
bond market. The Comit index advanced 4.67 to 548.56.
The mood was also inhibited by political worries ahead of this weekend's
second round of local elections, passage of the budget and the start of
privatisation of Credito Italiano next week.

edged 0.3 higher to 2,738.5.
CS Holding added SFr45 to SFr3,595 and SBC was SFr8 higher at SFr480 with
the latest warrant issue on a bank basket drawing attention to the sector.

FT  01 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Tokyo): Nikkei gains 2% on government
pledges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Concerted efforts by government ministers pledging economic measures to help
the weak economy boosted confidence, and the Nikkei average, which plunged
to a year's low on Monday, advanced 2 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei, which has suffered heavy selling from arbitrageurs, dealers,
corporations and banks during the past month, regained 327.83 at 16,406.54,
after a day's range of 16,004.00 and 16,505.15. The Topix index of all first
section stocks, which dropped 5.2 per cent in the previous session, improved
23.58, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,374.06. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 3.94 to 1,113.79.
Volume totalled 320m shares, against 372m on Monday, while advances led
declines by 691 to 323, with 101 issues unchanged.
The 225-issue Nikkei average has lost 18 per cent since October 26, when the
government listed East Japan Railway, the direct catalyst for the fall. The
stock yesterday picked up by Y15,000 to Y415,000.
Selling accelerated last week when investors took their cue from bad interim
earnings figures at the country's leading banks.
Renewed fears over the stability of the financial system emerged, as 11
commercial banks posted a 22.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the
first half of the year to September, while long term credit banks reported a
10.1 per cent decline. The total of bad loans reached Y13,800bn at 21
leading banks, up 7.7 per cent from last March.
A fall in bank prices fuelled fears over a freefall in stock prices, since a
sharp retreat in the banking sector heralded the stock market's plunge in
August last year, when the Nikkei hit a six-year low of 14,309.41. The
banking index has dropped 14.7 per cent over the past week, while leading
banks such as Industrial Bank of Japan have lost 16.9 per cent.
Investors still fear that a repeat of last year's fall would severely damage
business confidence, as Japanese companies, including banks, heavily rely on
unrealised profits on shareholdings as a buffer against weak profits.
Government ministers yesterday tried to ease the alarm, by addressing the
stock market's weakness, and stressing the need for stimulatory measures.
While ministers said they would not directly intervene in the market to
shore up prices, they pledged to boost the economy.
Ms Manae Kubota, director general for the economic planning agency, said the
economy needed an expansionary budget and tax cuts, while Mr Yasushi Mieno,
Bank of Japan governor, said he was ready to take further monetary action if
the real economy demanded.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, and Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of
international trade and industry, met to discuss measures to strengthen the
economy. While no concrete plans were announced, the two ministers said the
government would consider easing the burden of land transfer taxes and
increase tax breaks for land deals.
In spite of the calls from leading ministers, investors remain cautious over
the stock market's direction.
The weak economy, worsening corporate profits, and the absence of public
funds, which lifted the market from its lows earlier this year, mean that
investors have little reason to buy.
Mr Alex Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley, expects the market to fall at
least to last year's low, and even to the Nikkei 12,000 level, if the
government fails to implement economic stimulus.
Data released yesterday further deepened prevailing gloom over an economic
recovery. Industrial output fell 5.1 per cent from the previous month in
October, the sharpest drop on record, while the country's unemployment rate
rose to 2.7 per cent in October, the highest for nearly six years.
Analysts believe that a combination of an income tax reduction, further
monetary easing, and government aid for the banks, is crucial for a market
recovery.
However, even if the government manages to formulate such measures,
implementation is likely to be early next year.
Investors will need to wait until the political reform bill passes through
the upper house during this parliamentary session, when Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa will finally be ready to make decisions over the economy.
Among individual stocks, export-orientated companies performed well, as the
yen settled at its lowest level against the dollar in four months. Hitachi
rose Y26 to Y768, Toshiba Y55 to Y655, Matsushita Electric Industrial Y60 to
Y1,360, NEC Y12 to Y774, and Fujitsu Y32 to Y722.
In the car sector, Toyota Motor strengthened Y110 to Y1,640, Nissan Motor
Y22 to Y605 and Honda Motor Y30 to Y1,370.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Sterling up on Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling gained around  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark in late European
trading yesterday after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, announced
unexpected reductions in the government's spending plans for the next
financial year, writes James Blitz.
Strong fiscal rectitude was the key theme of Mr Clarke's first Budget. He
announced that public spending would be lower in each of the next three
years than the ceilings set by the cabinet in June.
He also announced progressive reductions in the public sector borrowing
requirement, phasing out borrowing to finance current spending by 1997-98.
These broad goals were well received by traders in sterling and UK
government bonds. At the start of the chancellor's speech, the pound was
trading at DM2.5450. It rose to DM2.5500 before closing a net  1/2 pfennig
up at DM2.5475.
Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, expected
the Budget to give sterling good support over the next few days.
In particular, he was impressed by the political skill of the chancellor's
speech. He pointed out that there had been a generous package to compensate
pensioners for VAT on fuel. The squeeze on invalidity benefit, though one of
the more politically sensitive measures, had also been skilfully presented.
However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, warned that the
PSBR projections were too reliant on high expectations of growth to be
realistic. He said that 3 per cent growth would push the economy too close
to a balance of payments constraint.
If sterling failed to make more headway, it may have been because of the
general strength of the D-Mark against all European currencies.
In part, this was due to the Bundesbank's decision to set an unchanged
two-week fixed rate repo at 6.25 per cent.
The decision to introduce a fixed rate repo was unsurprising, considering
the recent volatility in German money market interest rates.
The Bundesbank has been trying to suppress the end-of-month scramble for
funds by issuing Paragraph 17 funds and short term liquidity through a
variety of instruments.
Against this background, a variable rate repo - which allows banks to state
the rate at which they will buy funds - could not have been expected.
This trend was offset by comments towards the end of the day from Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the new Bundesbank president, which helped to depress the D-Mark.
He said the Bundesbank would explore the potential for lower interest rates
in the future in agreement with its policy of monetary stability.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments helped to depress the D-Mark at the end of a day
when it had been a good deal firmer against European currencies.
The French franc closed unchanged at FFr3.458 to the D-Mark, in spite of
news that French unemployment had hit a record 12 per cent in October. In
recent days, the French currency has performed strongly amid signs that the
Bank of France has managed to recoup most of the reserves that it lost
during the futile defence of the franc in July and August.
However, the dollar rose by nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark, following
the release of very strong US economic indicators. The Chicago Purchasing
Managers' Index for November rose to 65.3 per cent from a previous 57.0 per
cent and the Conference Board Confidence Index climbed to 71.2 per cent from
a previous 60.5 per cent.
Both these figures strengthened the impression that the US economic recovery
is gaining momentum. The employment component of the Purchasing Managers'
Index underlined speculation that Friday's non-farm payroll figure for
November will come in higher than expected. The dollar ended at DM1.7165,
compared with DM1.7085 previously. It finished New York trading at DM1.7150.
The yen came under strong pressure against the dollar in European trading,
following another spate of bad economic news in Japan.
Industrial production in Japan fell by 5.1 per cent in October, and there is
growing speculation that the official discount rate could be cut again -
perhaps to 1 per cent from its current level of 1.75 per cent.
When European trading opened, the yen dropped from an opening of Y108.75
against the US currency to a low of Y109.30. It closed in London at Y109.10
and in New York it ended at Y109.05.
Citibank's economists in London believe that pressure on the yen will
continue over the next 12 months. In the medium term, they expect the yen to
sink as low as Y115 to the dollar.
On the German money markets, call money still hovered at the comparatively
high level of 6.68 per cent. Euromark futures were also depressed: the
December contract was down 4 basis points to a close of 93.83; the March
contract declined 5 basis points to 94.56.
Sterling markets were little changed against this background, following a
Budget speech which gave no hint of more policy easing. Three-month money
closed unchanged at around 5 5/16 per cent. The December short sterling
contract ended 3 basis points up at 94.64.
French franc futures were badly affected by the unemployment news. The
December Pibor contract dropped 8 basis points to close at 93.49.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Saskatchewan ripe for diamond
rush'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's next diamond rush is likely to be in Saskatchewan, according to
Credit Lyonnais Laing, part of the French banking group.
'Saskatchewan has a very high potential for the discovery of an economic
diamond deposit over the next few years,' suggests analyst Mr Charles
Kernot.
Diamond hunting in the province has been going on spasmodically since 1948
but was given a boost by the recent diamond rush in Canada's Northwest
Territories. The most high-profile operation in Saskatchewan is a joint
venture between two uranium companies, Cameco and Uranerz Exploration, which
has found diamonds in the Fort a la Corne region. Monopros, the exploration
arm of De Beers, the world's biggest diamond group, is earning a 33 per cent
interest in that project and providing access to its sampling laboratories
in Johannesburg.
Credit Lyonnais has a vested interest in Saskatchewan diamonds because it is
in the process of raising CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.5m) net from European
investors for Kensington Resources, a small Vancouver-quoted company that is
exploring for gems in the province. Kensington has hired the head of the
Saskatchewan ministry of energy and minerals' diamond exploration programme,
Mr Malcolm Gent, as a consultant.
De Beers is moving into diamond mining in Ghana. The South African group
will spend USDollars 1m to re-evaluate state-owned Ghana Consolidated
Diamonds' Birim River reserves. If the outcome is positive Ghana's
government will take 20 per cent of a new company, Birim River Diamonds, and
De Beers will share the rest with Lazare Kaplan, a US merchant. Meanwhile,
De Beers will take over management of GCD's existing operations and expects
to double output of mainly near-gem and industrial-quality diamonds to more
than 400,000 carats in the coming year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iraq sends oil prices tumbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iraq's announcement last night that it might negotiate with the United
Nations over a one time only sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil sent prices
tumbling in late London trading. The setback came at the end of a day in
which prices had recovered some of the ground lost after last week's meeting
of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend fell back to Dollars 14.20 after
having climbed at one stage above Dollars 14.60 a barrel. On Monday prices
briefly fell below the psychological barrier of Dollars 14 as traders
reacted to Opec's decision not to cut output to prop up prices.
Iraq has consistently rejected UN offers to organise a one-off sale because
it would have no control over the revenues. They would be used to buy
humanitarian relief supplies for Iraqis as well as compensate some of the
victims of the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The earlier sharp move upwards in prices was stimulated by reports that
Russia would reduce some exports because of heavy domestic demand caused by
an early cold snap.
Other developments, however, pointed to a continuing bearish trend.
Statistics from the American Petroleum Institute were expected to show a
rise in US stocks of crude oil and petroleum products.
Dr Alirio Parra, the Venezuelan oil minister yesterday repeated his position
that it would take several more days for the markets to appreciate Opec's
decision. But Nigerian minister Mr Don Etiebet said Opec might 'have to
review the situation as soon as possible'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World harvest estimate down
another 18m tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Wheat Council has made another cut in its forecast of the
1993-94 world cereal harvest.
The total for wheat and coarse grains, reduced a month ago from 1.39bn to
1.373bn tonnes, is cut by a further 18m tonnes in the agency's latest
report, published yesterday, to 1.355bn tonnes, 68m tonnes below the 1992-93
total.
The wheat estimate's 8m-tonne fall to 562m tonnes, attributed chiefly to
lower projections for the European Union, Kazakhstan, Russia and the US,
takes the figure back to last season's level. But the coarse grains
estimate, reduced by 10m tonnes to 793m in yesterday's report, is 68m tonnes
down from 1992-93.
The IWC blames a 'huge drop' of 73m tonnes in reported US maize production
for the sharply lower coarse grains estimate. This has been partly offset by
better prospects in western Europe, the former Soviet Union, Turkey, Egypt
and Australia.
The weather problems that cut US wheat output have also affected the quality
of the crop, and the IWC warns that competition for supplies of high-protein
premium breadmaking wheat could become still more keen early in the new
year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese rare earth producers
form cartel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China has allowed rare earth exporters to end a price war by forming a
cartel and fixing prices, according to the Xinhua news agency, reports
Reuter from Beijing.
Producers and exporters set up the cartel at a recent meeting and 'agreed to
adopt uniform prices for exports" starting in 1994, the official news agency
said.
China is the largest producer of rare earth, which contains a group of 15
chemically-similar elements used in items such as x-ray screens and colour
television tubes, and in alloys to store hydrogen in fuel cells. They also
have potential uses in super-conducting materials. Its main export markets
are in the US, Japan and Europe.
The announcement appeared to conflict with the Communist Party's formal
decision this month to make competition in free markets the cornerstone of
economic development.
The Xinhua agency said China's rare earth producers could not handle the
rigours of market pricing and had descended into an increasingly bitter
price war over the last few years. 'Producers and exporters have drastically
lowered prices to win foreign orders in the past few years, making the trade
barely profitable,' it said.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Go-ahead close for PNG gold
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Papua New Guinea government will issue a mining lease for the USDollars
609m Lihir Island project, where the biggest gold mine outside South Africa
is to be developed, at its next cabinet meeting, probably in January, said
Mr Masket Iangalio, PNG's minister of mines and petroleum, yesterday.
He also held out hopes that mining could begin again at one of the world's
major copper mines, on Bougainville Island, PNG, where the operator, CRA of
Australia, had to withdraw in 1989 because of secessionist rebel activity.
Mr Iangalio, speaking at a presentation in London by Niugini Mining, which
owns 20 per cent of Lihir, said that talks this week with RTZ Corporation of
the UK, which owns the other 80 per cent, had removed the last obstacles to
the lease being granted.
Mr Gavin Thomas, Niugini's exploration director, said site clearing and
construction work would begin immediately the licence was granted. The mine,
which is expected to produce 620,000 troy ounces of gold annually for the
first 12 years, should pour its first precious metal in the third quarter of
1996.
The PNG government is to spend Dollars 41m to take a 30 per cent stake in
the project and Niugini will build its interest to 30 per cent for Dollars
48m. The three partners intend to put their interests into a new company,
Lihir Gold, which will be floated on the Australian stock exchange in the
third quarter of next year.
Mr Geoff Loudon, Niugini's chairman, said the company had about Dollars 24m
in cash and would raise the rest via a placing of 5.7m shares as soon as the
mining licence was issued. This would take the stake in Niugini held by
Battle Mountain Gold of the US down from 54 to just over 50 per cent. Also
Niugini is selling non-core assets and this week collected more than
ADollars 4m for its 12 per cent shareholding in Equatorial Mining, a small
Australian company.
He suggested that, after Lihir Gold was floated, RTZ would own between 24
and 30 per cent, Niugini and the PNG government between 18 and 23 per cent
each, and Malaysian Mining Corporation up to 20 per cent while PNG
investors, who would be given preferential treatment, would have 7 to 12 per
cent.
Questioned about Bougainville, Mr Iangalio said that PNG government troops
now controlled 90 per cent of the island, including the copper mine site. So
far the site had not been carefully inspected but it seemed that the
conveyor system was still intact. He hoped the troops would soon have total
control of the island and claimed that the PNG government now had the
support of the local community so it would not be necessary to keep a large
force there - at present 2,000 troops are on the island.
Analysts suggested it would take many months to evaluate the copper mine,
which is 53.6 per cent owned by CRA and was producing about 175,000 tonnes
of copper a year. The mine had only about ten years of reserves left and it
might not be worthwhile re-starting output, one said.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian fishermen face big
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cod fishing off Canada's east coast will come to a virtual halt next year if
the government accepts a call by a conservation agency for drastic quota
cuts to protect depleted stocks of cod and other species.
The Fisheries Resource Conservation Council has urged an extension of a
two-year moratorium on northern cod fishing off the coast of Newfoundland,
as well as deep cuts in other areas. At the same time, it has questioned the
ability of the North Atlantic Fishery Organisation to control over-fishing
by foreign vessels in international waters.
The FRCC recommends a total allowable catch for all species in 1994 about 60
per cent lower than last year. The cod and haddock quota would be less than
5 per cent of levels set in 1988.
Mr Herbert Clarke, the council's chairman, warned that east coast groundfish
stocks were at the lowest levels ever recorded. He said that the northern
cod fishery, once one of the world's richest fishing grounds, was unlikely
to reopen for at least 6-7 years.
The precise causes of the fishery's decline are disputed, but are believed
to include heavy over-fishing by Canadian and foreign vessels, as well as
changes in water temperature and fish habitats.
The decline in the fishery has already put at least 20,000 people out of
work in Newfoundland and other Atlantic provinces. The proposed cutbacks are
likely to cost several thousand more jobs.
The government is expected to accept the bulk of the council's
recommendations. Mr Brian Tobin, fisheries minister, said official policy
would 'err on the side of caution'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet collapse distorts world
dairy market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world dairy market is being strongly affected by economic and social
changes in central and eastern Europe, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade says in its 1993 review of dairy trends and prospects.
Commercial shipments of dairy products to Russia, formerly the world's
leading butter importer, have fallen sharply.
At the same time, other countries in the region have boosted cheap butter
exports, reflecting lower domestic consumption in response to higher prices
and the need for hard currency earnings.
The result has been a continuing butter market imbalance that has kept
stocks high and prices weak, despite falling production, the Gatt report
says. World butter output fell by 2.5 per cent in 1992 and is expected to
fall by a further 2 per cent in 1993. Butter prices have also been depressed
by concessional sales and donations to Russia and by US export subsidies.
US dairy exports rose sharply last year, lifted by the dairy export
incentive programme, which paid out Dollars 140m on exports of milk powders,
butter and butter oil, and cheese. Algeria and Mexico were the main
beneficiaries of the programme, which applied to exports to 76 nations.
World milk production fell by 2 per cent between 1991 and 1992, mainly
reflecting lower output in western and eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union. Gatt is predicting another 1 to 2 per cent drop in 1993. However, New
Zealand had record milk production in 1992 and may surpass this level in
1993. Australia's 1993 output is expected to be the highest in two decades.
The Gatt report points out that, although milk consumption in developed
countries is flat or declining, it is rising steadily in Asia and Latin
America and there is strong demand worldwide for milk products, especially
cheese.
Exports of skimmed and whole milk powder rose in 1992, and stocks of skimmed
milk powder have fallen to low levels, underpinning relatively high prices.
Trade in cheese, meanwhile, remains brisk. High prices and global
consumption growth of 2 per cent a year have encouraged rising production,
of 2 per cent in 1992 and a likely 1 per cent this year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts stage sharp rally in wake of PSBR
reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the action in Europe's bond markets took place in the gilts market
which rallied sharply on the back of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's 1994-95
Budget.
The biggest boost to gilts came from the announcement of a cut in next
year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and the larger than expected cut
in spending.
The long-dated gilt future rallied about 1 1/2 point to 116 29/32 .
The Bank of England announced the terms of next Wednesday's auction of
Pounds 3bn of 6.75 per cent gilts due 2004. On a when-issued partly-paid
basis the paper was trading at 50 7/8 in late dealings, yielding some 6.63
per cent, one trader said.
German government bonds drifted lower in lacklustre trade. With many
operators lying low ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank's Central
Bank Council and many investors sidelined so close to the year-end, volume
was moderate and trading trendless.
'Much of the volume in the futures pits came from roll-overs into the March
from the December (bund) contract,' said a Frankfurt futures dealer.
The December bund futures contract closed at 99.91, down 0.06 point from
Tuesday.
The Bundesbank's announcement of 14-day fixed-rate securities repurchase
agreements at 6.25 per cent for today's allocation had little market impact
as it was widely expected and was seen to have neutral policy implications
for Thursday's Bundesbank meeting.
French bonds drifted lower for most of the day in line with bunds, but
recovered in late trade on jobless data that reignited hopes for near-term
easing by the Bank of France. However, many traders still do not expect the
French central bank to cut rates independently of the Bundesbank.
The notional bond future on Matif ended 0.34 point lower at 124.00 but
jumped in after-hours trading to 124.18.
After tumbling by more than a point during the session, Italian bonds
recovered from earlier lows towards the close and traders said the
possibility of a a deal between the government and opposition on the budget
could lift prices today. The BTP futures contract on Liffe closed at 111.75,
down 0.81 point from Tuesday.
Japanese bonds continued their rally following weak economic data and
suggestions by Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno that further monetary
easing could be needed if the economy were to decline further.
The three-month certificate of deposit rate fell to a record low of 2.22 per
cent, down from 2.23 per cent on Monday. The yield on six-month treasury
bills fell to 1.67 per cent from 1.78 per cent, crossing the 1.75 per cent
official discount rate for the first time.
Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark JBG No 157 dropped to a low of 3.275
per cent, the lowest in more than five years.
US Treasury bond prices moved sharply lower yesterday as fresh evidence of
improving economic conditions served to exacerbate fears of mounting
inflationary pressures.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 15/16 at 99
9/32. The yield, rose to 6.298 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note
was 1/8 lower at 100 1/32, to yield 4.217 per cent.
As the trading session began, a mood of nervous anticipation was evident.
Crude oil prices, which fell to a three-year low on Monday, had started to
recover some ground. However, the focus of bond traders was set squarely on
this first of a batch of reports this week which are expected to show the US
economy picking up strength in the fourth quarter.
The first bad news came when the Conference Board said its index of consumer
confidence had jumped to 71.2 this month, compared with a reading of about
60 forecast by analysts.
The second - and perhaps most disturbing - report was the November index of
business activity from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago,
which showed one of the biggest gains in the survey's 25-year history.

The three partners in the Globex electronic futures trading system met in
New York yesterday for a day-long summit to discuss the future of the
troubled project.
Globex volume, while topping 600,000 in November, is still below targeted
levels. Management issues have kept new exchanges, like Liffe, from joining
the system, and infighting between managing partners has limited growth.
Mr Jack Sandner, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Mr Patrick
Arbor, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, and Ms Rosalyn Wilton,
project manager for Reuters, were expected to discuss a new governance plan
for Globex and Reuter's growing dissatisfaction with the CBoT's promotion of
competing after-hours trading mechanisms.

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Bonds: World Bank arm in Dollars 500m Eurobond
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the
World Bank, reaped the benefits of its recent Dollars 200m buy-back
programme when it launched its Dollars 500m offering of five-year Eurobonds
yesterday.
By buying back old, illiquid Eurobonds, the IFC enabled investors to swap
out of high-coupon, high-premium paper into a current-coupon and liquid bond
at virtually the same spread over US Treasuries, said joint lead manager
Deutsche Bank.
The new bonds were priced to yield 13 basis points over the 5 1/8 per cent
US Treasury due 1998. This compared with an average spread of 14 to 15 basis
points over US Treasuries at which the IFC bought back the old bonds.
The buy-back programme also allowed the IFC to establish a new benchmark
offering for itself which its relatively modest annual borrowing programme
would not otherwise permit.
Mr Robert Graffam, director of the IFC's treasury and financial policy
department, said that the IFC had now raised Dollars 1.2bn of its Dollars
1.6bn international borrowing programme for the current fiscal year which
runs until the end of next June.
Around three-quarters of the bonds had been sold by late afternoon, Mr
Graffam said. At the launch the bonds were priced at 99.665 but they eased
to 99.37 bid late in the day, in line with the  1/4 point fall in the US
Treasury market.
Elsewhere, the launch of the European Investment Bank's largest-ever Swiss
franc offering ran into difficulty yesterday when other Swiss banks failed
to join in the syndicate group.
The EIB raised SFr800m through an offering of five-year bonds. The offering,
which has a re-opening clause, carries a coupon of 3.75 per cent which
syndicate managers said was the lowest in the current interest rate cycle.
Lead manager UBS said that EIB's issue established a new benchmark for other
top quality borrowers wishing to tap this area of the yield curve.
However, syndicate managers at other Swiss banks said the bonds were priced
well in advance of a further drop in Swiss bond yields. The yield on EIB's
bonds of 3.7 per cent compared with yields around 4 per cent on outstanding
issues with similar maturities, they said.
Swiss banks expressed their disagreement with the pricing of the issue by
declining to join the syndicate group, which was made up of Japanese and
American banks.

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Citibank study points to lack
of German ADRs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A study sponsored by Citibank has highlighted a series of obstacles which
inhibit the development of a significant US shareholder base for German
companies.
According to the study*, the lack of sponsored or listed American depositary
receipts (ADRs) by German companies is the main hindrance because a large
percentage of US institutions cannot hold ordinary shares of non-US
equities.
So far, Daimler-Benz is the only German industrial company to have obtained
a full listing for its ADRs, though Volkswagen has a sponsored ADR
programme. Kaufhof, one of Germany's biggest retailing groups, also plans a
sponsored ADR programme.
Other obstacles to investing in German equities range from a lack of
adequate information on German companies, German accounting practices, a
lack of liquidity in the German equity market and insider trading, the study
found.

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: DTB sets date for Fibor
future launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's futures and options exchange, Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), plans to
launch its long-awaited three-month interest rate contract, the Fibor
future, on March 18.
Seven designated market makers have signed up to trade the contract, which
will be based on the Frankfurt inter-bank offered rate (Fibor): Bayerische
Hypotheken-und Wechselbank, BfG Bank, Caisse des Depots et Consignations,
Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank and Dresdner Bank.
The instrument will complete the DTB's range of products across the German
yield curve.
'Investors will now have the opportunity to trade short-term interest rates
in addition to the medium and long-term range,' said Mr Jorg Franke, DTB
chairman. The DTB offers a future on 10-year government bonds (bunds) and on
five-year government notes (bobls).
The Fibor future closely resembles the Euromark contract on the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) which is based
on the British Bankers Association Interest Settlement Rate for three-month
Euromark deposits and has traded successfully since April 1989.
The DTB's Fibor future is not expected to lead to an escalation of
competition between DTB and Liffe - partly because the underlying
instruments for the two contracts differ slightly. 'While we have to be wary
about being complacent, I don't see a big risk of business being taken away
from Liffe,' said Mr Roger Barton, managing director of business development
at Liffe.
Like Liffe's Euromark contract, the Fibor future will have a contract size
of DM1m, minimum price movements of 0.01 per cent (or a value of DM25), and
will be quoted in per cent, as 100 minus the going rate of interest.

<TEXT>
SHL Systemhouse, a fast-growing North American computer service outsourcing
group, posted an 18 per cent gain in fourth-quarter sales, to CDollars 225m
(USDollars 169m). However, losses continued and heavy special charges
reflected a broad reorganisation.
At the operating level, the loss for the three months to August 31 was
CDollars 8.6m against a profit of CDollars 600,000 a year earlier. However,
the final net loss after special charges was CDollars 149m, or CDollars 2.92
a share, against a loss of CDollars 7.4m, or 18 cents a share, a year
earlier.
For the full year, the final net loss was CDollars 145m, or CDollars 3.09,
on fewer shares outstanding, against a loss of CDollars 9.5m, or 25 cents.
Revenues were CDollars 913m, up 24 per cent.
SHL is moving out of mainframe-based systems to concentrate on network
computing based on workstation technology.
The special charge to cover the restructuring required totalled CDollars
135m. Delays in signing and starting work on several large new contracts
also adversely affected results.
The order backlog at August 31 was CDollars 1.5bn, double the year-earlier
level, and including a large Canada Post outsourcing contract. SHL says it

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: AMP stake in copper project
expanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial services group, has taken its
shareholding in Equatorial Mining to 19.9 per cent, the maximum permitted
level before a bid is automatically triggered.
Equatorial's main asset is the Leonor copper deposit in Chile, midway
between Chuquicamata, the biggest copper mine in the world, and Escondida,
the third largest. It is expected to produce about 30,000 tonnes of copper
annually for ten years when it goes into production.
Analysts suggest that AMP might provide debt finance for the project.
AMP bought its first 12.5m shares in Equatorial last summer at 37 cents
each, a placement which raised ADollars 4.625m (USDollars 3.05m) for the
mining company.
Yesterday Equatorial's other big shareholder, Niugini Mining, said it had
sold 13.9m shares (about 12 per cent of issued capital) at a net 32 cents
each, a total of ADollars 4.3m, and most of the shares had gone to AMP.
Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of both Equatorial and Niugini, said the latter
was selling non-core assets to help finance its share of development of the
huge Lihir Island gold project in Papua New Guinea. He said: 'It is a great
sorrow to see it go but it is for a good purpose.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: Synergies and savings elusive
for Qantas - Upheaval has been the most conspicuous feature at the airline
since its takeover of Australian 14 months ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Qantas, Australia's long-time international airline and, for the past 14
months, owner of the large internal Australian Airlines network, just passed
through a bout of severe turbulence? Or are there more bumps ahead?
For most of the year, upheaval has been the most conspicuous feature at the
Sydney-based carrier. On the management front, Mr Gary Toomey today takes
over as chief financial officer. He replaces Mr Graham Jones, who resigned
recently after only 11 months with Qantas and who, according to industry
sources, could not commit himself to a three-to-five year stint at the
airline.
Mr Jones followed in the footsteps of Mr John Ward, former managing director
who departed in August, and Mr Bill Dix, previous Qantas chairman who
resigned in March. Even with Mr Toomey's appointment as a director there is
still a vacancy on the Qantas board.
Finances have been equally tumultuous - Qantas recently announced a ADollars
377.2m (USDollars 249m) after-tax loss for the year to end-June. The deficit
was due to large abnormal provisions, but operating profits still fell to
just ADollars 32.9m, on revenues of ADollars 5.8bn. The result, which
included a 10-month contribution of ADollars 9.5m from Australian Airlines,
compared with revenues of ADollars 4.0bn and operating profit of ADollars
102.8m for Qantas alone in the previous year.
All this can hardly be music to the ears of British Airways, which paid
ADollars 665m for a 25 per cent stake in Qantas in March. Indeed, there has
been speculation that the UK carrier, which is entitled to three of the 12
board seats at Qantas, instigated some of the top-level management changes.
BA says only that it was consulted over Mr Dix's replacement, and declines
to comment on Mr Jones' departure.
Much of the turmoil relates directly to the Australian/Qantas tie-up.
Airline mergers are notoriously difficult, and nobody pretends that this
deal has been any exception.
Take the labour situation, for example. Some 18 unions were represented at
the two carriers, and although many were common to both - pilots being an
exception - pay and conditions differed. Union negotiators say that wage
rates tended to be higher at Qantas, while benefits and conditions were more
generous at Australian. Qantas had one superannuation fund; Australian had
seven.
'Extremely difficult' is how one labour representative leader characterises
the efforts to move towards an integrated structure. The task, he adds, is
probably about 70 per cent complete.
The complexities are also demonstrated by the types of aircraft deployed.
Qantas, as an international carrier, used Boeing 747s and 767s; Australian,
737s, 727s and Airbus A300s.
There were obvious gains to be achieved from using some Qantas aircraft on
internal routes, rather than have them sitting on the ground between
international flights. But that, in turn, meant different servicing
requirements at different airports. Conversely, when an Australian aircraft,
repainted in Qantas colours, arrived in Melbourne, a demarcation dispute
erupted over who should handle it.
While fleet realignment has led to spare aircraft, Qantas - facing a weak
equipment market - has yet to discard unwanted goods.
'We've still got four Australian A300s flying around,' says Mr Rodger
Robertson, head of corporate planning. 'Four of any aircraft is a fleet size
which is just too small. We're scheduling them out over the next 12 months,
but the market for selling aircraft is not great.'
Costs attached to these kinds of operational changes - together with the
funding of around 1,835 redundances out of the pre-merger combined workforce
of 27,000 - accounted for a large part of last year's abnormal charge.
Qantas wrote off ADollars 282.3m of goodwill in respect of Australian; took
a ADollars 71.5m pre-tax charge for redundancy and restructuring costs;
revised aircraft depreciation policies, leading to a ADollars 46m charge
before tax; and provided, to the tune of almost ADollars 40m, for the
under-recovery of rentals on unused premises.
But the pressing question is when the benefits from this process will show
through, how substantial they will be, and whether other changes in the
Australian aviation market will mitigate against a speedy upturn in Qantas'
fortunes.
All along, Qantas has argued that the eventual cost-savings from combining
the airlines should run to at least ADollars 100m a year. 'I think we're
relaxed with the Dollars 100m figure,' says Mr Robertson. However, he also
admits that 'some of that will take some time to get in.'
Some 'synergies', Mr Robertson suggests, will only be achievable over the
very long-term. Anyone connecting from a old Qantas terminal to a former
Australian one, for example, usually finds that they are on opposite sides
of the airport. 'That means it's going to be a lifetime before we can do all
the things an airline should do and get all its operations together'.
How quickly the two airlines' 'cultures' will blend is also debatable. It is
no secret that there were tensions between the two employee groups, at least
at the outset. 'Qantas was bigger and it has always had a bit of a
superiority complex,' says one observer. To make matters worse, Australian
was headquartered in Melbourne and Qantas in Sydney. Rivalry between the two
cities is legendary, and Australian employees faced the prospect of either
shifting base or remaining in a 'branch office'.
However, the appointment of executives with experience of Australian to top
positions at the combined airline seems to have smoothed a few feathers. Mr
James Strong, who took over as managing director from Mr Ward, was chief
executive of Australian for four years in the 1980s; Mr Gary Pemberton, the
new chairman, was an Australian director from 1988 to 1990. And Mr Toomey
joins the Qantas fold from Arnotts, the food group, having been chief
financial executive at Australian between 1987 and 1992.
All the merger-related upheavals, meanwhile, come against the background of
a local market which is still depressed and price-sensitive, and an
international arena where Qantas must compete for routes with Ansett, the
second and slightly larger domestic carrier.
Just as Qantas was allowed to move into domestic aviation by merging with
Australian, Ansett has been permitted to apply for international route
authorities. It has already built up a clutch of interests in the
Asia-Pacific basin.
Qantas admits that watching the competition absorbs management effort,
although it downplays the real impact. 'Ansett is more of an impediment than
a huge competitor. They've got very good distribution in Australia, so
they'll get Australians going on the service overseas, but they'll find it
much more difficult to get into the in-bound market,' is the airline's own
assessment.
But the rivalry is clearly taken seriously: talking about trans-Tasman
routes, for example, Qantas has made it clear that if Ansett is to be
allowed to fly between domestic terminals in New Zealand and Australia, it
wants parity.
Finally, there is the question of British Airways' global ambitions, and the
issue of how quickly and smoothly links with the UK carrier - and with
USAir, BA's US partner - will be pursued.
Here, any notion of swift integration is dismissed, a contrast to the
'seamless service' hype. 'So far we've achieved a lot of small things, but
nothing monumental.' says Mr Robertson.
'I think BA has been concentrating much more on the USAir relationship and
would have prefered the timing to be a little bit different,' he adds.
'Our approach has been a lot less structured than at USAir. There, they've
got people appointed to handle the integration, and they've got consultants.
There's none of that with Qantas, although there is a series of working
groups talking on particular specialist issues. Some are making progress,
others not so fast.'
Some tripartite talks have been held, but Qantas remains cautious about the
US leg of the alliance. Qantas customers who arrive on the west coast of the
US, it points out, usually want to connect with flights to other big US
cities such as Chicago or Washington, not to be ferried around USAir's east
coast heartland.
'Our difficulty with USAir is that it doesn't serve the west coast of the US
very much, and would not be Qantas' natural partner in the US. It just
doesn't fit properly, which is why we still have our relationship with
American Airlines over there. (Qantas, for example, shares a frequent-flier
mileage scheme with American Airlines, BA's arch-rival on transatlantic
routes.) Until, and if, USAir gets an operation which suits us, we'll stay
that way.'
At the end of the day, the delayed privatisation of the remaining 75 per
cent of Qantas which is still owned by government means that the carrier
probably has another year to get its house in order. Every moment, one
suspects, will be welcome.

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: US pensions hit by shift in
Treasury market - Corporate efforts to tackle the 'double whammy' caused by
falling long bond yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many US companies, the retreat in the Treasury bond market of the past
six weeks has not gone far enough. Even after a one-half percentage point
rise since mid-October, long-term bond yields are still a point lower than
at the start of the year.
One result: a massive addition to corporate pension fund liabilities, and
pressure on many companies to raise cash contributions to their funds before
the end of the year.
Long-term bond yields matter because they are one of the most important
elements in the equation used to assess the scale of a pension fund's
liabilities.
They provide the discount rates used to calculate the present value of a
fund's liabilities: future payments the fund is expected to make are
discounted back to their current value. The lower the discount rate, the
higher the present value.
According to the Department of Labor, a one point fall in the discount rate
will add 10 per cent to the liabilities of a typical pension fund. On that
assumption, the liabilities of private sector US funds have jumped Dollars
75bn since the end of last year.
Falling bond yields have a second harmful effect. They reduce the expected
long-term investment returns on pension plan assets, further undermining the
finances of some funds. This double whammy is only partially offset by
companies' lowering of their assumptions of future wage increases: this has
the effect of lowering the liabilities of defined benefits schemes, in which
pension benefits are based on salaries.
General Motors may have hogged the headlines in recent weeks with its
gargantuan pension fund deficit, but the reported earnings and shareholders
funds of many US companies will suffer this year as a result of falling bond
yields.
GM, though, remains way out in front. By its own estimate, its deficit at
the end of this year will reach Dollars 24bn, towering over other
underfunded pension plans. Chairman Mr John Smith said steps announced last
month marked the company's plans to bring its deficit down quickly, but it
still has a long way to go.
Two factors have made lower bond yields of particular concern to many US
companies this year. First, the assumptions used when calculating pension
liabilities are being policed actively for the first time. The SEC has
warnedmany companies which used a high discount rate last year to use a rate
reflecting current market yields.
In the past, companies have picked their own discount rates, making it
possible to smooth the effect of interest rate movements. A survey of 350
clients by Towers Perrin, a benefits consultancy, found rates ranging from
5.5 to 10 per cent at the end of last year.
That latitude is about to go. In a letter to the Financial Accounting
Standards Board at the end of September, the SEC said discount rates should
reflect the yields on bonds rated double-A or better 'at the next
measurement date'. One effect of this approach will be to make the scale of
pension fund liabilities more volatile in years to come.
GM, with a discount rate of 8.6 per cent for its US funds at the end of last
year, remains higher than many. It has already brought the rate down faster
than market rates, though: between end-1990 and end-1992, while long-term
bond yields fell around 0.8 percentage points to 7.3 per cent, GM's discount
rate fell by 1.5 percentage points.
According to Goldman Sachs, 45 companies in the S&amp;P 500 had discount rates
higher than 9 per cent at the end of 1992. Some of the companies with the
biggest deficits were close to this level, though not actually above it:
Westinghouse (9 per cent), Exxon (8.5 per cent), Chrysler (8.38 per cent)
and Ford (8 per cent).
The second factor making lower bond yields of particular concern this year
is the planned legislation which would force companies to cut their deficits
more quickly. Backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the new
law would refine a formula introduced in 1987 which failed to force
companies to make greater efforts to fund their deficits.
It would also remove the ceiling on contributions to the PBGC, forcing the
companies with the biggest deficits to pay more of the agency's costs.
Companies' reactions to these developments have been modest so far. In part,
this is because the scale of their pension fund commitments will not be
known until the end of the year. With the bond market swinging so sharply,
there is still time for the picture to change before the year-end.
'Everybody's attitude at the moment is to ask what everybody else is doing,'
says Jerry Spiegel, a vice-president at Towers Perrin. 'People are running
tests on what would happen if they had to use a discount rate of 7 or 7.5
per cent, but they haven't done anything yet.'
To reduce the cash impact of higher contributions, many companies are
exploring ways of injecting other assets into their pension plans. Handing
over shares in the parent has been a favoured route, though the Department
of Labour applies restrictions to the proportion of the sponsoring company's
shares that can be used to meet pension obligations.
GM is currently seeking regulatory approval, and freedom from excise duty,
for a proposal to hand Dollars 5.7bn of stock into its pension plan. It is
not alone. Tenneco has received preliminary approval from the Department of
Labor to transfer Dollars 150m of shares it owns in Cummins into its pension
plan. One of only six companies listed by the PBGC as having a funding ratio
below 50 per cent, Tenneco had a pension deficit of Dollars 249m at
end-1992.
Other solutions being explored include transfering properties to meet
pension fund liabilities and merging underfunded plans with more robust
ones, says Mr David Walker, chairman of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants' employee benefits committee.

375m

<TEXT>
LTV, the US steelmaker which emerged from bankruptcy protection this summer,
is to receive Dollars 375m from rival steel group USX in settlement of a
long-running lawsuit.
The money will be used to reduce LTV's massive pension fund deficit, which
has been put at over Dollars 2bn.
The payment follows allegations of anti-trust activities against Bessemer
and Lake Eerie Railroad, formerly a subsidiary of USX and now owned by
Transtar, in which USX holds 45 per cent. The railway company was charged
with monopolising the dock handling and inland transportation of iron ore
from Lake Eerie ports from the mid-1950s to the early 1908s, USX said.
USX said its potential liability had been as much as Dollars 500m, and that
it continued to appeal judgments of Dollars 210m made in favour of other
companies.
LTV's pension fund deficit has been put at Dollars 2.1bn by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, making it the third largest in the US, behind
General Motors and Bethlehem Steel. Assets in the fund before the Dollars
375m contribution announced yesterday were sufficient to cover only 38 per
cent of the company's pension liabilities.
The payment, which has been agreed in principle by both companies but has
yet to be finalised, will be made in two instalments, one later this month
and the other by the end of February.

<TEXT>
Four Seasons Hotels plans to raise about CDollars 100m (USDollars 75m) by
selling half a dozen properties, including the Four Seasons Hotel, formerly
Inn on the Park, in London.
The Toronto-based company, which claims to be the world's largest operator
of luxury hotels, decided to sell the properties to reduce debt and to take
advantage of 'what appears to be the beginning of a moderate recovery in the
real estate markets'.
Besides the London property, the assets for sale include Four Seasons Hotels
in San Francisco, Austin (Texas), Santa Barbara (California) and Vancouver,
as well as the Inn on the Park in Toronto.
Mr Roger Garland, executive vice-president, said that Four Seasons would in
some cases be willing to give up its management contract to the buyer.
But the group will make it 'an absolute requirement' to maintain management
of the London property, despite disappointing occupancy levels. Business has
been hit by the weak European economy and by the increasing number of hotel
rooms available in London.
Four Seasons posted nine-month earnings of CDollars 5.2m, or 19 cents a
share, down from CDollars 6.1m, or 26 cents a share last year.

Dell Computer reported much higher than expected earnings for the three
months to end-October, reversing losses in the first two quarters of its
fiscal year as it restructured its operations.
Net income was Dollars 12m or 26 cents a share, against Dollars 28.6m or 72
cents in the same period last year. Revenues rose to Dollars 757.3m from
Dollars 570m. .
Analysts had been anticipating further losses and Dell's share price gained
Dollars 3 to close at Dollars 27 1/8 yesterday.
However, Dell said it no longer expected to achieve fourth-quarter earnings
above those of last year's final quarter and its original goal of reaching
Dollars 3bn in sales for the year now 'looks too aggressive'.
Dell achieved revenue growth despite the withdrawal of its notebook computer
products in August, due to design flaws. Notebook sales in the quarter were
Dollars 5m, compared with Dollars 62m last year. It intends to re-enter the
notebook market in the next fiscal year.
For the nine months, sales were Dollars 2.1bn, up from Dollars 1.4bn last
year. Net losses were Dollars 53.5m, or Dollars 1.48, against net income of
Dollars 70.4m or Dollars 1.81.

a company spokesman said, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The 800-strong division will handle the development, manufacturing,
marketing and maintenance services of IBM Japan's PC business, said Mr
Tatsuyuki Saeki, who will head the unit to be created on January 1.
The new division is aiming for sales of Y130bn (Dollars 119m) in calendar
1994. In two years IBM Japan hopes to emerge as the second largest PC maker
in Japan, after NEC, with 15 per cent of Japan's PC market, Mr Saeki said.
The plan, said Mr Saeki, is to react more quickly and effectively to the
changes in Japan's PC market.

Group operating profits at BHF-Bank rose almost 24 per cent to DM267m
(Dollars 157m) in the first 10 months of 1993, the bank reported yesterday.
Partial operating profits, which exclude results from own-account trading,
climbed about 29 per cent to DM306m, it said in an interim report.
While both figures showed modest advances on first-half results, published
in August, provisions for bad debts were up sharply at DM132m compared with
DM97m in the comparable part of 1992, and DM67m in the first six months of
this year.
Mr Wolfgang Strutz, senior partner, said there had been no spectacularly bad
loan cases and that provisions had been increased as a result of the
difficult economic environment and BHF's strict criteria for risk
assessment. Provisions for the full year would probably reach DM160m, he
added.
Lending losses for 1993 would show 'hardly any increase worth noting' over
1992's 0.17 per cent of outstanding loans.
In the period under review, interest earnings rose 15.7 per cent to DM516m,
provision income was 14.5 per cent higher at DM284m, and the bank's assets
increased more than 17 per cent to DM55bn.

Gerresheimer Glas, the German bottle and glass container maker, yesterday
announced a move into the US tubing glass market, with the purchase of a 51
per cent stake in OI Kimble FTS, part of the Owens-Illinois group, the US
packaging group.
The deal will more than double the turnover of Gerresheimer in tubing glass
and laboratory products, continuing a steady process of diversification from
its traditional manufacture of bottles for the brewing and spirits
industries.
No price was given for the purchase of the stake in OI Kimble, which employs
about 2,000 workers, and has a turnover of some Dollars 200m both in
semi-finished and finished glass tubing products.
Gerresheimer, quoted on the Frankfurt stock exchange, but 51 per cent owned
by Viag, the industrial conglomerate, has diversified from its core
production of bottles since it was sold by Owens-Illinois in 1987.
Since then it has built up a European tubing glass division with a turnover
of DM200m (Dollars 118m), including Kimble Italiana and subsidiaries in the
UK and France.
The deal would further reduce Gerresheimer's dependence on the
highly-cyclical bottle manufacturing industry. Production of bottles had
fallen to between 40 per cent and 45 per cent of turnover from 75 per cent
of turnover in 1987, he said.
Gerresheimer has been hit by recession with turnover for the first six
months of 1993 falling by 8 per cent. Its bottles division is in the red.

Finnair, the Finnish national airline, expects to reach its target for this
year of a halved group loss, Reuter reports from Helsinki.
For the first six months to September, Finnair's performance was better than
expected, said Mr Antti Potilla, chief executive yesterday. As a result 'it
has been possible to slightly raise the forecast for the financial year'.
The first-half result, after financial items, was a profit of FM89.8m
(Dollars 15.7m), compared to a loss of FM197m in the same period a year ago.

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: Poland's exporters find a new
lease of life - A game plan that plans to create strong Polish-run groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's privatisation process is giving foreign trade companies, a dying
breed elsewhere in eastern Europe, a new lease of life. Several of these
relics of the former planned economy are beginning to purchase industrial
plants and turn themselves into holding companies strong enough to challenge
competition from abroad.
Elektrim, privatised early last year and performing well on the Warsaw stock
exchange (WSE) specialising in power, telecommunications and electrical
equipment, is leading the way. Rolimpex, a grain and sugar trader, and
Stalexport, which once concentrated on iron ore and steel products, are to
be privatised in the new year. They plan to purchase the companies whose
foreign trade they once handled.
Meanwhile Ciech, the country's oil and chemical products trader with a
turnover of 38,500bn zlotys (Dollars 1.9bn) last year and profits of 631.5bn
zlotys, has teamed up with private sector partners to establish Chemico, a
holding company which plans to buy up important companies in the chemical
sector.
'Ciech's financial clout means that integrating its operations with
producers should lead to the formation of a very powerful company indeed,'
notes a western banker. But he cautions that the skills needed to conduct
export and import deals and those needed to restructure and manage
production units are very different. 'Failure to recognise that could end in
tears,' he adds.
For the moment, Mr Andrzej Skowronski, Elektrim's managing director is at
the stage of purchasing companies. 'When we were privatised we drew up a
shopping list of plants which are important to us and we are acting on
that.' Funding is coming from bank loans and cash flow. Elektrim's net
profits last year were 317bn zlotys, on sales of 6,421bn zlotys, while for
the first nine months of 1993 net earnings totalled 286bn zlotys.
Recently, Elektrim, in alliance with the privately owned Export Development
Bank (BRE) agreed to pay Dollars 16.8m for an 80 per cent share in the
Slaska Fabryka Kabli, beating off a bid for the cable maker from Siemens of
Germany. Before that, Elektrim bought a 51 per cent share in the Opolwap
lime producer for 51bn zlotys. It is committed to buying the Zalom cable
producer in Szczecin.
Among Elektrim's sources of funds is the sale of share stakes in companies
it owns. Last month, a 15 per cent share of Mostostal SA, purchased in 1991,
was sold through the WSE and another tranche is due for sale in the new
year. 'As long as we maintain a controlling share I'm happy to sell stock in
the companies we own,' Mr Skowronski says.
Elektrim is showing interest in Poland's planned Dollars 4bn motorway
building programme, which will need cables and lighting equipment, and is
ready to support plans by other companies to purchase cement plants.
Another route to diversification and expansion has opened up through its
telecommunications interests. These have led the company into consortia
preparing to bid for Poland's first private television channel. 'They come
to us because they need a strong stock market listed company in their
ranks,' says Mr Skowronski.
The trading companies' motivation to buy state sector plants flowed from a
desire to preserve their client base. Elektrim has seen a number of
telecommunications plants for which it once conducted foreign trade
transactions sold to foreign companies such as AT&amp;T, Siemens and Alcatel.
However, Mr Marian Malecki, the managing director at Ciech, recognises that
the foreign trade companies building up their holdings must have a strategy
which transcends the need to preserve the status quo.
Mr Marek Dochnal, a management consultant who is to head Chemico, says the
aim is to 'organise Polish companies in such a way as to enable them to
compete'. He notes that only the foreign trade companies, with their high
earnings and minimal investment needs, are in a position to invest in this
way.
The game plan is to create strong Polish-run companies, but not to the
exclusion of foreign partners. ABB, the Swedish-Swiss group, owns 10 per
cent of Elektrim through subsidiaries in Poland and another 10 per cent is
held by Italian and Turkish companies.

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: France to offer Erap
certificates when Elf is sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government will offer to exchange non-voting investment
certificates in Erap, the government agency which controls Elf-Aquitaine,
when the oil group is privatised at the beginning of next year, Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister said yesterday.
The offer for the certificates in Erap is aimed at simplifying the
privatisation issue. The issue, which is expected to raise about FFr50bn
(Dollars 8.5bn), is the biggest so far in the government's plan to sell 21
publicly-owned groups.
Mr Alphandery said terms of the offer for the Erap certificates would be
decided on the basis of recommendations from the privatisation commission,
an independent body which advises the government on the terms and pricing of
privatisation issues.
Trading in the certificates will be suspended until the terms have been
fixed.
At the time of their suspension yesterday, the investment certificates were
trading at FFr361.1 compared with the Elf share price which stood at
FFr411.7.
Individual investors in the privatisation issue of Rhone-Poulenc, which was
completed last week, will receive an extra share, the economy ministry said
yesterday.
Investors will receive 17 shares in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group.
Those who applied for a separate allocation, in which payment was made with
Balladur bonds, will receive 16 rather than 15 shares.
Investors were originally offered 60 shares, and a further 60 if they paid
with Balladur bonds - a government debt issue launched last summer.
The decision to raise the amount followed a final calculation of demand for
the shares. The issue was three times over-subscribed.

FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: UAP sell-off will test
investors' appetites - In theory, the French insurer's sale is likely to be
smooth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), which is to be privatised early next
year after the Elf-Aquitaine oil group and Banque Hervet, is not only
France's largest insurer but its biggest institutional investor.
UAP has a high profile among international investors with 23.5 per cent of
its equity in public hands, so - in theory - the stage is set for yet
another successful issue. But in practice the flotation could prove the
first serious challenge for the architects of the government's privatisation
drive.
UAP is in good shape. It has just emerged from a bruising period in which
its insurance interests were affected by the French recession and Banque
Worms, its banking subsidiary, sustained heavy losses in the Paris property
crisis. Net profits peaked at FFr4.22bn (Dollars 715.2m) in 1990 only to
fall to FFr3.77bn in 1991 and to FFr1.08bn in 1992.
It is on the road to recovery. The French insurance market is still
intensely competitive. However, UAP, like the other large insurers, has
benefited from the trend to raise premiums in the vulnerable damage sector.
The life sector has continued to grow, in spite of the recession, although
margins are still under strain. Even the sickly Banque Worms is starting to
reduce its losses.
For the first half of 1993 UAP net profits were 15 per cent ahead at
FFr1.09bn, against the same period last year.
Mr Simon Rudolph, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, expects net
profits of FFr1.8bn for the full year and FFr2.5bn in 1994. 'There are still
lots of pressures on the French market,' he said. 'But the situation has
improved.'
UAP's management is highly regarded. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who was chairman
for nearly five years until leaving last month to become head of the
troubled Credit Lyonnais banking group, is widely seen as having created an
excellent management team.
Mr Jacques Friedmann, his successor, is a political appointee with no
experience of the insurance industry. However, analysts seem confident that
UAP's existing team will be able to cope leaving Mr Friedmann to orchestrate
the privatisation and to put his political influence to good use on the
investment front.
'The appointment may seem strange from an Anglo-Saxon perspective, but the
French insurance industry is riddled with civil servants,' said Mr Derek
Elias, insurance analyst at Paribas in London. 'Besides we're not looking at
a rescue situation. UAP is well-managed and recovery is already under way.'
One of Mr Peyrelevade's last acts at UAP was to solve its strategic problem
by clinching a deal with Suez, the French holding company, to take control
of Colonia, the second largest German insurer. The Colonia agreement has not
only given UAP a long-sought foothold in Germany, but has also ended the
embarrassment of its on-off negotiations with Suez.
Financially, managerially and strategically UAP looks like a prime contender
for a smooth privatisation. The only potential obstacle is the over-heated
state of insurance shares on the European stock markets.
Insurance shares rose rapidly in the 12 months until October this year on
hopes of an improvement in trading and of further falls in interest rates,
which should increase the value of the insurers' bond and equity
investments. The sector peaked in October but has fallen as investors have
grown impatient with the slow progress of rate reduction, particularly in
France and Germany.
UAP has reflected the market trend. Its shares soared to a peak of FFr673 in
October this year, from FFr375 in November 1992 but have since fallen to
close yesterday at FFr633. This means that the government will have to fix
the price of the state's remaining 53 per cent stake in UAP (worth FFr28bn
at the present prices) against an adverse trend.
'Investors have lost their appetite for insurance shares,' said one analyst.
'There's absolutely no doubt that UAP is a suitable candidate for
privatisation. But the pricing of the issue could be tricky and not as
attractive to the French government as it would have been a few months ago.'

Great Western Resources yesterday announced it had settled its litigation
with the former chairman and founder of the US based oil and coal company
who left amid shareholder discontent two years ago.
Mr Dan Pena, who was recently awarded Dollars 3.3m (Pounds 2.2m) plus costs
by a Texas jury over his claim for unfair dismissal, will receive Dollars 3m
plus an 80 per cent stake in a GWR subsidiary.
GWR said yesterday that the settlement incorporated a substantial reduction
in the termination benefits awarded by the jury to allow for Dollars 1.4m
which was advanced to the former chairman during his time at the company.
Mr Pena and Mr Gary Loveless, GWR's chief executive, have both agreed to
surrender some options as part of the settlement.

the directors anticipated a 'very busy' second six months.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 8.28m (Pounds 9.6m). Interest charges accounted
for Pounds 118,000 (Pounds 276,000) and tax for Pounds 188,000 (Pounds
256,000). Earnings emerged at 1.49p (2.4p) and an interim dividend of 1.15p
is declared.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Philip Harris halved
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As foreshadowed in the statement issued in September, difficult trading left
pre-tax profits at Philip Harris, the laboratory and educational equipment
supplier, halved at Pounds 378,000 for the six months to September 30,
against Pounds 806,000.
Turnover, however, advanced 6 per cent to Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 41.7m), all
of the increase coming from the medical division. Earnings per share fell to
2.42p (6.6p) while the interim dividend is held at 2.2p.
Gearing at the period end was 17 per cent against 65 per cent six months
earlier, the result of the Pounds 5m rights issue in March.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dawson Intl tumbles 41% to Pounds 9.2m -
Interim dividend halved following poor performance at US fleece and jersey
offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile company, cut its interim
dividend by almost half as continuing problems in the US reduced pre-tax
profits for the six months to September 25 by 41 per cent.
Profits were Pounds 9.23m on turnover of Pounds 220.9m, compared with Pounds
15.5m on turnover of Pounds 210.7m.
Earnings fell from 6.5p to 3.3p, and the interim dividend is cut from 2.9p
to 1.5p.
The shares fell 37p to 136p.
Sir Ronald Miller, chairman, attributed the fall to extremely difficult
markets for fleece and jersey garments - mainly T-shirts and sweatshirts -
made by JE Morgan Apparel in the US. Losses there obscured good results from
other businesses.
Operating profit at the mainly US-based Dawson Consumer Products fell from
Pounds 8.46m to Pounds 723,000. Turnover rose from Pounds 117.3m to Pounds
125m, but the latest figure included a benefit of almost Pounds 20m from
foreign exchange movements.
The company, which is closing four plants in the US, said that structural
over-capacity in the sector and the need to hold stocks to meet changing
demands from retailers had both built up stocks and hit margins. Losses on
fleece and jersey had reached well into seven figures.
Operating profits at Dawson Premier Brands, which includes Pringle and the
luxury goods business, rose from Pounds 8.84m to Pounds 12.8m. But after
allowing for the effect of currency translations, operating profits were
flat. Turnover rose by 2.6 per cent to Pounds 95.8m.
Mr Nick Kuenssberg, chief executive of the division, said Pringle was
proving a main area for growth and now had 230 retail outlets. However,
United Brands incurred an operating loss. Restructuring was taking longer
than expected and some overseas markets were proving difficult.
Interest payable rose from Pounds 1.78m to Pounds 4.29m. The increase was
mainly accounted for by a rise of Pounds 1m payable on dollar-based loans,
coupled with a Pounds 700,000 fall in interest received on European
deposits. The remainder reflected higher levels of working capital.
COMMENT
It looks like the end of the American dream for Dawson. The harshly
competitive environment in the US is likely only to get worse, and it would
perhaps be better for the company to admit that it is too small a player in
a rough game. The fundamental nature of US retailing has changed, and
just-in-time delivery is forcing all suppliers to take the risk on stocks.
The North American Free Trade Agreement has upped the ante with the threat
of low labour cost plants in Mexico. The UK businesses look sound, but not
exciting. The City, wary of more nasty surprises, has cut forecasts for the
full year from Pounds 30m to as low as Pounds 18m. Until Dawson settles its
US problems once and for all, the shares cannot realise their full
potential.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Verson reduces loss to Pounds 2.87m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Verson International, the Midlands-based capital equipment manufacturer,
reduced losses in the half year to end-July, but its prospects for returning
to the black by the end of its financial year depend crucially on the future
flow of royalty payments.
The company yesterday announced a pre-tax loss for the first half of Pounds
2.87m, against a deficit in the comparable period of Pounds 5.61m. The
1991-92 full year loss was Pounds 3.27m.
The half year deficit translated into losses per share of 1.96p, against
losses of 3.95p in the comparable half. There is no dividend payment.
Turnover expanded from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 49.4m, reflecting the
acquisition last year in the US of Niagara Machine and Tool Works and of
Clearing International.
Verson Wilkins, Verson's lossmaking pressing company, has been merged into
Clearing and, while the two are operating at a loss, their position is
improving on the back of buoyant US orders and an increase in UK demand.
Verson's first half profits were hit by a fall in royalty income to Pounds
667,000 from Pounds 3.9m in the 1991-92 first half.
The group is now negotiating new royalty agreements. If these can be
concluded in the second half they would help the group back to profit this
year. If not, a return to profit is likely to be delayed until next year.
However, Mr Tim Kelleher, chairman, noted that 'overall order intake during
the six months since the year end has shown a slow but steady upward trend.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity lifts dividend by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity led off the regional electricity companies' interim
results season yesterday with a pace-setting 20 per cent increase in its
dividend.
The rise, from 5.5p to 6.6p, was accompanied by a minimum Pounds 5 rebate
for all domestic customers, bringing to more than Pounds 10 the rebates that
customers have received this year. Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said:
'We have obligations to the customers and to the shareholders, and we're
trying to fulfil both of them.'
Eastern, the largest of the recs, reported pre-tax profits for the six
months to September 30 of Pounds 77.4m, up 14.5 per cent from last year's
Pounds 67.6m which was restated to reflect a change in accounting policy.
Eastern now matches periodic costs to revenues, spreading them more evenly
through the year.
Turnover was Pounds 799m, down from Pounds 841.9m, reflecting the absence of
economic recovery in Eastern's region, which stretches from north-east
London to East Anglia, and price reductions. Unit sales of electricity were
flat in all segments of the market.
The profits growth came largely from reduced costs. The company shed 1,250
people in the year to September 30, and expects to lose a further 200 by the
end of the current financial year. The cost of all these redundancies,
Pounds 8.6m, was charged to the first half.
There was also an improvement in Eastern's retailing activities where a loss
of Pounds 1.3m was turned into an operating profit of Pounds 3.1m, including
a Pounds 600,000 share of the loss by E&amp;S, Eastern's joint retailing
venture. Contracting reduced its loss from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.1m.
Mr James Smith, chairman, said the result clearly demonstrated the company's
determination to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the core
electricity business. 'We confidently expect our results for the full year
to continue to demonstrate our success in these areas.'
COMMENT
The eye-catching dividend helped drive up the shares and set a good tone for
the results season. The underlying performance was harder to judge, however,
because of the rebalancing caused by the change in accounting policy, though
SG Warburg calculate it implies a full-year dividend of 22p, and a yield of
4.7 per cent, about average for the sector. The results showed that the new
management team headed by Mr Devaney continues to make progress against
costs, and that should enable Eastern to hold its place as the supplier of
some of the cheapest domestic electricity in the country. However, non-core
activities are still not out of the red, and those will still need close
attention.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIT Holdings, the marketing services, investment and fund management group
that has specialised in business expansion schemes, is to restructure and
eliminate its Pounds 8m of bank debt.
The group, which will seek shareholder approval for the proposals at an
extraordinary meeting on December 22, has also settled, without adverse
impact, an investigation by the Inland Revenue.
The name is to be changed to Johnson Fry Holdings, its UK financial services
company.
The proposals include the conversion of all preference shares, the
acquisition of significant minority interests and the removal of very small
shareholdings. An open offer of 1.81m new ordinary shares is being made at
43p a share.
It is also intending a 1,000 for 1 share consolidation and a 25 for 1 share
split giving an effective consolidation of 40 for 1.
The repayment of the bank debt, which had already been reduced from Pounds
12m by proceeds from the sale of LIT America, the US futures and options
clearing subsidiary, will be financed by cash generated by Johnson Fry.
Minority interests will be acquired for 30 per cent of the new ordinary
shares. The banks' holding of Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) of Johnson Fry
Holdings preference shares will be eliminated, along with Dollars 750,000 of
dividend arrears.
First preference shares will be converted at 37 for 1 which would give
holders a total of 35.4 per cent of the new ordinary shares. Redemption
premiums of Pounds 5.17m are being waived, along with dividend arrears of
Pounds 151,800.
Some of these shares are being made available to the employee share
ownership plan and the open offer, leaving the first preference shareholders
with 11.4 per cent.
Second preference shares will be converted at 10 for 1 giving holders a 25
per cent stake. Redemption premiums of Pounds 14.3m and dividend arrears of
Pounds 5.7m will be waived.
Holders of the existing ordinary shares will be left with a holding of 9.6
per cent.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Newspaper Publishing falls Pounds 486,000
into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newspaper Publishing, the company behind The Independent and The Independent
on Sunday, has moved into loss as it prepares to raise vital new long-term
finance to secure its future.
For the year to September 26 there were pre-tax losses of Pounds 486,000
compared with a Pounds 28,000 profit. Losses per share were 2.3p and no
dividend is recommended.
A main factor in the loss was Pounds 350,000 in professional fees arising
from the failed attempt to take over The Observer, which went instead to The
Guardian Media Group.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, the chairman, said that revenue had held up well in a
difficult year - turnover at Pounds 81.4m was only marginally down from last
time's Pounds 81.8m.
However, 'since the year end product redevelopment costs of Pounds 2.35m
have been incurred on advertising and other promotional expenditure', he
said.
The company has a 'multi-million pound' bank facility which runs until the
end of March 1994. Between now and then the company will have to get new
long-term finance in place or renegotiate the bank facility.
Mr Hay Davison confirmed that a business plan was being formulated 'which
will form the basis for raising the long-term finance necessary for the
company to go forward.'
The options range from a rights issue which could give the largest
shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, effective
control, bringing in a large new shareholder to a full takeover. The company
sees a full takeover as the least likely option at the moment.
Newspaper Publishing is going into its refinancing plan with the circulation
of both its titles under pressure.
The Independent is currently selling about 320,000 copies a day and The
Independent on Sunday 360,000. The daily paper's market share has fallen
from 17 per cent in 1992 to 16.1 per cent now and the Sunday title has a
stable share of about 14.3 per cent.
The market share figures mask a serious absolute drop in sales. Between May
and October The Independent's circulation fell from 374,668 to 333,647, a
fall of nearly 11 per cent. In the same period The Independent on Sunday
fell by 8 per cent to 368,246.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape poised to appeal over actuaries
classification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape has failed in its attempt to persuade the FT-SE Actuaries Industry
Classification Committee to move it from Vehicle Distributors to Diversified
Industries. It now plans to appeal.
The group's shares fell 6p to 515p on the news. Inchcape said it was 'very
disappointed by the decision' which it said was 'not in the interests of our
shareholders, our customers and the people we do business with. It cannot be
in the best interests of the investment community'.
Under the classification system companies are assigned to sub-sectors
according to the industry from which they derive most of their profits. In
1992 Inchcape made 60 per cent of its operating profits from motors
importing, distribution, and retailing.
But Inchcape argued that there was a distinction between the importing and
distribution activity and the retailing side. The latter made only 14 per
cent of profits.
Inchcape's compatriots in the sub-sector are largely UK motor retailers, and
as a much larger company, Inchcape said its presence would distort the
sector.
The new system comes into effect on January 4, and the Financial Times will
publish details at the year end.
Final changes to the proposed reclassifications, originally published in
October, were announced by the committee yesterday after a third meeting on
Monday. As a result another 40 companies were reassigned.
Significant movers included Albert Fisher Group, which shifted from
Retailers &amp; Wholesalers, Food to Food Manufacturers, and Ladbroke, which
moved from Leisure to Hotels &amp; Caterers.
Burton Group, which owns Debenhams department stores as well as a number of
retail chains, moved from Retailers, Chain Stores to Retailers,
Multi-Department. Sears, which runs the Selfridges department store, and
chains such as Miss Selfridge, Adams and Olympus, did the opposite switch.
A full list of yesterday's company sector changes will appear in tomorrow's
FT.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Turmoil over the Weinstock penny - The
closing stages of the rescue bid for Ferranti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that the rhetoric has died down it is time for Ferranti International's
48,000 shareholders to decide on GEC's recommended 1p a share rescue bid.
Next Wednesday is the first closing date for GEC's Pounds 11.4m offer for
the crippled defence electronics group - a bid which has the enthusiastic
support of no one.
Even GEC appears to have adopted a take it or leave it attitude to its token
offers, leaving Ferranti's board, led by Mr Eugene Anderson, to undertake
the difficult task of persuading shareholders representing at least 90 per
cent of its 936m ordinary shares to back the bid.
GEC's indifferent attitude towards the outcome of its offers to Ferranti's
ordinary, special and preference shareholders may reflect confidence that it
would be able to 'cherry-pick' any remaining Ferranti assets at bargain
prices should its bid be rejected and the company goes into receivership.
Although GEC would lose the possible, but by no means certain, benefits of
Ferranti's Pounds 109m of accrued UK tax losses and Pounds 106m pension
scheme actuarial surplus by purchasing from the receiver, it would save both
the Pounds 11.4m cost of the offers and the cost of assuming Ferranti's net
debts, contingent liabilities and overdue creditors' payments totalling
about Pounds 155m.
For their part Ferranti's institutional investors, who control about 60 per
cent of the group's outstanding equity, have grown accustomed to bad news in
the four years since the discovery of a huge fraud in the group's
International Signal &amp; Control subsidiary in the US blew a massive hole the
balance sheet.
Since then, they have watched as Mr Anderson fought to keep Ferranti afloat
by selling Pounds 500m of assets, cutting bank debt from Pounds 689m in 1989
to about Pounds 100m today, and reducing costs, including the workforce
which has shrunk from 22,000 to under 4,000.
However, in the absence of a higher bid the institutions will almost
certainly, albeit reluctantly, accept Lord Weinstock's penny.
Understandably, some of Ferranti's individual investors take a more robust
and arguably less pragmatic view, arguing that GEC's offers are 'derisory'
and fail to fully value Ferranti's intangible assets in particular.
Opposition to the bid has crystallised around the Ferranti Shareholders
Support Association, chaired by Mr John Katz, a research consultant who is
conducting a spirited campaign on their behalf.
Mr Katz believes shareholders are being 'steam-rollered' into accepting an
inadequate offer by warnings of the dire consequences if they do not. 'They
are being mugged', he says.
The association, which claims a membership of some 230 shareholders speaking
for more than 22m shares and probably speaks for hundreds more investors,
has argued that shareholders have been provided with insufficient
information on which to base an informed decision.
The association has suggested that Ferranti could be worth up to Pounds 150m
as a going concern and has urged Ferranti's banks to reconsider their
opposition to court administration rather than receivership if the GEC bid
fails.
This, however, seems a forlorn hope. Indeed, Mr Anderson, a company doctor
brought in to stabilise Ferranti after the ISC fiasco, argues that Ferranti
has effectively been in administration since the banks agreed to a
standstill arrangement in 1989.
More fundamentally, he has told shareholders that Ferranti is trapped in a
vicious downward spiral of dwindling orders and widening losses.
'Our weak balance sheet showing net borrowings of Pounds 98.6m against
shareholders funds of Pounds 34.9m, combined with extremely tight liquidity
has reduced the company's credibility when it bids for major contracts . . .
this situation has led to fewer contract wins and increased losses, a weaker
balance sheet and even tighter liquidity,' he said.
The final straw came early in November when Ferranti was told it would have
to resubmit its bid for a large Middle East air defence contract called
Delmon Eye. It was at that stage that GEC was persuaded to mount its rescue
bid.
As a Ferranti shareholder himself, Mr Anderson says he has sympathy with
some shareholders, although he also notes that 26,000 have joined the
register since the ISC fraud was discovered and that 200m shares changed
hands in the week after the 1p a share bid was first mooted.
Nevertheless, he has acknowledged that many loyal long-term Ferranti
shareholders are 'disappointed, disillusioned and angry.' He has even
described GEC's bid as 'calculated to irritate.'
But he has consistently argued that the GEC offer, no matter how 'mean',
represents the best option for shareholders and that whatever the arguments
'shareholders must appreciate that Ferranti is worth only what someone will
pay for it in its present circumstances.'
Even if there were no shareholder opposition, GEC's 90 per cent acceptance
target would be extremely difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, in the absence
of a viable alternative, Mr Anderson has called on shareholders to be
realistic and support the bid.
Many will find it hard to vote with their heads and not their hearts for a
GEC bid which is both paltry and unpalatable.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: West Trust to focus activities on food side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
West Trust yesterday announced an acquisition and a disposal to achieve its
objective of transforming the company into a specialised, high-added-value
food group and its virtual withdrawal from the textiles sector.
At the same time West reported a jump in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds
172,000 (Pounds 25,000).
The acquisition is of Drenning, whose Enco subsidiary is a wholesaler and
distributor of Caribbean and other food and drink products.
The consideration of Pounds 6.48m will be satisfied by the allotment of new
ordinary shares and Pounds 1.52m in cash. The vendor will retain 638,736
shares with the remaining 14.8m being offered by way of rights to West
shareholders on the basis of 11-for-20 at 32p.
West also announced the sale of Ken Moore, its wholly owned lycra
manufacturing subsidiary, to Ken Moore's managing director for Pounds 33,000
cash on completion. Ken Moore will also repay Pounds 117,000 of
inter-company debt, the balance of which, expected to amount to Pounds
622,000, will be paid in instalments.
For the six months to September 30 the pre-tax advance was achieved on
turnover of Pounds 4.92m (Pounds 3.76m). Earnings per share amounted to
0.75p (0.19p) and, subject to the acquisition being completed, an interim
dividend of 0.2p will be paid.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: NM Smaller Australian seeks Pounds 25.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NM Smaller Australian Companies Trust is raising Pounds 25.8m, before
expenses, via a placing of ordinary shares at 100p each, with warrants
attached on a 1-for-5 basis.
The new investment trust will invest in a portfolio of companies listed on
the Australian Stock Exchange which are not included in the ASX 50 Leaders
Index.
NM manages an Australian unit trust which is top of the Australasian sector
over the three, five and 10 years to November 1, according to Micropal. NM
Funds Management is owned by the National Mutual Life Association of
Australasia.
NM says the outlook for smaller Australasian companies is positive because
they have cut costs and improved efficiency in recession.
The trust will concentrate on capital appreciation and any dividends are
likely to be modest. The initial life of the trust will be seven years.
NatWest Wood Mackenzie is handling the placing and the minimum subscription
is Pounds 20,000. Initial expenses of the issue will be about 2.7 per cent
and the annual management fee will be 0.8 per cent.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: JLI slips to Pounds 1.3m midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring costs left pre-tax profits at JLI, the snacks and ingredients
maker, down from Pounds 1.84m to Pounds 1.32m in the six months ended
September 30. Sales advanced to Pounds 52.5m, against Pounds 50.9m.
As a measure of confidence the interim dividend is being lifted from 1.55p
to 1.6p. Earnings per share fell to 2.1p (3.2p).
Operating profits were Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 2.35m) but the company spent
Pounds 695,000 on reorganising the snacks division, its most profitable
business. During the period the division's operating profits fell to Pounds
1m (Pounds 1.29m) on sales ahead at Pounds 15m (Pounds 14.7m). 'We were held
back basically by the inability to get price increases from our customers to
compensate for the sharp increase in the raw material input prices,' said Mr
Yoav Gottesman, chief executive.
Interest payments declined to Pounds 232,000 (Pounds 511,000) as UK rates
fell. Gearing was unchanged at 42 per cent at the period end but was likely
to fall to about 30 per cent by the year end, in line with seasonal
fluctuations.
