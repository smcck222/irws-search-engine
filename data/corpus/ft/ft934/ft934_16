FT  30 NOV 93 / FT Review of Business Books (9): The way to a journalist's
heart - Charles Batchelor assesses some self-help PR guides for growing
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
How should businesses handle their PR? Most people spend at least an hour a
day reading the newspapers, listening to the radio and watching television.
Yet to judge by their attempts to get a story about themselves or their
business into the media, many have not the faintest idea what makes 'a good
story.' when it comes to self-promotion.
Fortunately for the amateur in this area, there is no shortage of recent
books offering advice, some of it good.
Linda Fairbrother's Your Message and the Media (Nicholas Brealey Publishing,
Pounds 19.95, 306 pages) is the most expensive, but probably the best value,
from the latest clutch of books on the subject. It addresses in a clear and
entertaining style the questions raised by the person attempting to gain
publicity for himself or his organisation. The clear lay-out, helpful
section headings and extensive use of examples almost compensate for the
lack of an index.
One of the commonest questions about media relations is, 'How do I retain
control over what they print or say?' The straightforward answer is that you
can't, writes Linda Fairbrother, who runs courses on media relations for the
Industrial Society.
Journalists will follow the angle they think is interesting but you can
nudge them in the direction you want if you plan ahead, she says. Suggest a
newsworthy angle of your own; target the right medium for your type of
story; practice before an interview. These simple techniques will give you
greater control of the message.
Recognise that the media will often come at you whether you like it or not,
she warns. If something does go wrong you will at least have a good chance
of your version getting a good hearing if you have already established good
contacts with the press.
The Small Business Publicity Manual, by Barry Ashby and Mike Park (Copydesk,
tel: 081-851 440, Pounds 9.75, 58 pages), could probably justify its lack of
an index by its claim to be a no-frills guide to promoting sales. It
provides a sensible if somewhat brief guide, together with handy checklists,
for people seeking to win publicity for their business.
Decide what is special about your business, so you know what you want to
say; then define your target market so you know who you want to say it to,
the authors suggest. They provide helpful hints on writing a press release
and preparing for meetings with journalists.
Many of the suggestions they make appear obvious but they are often
overlooked. Make sure that your occasion does not clash with another media
event on the same day. Unless your premises are really unsuitable, use them
for meetings. Keep presentations short but allow plenty of time for
questions.
For all its brevity this book could not be accused of lacking ambition. It
takes in advertising, sponsorship and exhibitions as well as press
relations. For the owner manager or executive with very little time to
spare, this makes a handy, if somewhat overpriced, introduction.
Hiding inside 101 Ways to Get Great Publicity, by Timothy Foster (Kogan
Page, Pounds 7.99, 114 pages) are some sensible suggestions but they
struggle to overcome the author's format. Any handbook with a number in its
title prompts suspicion that the subject matter is being stretched (or more
rarely compressed) to fit. The suspicion is amply justified in this case.
Scrappy writing and the frequent resort to the dictionary for a handy
definition to carry the narrative forward suggest a book written in haste.
Nonetheless, 101 Ways contains worthwhile advice on producing press
releases, compiling a press kit, handling bad publicity and correcting
errors. Deliberate lies or distortions also have a knack of being found it,
the author warns. The big advantage of telling the truth is you don't have
to remember what you have said.
Manage the Message, by Bryan Thresher and Jim Biggin (Century Business,
Pounds 9.99, 258 pages), is not really about dealing with the press at all,
despite its title. Its theme is the use of writing to achieve your aims  -
written communication as a means of persuading and motivating people.
Much of the subject matter is the sort which would be covered by any
competent English master in the second or third form, though the daily
mangling suffered by the English language in much business communication
shows the need for a reminder at least.
This book compares the use of a formal writing style with a more chatty
approach and the different effects which can be achieved. It considers the
active and passive voice, the use of Latin words and the importance of
constructing an argument logically and without emotion or exaggeration.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH
By David Inwood and Jean Hammond
Kogan Page Pounds 16.95 194 pages
The company which gets to market first can often set a standard and
establish a lead which its competitors can never destroy. So the speed with
which new products or services can be developed and put on sale can make a
significant contribution to company profits.
The Japanese have established a strong reputation for bringing products
rapidly to market. Japanese companies in the motor industry have brought
development lead times down to just 43 months compared with the 63 months
taken by their US competitors, though the Americans have started to respond.
Just how a company should set about improving its management of product
development is explained in this practical guide. The authors, respectively
a consultant and an organisational psychologist, identify their target
market as the corporate strategist, the project manager and the leaders and
members of product development teams.
The techniques described are most likely to form part of a large company's
management armoury but the principles could be applied, with benefit, by the
medium-sized business.
The pace of new product launches in a range of highly visible sectors such
as video recorders, cameras and motor vehicles has encouraged high
expectations among consumers. But the failure rate for new high-technology
products is high.
Traditional methods of developing new products are no longer appropriate,
the authors argue. In the past the process would start with a technical
product development team turning an idea into a design. The production
engineering department would convert the design into a product; and a
production team would devise the means of manufacture, including tooling and
training. Finally marketing would launch and sell the product.
This way of working is often known as the 'over-the-wall' approach to
product development. One department does its job in isolation and then
passes the project with little or no discussion on to the next. Objectives
may be lost as the project is handed on; no one is in overall control; there
is often a need for lots of changes late in the day; and the process is
expensive and slow.
The new approach, which has been pioneered by the Japanese, is for an
integrated management team to develop these various strands in parallel.
Outline market research will be carried out at the same time as an
investigation of the technical possibilities. At the same time the
production department will begin its planning.
However, there are limits to this approach and complete parallel working is
not really possible. Until the concept has been worked out and the
specifications drawn up it would be suicidal to run technical, production
and marketing development at the same time.
The label which has been applied to this method of working is 'simultaneous
or concurrent engineering', though this has the unfortunate implication that
product development is still at heart an engineering process. The authors
prefer the term 'integrated product development.' This requires the
creation, at an early stage, of a multi-disciplinary team which can ensure
there is a consistent approach. As far as possible, the different processes
should take place in parallel, though in practice some areas will have to
overlap rather than run in complete parallel.
Ideally projects should be kept small and companies should aim for
incremental improvements rather than big advances. The more ambitious the
development, the more likely it is to become bogged down by problems. This
can create a vicious circle of infrequent product launches and a consequent
loss of feedback from customers, leading to expensive failure. Controls are
then tightened, senior management becomes involved and development slows
even further.
But while incremental change can reduce the risks involved in product
development, it can be pushed too far, the authors warn. Too many changes
cause problems for product support and can leave customers who have bought
an earlier model feeling short-changed.
Even when there is careful planning, product development is never a certain
thing, with fixed and knowable goals at the start. Product development teams
must therefore be prepared to modify their plans as a project advances. If
insuperable problems emerge they may have to axe a project altogether.
But by adopting a phased approach they can achieve a better management of
risk. Often the idea of risk appears to defy rational thought, but there are
methods of controlling risk which do not necessarily require the use of
refined numeric techniques.
Risks may be categorised as internal, resulting, for example, from a lack of
resources or the use of an unfamiliar technology. Or they may be external,
taking the form of a pre-emptive product launch by a competitor or a change
in public taste. They may relate to the technology involved or to the
marketing approach adopted.
By discussing risk in advance, a product team can assess both the
probability of a particular threat and its potential severity. Managers can
then take steps to avoid the risk, to share it with, say, a supplier, or to
insure against it. They can modify a product or commission outside research
and development to solve a particular problem.
This handbook provides a thorough, if somewhat dry, account of how to speed
up product development. It would have been improved by the use of case
histories and by a more comprehensive glossary to guide the beginner through
the jargon. But it deals with a subject which companies ignore at their
peril.

THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER IN EUROPE: COMPETITION AND REGULATION IN THE EC
ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY
By Francis McGowan
Royal Institute of International Affairs, Pounds 12.50 104 pages
Francis McGowan does not tell us whether he was alluding to AJP Taylor's
Struggle for Mastery in Europe in choosing the title for his book on
electricity competition. Either way, the comparison is more apt than it may
appear.
Both Taylor, whose book concentrated on European diplomacy in the 19th
century, and McGowan had to get to grips with complex issues. And both deal
with subjects of political import.
As McGowan points out it was Lenin who pointed to the power of electricity
when he said communism equals Soviets plus electricity. But throughout the
world virtually all political systems have considered electricity to be a
strategic industry safest in monopolisitic, often state, hands.
The political power of electrical power explains the intense struggle the EC
is facing to liberalise the industry and free it up to competition, with
strong opposition coming both from the European parliament and the
utilities.
The liberalisation attempts form the focus for McGowan's study which manages
to combine comprehensiveness with accessibility. Unlike many writers,
McGowan, a university lecturer, has no political axe to grind. His book
provides useful reading for the growing numbers of industrialists who will
need to understand the proposed changes.
The need arises because the EC's proposals would radically change the way
the industry operates and reshape its relations with both consumers and
suppliers.
The main elements of its reform plan include increasing transparency of
utilities accounts, achieving greater access for non-utility power producers
to grid systems. Third Party Access, another plank of reform, would give
greater scope for large energy users and distribution companies to deal
directly with competing power producers.
The effects would be to end privileged relationships between national
utilities and local suppliers of fuel and equipment, and change pricing
structures for consumers. Some charges may fall as competition bites but
others, for example those affecting rural communities, could rise as
cross-subsidies would be threatened.
The trends towards privatisation and diversification among utilities would
be strengthened and utilities would have to reconsider broader commitments
to social policy such as maintaining job levels. There is also a risk of
service deterioration. With so much at stake it is not surprising that the
utilities are fighting, often with the backing of their governments, to
limit the effects of the change.
The book charts the influence on the debate of the UK, which through
privatisation has shown how electricity systems can be ordered differently
but does not necessarily provide a model for Community-wide reform, and of
France, widely viewed as the country where monopolistic tendencies are most
acute.
McGowan points to the likely compromise solutions between the commission and
opponents of reform. Under one scenario, the commission would water down its
TPA directive by maintaining the principle of a more competitive system but
leave it to individual users to to request access to systems.
In any event the European electricity industry is moving from its strong
monopolistic bias towards greater competition. The EC's willingness and
ability to exercise its will should none the less determine the speed and
depth of change.

SCOTCH MISSED: THE LOST DISTILLERIES OF SCOTLAND
by Brian Townsend
Neil Wilson Publishing Pounds 14.99 160 pages
Whether it is coal mining, motor cycles or televisions, sentimentality about
'lost' industries is rather a British speciality. But when it comes to the
uneconomic distilleries of Scotland, the pining becomes almost inconsolable.
What a tragic loss, goes the cry, as a bottle of 64-year old Dallas Dhu is
sold at auction for Pounds 4,400.
Such hand-wringing is misplaced. It fails to take account of the unique
conditions that led to a distillery's foundation and shaped its initial
market. It also ignores the widespread failure of a hopelessly atomised
industry to adapt to, and influence, changed consumer tastes.
Brian Townsend is a devotee of the lost dram. His book is part history and
part guide to the ruins. The 'water of life' probably came to Scotland from
Ireland in the late 15th century, explaining in part peat-rich Islay's early
pre-eminence. Family bothy distilleries remained ubiquitous north of the
Highland line even after the Industrial Revolution, exploiting the special
qualities of their location - whether peat, water, barley or all three.
The North also stood out for its successful evasion of duty. This owed much
to family ingenuity, but also to the localised nature of the market. Many a
magistrate was struck with compassion when his importunate estate supplier
stood before him.
But ironically such parochialism does much to explain the demise of the
smaller distilleries. Take, for example, their reaction to the 1820s reform
of the excise system. It now became viable to distil on a larger scale, and
such household names as Johnny Walker date to that time. But the smaller
distilleries rarely combined. Not for the first time in British
manufacturing, long-term thinking was at a premium in a long-term industry.
Distilling in the 19th century offered better returns on investment than
selling grain to mills, but quality varied between distillations and
according to harvests. Continuity and reliability of supply were secured
only by outside intervention. By blending malt with the less flavoursome,
but more consistent, grain whisky increasingly produced in the larger
distilleries, the new whisky merchants could ensure supplies to the
lucrative distant markets, particularly London. Further growth came through
exploiting the nascent glass bottling process which helped to reduce prices.
The fact that expansion was largely the result of action by non-distillers
is significant. The distillers were often woefully under-capitalised and
their focus on local markets meant a large slice of the profits went to the
merchants when, in the later 19th century, consumption increased among such
groups as the brandy-deprived monied classes and Empire exiles.
Townsend chronicles the almost yearly changes of ownership among the
proliferating, but ultimately-doomed distilleries, as new owners sought
unsuccessfully to cash in at the local level. When the boost in whisky
consumption was ended by a combination of temperance, a big rise in duties
courtesy of Lloyd George and war, the core weaknesses of the smaller
distillers, particularly in the west of Scotland, were ruthlessly exposed.
Depression and the organising mind of Distillers Company's chairman, William
Ross, rationalised the industry and cut back the over-supply in the
inter-war years. Once both domestic and export market conditions improved
after 1950, a smaller, but more outward-looking industry developed, notably
in Speyside. The fact that some of the most successful new operations are
family-owned shows that past lessons have been learnt. Japanese inward
investment has included distillery ownership, with tourist potential well
exploited.
Old habits die hard, however, and Townsend's affinity with his subject
prompts him to echo the industry's plea for 'fairer' tax and tariff
treatment. But British governments have a well-proven ability to raise
revenue successfully from duties, while other countries seem set to ensure
their own distilleries prosper, regardless of the Uruguay Round.

THE EVOLUTION OF OIL MARKETS: TRADING INSTRUMENTS AND THEIR ROLE IN PRICE
FORMATION
by Joe Roeber
Royal Institute of International Affairs, 90 pages, Pounds 12.50
OIL MARKETS AND PRICES
by Paul Horsnell and Robert Mabro
Oxford University Press, 334 pages, Pounds 39.50
Asked how the oil markets work, most would probably say they were run by the
big oil companies and OPEC. That may have been so 10 years ago, but today
things are very different.
OPEC's grip on oil prices began to slip after the oil shocks of the 1980s
and finally gave way in 1985-86 when Saudi Arabia stopped playing the role
of 'swing producer'. Since then, open markets have taken over, and oil is
now traded like any other commodity with published prices and all the
derivative trappings.
The markets revolve round a few 'marker' crudes, such as Brent from the
North Sea, West Texas Intermediate in the US and Dubai in the Gulf. The
market players are a tight-knit - and shrinking - group of large oil
companies, Wall Street investment houses and Japanese traders. According to
Horsnell and Mabro, 174 traders were identified in the late 1980s, but now
the core of those who really matter numbers a mere 15.
In the 'wet markets' for actual delivery, oil is traded on the basis of
cargoes using a complicated system which anticipates three-day loading slots
at some future date in the future.
In the dated Brent market, a cargo is traded round the market in a kind of
pass-the-parcel, and whoever holds it at the end of the afternoon is 'five
o'clocked' and has to buy it. There are wrinkles, like the 'tolerance game'
which enables traders to trade on the fact that cargoes may have variations,
or tolerances, up to 5 per cent.
The evolution of derivative markets such as futures and options, (the 'paper
markets') has opened the way for sophisticated trading techniques in which
tax minimisation, hedging or pure speculation provide the motivation as much
as a simple desire to buy crude oil.
The key question, though, is what drives the oil price if it is no longer
OPEC? Both books reach the same conclusion: Brent is the key because many
OPEC members price off it, and other markets are linked through arbitrage.
Politics plays a role, but as Horsnell and Mabro point out, it is
anticipation of what OPEC may do rather than what it actually does which
influences prices.
The markets are far from perfect: they can be manipulated, they lack the
ability to trade certain types of crude oil, and the best price information
depends on newspaper reporters speaking to the right people at the right
time. But both books contain pleas to government to resist the temptation to
try and make them better.
Readers can choose between these two publications. Roeber has compressed the
subject to a handy size, but the result is often dense and heavy going.
Anyone with a serious interest in the oil market would do better to invest
the time and money in Horsnell and Mabro whose account is both fascinating
and scholarly.

IT AIN'T AS EASY AS IT LOOKS
By Porter Bibb
Crown, Dollars 25, 468 pages
In the appropriate setting of Las Vegas, gambling capital of the world,
Atlanta television station owner Ted Turner announced to a sceptical world
in May 1979 that he was about to steal a march on the entire communications
industry and launch the first 24-hour-a-day television news network. It
would be called Cable News Network, or CNN.
The event was classic Turner: a combination of inspired business acumen,a
touch of bombast, immense risk-taking,and an ability to fly by the seat of
his pants.
Turner, while a growing force in the industry, was no heavyweight, and
several of America's largest television conglomerates were also considering
an all-news network - though very cautiously, given the potential this
offered for heavy losses.
Indeed, at the time of the announcement Turner lacked any clear blueprint,
structure, organisation or offices for the new channel he was committed to
launching in just 11 months. Just minutes before the Las Vegas press
conference, to give credibility to the venture he signed a hurried contract
on a sheet of hotel writing paper to hire CNN's first Washington
correspondent.
What Turner did have was a remarkable instinct for trends in the television
industry and a knack of hiring extremely able lieutenants who could
translate his grandiose visions into practical ventures.
Not long after the Las Vegas meeting, Turner disappeared to indulge his
passion for competitive ocean sailing, leaving the detailed planning of the
network to the man widely regarded in the industry as the real founder of
CNN - television news veteran Reese Schonfeld.
Many pundits predicted disaster, particularly when media giant Westinghouse
Electric launched a short-lived news station of its own. Forbes magazine
said Turner was likely to 'crash in flames.' Yet CNN triumphed and,
according to Porter Bibb, has redefined news from 'something that has
happened to something that is happening.'
Bibb, an investment banker and former journalist, has written a readable
biography of Turner, ranging over his remarkable business and yachting
achievements (including his 1977 America's Cup victory) and his colourful
character and private life.
Turner takes the drug lithium to control his violent mood swings, which,
says Bibb, are typical manifestations of a manic-depressive illness known as
clothymia.
Bibb also reckons that unhappiness in Turner's childhood helped turn him
into a 'lonely, defiant outsider.' His father, who ran a successful
billboard advertising business, sent him to live with his grandparents at
the age of three and at the age of six he was sent to boarding school.
Throughout his life, says Bibb, Turner has been driven to outdo his remote,
harsh father, who committed suicide in 1963 when Turner was just 24.
Instead of selling the family business, Turner started to build it up, and
took his first steps into broadcasting, buying up radio stations on the
grounds that he could use his empty billboards to advertise their
programmes.
In 1970 he acquired his first television station, a failing Atlanta
operation, which he built into America's first super-station offering a
combination of entertainment and sport.
'At first,' says a colleague from that time, 'nobody took him seriously. Big
mistake. He is eccentric. Maybe even crazy. But Turner's bright and he is
driven.' It is Turner's oddball nature, his willingness to take a contrarian
position, that has repeatedly brought him business success, often against
big odds.
The takeover battle currently raging over Paramount Communications, the
entertainment group, reflects the growing belief among communications
companies that access to programming will be a key to success in the new age
of multi-media interactive entertainment.
But Turner has acted on that principle since the start of his career. When
he was building up the Atlanta super-station he went against conventional
wisdom and bought films outright rather than licensing them for a limited
number of showings.
As long ago as 1981 he opened negotiations with Californian investor Kirk
Kerkorian which ultimately led Turner to buy the MGM studio's library of old
movies for Dollars 1.2bn in 1986 - a transaction mocked at the time as
over-priced but which may turn out to have been shrewd.
'The game I'm in is building assets,' Turner once said, 'and I've never
minded overpaying if I know the values are there.' His recent expensive
acquisition of two small Hollywood studios, Castle Rock and New Line, fits
the same pattern.
However, as Bibb notes, the domestic growth of Turner's established channels
is likely to slow over the next few years as the US cable market approaches
saturation. The company will have to look overseas for growth, where it
faces increasing competition, and to new domestic channels or acquisitions.
Turner has long been interested in buying a television network and made an
abortive bid for CBS in 1985. Bibb suggests that a merger with any of the
big three US networks would make business sense, though it might be blocked
by the cable companies which hold large stakes in Turner.
Still, in the midst of a media takeover wave, no such alliances can be ruled
out. Many more chapters remain to be written in the Ted Turner story.

THE WORLD OF GOLD: THE INSIDE STORY OF WHO MINES, WHO MARKETS AND WHO BUYS
GOLD
by Timothy Green
Rosendale Press, Pounds 21 388 pages
It is 25 years since Tim Green became entranced by the mystique of gold and
quit his job as editor of Illustrated London News to write the first version
of this book. Time has not diminished his enthusiasm nor his ability to
bring the world of gold to life with writing that has crystal clarity and
huge dollops of humour. These flow from the anecdotes he has picked up
travelling well over 1m miles in a global search for the gossip which is
essential to an understanding of a deeply secretive business.
He contends that during those 25 years the world of gold has changed more
than in the preceding three or four thousand. He has seen the price of gold
move from Dollars 35 a troy ounce in 1970, up to Dollars 850 in 1980 and
back down to Dollars 350 in 1990. But he cannot decided whether the decision
by international governments to end the fixed price of gold in 1968 or the
subsequent radical transformation in communications was the more important
influence.
According to Green: 'It meant that, for many new players in the market,
volatility, not stability, was the chief attraction: to them it did not
matter whether the price went up or down, as long as it moved. The
communications network brought everyone together, round the world, round the
clock, and made the gold price a moveable feast.'
The gold market has been dishing up futures, options, warrants in ever more
exotic combinations to woo a new clientele whose prime concern was often a
piece of the action without the acute embarrassment of having to take
delivery of a single ounce.
Green argues that this has left the gold market's future very much in the
hands of the New York investment funds. Futures, options, swaps and related
instruments today make up an estimated Dollars 10,000bn in investments
traded both over the counter and on regulated exchanges.
'The gold market is only a side-show in this revolution much of the time,'
Green points out. 'But mobile money can be switched into it in an afternoon
if the mood is there, as happened in 1993 when high-profile players like Sir
James Goldsmith and George Soros kick-started a rally that ran from Dollars
340 to Dollars 400, triggering not only a scramble for cover, but luring the
weight of serious money from managed futures funds who saw gold as the
play-of-the-day.'
Such a wave can easily swamp momentarily the 'rather modest' physical market
in gold. Green puts the total value of newly-mined gold each year at less
than Dollars 30bn (at Dollars 400 an ounce). 'This is petty cash when one
considers that Dollars 1,130bn is traded every day in currency markets.'
Managed futures funds have more than Dollars 20bn at their disposal and
think nothing of zipping in an out for 100,000 ounces of gold or more at a
clip. 'Annual trading volume on futures thus dwarfs conventional physical
markets.'
Green also shows the way tactics in gold options and futures have become
increasingly dictated by technical charting and computer trading which are
all about 'buy' and 'sell' signals and give short shrift to the fundamentals
of who mines and who buys gold. 'Detecting when those signals may be
triggered is a part of a dealer's life. Every bullion bank has its in-house
chartist, plotting support points, moving averages and momentum indicators
or oscillators as they are known in the US.'
Green tells of a colleague who ventured to tackle a fund manager after a New
York seminar on the growth of managed money, with the suggestion that the
mine production numbers might mean something. 'He had his head snapped off.
'I don't care if South Africa produces one ounce or one million,' the
manager said, turning on his heel and leaving. His fund looks after a modest
Dollars 650m, some of which may shift into gold from time to time, when the
computer says so.'
This book is not for that fund manager. Green gives us gold's fascinating
history as well as showing us many of today's great gold mines through an
expert's eyes. He explains how new technology - and a climbing price -
spurred the gold rushes in Australia and North America during the 1980s.
The broad message of this book will please the bulls. Green suggests that
gold has come to terms with its new environment while the broad canvas of
supply and demand looks promising. Gold 'has come through what could have
been a traumatic transition from being principally a monetary metal to one
principally used in jewellery, but with the added zest of continuing
universal acceptance as a means of exchange and as a speculative or
investment vehicle.'

MODERN JAPAN

THE JAPANESE POWER ELITE
by Albrecht Rothacher
Macmillan, Pounds 45 312 pages
PLANNING FOR CHANGE: INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND JAPANESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
1945-1990
by James Vestal
Oxford, Pounds 25 244 pages
Until recently, studies of modern Japan tended to be of the awe-struck
'economic miracle' variety, with glowing accounts of post-war
reconstruction, or, occasionally, dire warnings of the country's coming
global domination. Then, a few years ago, the tide turned. The new consensus
held that Japan was on the brink of collapse.
As so often, the facts turned out to be less melodramatic. The miracle was
flawed, but the descent to reality has been gradual rather than cataclysmic.
The current deep recession is producing a more radical restructuring of the
economy than previous downturns. After years of promises, political reform
is under way. Society too is evolving, with previously unimaginable
challenges to the primacy of the company in Japanese life.
None of these three books was written late enough to take account of recent
developments, but they each provide clues as to what sort of country might
emerge.
Sir Hugh Cortazzi spent 15 years in the British Embassy in Tokyo, most
recently as ambassador from 1980 to 1984, and has written extensively on the
country. Modern Japan is a thorough, factual survey of the political,
economic and social institutions of the country. It is a compact book, a
basic guide to Japan for newcomers.
Ten chapters deal with the major themes: history, politics, government, law,
foreign affairs, finance, industry, agriculture and infrastructure,
employment and health, and education and culture. Each chapter provides
little more than a brief pen-picture.
At times the pace is too much. A thousand years of history is condensed into
30 pages. Its concise nature requires the author to dwell heavily on the
institutional framework of the country, without too much detail of the way
it works in practice.
There is plenty of factual material on the basic political institutions  -
parties, elections, cabinet, civil service - but virtually no account of the
way in which those institutions have actually functioned in the recent past.
No mention is made of either the Lockheed or Recruit scandals. Yet these two
episodes tell us as much about Japanese politics in practice as any
constitutional textbook.
In the preface the author explains that the information has been selected on
the basis that it is the kind of material he 'would have liked to have had
as ambassador . . . to provide briefing for visiting ministers and
officials.' This is its principal weakness. It is largely an administrator's
guide. Even the sections on industry and finance begin with descriptions of
ministries, not businessmen, as though only civil servants matter.
Albrecht Rothacher's The Japanese Power Elite puts us right on that point.
Rothacher is a European diplomat, who served in the EU Tokyo delegation
until 1991. But his language is far from diplomatic. 'The country resembles
a uniformed, almost fully functionalised work camp,' sets the tone. Meetings
between Rothacher and his Japanese counterparts must have made for
entertaining eavesdropping.
The country, he claims, is run by around two thousand men (there are few
women) spread across politics, the civil service and big business. Alas,
however, the political upheavals of the summer have undermined that central
proposition by largely removing from the troika the part on which Rothacher
dwells most: the Liberal Democratic Party.
Rothacher suggests that there has been a close community of interest between
the three groups that makes their exercise of power 'self-serving and
frequently corrupt', and he examines the nature of the relationship between
the three. Its real strength, though, is the detailed descriptions of the
power blocs themselves.
First, the typical, ambitious LDP politician. In Japanese multi-member
constituencies, electors have only one vote, giving scope for intense
intra-party competition. To succeed in this rat-race, Diet members have to
spend vast sums of money building up their support - donating to
constituents' shrine openings, winning baseball teams, weddings, schools
etc. There is only one source of that kind of money - big business. Thus the
relationship develops.
Since entry into politics is so expensive and exclusive, it tends to be a
family affair. In 1990 41 per cent of the LDP's MPs were second-generation
politicians. The political elite is literally self-perpetuating. Civil
servants, because of the power of the great ministries like MITI and the
Ministry of Finance, are full members of the elite. Though their profession
is less nepotistic and more egalitarian in recruitment, its integration into
the power triangle is assured, not just by its administrative clout and
proximity to 40 years of LDP governments, but by the process of amakudari -
'descending from heaven', the practice whereby senior civil servants retire
early to take up lucrative positions in business.
With big business providing the funding for politicians to ensure their
re-election, and then taking delivery of super-annuated civil servants, the
triangle of power is complete.
But is the existence of this elite the product of purely Japanese cultural
or social circumstances, or are its roots principally political? Few systems
could resist the encroachment of corruption after 40 years of single party
rule. The swing of the pendulum in parliamentary democracies is the surest
way of keeping the politically powerful members of society - politicians,
administrators, and big business - honest.
Whatever the political and ethical shortcomings of Japan's close-knit
political and business systems, it has long been axiomatic that the intimacy
of the relationship between government and business has been instrumental in
Japan's post-war economic success. James Vestal's Planning for Change
challenges that conventional wisdom.
In an extensive analysis of the role of industrial policy in economic
development, Vestal argues that the performance of policy has been patchy.
While MITI and other government agencies played a key role in the
reconstruction of the Japanese economy in the 1950s, their record in the
1960s and 1970s was less impressive.
In the early days of MITI, government pursued a largely successful
interventionist policy based on identifying and supporting key growth
industries with enormous investment programmes, protecting them from foreign
competition, but crucially, encouraging domestic competition.
But in the 1960s MITI began to go wrong - abandoning its promotion of
domestic competition and encouraging cartelisation. That damaged industrial
performance by creating oligopolistic practices and leading ultimately to
high inflation. In the 1970s, the economic policy consensus broke down and
MITI's power waned. Today it occupies a relatively minor role in industrial
policy.
Vestal claims that MITI's success in the 1950s provides lessons for
developing countries - that it can be efficient to protect and develop
certain industries through government agencies - but he rejects the argument
that the west has anything to learn from Japan now.
There is a brief analysis of Japan's recent economic woes. The country's
principal problem is now unbalanced growth, a surplus of domestic savings
over domestic investment that gives rise to a chronic current account
surplus. Industrial policy is powerless to deal with this, as indeed is
macro-economic policy.
The underlying cause is a lack of pluralism. In Japanese society the company
is paramount. Workers put their own interests beneath those of business,
with the result that wage settlements are too low. Only a radical change in
the way Japanese see themselves in relation to their employers will resolve
this problem.
Unlike some observers of the country's economic problems, Vestal stops short
of writing off Japan. I am sure he is right. The political earthquake of
1993 may result in a radical perestroika of the Japanese economy and
society, with unforeseeable consequences.
But the country is more likely to emerge strengthened from the trauma. After
all, those who have already delivered the obsequies on Japan's might are
often the same seers who have dubbed the next century the Asian century.
Japan is unlikely to miss out on the fun.

THE KOREAN ECONOMIES: A COMPARISON OF NORTH AND SOUTH
by Eui-Gak Hwang
Clarendon Press, Pounds 40 380 pages
It is novel for a book about development economics to open with a dedication
to 'the Lord Jesus Christ . . . foremost supporter, moral economist and
political adviser in my life', but that is how Eui-Gak Hwang introduces his
study of North and South Korea.
Hwang, professor of economics at the Korea University in Seoul, goes on to
top each chapter with either a Biblical text or a piece of oriental poetry.
The reader thus starts to speculate exactly which Biblical extract will come
up next, for example to set the tone for a chapter on Public Finance in
North and South Korea; the answer, appropriately enough, is Isaiah's
prophetic roaring that claims must be supported by evidence. In the
conclusion, Biblical reference also comes in handy to duck a judgment on the
likely pace of Korea's surely inevitable reunification process. Here, the
author cites Proverbs: 'In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord
determines his steps.'
Most of this unusual book is devoted to a painstaking assembly of parallel
data about the two Koreas. Hwang goes to great lengths to try to render
comparisons between the two meaningful, which is no easy task given the
secretive nature of the North Korean authorities and the problem of
interpreting that data which does exist, especially with regard to exchange
rates.
His underlying purpose, however, appears to be to do his bit for the
reunification debate, by adding to our understanding of the historical
relationship between the economies of north and south and their potential
complementarity in the future. Hwang has worked in Germany and thought about
the problems of bringing together the unruly offspring of communism and
post-colonial capitalism.
The historical picture presented does not conform to the western caricature
whereby after a period of domination by Japan, the second world war bestowed
upon South Korea American patronage, market capitalism and prosperity, while
the north chose autarkic Marxist-Leninism, leading to economic collapse and
poverty.
Prior to the division of the country in 1945, Korea south of the 38th
parallel was the poorer, more agricultural part of the peninsula. The north
had the minerals and most of the heavy industry.
During the 1960s and early 1970s, Hwang supports the view that the communist
northern economy grew more rapidly than the south's, where a combination of
political confusion and natural disadvantage impeded progress. Although it
is clear that the south recovered from these setbacks and became in the
1980s one of the outstanding economic performers in the world, it was not
until at least the mid-1970s and possibly not until the 1980s that the south
actually overtook the north in terms of per capita GNP.
During the 1980s, in spite of a Deng Xiao-Ping inspired 'opening up',
economic data from the north became ever scarcer, contributing to the
impression that successive plans were failing to hit their loudly proclaimed
targets. But even in the 1980s, when Hwang argues the central planning
system failed to deal with the growing complexities of the northern economy,
his figures suggest annual growth in the north never fell below 1.7 per cent
in local currency terms, exceeding 12 per cent in 1982 and 1983. In the
1980s, however, the south streaked ahead; by 1989 the south's dollar gnp per
capita was double that of the north. By some measures, it is now four or
five times that of its neighbour.
Even this, Hwang implies, should not be taken crudely as a triumph of one
system over the other. Although he acknowledges the inestimable value of
greater personal freedom in the south and the more widespread availability
of consumer choice, he notes disapprovingly the wider gap between rich and
poor in South Korea and adds that 'other indicators, such as life
expectancy, mortality, literacy, and other physical quality-of-life indexes,
merely serve to indicate that there exists no significant difference between
the north and the south.' Not for this author much regard for the regular
current rumours of food riots and impending political collapse.
Hwang thus implies that North Korea's future might be better foreseen in
comparison with that of China or even with other politically authoritarian,
free traders in the region, than with post-glasnost Russia or Albania. The
north may have a totalitarian system, dominated for half a century by the
unpredictable Kim Il Sung, but it has dabbled with capitalism, through joint
ventures, especially with Japan. North Korea, the author says, has an
economy which is 'on a road to quasi-market principles at least.'
Some will think this altogether too optimistic and even Hwang says that the
cultural re-harmonisation of the two Koreas will present serious
difficulties, especially given the rapid widening of the economic gap in
recent years. Given North Korea's recent high-risk manoeuvres on its nuclear
weapons programme, the politics as well as the economics appear to point to
measured rather than sudden progress in the drama of re-unification.

COUNTRY COMPETITIVENESS: TECHNOLOGY AND THE ORGANISING OF WORK

Oxford University Press Pounds 30 270 pages
THE BRITISH RENAISSANCE
By Jeffrey Ferry
Heinemann Pounds 17.50 318 pages
Towards the end of the last century US companies such as Singer, the sewing
machine manufacturer, were perfecting the techniques of standardisation and
mass production which were the basis for their success in world markets.
American bicycles, among other products, were exported in large numbers to
Europe. In this case, British entrepreneurs were quick learners. By
importing American machine tools, lowering costs and improving quality, they
overtook the US and established an export lead which lasted for much of this
century, until they, in turn, were overtaken by Taiwan and other Far East
producers.
Bicycles were an exception. In other industries American methods were slow
to take root in Britain. In cars, the craft traditions of British skilled
workers limited the ability of employers to organise the shop floor on the
principles laid down by Frederick Taylor and later refined by Henry Ford.
Despite the presence before the first world war of American-owned factories
like Singer's in Glasgow and Ford's in Manchester, their example was not
widely followed. In the inter-war period, only a few British enterprises
imitated the multi-divisional structure pioneered by Du Pont and General
Motors as a means of administering large, diversified corporations.
After 1945 the productivity lag was clearly recognised. Britain, like the
rest of Europe, attempted to close the gap by encouraging American inward
investment, learning from American management consultants and creating
American-type business schools. US management methods in such fields as
budgetary control spread more widely.
But in the 1970s a new way of organising production, originating in Japan,
began to displace the US model: mass production was superseded by quality
production. Japanese 'transplants', like the Nissan factory at Sunderland,
were the new role models. Managers in Europe and North America became avid
students of Japanese practices.
US manufacturers found adjustment difficult. In the car industry the rigid
definition of tasks in American plants, the elimination of worker
discretion, the role of unions in maintaining tight job specifications - all
this was ill-suited to the new era of flexible specialisation.
Between the 1950s and the 1980s the famous Toyota Production System,
involving relationships of trust and reciprocal learning between vehicle
assembler and component supplier, was gradually developed.
A new 'organisation culture' emerged in response to the particular
circumstances which the Japanese motor industry faced during those years.
Transferring such a culture to the very different market and institutional
environment of the US could only take place after a long period of
experimentation.
The institutional obstacles to the diffusion of 'best practice' from one
country to another form the central theme in Country Competitiveness, a
collection of academic papers edited by Bruce Kogut. The book makes a
valuable contribution to the debate about shifting competitive advantage
between nations and about what governments and companies can do about it.
Most of the papers have the great merit of being based on detailed research
at company level in Europe, the US and Japan.
The book shows how history has influenced each country's industrial
strengths and weaknesses. For example, education and technology policy in
Japan has long given priority to engineering; Japan has provided a less
favourable environment than the US for scientific research and this is one
of the reasons for the relative weakness of its science-based industries
such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
In their chapter on machine tools Arndt Sorge and Marc Maurice show how
institutional differences between France and Germany affected their response
to the external shocks of the 1970s and 1980s - the introduction of computer
numerical control (CNC) and the rise of the Japanese. They stress that two
industries are embedded in their respective economic and social settings.
The German industry has close relationships with technical universities,
especially at Aachen, Berlin and Stuttgart, where the production,
engineering and machine tool departments enjoy a high standing. The French
industry is not backed by an academic establishment as large or as highly
regarded as in Germany, and cross-fertilisation between the two is much less
in evidence.
No less important is the issue of skills. The Germans were able to graft CNC
expertise into existing education and training profiles, starting from craft
worker apprenticeships. Whereas the French work force was segmented between
shop floor operators and more highly skilled specialists, there was a
greater 'professional continuity' in Germany between worker, technician and
engineering graduate.
This institutional background is also highlighted in Gary Herrigel's study
of small and medium-sized enterprises in Baden Wurttemberg. These companies
have been extraordinarily successful in traditional areas of manufacturing
such as machinery, vehicle components and textiles. 'They produce an almost
infinite array of special industrial products in virtually infinite
variety'.
Their ability to combine specialisation with flexibility, Herrigel argues,
is 'based on a system that socialises risks across a broad array of public
and private organisations', including educational institutions, trade
associations and chambers of commerce, banks and the regional government.
Institutional advantages are not, of course, valid for all time. It is
possible that the world machine tool industry, increasingly driven by the
Japanese, is evolving in a way which makes the decentralized Baden
Wurttmberg model less appropriate. The economies of scale which the leading
Japanese companies enjoy seem to be forcing the German producers to give up
their tradition of independence and band together in larger groups. Whether
the German model can be adapted to the industry's changed circumstances is
not yet clear.
A much more obvious case of institutional inertia is Britain. In a paper on
the car industry Ulrich Jurgens describes how different countries and
companies have handled the shift from Fordism to specialisation. To meet
Japanese competition, new approaches to work organisation were needed, with
the emphasis on more flexible and more highly skilled workers and on
delegation of tasks to autonomous teams.
Despite the weakening of British trade unions through legislation and high
unemployment, multinational companies with plants in the UK, Germany and the
US found their British plants the most resistant to the new concepts. It
proved impossible to initiate a process of institutional change that would
be jointly supported by unions and management. Britain, says Jurgens, was
'not particularly fertile soil for developing independent non-Taylorist
forms for regulating labour in the l980s'.
This reminder of the malign legacy of Britain's industrial relations history
is a useful offset to the euphoric picture presented in Jeffrey Ferry's The
British Renaissance. This is a story of how international competition
'blasted away the old world' in Britain, removing the dead wood and allowing
new companies to surge forward. 'Thrilled at their liberation, they seized
on the newest, freshest, youngest, most exciting new ideas in strategy and
management and went to work'.
The book consists of racy descriptions, based on interviews at several
levels of the workforce, of six British companies. Four are 'turnarounds' -
Oxford Automotive Components (OAC), which is owned by Unipart, Guinness, TI
Group (formerly Tube Investments) and ICL - which 'have literally changed
from companies with their great days behind them to companies with their
greatest days yet to come'. The other two - Virgin Group and Control
Techniques - were entrepreneurial start-ups which have become 'world-leading
innovators' in their businesses, airlines and electronic drives.
The blurb makes extravagant claims for the book - 'destined to become for
British managers what In Search of Excellence was to Americans.' It is
neither an instructional book from which clear management lessons can be
drawn, nor a serious analysis of how competitive problems were overcome. It
does, however, have other strengths. Although Ferry devotes some attention
to the leaders of the companies like Peter Bonfield at ICL, John Neill at
Unipart and Trevor Wheatley at Control Techniques, pride of place is given
to managers and workers closer to the 'sharp end' of industrial change.
Thus the transformation of OAC, once a notoriously inefficient part of
British Leyland, is seen through the eyes of the plant manager, Roger Ball,
whose first experience of Japanese methods came when he ran the BSA-Triumph
motor cycle factory in the 1970s. Determined to learn from the collapse of
the motor cycle industry, he studied Japanese methods and became a
specialist in applying just-in-time techniques to old factories. Part of his
programme at OAC was to send a group of shop floor workers to Japan to see
how quality and volume production could be combined.
Do such examples support the claim that a British renaissance is taking
place?
There is not much doubt that there have been important industrial changes in
the past 15 years and that some of the institutional obstacles which impeded
competitiveness in the early post-war period and before have been removed.
But if, as the contributors to Kogut's book argue, competitiveness
increasingly depends on how work is organised and on the education and
skills of the workers, further institutional reform is certainly needed.
Hugh Whittaker's chapter on British and Japanese factories reaches the
conclusion that 'British managers have some way to go in tapping and
building the innovative potential of those nearest the work process. To this
end, more fundamental reforms in employment relations are probably
necessary'.
Historical patterns of organisation, based on long-established social and
institutional arrangements, are slow to change. But if a convergence on best
practice is taking place, Britain is much better equipped to participate in
it than was the case 20 years ago.

FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another torrid session in the crude oil market, which saw Brent crude slip
below the Dollars 14 a barrel mark at one point, triggered yet another bout
of heavy selling pressure in an already bruised oil sector.
Oil shares were the market's weakest performers last week after Opec
surprised the market by holding its overall production level at 24.5m
barrels a day. There had been hopes that Opec would cut output by around 2m
barrels a day to try to stem the weakness in oil prices. And there were
fears in international oil markets yesterday that Iraq may be permitted to
resume oil sales in the middle of 1994, putting further pressure on Opec
output quotas and prices.
Yesterday, it was the oil majors rather than the exploration stocks that
were roughly handled by the market, with US holders said to have continued
to sell stocks such as BP and Shell aggressively amid talk of downgraded oil
price and earnings forecasts.
Shell dropped 12 1/2 to 665 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 6.5m, with the market
additionally upset by reports that Gencor's purchase of Billiton, Shell's
minerals and mining subsidiary, may have run into trouble. BP, which bore
the brunt of some big downside pressure from the US late in the session,
lost 7 more to 325 1/2 p in a large turnover of 13m.
The exploration and production sub-sector outperformed the senior oil index,
but nevertheless looked set to come under renewed fire. Lasmo, beset by
worries about the dividend, eased further to 116p on 5.4m volume. Enterprise
dipped 4 to 433p on 2.3m traded and Hardy fell 13 1/2 to 143 1/2 p.
GEC, the flagship of the UK's electronics and heavy electrical industry, was
one of the worst performers among the Footsie constituents as the market
became increasingly nervous ahead of the group's interim figures tomorrow.
Some fairly aggressive selling pressure saw the shares close 4 off at 333p
on turnover of 8.1m, the fifth most heavily traded stock in the market. One
close follower of the company described it as 'almost a utility but without
the yield and dividend cover of most', and said the market had been slightly
spooked by worries about difficult trading conditions which could provoke a
series of profits downgrades of full year estimates.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo saw its shares rise 16 to 671p ahead of a key
presentation on research and development this morning. There was also active
business in traded options.
Glaxo last held an R&amp;D presentation two years ago. Since then the group has
launched three products, and now that they are in the market,
pharmaceuticals experts will be looking for new developments to combat
erosion of market share in Zantac, the anti-ulcer product which accounts for
around 44 per cent of Glaxo's turnover.
A return of speculation over the future of the stake held by Rank
Organisation in Rank Xerox underpinned a rise in the shares in a firm
leisure sector. Rumours of the sale by Rank to its venture partner Xerox
have been in the market for some months, but were given fresh impetus at the
weekend in an interview with the Rank chief executive.
The sale of the Xerox stake could raise up to Pounds 1.5bn and effectively
wipe out Rank's debts. However, while leisure specialists accept that the
issue is on the agenda, most believe it is still some years off. Rank shares
were up 7 at 883p, after touching 897p.
Troubled theme park group Euro Disney rallied 10 to 360p on speculative
buying. Stories swirling around the stock continue to suggest some imminent
moves by the bank creditors to take a more forceful role in the company's
financial restructuring.
Optimism over the likely effect of today's Budget on consumer spending
impacted favourably across consumer-related stocks. In the drinks sector,
shares were marked higher on additional hopes that the chancellor would not
come down too heavily on excise duty. Among the main beneficiaries, Scottish
&amp; Newcastle added 10 at 492p, Bass - reporting results tomorrow - 14 at
493p, Grand Metropolitan - with figures due Thursday - 19 at 409p and
Greenalls Group 10 at 381p. Merrydown was a notable omission, slipping 8 to
210p on disappointment at the group's dividend.
Stores were buoyant. Boots rose 10 to 544p, Dixons 7 to 265p, WH Smith 'A'
20 to 485p, helped by a BZW buy note, Next 11 to 199p and Kingfisher 12 to
679p.
Bank shares made rapid progress, as did life and composite insurers as
financial sector specialists remained convinced there will be no big changes
affecting life policies and pensions in the Budget. Barclays, up 13 at 569p,
led the banks higher, while Prudential jumped 7 1/2 to 357 1/2 p,
spearheading the life sector.
Westland Group advanced 9 to 235p as vague takeover talk pointed to GKN. The
latter's shares put on 7 at 491p.
AAF Industries jumped 11 to 49p after announcing an Pounds 18.4m deal. BBA
Group retreated 11 to 178p on reports of a downgrading from Cazenove.

FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton bid lifts TV stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television took centre stage in the market as Carlton Communications
launched a well-received takeover bid for Central Television. The offer came
just five days after the government relaxed rules on mergers within the
industry and is seen as the first course in a feast of bids within the
sector.
The bid values Central at Pounds 758m, or Pounds 26 a share, and was to the
surprise of many analysts endorsed by Central's board of directors. It will
create the country's biggest independent television company with an area
covering 20m viewers.
Predictably, Central's shares rose sharply, closing some 405 higher at
2573p.
Less predictably, Carlton's share price also jumped significantly, finishing
30 stronger at 797p. The stock was helped by an increase in profits to
Pounds 126.1m from Pounds 100.24m and a discussion aimed at defusing worries
over inroads into Carlton's video sales and rental arm. However, the results
were in line with expectations and the shares only started to lift when the
Central offer was announced.
Ms Chris Munro, media analyst with Hoare Govett, estimated that Carlton's
1993-94 profits would be boosted by Pounds 31m to Pounds 186m following
acquisition of Central and earnings would only be diluted by 0.5p per share
to 50p.
Investors are now looking for the next bid in the sector, and many bets were
riding on Granada making a move on LWT Holdings, possibly as early as today.
Granada climbed 13 to 463p in spite of worries that it will have to launch a
bumper rights issue to fund any bid. LWT shares jumped 45 to 579p.

FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enthusiasm within the futures market caught the underlying stock market by
surprise yesterday and was largely responsible for forcing stock prices
higher ahead of today's budget, writes Peter John.
The cash market showed no desire, on the first day of the new trading
account, to move forward from Friday's close. But the FT-SE futures contract
expiring in December jumped 10 points at the start of trading and surged
forward to a high of 3,167 to set the agenda in London markets.
Marketmakers said the contract was 'very squeezy' as there was still quite a
big shortage of stock following the surprise turnaround prompted by last
week's base rate cut.
At its best the December contract was 23 points above cash, a startling
premium considering that the estimated fair value - the premium that takes
into account the cost of carrying less dividend payments - is actually at a
small discount to cash for this account.
By the official close at 4.10pm the December contract was slightly easier at
3,157 but still at a premium of 22 to cash with dealers anticipating good
news from the Budget, particularly on advance corporation tax.
Any decision not to cut back ACT would be of particular benefit to
investment institutions such as insurance groups.
Among stock options Prudential was the most heavily traded with turnover
3,663 lots although traders said the volume mainly reflected bitty technical
trading. Glaxo, which is hosting a key R&amp;D presentation today, was the
second big stock option with 1,748 contracts transacted.

FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong opening to new equity trading
account - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another strong session in financial, consumer and industrial growth stocks
in the UK market yesterday, matched by weakness in the defensive high
yielders, signalled the City's conviction that this afternoon's Budget
speech will be favourable for equity investors. The first day of the new
equity trading account closed last night with the market showing a gain of
about 2.2 per cent since the middle of last week, when investors shed fears
of adverse tax changes and turned to a positive view of the likely Budget
proposals.
Attention focused entirely on the domestic scene, with the stock index
future again providing a lead for equities. After opening lower in the
shadow of the heavy fall in Tokyo, UK shares moved ahead steadily and gains
were trimmed only slightly when Wall Street, in its first full return from
the Thanksgiving break, managed a meagre gain of only 7 Dow points in UK
trading hours.
The FT-SE Index closed 24.4 ahead at 3,135.8, having touched 3,144.1
earlier. A good level of institutional interest was seen, with overseas
buyers looking confidently for further cuts in UK and European interest
rates soon. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, often the focus of private investor
activity, gained 11.1 to 3,466.
There were gains among life assurance stocks as fears of tax threats to
pension fund values eased, in merchant banks, which benefit from a strong
equity market, and in brewers, hotels and stores, all hoping for a benign
Budget.
But water and electricity stocks suffered as their solid dividend prospects
appeared less exciting in a stock market now looking for a Budget focused on
promoting economic growth. A fresh round of losses in oil stocks as crude
prices continued to weaken was balanced by perceptions that cheaper oil
would subdue inflation and encourage industrial economies.
Trading volume remained high, with 687.8m shares passing through the Seaq
network compared with 697.6m on Friday. Friday's retail business was worth
Pounds 1.53bn, at the high end of this year's daily averages. Last week
brought a total of nearly Pounds 7bn in retail business, in spite of the
brief absences of Wall Street and Tokyo for holiday breaks.
The excitement of the day came in the domestic television sector with the
first of the bid moves so widely-predicted since official takeover
restrictions were eased last week. Carlton Communications made an agreed bid
worth Pounds 758m for Central TV, setting the sector alive with activity.
In addition to the relaxation of fears of adverse changes in company
taxation, the stock market was also confirming its belief that UK base rates
will be reduced again in the near future, even if not today. Several
strategists have predicted that domestic rates will be cut from the present
5.5 per cent minimum to 4 per cent, or even lower. Interest rate optimism is
also fuelled from other European financial centres where a rate cut from the
Bundesbank is anticipated.
While there has been a distinct shift in sentiment over the past trading
week, there were still signs that share prices were being driven ahead by
the unwillingness of marketmaking firms to hold heavy stock positions over
the Budget period. Equity traders are expected to take their cue from the
stock index futures traders this morning.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities turn lower in line
with bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Falling crude oil prices and news of strong home sales set the stage for an
upbeat opening to trading on US stock markets yesterday, but profit-taking
and an afternoon retreat in bond prices left equities easier on balance at
the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 6.15 down at 3,677.80. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.16 at 461.90, while the Nasdaq
composite shed 3.33 to 751.54. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled
272.7m shares.
Conditions were set for a firm start to trading yesterday when bond prices
posted early gains. The bond market has rallied strongly over the past three
days, primarily because a sharp fall in oil prices (which was triggered by
the failure of Opec to agree on production cuts) and declines in the value
of other key commodities have helped to ease fixed-income investors'
inflation fears.
The rise in bond prices, meanwhile, has lowered long-term interest rates,
which has helped to allay concern that credit conditions in the US were
tightening. But bonds fell from early highs yesterday, prompting some late
profit-taking among equity investors.
There was, however, some good news for stock market investors on the
economy. Sales of existing homes rose by a larger than expected 3.6 per cent
in October, the latest in a long line of statistics that suggest the pace of
economic growth is quickening.
Although oil companies were again the target of selling because of the drop
in crude oil prices, the sector rebounded from its lows in the afternoon.
Texaco lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 63 3/8 , Chevron Dollars  1/8 at Dollars
85 5/8 , Phillips Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 28 3/8 , Mobil Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 75 and British Petroleum Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 58.
A positive article about Procter &amp; Gamble in the weekly business newspaper
Barron's spurred the stock forward to leave a gain of Dollars 1 7/8 at
Dollars 57 1/2 .
Selected retailers were firmer in the expectation of strong Christmas sales.
Gap Stores added Dollars 2 at Dollars 40 5/8 and JC Penney Dollars 1 at
Dollars 54, but Sears Roebuck, after posting an early gain, staged a sharp
reversal to finish Dollars 2 1/4 down at Dollars 53 3/4 .
JP Morgan appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 and Bankers Trust
firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 76 after the stock of the two banking groups
was upgraded by broking house PaineWebber.
Computer issues, after putting in a strong performance last week, ran into
profit-taking. Motorola shed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 93 1/2 , Texas
Instruments Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 62 and IBM Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54
3/8 .
Canada
Dropping gold and energy shares and confirmation of a gloomy economic
outlook from Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, pummelled the Toronto
stock market to a sharply lower close.
An analyst said it was not a good market even before Mr Martin took the
podium and announced his bleak deficit and growth forecasts.
The TSE 300 index tumbled 50.3 to 4,170.3 and declines trounced advances by
560 to 242 after volume of 53.5m shares valued at CDollars 615.8m.
Among the sub-groups, the energy index fell 2.94 per cent, conglomerates
2.68 per cent, golds 2.59 per cent and industrial products 2.21 per cent.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei's fall of 3.9%
weakens the region's markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei average fell 3.9 per cent, particularly on selling of bank
stocks, and the index closed at a year's low of 16,078.71, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
After opening at the day's high of 16,688.57, the Nikkei declined on a
plunge in futures and heavy arbitrage selling. The index crashed below the
16,000 level to 15,671.97 in the early afternoon, but later recovered some
of its loss on short-covering and bargain hunting.
The Topix index of all first section stocks dropped 74.06, or 5.2 per cent,
to 1,350.48, breaching the 1,400 level for the first time since March 24,
but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was only 0.33 off at 1,091.26.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, ruled out any possibility of
emergency measures to help share prices, while Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the
finance minister, said that although he was watching the stock market
carefully, no government support was being considered.
Traders said there were no firm technical support levels now that 17,000 on
the Nikkei and 1,430 on the Topix had been broken.
Volume was 370m shares, against 339m. Declines overwhelmed rises by 1,025 to
45, with 43 issues unchanged.
Mounting fears about the country's financial system hit bank shares. Some
banks remained offered only during the morning session. The fall prompted
unwinding of positions in the Topix index, which is heavily weighted in bank
shares. The Nikkei banking index lost 7.9 per cent from last Friday, with
Industrial Bank of Japan down Y330 to Y2,660 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y250
weaker at Y1,770.
Trust banks lost ground, with Mitsubishi Trust and Banking shedding Y130 to
Y1,050 and Yasuda Trust and Banking Y65 to Y675.
Other financial stocks were also weak, with Orix down Y230 to Y3,130 and
Nippon Housing Loan off Y5 at Y220. Nomura Securities dipped Y110 to Y1,660
and Nikko Securities Y80 to Y960.
East Japan Railway tumbled Y24,000 to a new low of Y400,000. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone fell Y49,000 to Y636,000.
Department stores were among the few gainers of the day, with Isetan
advancing Y80 to Y1,830.
In Osaka, the OSE average dropped 805.22 to 17,871.16 in volume of 22.7m
shares.
Roundup
The region, with the exception of Taiwan, fell in line with losses in Tokyo
and Hong Kong. Bombay was closed.
HONG KONG finished sharply lower following the collapse of the latest round
of Sino-British talks, but late bargain hunting brought the key index off
its low to end above the 9,000 level.
The Hang Seng index lost a net 261.65, or 2.8 per cent, at 9,012.77.
Turnover amounted to HKDollars 5.6bn.
The index had dropped to 8,870.59 early in the day on fears of a complete
breakdown of talks on Hong Kong's political reform plans.
HSBC was the most active issue, falling HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 84.50.
Cheung Kong and Hutchison retreated HKDollars 1.25 apiece to HKDollars 35
and HKDollars 31 respectively, while Jardine Matheson lost HKDollars 3 at
HKDollars 65.
TAIWAN soared 5.3 per cent in heavy turnover in response to the ruling
Nationalist party's victory in Saturday's local government elections.
The weighted index ended 220.52 up at 4,384.51, its highest close since
early June. Turnover came to TDollars 46.6bn.
The electronics sector led gains, with Acer and United Microelectronics
ending the day's limit up.
SEOUL declined marginally for its fourth consecutive session, with the
composite index losing 0.97 at 804.54 in turnover of Won618.8bn.
Some investors showed renewed interest in steel, vehicles and electric and
electronics shares on the back of expectations of a better than expected
economic recovery.
MANILA fell in reaction to events elsewhere. The composite index slipped
42.95 to 2,332.29 in turnover of 1.1bn pesos.
SINGAPORE resisted sharp falls seen elsewhere, with the Straits Times
Industrial index closing off 9.06 at 2,098.92. Volume was a thin 196.7m
shares.
AUSTRALIA weakened in line with the region, the All Ordinaries index
dropping 32.8, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,010.3. Turnover was ADollars 364.7m.
BHP ended 36 cents cheaper at ADollars 16.50 and News Corp was 34 cents, or
nearly 3.5 per cent, down at ADollars 9.68.
Among other leading stocks, CSR dipped 6 cents to ADollars 4.63, Amcor 10
cents to ADollars 9.35, Coles Myer 2 cents to ADollars 5.07 and Boral 5
cents to ADollars 4.02.
CRA receded 14 cents to ADollars 16.82, MIM shed 10 cents to ADollars 2.26,
Western Mining lost 8 cents to ADollars 5.98 and North Broken Hill eased a
cent to ADollars 3.42.
BANGKOK lost ground in thin trading but closed off the day's lows.
The SET index relinquished 14.06, or 1 per cent, to 1,295.51 in turnover of
Bt7.6bn.
Prasit Development, which made its debut yesterday, captured 20 per cent of
turnover and closed at Bt129, compared with the offer price of Bt70.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses find few incentives in
thin day's trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bourses in continental Europe showed little impetus yesterday, with
thin trading seen in most centres, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT moved in a narrow range throughout the session, before closing
just 3.81 points lower in the DAX index at 2,043.43.
Opinion suggests that the Bundesbank will make no move to cut interest rates
at this Thursday's regular meeting, therefore giving little incentive to the
market.
Thyssen, the steel group, which is expected to release figures this week
lost DM1.50 to DM232.50 in anticipation.
Varta shed more than 6 per cent on news that the battery manufacturer was to
cut its dividend. The shares lost DM20.70 to DM315.00.
PARIS weakened very slightly with the CAC-40 index losing 1.32 to 2,119.30,
having moved in a range between 2,125 and 2,105.
Oil stocks came under pressure after it was reported that one US broker was
placing the European oil sector under review: Elf Aquitaine lost FFr8.10 to
FFr416.70 and Total FFr11.00 to FFr303.20.
LVMH went against the trend, rising FFr21 top FFr3,751 on news that it was
extending its interests in the publishing sector.
MILAN edged higher in thin volume, the Comit index adding 2.37 to 543.89.
Ferruzzi Finanziaria, however put in a strong showing, gaining L1,374 or 4.6
per cent to L31,253 after a weekend report that foreign creditor banks were
coming round to approval of a rescue plan for the group.
Its agro-industrial and chemicals subsidiary Montedison was up L13.30 to
L761.60 . Montedison savings shares gained L15.30 to L556.50 and Ferruzzi
savings shares added L29.60 to L476.40. Shareholders meetings scheduled for
later this week have the rescue plan on their agendas.
Among heavily traded blue chips Fiat was down L19 to L3,842, while Sip
overcame an early deficit to finish L21 higher at L3,096 and Stet rose L22
to L3,578.
ZURICH continued its consolidation although the strength of the Swiss franc,
on the back of last week's good inflation figures, continued to support
expectations of lower interest rates. The SMI index eased 3.7 to 2,738.2.
Ciba, topping the actives list, saw the registered share rise SFr15 to
SFr784 on buying by a small bank. Foreign selling left Nestle SFr13 lower at
SFr1,169.
CS Holding bearers added SFr10 to SFr3,550 and Elektrowatt rose SFr10 to
SFr3,600 , still benefiting from last week's rumours that CS Holding may
sell its 47 per cent Elektrowatt stake.
Ems-Chemie bearers shed SFr20 to SFr3,980: Pharma Vision, SFr50 higher at
SFr3,980, said on Friday it had sold its entire holding.
AMSTERDAM found little excitement and the CBS Tendency index slipped just
0.7 to 136.1. Royal Dutch remained in investors' minds, falling back Fl 2.50
to Fl 191.20, while KLM went in the opposite direction, up Fl 1.70 to Fl
41.60 helped by the prospect of lower costs for fuel.
STOCKHOLM saw further weakness in Volvo B shares, down SKr16 at SKr391, as
investors began to accept that the merger with Renault of France would go
ahead. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 20.80 to 1,291.80.
Ericsson B's fell a further SKr5 to SKr338.
OSLO was unsettled by weakness in the oil price as the All share index lost
11.25 or 1.9 per cent to 567.6. Turnover was NKr296m.
Norsk Hydro lost NKr2.50 to NKr210 and Saga Petroleum NKr3.5 to NKr72.5.
BRUSSELS edged lower in quiet trade which was disrupted for the last
half-hour due to technical problems with electronic trading system. The
Bel-20 index fell 4.88 to 1,387.29 although sentiment was said to be still
fairly positive because of optimism there would be interest rate cuts soon.
MADRID was weighed down by losses in the banking sector, weakness in futures
and profit taking among electrical stocks. The General index shed 2.37 to
295.54. Bank Santander shed Pta190 or 2.9 per cent to Pta6,220 and Banco
Central Hispano shed Pta85 to Pta3,220.
ISTANBUL broke another record following the government's reaffirmation of
its privatisation programme. The composite index added 1,000.00 or nearly 6
per cent to 18,426.1.
ATHENS gained ground on optimistic expectations over today's budget. The
general index rose 2.4 per cent to 862.13 in turnover estimated at DKr3.7bn.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Scandinavia suffers sharp reverses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets were under pressure last week, with Japan, jittery over the
corporate outlook, leading much of the pack lower. This was reflected in a
2.26 per cent fall in the FT-Actuaries World index.
Most of Europe was on a downward track, with the sharpest falls seen in
Scandinavian markets.
UBS comments that the steep fall in Ericsson's share price serves as a
salutary lesson to all investing in Scandinavia. Foreign holdings have risen
sharply in recent months, with foreign investors pumping more than SKr3bn a
month into Sweden. 'Domestic funds are not able to replace that sort of cash
flow. So when foreign investors turn away from a market, stocks can fall
sharply,' says UBS. 'There is, therefore, a real danger to Scandinavian
markets if US bond yields rise in the near term, before earnings justify
current recovery hopes.'
Norway was a casualty of the collapse in oil prices as Opec failed to agree
on a reduction in production quotas, although the move is seen as a silver
lining for the country's oil shipping sector.
Oslo was also dragged lower on Friday by a 7.1 per cent drop in
Hafslund-Nycomed 'A' as the pharmaceutical group forecast that current year
profits would be held to 1992 levels.
Stockholm remained affected by weakness in Ericsson, in continued response
to the previous week's third-quarter results, a reaction that Barclays de
Zoete Wedd feels was exaggerated.
BZW contends that there had been encouraging stability in earnings estimates
in recent months, while continued undervaluation of the krona within Europe,
as well as further dollar strength in 1994, were a recipe for further
positive earnings recovery surprises in 1994-95.
Volvo also had a volatile week, with many participants marking the shares
lower ahead of a decision on the Renault merger at next Tuesday's egm. But
in spite of the reservations of many investors to the link-up, analysts
believe the decision of the 4th AP fund, the second largest shareholder, to
vote in favour is likely to carry the day. Kleinwort Benson comments that
the company presented probably the best set of third-quarter figures in the
Swedish market, highlighting the scale of operating earnings recovery.
However, it warns that the attraction of the shares as a dollar-exposed
turnround story would be minimised if the Renault merger is ratified.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Franc nears old floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc moved within reach of its former European exchange rate
mechanism floor yesterday, spurred on by last week's news that central bank
reserves have been largely replenished and by continued strong hopes for an
early cut in Germany's key lending rates, writes Emma Tucker.
In the morning, the French currency rose to FFr3.4484 against the D-Mark,
its highest level since August 2 when the ERM bands were loosened, and just
moderately lower than its previous floor of FFr3.4305. Many analysts expect
the franc to breach this level by the year-end.
Not even the prospect of a cut in French interest rates - widely expected in
the market - was enough to upset the currency. Analysts said this was
because the market is increasingly attaching importance to the growth
differentials between economies, rather than interest rate differentials
between currencies. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America in
London, said: 'If anything, interest rate cuts now are perceived as being
beneficial.'
The franc, however, eased back in late trade to close in London at FFr3.457
per D-Mark, virtually unchanged from Friday's close.
Sterling was steady yesterday on the back of D-Mark weakness, but a late
surge took it through DM2.54. Weekend newspaper reports that Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor, was planning to reduce the level of public
spending next year from the previously agreed total helped to support the
currency.
It ended in London at DM2.5425, up a pfennig from Friday's close. Against
the dollar it rose  3/4 cent to Dollars 1.4880.
The UK money markets were exceptionally quiet ahead of Mr Clarke's statement
today. As one dealer put it: 'The buyers have bought, the sellers have sold,
and everyone has gone home early.'
There was little technical trading to enliven the day, after the Bank of
England announced a small shortage of Pounds 450m, revised later in the day
to Pounds 750m. The Bank provided late assistance worth Pounds 135m.
The three-month interbank rate ended the day at around 5 11/32 per cent. The
March short sterling contract, which opened at 94.84, declined by four basis
points.
The Austrian National Bank announced that it was cutting its Gomex money
market intervention rate by 10 basis points to 5.8 per cent. A spokesman
from the central bank said the move was in response to high liquidity in the
Austrian money market.
Austria last lowered its Gomex rate, which covers two-thirds of bank
refinancing, by 20 basis points earlier this month. The discount rate stays
at 5.25 per cent and the Lombard rate at 6.25 per cent.
The Austrian schilling finished virtually unaltered from Friday's close at
Sch7.042 per D-Mark.
In Germany, tight money market conditions prompted the Bundesbank to
announce it would inject liquidity via a 'schnell' or two-day repo.
The repo, designed to relieve money market shortages in the short term, was
set at 6.40 per cent, a relatively high rate given that, last week, banks
were able to borrow money at 6.25 per cent. Dealers said conditions were
made even tighter in anticipation of today's annual payment of public sector
Christmas bonuses.
With the abolition of Paragraph 17 funds from the beginning of next year,
so-called 'schnell' tenders are likely to be used more often, although the
Bundesbank will also be able to use other fine-tuning instruments such as
the 'blitz tender', which injects liquidity even faster than the schnell
tender.
Opinion was divided over what stance the Bundesbank would take at today's
regular refinancing operation. Some analysts are expecting a variable rate
repo, although with the rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent, due to money market
tightness. Others believe the central bank will stick to a fixed rate of
6.25 per cent as a variable tender could invite banks to probe for lower
rates.
Whatever happens, currency traders across Europe will keep a close eye on
the repo announcement for clues on when German interest rates will next be
lowered.
Most analysts doubt that the Bundesbank will cut German interest rates at
this week's council meeting, but are not ruling out a reduction before the
end of the year.
West German inflation data on Friday showed a year-on-year 3.7 per cent rise
in November after October's 3.9 per cent increase and helped to keep rate
cut hopes on the boil, according to analysts.
The dollar weakened in late London trading after attempting to push through
the DM1.7180 level. But the US currency stayed firmly above Y109, aided by a
sharp decline in Tokyo stock prices, which fell 3.87 per cent to their
lowest level for more than a year. The dollar is likely to trade within a
fairly tight range ahead of US jobs data on Friday. In New York the dollar
ended at DM1.7085 and Y109.22.
Comments by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, that German
inflation has slowed and that the economy was stabilising had little impact
on the dollar/D-Mark rate, according to dealers.
The Spanish peseta remained under pressure yesterday on political worries
over union threats to carry out a general strike. It closed in London at
Pta82.10 against the D-Mark, compared with Friday's finish of Pta81.75.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green cloud hangs over
Ecuadorean oil sector - Raymond Colitt reports on a wave of protest that has
potential investors worried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only months before the Ecuadorean government is to invite foreign oil
companies to bid for new exploration blocks in the country's Amazon region -
potentially worth billions of dollars - a new wave of protests by
environmentalists and indigenous groups has investors worried.
The latest in a series of actions against oil companies in the region came
earlier this month as several aboriginal communities filed a civil law suit
against the US oil company Texaco.
The Indians of various tribes in the Amazon forests are demanding of Texaco
an indemnity in addition to legal costs of at least USDollars 50,000 for
each of the affected inhabitants of the area, which could run into thousands
of people. Separately the plaintiffs are to claim clean-up costs that may,
according to some estimates, reach hundreds of millions of dollars.
Texaco is accused of negligence, recklessness and intentional damage in its
exploration and production activities. These are alleged to have increased
the risk of cancer, respiratory and gastro-intestinal illnesses and to have
caused other personal injuries and property damages.
According to Mr Cristobal Bonifaz, a lawyer for the Indians, Texaco did not
always employ technologies and practices that met industry standards. For
example, toxic substances, he said, were not disposed of properly, but were
rather 'dumped' into pits, rivers and bogs or burnt without any pollution
control. Mr Bonifaz adds that the environmental damage in Ecuador's Amazon
region far exceeds that caused by the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska three
years ago.
Texaco has not operated in the fields of the Oriente, as Ecuador's Amazonian
region is called, since 1990, when its contract with the Ecuadorean
government expired and it withdrew after 20 years as the principal operator
from a consortium with the state-owned Petroecuador.
The US petroleum company denies the allegations and argues that the case
should have been filed in Ecuador, where Petroecuador is legally
established. Yet the plaintiffs argue that the defendant is legally a
resident of New York and that all decisions regarding operations in Ecuador
were essentially taken in the US.
Meanwhile, Texaco awaits the results of an environmental audit initiated by
the Ecuadorean government itself to determine exactly what environmental
damage has been caused and what the reparation cost might be. The results of
a study conducted by a Canadian environmental consulting firm are expected
soon. Ecuador's minister of energy and mining, Mr Franciso Acosta, says that
he will not sign any new contract with Texaco - which seeks to commercialise
petrol within Ecuador - until the environmental review has been completed
and Texaco has renewed its commitment to abide by it.
The validity of the audit has been questioned by environmental groups in the
US and Ecuador because of the lack of public access to information, the
exclusion of local communities from the process and the terms of the audit,
which were set by Texaco and Petroecuador.
Laws and regulations that might substantiate specific infractions against
Texaco are scarce. Ecuador has only recently adopted environmental
regulations specific to the petroleum industry. Yet first the court for the
southern district of New York must be signed to hear the case.
That considerable environmental damage has been caused in the Oriente is
beyond question. Countless acres of rain forest have disappeared, water and
soil have been polluted by oil spills and animal habitats have been
destroyed. According to a government estimate nearly 17m gallons of oil has
leaked out of the Texaco-operated pipeline.
Preliminary results from an independent study by the US-based Institute on
Economic and Social Rights indicates that in areas in which Texaco operated
there is evidence of the presence of toxic substances like benzine and
toluol in excess of levels deemed tolerable by the US Environmental
Protection Agency.
Yet the company maintains that its emergency clean-up efforts were effective
and that oil spills, often due to natural disasters, represented only a
small percentage of the total amount transported during 18 years of
operation.
Texaco is not the only company accused of environmental improprieties. Only
days before the legal suit against Texaco, members of the Cofan tribe -
armed with spears and shotguns - forced drilling to be suspended at a
Petroecuador site.
The Cofanes demanded that the exploratory work within a national park and
close to their tribal lands be halted. Especially indignant at President
Duran Ballen's decision to allow resumption of exploratory work after having
previously suspended it because of environmental concerns, they contended
that they were not consulted about the activities as is required by law.
Confrontation is certain to continue as the Cofanes insist that Petroecuador
withdraw from their lands. Petroecuador has already had to shut down one of
its most promising sites - Tiputini Panacocha, also located in the national
park - following a decree by the government's environmental agency in
response to supposed damage.
Despite assurances to potential investors by the energy minister,
potentially interested oil companies are wary of increasing confrontation by
indigenous peoples and environmental groups that might lead to costly legal
battles and an image problem at home.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU ready to meet Russia half
way on aluminium plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has rejected a European Commission suggestion that its aluminium
exports to the European Union be restricted to 200,000 tonnes next year and
asked for the level to be set at 300,000 tonnes.
The Commission is ready to make a concession, moving the total to 240,000
tonnes, and this will be put to the Russian delegation later this week.
Meanwhile, the Commission has extended the temprorary curbs of imports from
all the Commonwealth of Independent States for another three months, mainly
because it has not been able to organise talks with other CIS republics.
It hopes to reach agreement soon with Russia, the main CIS producer, and
there is even a possibility that details will be announced on December 9
when Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, may be in Brussels to sign a
trade agreement.
Agreement in principle has been reached about the need for CIS export
restraint, including a method of double checking by the use of both export
licences in the CIS and import licences in the EU.
The commission imposed a restriction on CIS aluminium to 'safeguard' the EU
industry, saying that only 60,000 tonnes could be imported between August
and the end of this month. The curb is to be extended at the same rate, so
only another 45,000 tonnes can be imported between December 1 and the end of
February.
The commission still insisted that an EU/CIS arrangement would not conflict
with attempts to get agreement between most of the big aluminium producing
countries who will meet in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday. The
Commission's new offer will be made to Russia at these meetings.
Russia is suggesting to the western producers that the industry should cut
annual production by 1.5m tonnes, or about 8 per cent, to help bring supply
back into line with demand. The US industry is seeking instead an immediate
1.1m tonnes cut in CIS output - and for its exports next year to be held at
500,000 tonnes, down from the expected 1.5m tonnes in 1993.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU welcomes government
measures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Farmers' Union of England and Wales yesterday welcomed
government measures to tighten health checks on imported livestock following
outbreaks of brucellosis and warble fly in Britain.
The government is to check all livestock imports from countries where there
are high-risk diseases and to examine 50 to 60 per cent of all imported
animals. Cattle from France are already being checked following the warble
fly outbreaks, which originated from French imports.
The government is also pressing for common EU standards to be used by vets
who certify the health of livestock.
Mr David Naish, the NFU president, said: 'These are all moves in the right
direction. It's got to be policed very carefully'.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Advisers worried about reduced
crop diversity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There could be far fewer crop varieties in future as set-aside and farmers'
increasing use of home-saved seed reduce the revenues that plant breeders
can devote to investment, according to Adas, the UK government's
agricultural advisory agency.
Launching a report on the arable industry yesterday, Mr Melvyn Askew, head
of Adas crop development, said this could leave crops more vulnerable to
diseases and pests.
'The more diversity we have, the less chance we have of a disease or pest
wiping everything out,' he said, adding that the area sown with new cereal
varieties had fallen by up to 53 per cent in the UK in the past five years.
He also pointed out that the US Department of Agriculture had drawn up a
list of 600 new crop varieties that could be developed for non-food uses
such as paint, printing ink and fibres, if breeders had the necessary
financial resources.
To increase revenues, breeders should receive 'intellectual property'
payments on home-saved seed, he suggested.
Plant breeding and seed supply are just one of the agricultural service
industries to be hit by falling farm expenditure. The report says UK
pesticide sales have dropped 13.5 per cent in value from their 1989 high,
while inorganic fertiliser sales are down 17.7 per cent in volume from 1987.
The number of tractors sold fell by 37 per cent between 1988 and last year,
and the downward trend is expected to continue despite a 30 per cent rise
this year due largely to the extra farm income derived from the devaluation
of sterling last September.
The report examines the impact on farm incomes of reforms of the European
Union's common agricultural policy reforms and movements in the sterling.
A typical cereal farm of 200 hectares would have income of Pounds 30,000 in
1995 compared with Pounds 31,000 last year and Pounds 29,000 this year, if
sterling remains at its current exchange rate. However, a 5 per cent
strengthening of the pound would reduce income to Pounds 22,000. In 1991 it
was Pounds 18,000.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices slip to fresh 5-year
lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices tested new five-year lows yesterday as markets continued to react
to last week's decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
not to cut output.
At one stage the benchmark Brent Blend for January delivery broke through
the psychological Dollars 14-a-barrel barrier, before recovering to around
Dollars 14.25 in late London trading, about 10 cents down on Friday's close.
There was little optimism among traders or analysts that prices would
recover in the short term.
Neither was there much support for Opec's view that winter demand in the
northern hemisphere would soon lead to surplus stocks being eroded, thus
clearing the way for higher prices. 'Prices in a balanced market stay
still,' said Mr Lindsay Horn, a trader at Lehman Brothers Securities in
London.
Yesterday's price weakness was exacerbated by Iraq's announcement last
Friday that it was prepared to accept United Nations' monitoring of
factories capable of manufacturing military equipment, a prerequisite for a
resumption of oil exports.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Polaroid scare sends silver
price tumbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silver lost 6 1/2 per cent of its value in a bout of hectic trading that
sent the price plunging 30 cents a troy ounce in New York yesterday after a
brief announcement that the Polaroid Corporation had developed a silver-free
photographic process.
The precious metals markets were very nervous after a four-day Thanksgiving
holiday in the US and gold and platinum took their cues from silver, each
dropping Dollars 9 an ounce at one stage.
All three metals recovered slightly and steadied by the close in London.
Silver ended 15 cents down at Dollars 4.51 1/2 an ounce; gold was down
Dollars 5.75 at Dollars 371.25 an ounce; and platinum closed Dollars 6 down
at Dollars 368.75.
Silver's reaction to the Polaroid announcement was considerably overdone,
suggested Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers. The full
story showed Polaroid was moving further into the medical X-ray business and
would begin testing larger prints for its Helios dry-process laser imaging
system for medical applications. He said X-rays accounted for less than 8
per cent of silver consumption 'and this will affect only a small part of
the X-ray market'.
Consequently, this was less important than the Xerox Corporation
announcement about a silver-free film for the graphic arts market on
November 1 - which also sent silver prices spiralling downwards - and would
have a discernable impact on 10 per cent of the market.
Mr Milling-Stanley suggested silver might dip a little more before the year
end, moving to Dollars 4.50 or even Dollars 4.25 an ounce. Gold was unlikely
to break out of its present trading range between Dollars 360 and Dollars
385 an ounce.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (10): Business guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Getting there
Vietnam is served by an increasing number of international and regional
airlines, including Air France, Lufthansa and KLM. Visa and entry
formalities are generally straightforward, although visitors are sometimes
presented with an extra 'application to enter' form at the airport which
requires a passport-sized photograph.
Currency
Visa and Mastercard - but not American Express - can be used at major
hotels; the US economic embargo excludes the use of any credit cards and
travellers cheques issued by US banks.
It is advisable to take a substantial amount of US dollars in cash for
transport and accommodation, especially if you are travelling in the
provinces.
Theft and other crimes are on the increase, especially in Vung Tau and Ho
Chi Minh City in the south.
Information
Commercial and economic information in English is widely available inside
Vietnam, but the local press is not free and the best coverage of political
developments is in the foreign media. The official Vietnam News, a four-page
newspaper in English, is published daily.
The weekly Vietnam Investment Review has comprehensive coverage of economic
news. Vietnam Economic Times, a monthly English language version of the
Vietnamese weekly of the same name, is expected to be available from March
next year.
English is the language of business, although some older people speak French
and Vietnam's communist heritage has given the country many Russian and
German speakers.
Accommodation
New hotels are under construction in large towns, but first-class hotels
still tend to be full. Book well in advance and confirm the reservation.
Those planning a longer stay will find housing can be extraordinarily
expensive for foreigners.
The south
In Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), leading hotels include Century Saigon (Dollars
110 to Dollars 475 per night, tel (84 8) 231818, fax 292732); Saigon
Floating Hotel (Dollars 130 to Dollars 425, tel 290783, fax 290784); and
Continental (Dollars 80 to Dollars 176, tel 299201, fax 290936).
A favourite for connoisseurs of kitsch is the Rex (Dollars 59 to Dollars
198, tel 292185, fax 296536), with its rooftop garden complete with rotating
illuminated crown. Another hotel with a pleasant rooftop bar - if you don't
mind the odd rat - is the Majestic (Dollars 45 to Dollars 140, tel 295515,
fax 291470) by the river.
Saigon has a growing number of restaurants and bars, including the pub on
the top floor of the Dragon Inn - a mock-Elizabethan mini-skyscraper near
the river - modern bars with war-nostalgia names such as Apocalypse Now, and
French establishments such as La Cigale.
La Bibliotheque de Madame Dai, a law library converted into a restaurant, is
still going strong under Madame Dai herself. It is better known for its
traditional music and dancing displays than for its cuisine.
It is worth visiting the tunnels at Cu Chi used by Vietnamese guerrillas
during the war and to the Great Temple of the Caodai religion (prophets
include Lenin, Jesus, Mohammed, Shakespeare and Victor Hugo).
North and centre
The leading hotel in Hanoi is the elegant Sofitel Metropole (Dollars 139 to
Dollars 294, tel (84 4) 266919, fax 266920). Others include the Saigon Hotel
(Dollars 60 to Dollars 110, tel 268499, fax 266631), and the Army Hotel
(Dollars 41 to Dollars 72, tel 252896, fax 259276).
Hanoi is undergoing the kind of construction and motorcycle-buying boom
experienced by Ho Chi Minh City three years ago, but it remains a delightful
if dilapidated town of tree-lined avenues, lakes and French colonial
architecture.
In the centre of the country, Danang and Hue - the old imperial capital -
are developing at a more sedate pace.
The lifestyle of the emperors, with their concubines, eunuchs and mandarins,
makes fascinating reading. Emperor Minh Mang enjoyed five concubines a night
(he had 142 children), while Tu Duc's tea was made from dew collected from
the leaves of lotus plants.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (9): Patience an essential tool - Victor
Mallet looks at the obstacles to doing business in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The physical difficulties of doing business in Vietnam are being eased but
the bureaucratic, legal and political obstacles to securing a successful
deal remain almost as formidable as ever. Those who arrived in Vietnam
immediately after the enactment of the country's first foreign investment
law in December 1987 had to overcome the most basic transport and
communications problems.
Many of these have been resolved. Taxis now circulate in the capital Hanoi
and in Ho Chi Minh City, the southern commercial centre formerly called -
and still known as - Saigon; international direct dialling is available from
even modest hotels; frequent international flights connect both cities and
Vietnam Airlines has added leased Airbuses, Boeings and ATR aircraft to its
ageing Soviet fleet for both domestic and foreign routes. Multilateral and
bilateral donors, such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the
Japanese government, are starting the task of repairing and upgrading roads,
ports and other infrastructure left in a sorry state by decades of war and
communist rule. But Vietnam's policy of doi moi (renovation) - its
equivalent of perestroika - and the government's official adoption of free
market economics has not eased problems for foreign investors. Some
companies have abandoned their projects after months of frustrating
negotiations.
The experience of the first five years of foreign investment in Vietnam
suggests that the principal obstacles to sealing an agreement are frequent
conflicts between the central and local governments with their own agendas.
'The power of the emperor ends at the village gate,' is an old saying that
has become increasingly popular among Vietnamese and foreign executives in
recent months.
A local communist people's committee will usually try to ensure that one of
its own subsidiaries is the partner in a joint venture with a foreign
company, or it will want to charge for the lease of state land above the
limits set by Hanoi; the people's committees vet project proposals in their
territory and are therefore both players and referees.
The central government is acutely aware of the threat to foreign investment
posed by free wheeling local officials and is trying to reimpose its
authority on the provinces. 'The decision-maker must be the central
government,' says Nguyen Mai, vice-chairman of the State Committee for
Co-operation and Investment.
Meanwhile prospective investors must ensure that their negotiations with the
central and local authorities are heading in the same direction; approval
from Hanoi is of little benefit if the people's committee in Ho Chi Minh
City where your factory is located is going to make life difficult.
Investors planning to export what they produce and with no need of a local
distribution network often opt for 100 per cent foreign ownership.
Others usually take the easy way out and form a joint venture with a local
government enterprise or with a company controlled by the relevant national
ministry.
There are several significant risks attached to doing business in Vietnam
besides the uneasy relationship between Hanoi and the regions.
The legal system is rudimentary, and the influence of your contacts or
partners is more important than the application of laws - if there is one to
cover your particular situation. The government plans to introduce a
bankruptcy law and improve commercial contract law, but for now disputes are
referred to local arbitration panels which have no powers of enforcement.
Even the foreign investment law contains internal contradictions. It
includes guarantees against nationalisation, but amendments introduced last
year suggest that Vietnamese companies have the right to buy into the
foreign share of a joint venture in 'important economic sectors'. Foreign
lawyers urge investors to ensure their agreement states that the business is
not 'important'.
Investors are also advised to insist on the right to hire their employees
directly rather than through a government agency.
Another concern for both foreigners and Vietnamese is the confused and
apparently arbitrary tax system, which includes a turnover tax on business,
personal income tax of up to 50 per cent, a complex import tariff scale and
local taxes. Again there is a lack of co-ordination between the centre and
the regions, with different provinces making different demands on taxpayers.
One irritating if understandable countrywide feature of life in Vietnam is
dual pricing. Foreigners pay between two and and 10 times as much as
Vietnamese for services ranging from domestic flights to access to ancient
monuments.
Corruption is widespread. The government has launched a high-profile
campaign in an attempt to eradicate corrupt practices, but bribery remains
common both for petty transactions such as visa applications and in business
dealings.
For example, one foreign businessman, said it was normal to over-invoice the
health ministry for pharmaceutical supplies, with the difference between the
actual cost and the invoice total going to ministry officials.
As a Vietnamese banker points out, corruption is unlikely to disappear when
civil servants with nominal salaries of Dollars 20 or so a month are
overseeing Dollars 1m contracts.
Lastly, the banking and accounting systems in Vietnam are rudimentary. Cash
dollars and dong, the Vietnamese currency, are both used freely in urban
areas and it is not difficult at present to obtain foreign exchange. But
personal cheques for domestic accounts do not yet exist; most employees are
paid in cash.
Many of the problems detailed above are the inevitable result of Vietnam's
rapid switch-over from a Soviet-style command economy to a free market
system requiring new regulations which have yet to be enacted; others are
common to fast-growing economies elsewhere in Asia, such as Indonesia and
Thailand.
If the Vietnamese government succeeds in pushing the necessary legislation
through the National Assembly and in enforcing the laws thereafter, the
investment climate in Vietnam will be much improved.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (7): Instant dollars a threat - Mark
Graham voices concern about the rush to develop tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years from now, Hanoi's shaded avenues are full of cars, Ho Chi Minh
City's streets are clogged with traffic jams, Vung Tau's beaches are
surrounded by sterile high-rise apartment blocks and hotels and the peace of
Ha Long Bay is shattered by hundreds of tour boats.
Such is the overweening desire to promote tourism in Vietnam that this
prediction is more than likely to be fulfilled. Vietnamese officials have in
recent years travelled widely among neighbouring countries, such as
Thailand, to see the results of south-east Asia's tourist boom. Without
exception they voice concern over tourism's often negative impact on the
environment, threats of uncontrolled growth around scenic areas and lack of
infrastructure to sustain tourism in the long term. But evidence suggests
that the immediate need for foreign exchange will overrule most of these
considerations and rapidly lead to the production of familiar touristic
eyesores. After years of isolation, it is only during the past three years
that Vietnam has welcomed foreigners with open arms, and even then it has
directed them to a relatively small number of destinations such as Ho Chi
Minh City, Hue, Hanoi and Ha Long Bay. Nevertheless officials claim that
more than 500,000 tourists will visit Vietnam in 1993 generating more than
Dollars 200m in foreign earnings.
The attractions are obvious - a little visited country with a fascinating
past, areas of great scenic beauty, the romance of an Asia still living in
the past and an excellent and varied cuisine. And it is cheap.
For the hardy traveller, prepared for the unexpected and the stimulus of
exotic adventure, Vietnam offers vastly different fare from the
predictability of well-trodden destinations elsewhere in Asia.
With the exception of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, decent hotel accommodation
is in short supply.
Transport is made difficult by the appalling state of roads and railways
which have suffered from 50 years of war and neglect. A limited number of
vehicles are available for hire and the public transport system creaks under
the combined weight of humanity and the inheritance of ageing eastern
European trucks and buses and still older vehicles left by the Americans in
the 1970s.
In an effort to conserve the environment and offer more exotic destinations
to visitors, the government is looking at national parks and wildlife
sanctuaries to see if they can be sensibly exploited.
Some of these areas, such as Nam Cat Tien, where a small number of Javan
rhinos roam a lowland swamp forest reserve 150km north of Ho Chi Minh City,
will remain off-limits. Others, such as Cat Ba island in Ha Long Bay offer
immediate opportunities for small groups intent on adventure and
exploration.
Ha Long Bay has long been considered one of the world's most spectacular
seascapes. Hundreds of limestone islands, reminiscent of a Chinese landscape
painting from Gwailin, emerge suddenly offshore from the flat Red River
delta. Stretching more than 150km, the area is populated with hundreds of
small fishing villages (and smugglers plying their trade between Hainan
island and the Vietnamese mainland).
Among the many motorised fishing vessels it is still possible to admire the
graceful shape of a junk slowly wending her way through the maze of inlets
and islands. For the most part uninhabited, many of the islands offer
pristine beaches and countless unexplored caves.
Cat Ba, the largest, covers more than 150 sq km with its rugged limestone
hills and heavily forested valleys.
Part of the island is a national park, home to the rare golden-headed langur
monkey, numerous birds, the flora of evergreen tropical forests and a
multitude of exotic butterflies.
The forestry department's headquarters provides simple accommodation for
about 30 people. Other diversions include visits to ancient fishing villages
and enjoyment of plentiful fresh seafood.
Although few organised tours exist to the more inaccessible parts of
Vietnam, the department of ecotourism at the University of Hanoi will
organise small group expeditions, obtaining the necessary provincial permits
and providing transport and guides.
Tourism offers instant dollars but it is hard to determine where this fits
into overall government policy of trying to feed one of the most densely
populated and poorest countries in the world.
The arrival of multinational hotel chains, the sale of land concessions to
foreigners for the construction of golf courses and an increasing mass of
ignorant tourists suggest that the heroic discipline which served the
Vietnamese so well throughout two anti-colonial wars has deserted them.
Idyllic though Vietnam may now be, the temptations of easy wealth will
ensure that today's unspoilt land will soon become another case of too much
too quickly.

co-authored books on the national parks and wildlife of Thailand.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (8): Tapping into undeveloped reserves -
Iain Simpson examines the government's plans to exploit its oil and gas
fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As its joint oil venture with the former Soviet Union lurches from one
crisis to another, Vietnam is looking at ways of making more money out of
its oil and gas reserves.
The government's priority is to recover the gas now being flared off by
VietSovPetro, the joint venture between Hanoi and Moscow. Plans to exploit
gas from undeveloped fields are also being assessed and exploration
contracts will soon be let on other areas.
The Australian company, BHP Petroleum, has struck oil in the Dai Hung (Big
Bear) field it is drilling off the south-east coast of Vietnam. BHP
officials say their floating production system means the find can be
exploited soon - certainly by the middle of 1994.
BHP estimates recoverable reserves in the field at 7-800m barrels of oil.
The company also says 2-3,000bn cubic feet of gas exists in Dai Hung. The
gas from Dai Hung will not be piped out until well into next year but the
state oil company, PetroVietnam, is pursuing ways of recovering gas from the
Bach Ho (White Tiger) field, the only Vietnamese field from which oil is now
being pumped.
Bach Ho was discovered by Mobil in January, 1975, but three months later the
company was forced to abandon its drilling rigs and flee the country in the
face of the advancing North Vietnamese troops. Two years later, Vietnam
established its own state oil company, PetroVietnam.
In 1981, the state company set up a joint venture with the Soviet Union,
VietSovPetro and three years later the first oil was pumped out of Mobil's
field. Since then, VietSovPetro has been draining the reserves at Bach Ho
and flaring off the associated gas. It is producing 130,000 barrels a day.
Critics in the oil industry say the Soviet technology is out of date and the
oil reservoir is not being properly conserved by VietSovPetro. Indeed,
PetroVietnam has just let two contracts - one for reservoir management and
one for rig maintenance - to foreign companies. These tasks are normally
carried out by the company drilling the wells.
A proposal to recover gas from the Bach Ho field has also been put out to
tender and British Gas, one of the companies bidding for the scheme,
believes there is a large untapped market for gas in Vietnam.
The project is split into two phases: under the 'fast track' phase one, an
underwater pipeline will bring the gas onshore near the south-eastern port
city of Vung Tau. Five foreign engineering companies have bid for this
Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m contract and the tenders are to be examined by the
middle of next month.
Phase two involves an expansion of the pipeline capacity from phase one and
the construction of an LPG plant. Industry sources say three foreign
consortia have bid for this second phase of the project, worth Dollars 400m.
At least one of these bids has been in since June and the bidders are
pushing the government to make an early decision, saying that otherwise the
reserves will continue to diminish as they are flared.
Hanoi is also keen to discover and exploit other potential reservoirs of gas
offshore and is seeking bids from companies to exploit gas reserves in
offshore blocks which are now being drilled for oil.
The gas pumped ashore by the phase one pipeline, which Hanoi hopes will be
completed by the end of next year, will be used mainly to generate
electricity at a power station near Vung Tau. Industry sources say the
turbines, now powered by imported fuel oil, can easily be adapted to use
natural gas.
There is currently almost no domestic market for gas in Vietnam, except for
a small onshore field in the north, used for electricity generation and
piped to a ceramics factory.
British Gas, which leads one of the consortia bidding for phase two,
believes the higher volume of gas brought onshore can be used to develop a
domestic market. A study carried out by the company 18 months ago concluded
that in the short term, the Vietnamese market could absorb 2bn cubic metres
a year.
Phase two could bring between 1bn and 1.5bn cubic metres onshore annually
and British Gas says it wants to promote the use of natural gas among
industries in the south which now rely on electricity.
Power is in short supply in the south, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City.
However, the government is spending Dollars 500m on a north-south power line
to carry excess electricity from north to south and may not welcome attempts
by foreign companies to promote alternative sources of power.
After a gap of 18 years, a team from Mobil is back in Vietnam, led by
regional vice-president Bob Aberbach. The company has bid for a
production-sharing contract on the Blue Dragon field, which will soon be
awarded by the state oil and gas corporation.
At the time of writing, the US trade embargo against Vietnam prevents
American companies from doing most kinds of business in the country but,
under the recently relaxed rules of the embargo, American oil companies can
go a long way towards exploring potential fields. 'We can sign
production-sharing contracts, carry out exploration drilling and appraisal
drilling, which is the first stage in any production-sharing programme,' Mr
Aberbach said.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (5): Progress is patchy - William Keeling
looks at obstacles to privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along with its commitment to a free market, investors might have expected
the Vietnamese government to undertake a programme to privatise state-owned
enterprises.
But after expressions of intent in 1991 progress toward privatisation has
been piecemeal. Companies that investors might wish to buy are not for sale
and many of those on offer have been withdrawn.
The tale of two companies in Ho Chi Minh City - Saigon Brewery, Vietnam's
dominant beer producer, and Legamex, a garment and footwear manufacturer -
provide an insight into the operations of state industry and the obstacles
to privatisation, or 'equitisation', as the government call it.
Among the most striking aspects of economic liberalisation has been the
energetic response of some state companies to greater competition.
Production at Saigon Brewery, owned by the Ministry of Light Industry, has
risen from 72m litres in 1991 to a forecast 110m litres this year,
accounting for one-third of Vietnam's total beer production.
'It's the difference between a centralised economy and a market economy,'
says Ngac Van Giau, the brewery's vice-director. It is also, he admits, the
result of a Dollars 23m programme to refurbish the plant.
A bottling line purchased from Germany and new fermentation equipment have
reduced losses from 12 per cent of production to 1 per cent. The company
financed the refurbishment from internal resources and is one of Vietnam's
largest tax payers, Mr Giau says. Saigon Brewery expects to pay the state
542bn dong in taxes this year, up from 165bn dong in 1991.
How profitable the company is remains unclear. Its accounting system carries
the legacy of the command economy with the emphasis on turnover. Salaries
are paid according to production, not profitability.
Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a private sector economist, says the accounting method of
state enterprises 'is all wrong. Depreciation has never been taken into
account'. Nevertheless, most businessmen agree that Saigon Brewery would
have to pour beer down the drain to lose money.
The industry has, not surprisingly, drawn the attention of foreign investors
but the government has limited entry to the sector, described by Nguyen Mai,
vice-chairman of the State Committee for Co-operation and Investment (SCCI),
as 'extremely profitable'.
While some early applicants received SCCI approval, further investment in
the beer industry must now be vetted by the prime minister's office. As for
Saigon Brewery, it is not on the list of companies waiting to be privatised.
As Mr Giau explains, privatisation only 'applies to businesses which are not
profitable'.
Legamex, on the other hand, is slated for privatisation and is touted as one
of Vietnam's best managed state enterprises. Yet after two years of wearing
the For Sale tag, the company remains in state hands and the prospects for
privatisation are receding.
In a sprightly piece of research in 1991, Credit Lyonnais Securities
described Legamex's garment operations as a 'Win-Win' business. Since then,
the company, which is owned by the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Light
Industry, has suffered a serious setback with a tight export quota being
placed on its principal product, jackets.
In 1992, Legamex exported 1.7m jackets to Germany; this year its quota for
the entire European Union has been set at 475,000 pieces. The company, which
also has embroidery and leather goods divisions, has tried to switch
production to shirts but rows of sewing machines lie dormant.
'When the government informed us of the quota, we were very upset,' says
Nguyen Thi Son, Legamex chairman. The company, which had not anticipated the
quota restrictions, found itself with excess stocks of materials and
finished products.
Mrs Son is optimistic that the company will be privatised but problems
remain. The most immediate is negotiation over a Dollars 12m seven-year
loan, taken in 1991, from International Investment Bank (IIB), a consortium
of 12 banks from former eastern bloc countries.
Mrs Son believes a repayment of 40 cents to the dollar could be negotiated.
But Legamex is one of six state companies with IIB loans and the government
wishes to negotiate collective repayment at 20 cents to the dollar, she
says. Legamex's interest payments on the loan totalled 12bn dong last year,
reducing profits before tax to just 2bn dong on turnover of 126bn dong. The
company anticipates similar figures this year.
Given the small profit, foreign investors 'are not interested in taking over
the entire company. They're interested in taking over bits', leaving the
loss making divisions in state ownership, says one European banker.
But the biggest obstacle to privatisation may be political. A recent press
campaign, backed by government labour unions, has accused Legamex executives
of corruption and nepotism. Businessmen in Ho Chi Minh City say Mrs Son's
enthusiasm for privatisation is proving unpopular with local government
officials.
'Privatisation was never going to be easy in this country,' a banker
explains. Opposition is in part ideological - some communist sentiment
remains - but mostly springs from self-interest, he says.
State employees in inefficient companies oppose privatisation for fear of
losing their jobs. At better-run enterprises, managers and workers are
benefiting from the profits - either through official profit-sharing
schemes, or by means of unofficial payments. They feel privatisation would
dilute their income. Few companies, therefore, are willing to leave the
state's embrace.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (3): Resources lie thin on the ground -
Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The elegant facades of the commercial bank buildings in Ho Chi Minh City and
the imposing exterior of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) in Hanoi provide
the veneer every banking system requires: stability, respectability and
wealth.
But it is not an image that springs to mind for most Vietnamese. Under the
former Communist command economy, individuals were unable to hold bank
accounts. Neither were private companies, as the concept of a private
company was not tolerated. Individuals and private businessmen either
transferred their wealth into durables, such as gold, kept it in cash or
deposited it with unauthorised, and often unscrupulous, financial
businesses.
Transforming the banking sector so that it can sustain and facilitate a
market economy is among the most daunting of the government's tasks.
The first step has been to hive off the separate lending divisions of the
SBV into four state-owned commercial banks - the Industrial and Commercial
Bank, the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture, the Foreign Trade Bank and the Bank
for Investment and Development. The SBV, therefore, now acts as a central
bank, in charge of the sector's supervision and as facilitator of the
government's monetary policy.
Ten foreign banks have been licenced to open branches, two joint ventures
between foreign and domestic state-owned banks established and more than 20
'shareholding' banks created. The latter have a mixed ownership of state and
private companies, co-operatives and individuals. Although most shareholding
banks are majority owned by state institutions, businessmen regard them as
private banks carrying no sovereign guarantee in the event of failure.
While private companies and individuals may now hold accounts, a director of
a shareholding bank sounds a note of caution. 'The banking system still
isn't up to the development of the economy. It's the main obstacle,' he
says.
Vietnam lacks a sufficiently wide branch network and bankers have yet to win
the confidence of individuals and businesses. The scepticism of potential
customers is justifiable, notes one local banker, who says banks face
difficulties in performing the most basic transaction - allowing customers
to withdraw cash.
The fault, he explains, lies in the government's policy of using physical
cash as the main tool of its monetary policy. As a result, when the
government wants to dampen inflationary pressure, it does so principally by
reducing cash in circulation, leading to a paucity of notes.
Understandably, many of the banks' customers demand a guarantee that
payments made through the banking system can be withdrawn in cash.
This can only be guaranteed by passing the transaction through the SBV which
has the sole authority to issue 'cash-cheques'. But the SBV will not issue a
cash-cheque unless the bank from which the money is being transferred
delivers to the SBV the payment in physical notes. 'Sometimes, we cannot
understand the way the State Bank (of Vietnam) does business,' complains one
local banker.
A former financial adviser to the government believes senior SBV officials,
in spite of recent bank reforms, remain ignorant of how banks operate in a
free-market economy. His advice for further reform, given with a wistful
smile, is, 'Pull out the governor (of the SBV) . . . He doesn't know
banking'.
Although other bankers point to the excellent record at controlling
inflation of Cao Si Kiem, SBV governor, severe inadequacies in the sector
need to be confronted.
The four state-owned banks, which at the end of 1992 had 36,000bn dong in
assets, are burdened with non-performing loans and are poorly capitalised.
Donor officials say the proportion of the state-owned banks' non-performing
loans has fallen from about 30 per cent of their portfolios in 1990 to about
12 per cent, after a concerted government drive to make state corporations
current on loans, by selling assets if necessary.
But local bankers point out that the accounts of state-owned banks and
enterprises are poor. More non-performing debt may come to light.
The banks' capitalisation is no better. A recent World Bank report estimated
the state-owned banks' capital levels at less than 1 per cent of assets. The
banks would require an injection of Dollars 250m to bring them up to
international capital adequacy standards, and a higher figure if they plan
to increase lending.
Economic liberalisation should go hand-in-hand with a relatively fast
expansion of domestic bank credit but Vietnamese banks lack the basic skills
for the task.
A recent World Bank report notes: 'There is as yet no loan classification
system - neither in most of the individual banks (with the notable exception
of the foreign and joint venture banks), nor even in the thinking of the
regulatory authorities'.
One step would be for foreign banks to fill the void until the domestic
banks' skill levels have been improved. However, 'there is an aversion among
the foreign bankers to lend locally,' says an Asian banker.
Foreign banks prefer 'to pick off the short-term stuff, the trade finance,'
says a European banker. He says foreign banks would be willing to lend more
to domestic business but the legal system allowing recovery of bad loans is
inadequate.
The high tax structure for banks - a turnover tax of 4-15 per cent and a
profits tax of 50 per cent of net income - also makes them wary of
long-term, higher risk lending. Banks are encouraged to hold 30 per cent of
deposits with the SBV at negligible or zero interest rates which, being well
below the banks' average cost of funds, constitutes a further tax. As a
result, banks operate on the thinnest of margins.
The agenda, therefore, for those seeking to reform the banking system is
over-flowing.
Given its staff's lack of experience, the SBV faces a stiff challenge to
restructure the sector to keep pace with the rest of the economy. The scale
of the task 'scares the hell out of them (the SBV),' says one foreign
banker. 'They know they're short on resources'.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (3): Communism losing its lustre - Party
membership is no longer seen as the only path to prosperity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Their eyes flicking restlessly to and fro, the plainclothes policemen
watching the Buddhist monks at the Linh Mu pagoda are easily identified
among the foreign tourists and Vietnamese souvenir hawkers on the banks of
the Perfume River.
They are watching with good reason. In May, the dozen monks at this pagoda
on the outskirts of the old imperial capital of Hue were at the centre of
the most serious threat to the authority of the Vietnamese Communist Party
for many years.
The trouble began when a man committed suicide at the temple by dousing
himself with petrol and setting himself ablaze. The monks, belonging to the
Unified Buddhist Church which has long resisted incorporation into the
official church sanctioned by the government, said the dead man was a devout
Buddhist; the authorities said he had problems with his wife.
When Thich Tri Tuu, the abbot, was taken away for questioning about the
incident, about 1,000 people staged a demonstration on a bridge in the
centre of Hue. A government car was overturned and set on fire before the
security forces dispersed the crowd.
Four monks, including the abbot, were among those subsequently arrested.
They were sentenced to 3-4 years in jail at a trial in November, according
to news agency reports from Hanoi. The unrest appears to have spread from
central Vietnam to the south, and the head of a pagoda near Vung Tau has
also been arrested.
'There is no freedom of religion,' said one of the grey-robed monks at the
Linh Mu pagoda recently. 'We are trying to develop Buddhism among the
people, and most people are Buddhists, so the government is scared. Buddhism
does not fit in with Marxism-Leninism . . . It is hard for both Catholics
and Buddhists.'
Supporters of the government and western diplomats say the monks have links
to south Vietnamese anti-communists. Yet it was from this pagoda that a monk
went to Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) in 1963 to perform a much publicised
act of self-immolation in protest against the persecution of Buddhists by
Ngo Dinh Diem, the South Vietnamese president then confronting the Communist
north.
Opinion is divided as to the seriousness of the threat to the government's
authority posed by the Hue demonstration. The rise of religious feeling is
certainly regarded as more significant than the feeble anti-communist plots
organised by dissatisfied south Vietnamese living in exile in the US that
are occasionally uncovered by the government.
The interior ministry and the security forces maintain a tight grip on the
country. Asked about the demonstration, a Hue student said: 'The people had
a fight with the police. The police won. They took photographs to make
arrests. If anyone talks about the incident they go to jail.'
In the countryside, where four fifths of Vietnam's people live, the party's
control has been loosened by the collapse of agricultural co-operatives and
the liberalisation of the rice trade. In the towns, which have an estimated
3.5m unemployed, but no organised opposition to the government has emerged.
'I don't see the Communist Party fading away in the Soviet sense,' says one
western diplomat. 'It's secure as long as it controls the army. There is no
urban intellectual dissidence.'
Although it controls the levers of power, the Communist Party of Vietnam
(CPV) - like communist parties everywhere - is floundering ideologically.
Having adopted free market economic policies, it is communist only in its
name and its political structure.
By emphasising nationalism and pointing out that the party successfully rid
Vietnam of the French and the Americans in the 1950s and the 1970s, the CPV
can claim a measure of legitimacy and the support of much of the older
generation for the one-party state.
But half the population is under 20, and young men and women have no
memories of French colonialism or the more recent war against the US and its
south Vietnamese allies.
In Hanoi, the CPV has sought to boost its dwindling popularity among the
young by promoting such activities as a beauty pageant in the opera house
and a beer festival in the Vietnam-Russia Friendship Palace, but with the
economy being liberalised to allow the establishment of foreign and local
private companies, membership of the party is no longer seen as the only
path to prosperity and influence.
The party's reputation, meanwhile, has been tarnished by the increased
corruption that has accompanied economic reform and the leadership's
inability to control its members in the provinces. When the communist
people's committee in Ho Chi Minh City closed 44 of the city's 58 nightclubs
this year, it emerged that the 14 remaining open were owned by the committee
itself.
Whereas many young Vietnamese either ignore the party or want it to loosen
its grip, its ageing supporters complain that some of the good aspects of
communism - free education, for example - have been thrown out with the bad.
Perhaps the best argument that the CPV makes to justify its continued
dominance is that it can ensure stability during this hectic period of
economic transformation. Vietnamese leaders say that the communist states of
eastern Europe were wrong to allow democratisation before reforming their
economies, since the resulting anarchy made the introduction of coherent
reforms all but impossible. Most Vietnamese and foreign business executives
agree; the Vietnamese economy is growing fast to the benefit of the whole
population.
The disputes in Vietnam about the direction and pace of reform will be
discussed at a forthcoming party conference, and the fact that the meeting
has been put back from December to January indicates the intensity of
political manoeuvring within the party's ranks.
Coming in the middle of the CPV's seventh five-year congress, this mid-term
review is the first of its kind in Vietnam, and students of communism have
noted that similar conferences heralded the collapse of communist parties an
the arrival of democracy in eastern Europe.
In the absence of any serious contender for power, the immediate effects in
Vietnam are unlikely to be so drastic. But Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister
who is closely associated with the reform programme, will have a struggle on
his hands as he tries to steer a course between those who favour faster
liberalisation and hardliners fearful of change.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (2): The capitalist spirit is unleashed -
Despite impressive gains, sustaining economic growth will be hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It would be a brave person, and probably foolish, to deny that Vietnam will
be among the world's fastest growing economies over the next few years. The
government's 1986 decision to abandon the command economy has unleashed the
country's capitalist spirit.
While Vietnam remains extremely poor - the government estimates annual per
capita income at Dollars 220 - growth in gross domestic product between 1989
and 1992 averaged 7 per cent. Growth is likely to be sustained this year and
rise to more than 8 per cent in 1994. The move toward a market economy has
profoundly affected the lives of Vietnam's 70m people. More than 1m workers
and soldiers have been removed from the public sector and over a third of
the country's 12,000 state enterprises have been closed or merged. Instead
of experiencing an east European-style economic collapse, Vietnam has
responded vigorously. Exports have grown from Dollars 1.3bn in 1988 to
Dollars 2.5bn last year, while the trade balance improved from a Dollars
350m deficit to a Dollars 61m deficit in the same period. This was achieved
in spite of the collapse of the Soviet Union, on which Vietnam had relied
for aid and as its principal trading partner.
In the shops, more food, cigarettes and beer are available than at any time
in the past two decades as well as a plethora of consumer goods, from video
recorders to cuddly toys.
Perhaps most remarkable, this has been achieved in a period of tight
monetary control - inflation has fallen from 70 per cent in 1990 to an
annual rate of below 10 per cent - and without financial help from donor
agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank;
the US had blocked multilateral aid to Vietnam until July this year.
Instead, the principal source of foreign investment has been from foreign
private companies eager to benefit from a relaxed investment climate and low
wages. Since 1988, more than 780 projects worth Dollars 6.8bn have been
approved, with actual investment totalling Dollars 2bn.
Vietnam is also diversifying its export base with the two leading products,
crude oil and rice, accounting for less than half total exports last year.
Exports of seafood, textiles, shoes and agricultural goods such as rubber
and coffee are increasing.
Against this background, it might be churlish to suggest that big obstacles
exist to the government's target of doubling GDP by the end of the century.
Nevertheless, while gains to date have been impressive, Vietnam may struggle
to keep its development on track.
Of particular concern is the banking sector. Vietnam needs to avoid the
mistake of other developing countries, such as Ghana or Indonesia, which
restructured their banking systems too late. The issue of the sector's bad
debt, under-capitalisation and poor management must be a priority in the
development process, according to foreign investors.
The large number of state enterprises remains a problem. Accounts supplied
by the enterprises show a third as profitable but accounts are unreliable
and profitability often depends on subsidised credits supplied by the
treasury and the state-owned development bank.
Donors say the government must also improve its handling of infrastructure
projects. The north-south high voltage power line being constructed is
likely to exceed its planned Dollars 500m cost by about 25 per cent. The
World Bank estimates that between 1993 and 2000, Vietnam needs to invest a
further Dollars 2.6bn in the power sector and Dollars 2.8bn in roads, ports
and inland waterways to maintain the pace of development.
On a more positive note, the US decision to lift its objection to foreign
funding allows Vietnam to call on western donors to help finance these
projects. The IMF in October approved credits totalling Dollars 233m, while
in early November the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank gave the
green light to six projects with loans totalling Dollars 488m.
The World Bank estimates Vietnam will require aid disbursements of about
Dollars 550m a year in 1994-95, rising to Dollars 1bn by 1997 if its high
level of growth is to be sustained. This level of disbursement, given the
lead-time to initiate projects, will require far higher commitments, hence
the November 10 decision by donors to pledge Vietnam Dollars 1.86bn for the
year ahead.
Donor finance alone, however, will not guarantee economic growth. Much will
depend on the government's ability to absorb the aid efficiently and avoid
the problems of, say, Bangladesh, where a backlog of projects exists. The
machinery of government, which administers an annual budget of about Dollars
1.8bn, will be stretched by the influx of aid.
Donors are likely to demand a more transparency in the government's
finances. Important areas of revenue, particularly from oil exports, are not
yet fully revealed in the budgetary accounts.
But the greatest danger to economic liberalisation is that government
officials may object to the social and political results of the new policy.
The freeing of the economy has already increased friction between the Hanoi
central government and provincial governments, particularly in Ho Chi Minh
City. Provincial governments are modifying Hanoi regulations in areas such
as foreign investment and taxation to facilitate greater local autonomy.
The move toward a free market has also left a grey area between what is a
state-owned and what is a privately-owned company. Local economists say many
enterprises officially owned by provincial governments are now, in practical
terms, operated for the benefit of their managers and employees.
Such companies may set up autonomous subsidiaries and may have three sets of
accounts: one for the government - to which a nominal sum might be paid each
year - another for the workers and their profit-sharing scheme, and yet
another for the managers.
What appears to be happening is a slow metamorphosis of state-owned
companies into private sector businesses, except that the legal ownership
structure remains unclear and the companies - having failed to shake off
their Soviet-style accounting systems - put more emphasis on turnover than
on profit.
There are reasons to be alarmed by this process. Of immediate concern is
that the close relationship between the management of these 'state-owned'
companies and local government is likely to suppress true private sector
entrepreneurs.
A forthcoming law governing domestic investment may ease this but investment
data shows that genuine private companies remain almost exclusively
small-scale and only a few sectors, such as retailing, have seen rapid
growth. Most foreign investors form joint-ventures with local companies but
of the 780 investment approvals granted since 1988, only seven have involved
private Vietnamese companies. Of these, three have been revoked.
Of the 200 priority projects drawn up by the government to attract foreign
investment - ranging from food processing to heavy industry - none of the
proposed Vietnamese counterpart companies is private sector.
Replacing the command economy, therefore, is an economic system which is far
removed from the free-market ideal, with a relatively small number of
politically influential enterprises - some of which appear to be well-run -
dominating important business sectors; the hotel industry, usually
controlled by city or provincial people's committees, is one prominent
example.
The government, which remains Communist in name, may struggle under the new
system to achieve political objectives such as an equitable distribution of
wealth. The lesson from Indonesia, for instance, is that politically
influential companies are reluctant tax payers and tend to hoard their
riches while demanding business favours.
An impure free market system would also tend to localise wealth. Hanoi and
Ho Chi Minh may prosper, but other urban centres such as Hue and Danang
would fall further behind. On the macro-level, economic inefficiencies would
feed through to slower economic growth.
Neither is it the system envisaged by the Vietnamese officials who have
backed the move to a free-market economy. As one official noted, 'We are
enjoying ourselves too soon, importing luxury cars when the people in the
rural areas are still poor. We must try to bridge the gap'.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (1): Too much, too soon - Free market
reforms have led to a rush of business activity with Hanoi aiming to double
GDP in the current decade. But with growth comes the threat of corruption,
environmental destruction and a widening gap between rich and poor

The Vietnamese are enjoying themselves. After half a century of warfare and
dour communist rule, the country's 70m inhabitants - urban and rural - have
responded enthusiastically to the free market policies progressively
introduced by the government over the past seven years.
With an average per capita gross domestic product of Dollars 220 a year,
Vietnam is still one of the world's poorest countries, but the traits of a
modern consumer society are emerging everywhere from the trading towns on
the Chinese border in the north to the beach resort of Vung Tau in the
south. In the once sleepy capital Hanoi, foreigners and Vietnamese are
building hotels, office blocks and private houses, replicating the
construction and business boom which is already well under way in Ho Chi
Minh City, the southern commercial centre previously known as Saigon.
The public tennis courts in the central port city of Danang are packed with
eager if inexpert players; in nearby Hue, students are contentedly drinking
beer in bars which opened only months ago.
In Ho Chi Minh City, a new supermarket was forced to close its doors after
only four days because it could not meet the demands of its customers: the
check-out queues were one and a half hours long.
There is, as Vietnamese officials admit, an ugly side to Vietnam's
transformation. Corruption, greed and prostitution have flourished in the
liberal economic climate. But the incipient urban prosperity that allows the
wealthier Vietnamese to buy new motorcycles and build new homes is
underpinned by solid and nationwide economic achievements since the
communist government launched its policy of doi moi (renovation).
Ruthless restriction of the money supply has forced inflation down from more
than 700 per cent in 1986 to less than 10 per cent today. Foreign investors
have proposed Dollars 6.8bn of projects in the five years since the first
foreign investment law was enacted. Exports - including rice, textiles and
seafood - have been growing at an average 30 per cent a year in the same
period. The economy grew by 8.3 per cent last year, a performance which will
almost be matched in 1993.
Vietnam reacted nimbly to the collapse of communism in eastern Europe,
shifting the focus of its trade away from the former Soviet bloc countries
to new partners in Asia and the west.
According to the trade ministry, all of Vietnam's light industrial exports
went to the east bloc in 1988. Last year the figure was 4 per cent.
Most remarkable of all, the first stage of Vietnam's shift from central
planning to the export-oriented industrialisation policies that have been so
successful elsewhere in Asia was achieved with hardly any assistance from
foreign donors.
It was only in July that the US withdrew its objections to multilateral aid
for Vietnam from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the
Asian Development Bank.
The US bilateral economic embargo dating back to the communist Vietnam War
victory in 1975 remains in force, but the boycott is now at least as
frustrating for American companies as it is for Vietnam.
So much foreign aid money will flood into the country - Vietnam was promised
Dollars 1.86bn at its first donors' conference in Paris this month - that
the management skills of the government's Soviet-educated ministers and
bureaucrats will be severely tested.
The government has set a target of doubling Vietnam's GDP in the current
decade, and it estimates that success will require a total investment of
about Dollars 40bn - of which half is supposed to come from domestic sources
and the remainder from foreign direct investment and foreign aid.
Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, readily acknowledges the enormity of the
task that lies ahead. In an introduction to the Vietnamese document prepared
for the donor conference, he lamented the decline of social services and the
severity of unemployment.
He also emphasised the importance of repairing the country's battered
infrastructure and spoke of the need to strengthen the legal system in order
to allow the market economy to work properly.
'There is still much for us to do and there remain many difficulties to
overcome in order to carry on with our renovation programme and to realise
our socio-economic goals,' he wrote.
Mr Kiet and his reformist allies are operating in a difficult political
environment. Advocates of reform say social services were already declining
under the bankrupt policies of the past and that the switch to a market
economy - bringing with it the benefits of foreign aid and investment - was
made only just in time. The World Bank, for example, estimates that half of
Vietnamese children under six are malnourished.
The inevitability of reform, however, has not prevented many Vietnamese from
resenting the rampant corruption that has accompanied economic growth or
from complaining that the good aspects of communism - free education for
example - have been thrown out with the bad.
Bereft of a coherent ideology, now that it has abandoned the command
economy, the Communist Party of Vietnam is likely to find it increasingly
difficult in the years ahead to justify its monopoly of power.
Indeed, the central government is already being challenged by Buddhist monks
in Hue demanding greater freedom of religion, and by local governments
around the country eager to exercise their own authority and to keep for
their own fiefdoms a share of the money generated by investment and economic
reform.
One of the hardest tasks for Hanoi on the domestic front will be to nurture
the emerging Vietnamese private sector when both local and central
government agencies are accustomed to supporting the state enterprises which
fall under their control.
The privatisation programme has stalled. Returning Vietnamese exiles, a
potential source of capital and business skills, are often surprised after
many years abroad to find that they are greeted with suspicion by long-lost
acquaintances.
The banking system is in urgent need of reform and a series of draft laws
relating to business - including those on bankruptcy, the resolution of
contract disputes and the promotion of domestic investment - are queueing up
to be passed by the National Assembly at its next meeting in December.
Several will have to wait until the subsequent session in June 1994,
according to parliamentary officials.
With so many basic tasks still needing to be performed, talk of establishing
a stock market in Ho Chi Minh City is being dismissed by the government and
by foreign bankers as premature.
On the foreign policy front, Vietnam continues to have a difficult
relationship with its powerful neighbour China. Beijing periodically sends
ships into areas that Vietnam says are in its territorial waters, including
zones set aside for oil exploration.
This is one reason why Vietnam is anxious to restore full diplomatic ties
with Washington. The US is regarded as the only plausible counterweight to
Chinese expansionism in the region.
Given the difficulties Vietnam faces, it is enough to hope that the country
will be able to emulate east Asia's 'dragons' and achieve sustained economic
growth into the next century.
To expect Vietnam to go further and avoid the worst tendencies of its
fast-growing neighbours - including corruption, environmental destruction
and a widening gap between rich and poor - would probably be over-ambitious.
'Some people talk about the dragon,' says Do Duc Dinh, a Vietnamese
economist, 'but I think it may take three or four decades to come to that,
and it depends on our efforts.'
In the eyes of some of the country's more thoughtful citizens, the
Vietnamese are enjoying themselves too much, too soon.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Long gilts climb as traders digest falling
oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
European government bonds were little changed in thin trade ahead of today's
UK Budget and the Bundesbank's announcement of its latest round of
securities repurchase agreements.
UK gilts had a mixed day as traders prepared for today's Budget and the Bank
of England's gilts auction announcement.
The long end of the yield curve put on the strongest performance,
underpinned partly by the continuing decline in oil prices. London futures
for Brent crude oil fell below Dollars 14 per barrel for the first time in
five years following Opec's decision not to cut output quotas.
'This is a further factor indicating that inflationary pressures will stay
subdued through 1994,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilts analyst at UBS.
The 10-year sector was overshadowed by next Wednesday's gilts auction. The
Bank of England will announce the terms and amount of the auction at 3.30pm
today. Most dealers are betting on another Pounds 3bn-Pounds 3.25bn of the 6
3/4 per cent gilts due 2004.
'That would add liquidity to the issue, which should become next year's
10-year benchmark,' said one gilts trader.
The long gilt futures contract ended at 116 1/32 , up  3/16 point.
German government bonds erased their early gains to end broadly unchanged on
the day. The December bund contract on Liffe closed at 99.97, up 0.05 point
from Friday but off its intra-day high at 100.17.
Prices were underpinned early by firmness in the US Treasuries market, but
late profit-taking in the futures pits dragged bunds lower into the close.
Following the Bundesbank's fixed-rate repo at 6.25 per cent last week, some
dealers expect another fixed-rate repo at the same rate today to dampen
easing speculation ahead of Thursday's council meeting as a variable-rate
tender might tempt banks to test for a lower repo rate.
However, others argued that recent tight money market conditions, which
necessitated the injection of extra liquidity via two-day repos yesterday,
might mean the repo rate would remain close to 6.25 per cent even if bidding
was at variable rates.
The rally in longer-dated US Treasury securities continued yesterday, as
further declines in oil prices offset fresh evidence of a stronger economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 100
11/32 , yielding 6.221 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 4.151 per cent.
Prices firmed from the start at the long end, thanks to another big decline
in oil prices. They have been falling since last week, when Opec failed to
reach an agreement on production cuts.
This, along with declines in other commodities, have helped spark a
much-needed rally in bonds. At one point, the 30-year bond was up  3/4 , but
afternoon profit-taking brought the issue down, and pushed the yield back
above 6.2 per cent.
If it were not for falling oil prices, the market probably would have
reacted badly to yesterday's news that existing home sales rose 3.6 per cent
in October.
French bonds outperformed bunds in quiet trading, boosted by the continuing
appreciation of the franc, which hit its highest level against the D-Mark
since the August 2 revamp of Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
Despite the franc's strength, the Bank of France left its 6.45 per cent
intervention rate unchanged at its latest repo operation, and is expected to
refrain from easing key interest rates until the Bundesbank moves again.
Japanese government bonds posted more gains following yet another slide in
stock prices. The March JGB contract rose 0.22 point to 115.12.
Sentiment was slightly dampened by supply worries ahead of today's JGB
auction, and fears that some banks may offload bond positions ahead of the
year end to make up for losses incurred in the stock market.
However, in the longer term, 'the outlook is still very bullish for Japanese
bonds,' said Mr Stuart Thomson, senior economist with Nikko Europe.
He expects the yield on the benchmark bond to fall to 2.75 per cent by next
June from some 3.45 per cent currently.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Hungarian bank steals limelight with
DM1bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The National Bank of Hungary had the stage to itself yesterday when it
raised DM1bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds, its third DM1bn
Eurobond issue this year.
The bonds, via Commerzbank, were priced to yield 223 basis points over the
German government's 6 per cent bund due 2003, broadly in line with the
spread in the secondary market on Hungary's DM1bn issue of 10-year
Eurobonds, launched in August.
Syndicate managers said the pricing reflected the market's improved
perception of Hungary, since last year it was paying a yield spread of more
than 300 basis points over bunds.
The bonds were targeted mainly at German retail investors, among whom
Hungary has a wide following. However, lead manager Commerzbank said the
yield pick-up on the bonds also attracted institutional demand from the
Benelux countries and the UK.
The bonds, which had a recommended re-offer price of 99.55, slipped to 99.10
bid in the late afternoon. Some traders blamed the fall on signs that the
lead manager was selling the bonds below the recommended level.
Yesterday's other notable issue was a Dollars 115m offering of four-year
Eurobonds from Eurofima, the Swiss-based rolling-stock financing
organisation. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate Swedish kronor.
A number of borrowers are scheduled to tap the Eurobond market before it
closes down for Christmas.
The International Finance Corporation, which completed its Dollars 200m
buy-back of old Eurobonds last week at an average spread of 14 to 15 basis
points over US Treasuries, is due to launch a Dollars 500m offering of
five-year Eurobonds today.
The offering, via Deutsche Bank and Mitsubishi Finance, is expected to be
priced to yield between 12 and 13 basis points over US Treasuries.
Depfa, the German mortgage bank, is likely to raise DM1bn through an issue
of 10-year Eurobonds in the next few days, via Commerzbank and Morgan
Stanley.
The Bank of Greece is expected to raise Dollars 500m through an issue of
five-year floating rate notes later this week, via CSFB and Salomon
Brothers. The notes are likely to yield between 110 and 115 basis points
over Libor.
The issue could be the last by the Greek central bank, on behalf of the
state. From next year, the Hellenic Republic is expected to tap the
international capital markets directly.
The Republic of Argentina is likely to launch its offering of 10-year global
bonds towards the end of next week. The deal was originally expected to
raise Dollars 500m, but the amount could be raised to Dollars 750m due to
the positive response from investors.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) will launch Spain's first domestic bond issue
linked to a stock index on December 30, Reuters reports from Madrid.
The bond yields will be linked to the IBEX-35 stock index which supports
futures and options trading on the Meff exchange. The three-year issue will
total Pta10bn.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Budget watchers await lead
from PSBR forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, stands up to deliver
his Budget speech this afternoon, the UK government bond market will be
waiting to see if he lowers the government's previous forecasts for the
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) for 1993-94 and the following
year, thereby reducing the amount of borrowing needed in the gilt market.
By most estimates, the Bank of England is ahead of schedule with the funding
programme. Back in the March Budget, Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor,
forecast a PSBR of Pounds 50bn (Dollars 74.5bn) for 1993-94. Eight months
into the financial year, the Bank has completed about Pounds 43bn of gilt
funding. This calculation takes into account the second and third
instalments of partly-paid stocks issued in the previous financial year
(1992-93), but does not include last year's overfunding, estimated by some
City institutional economists to be about Pounds 5bn.
So, on its original calculation of a Pounds 50bn PSBR, the government only
has a further Pounds 7bn of gilt issuance to come, the equivalent of two or
three gilt auctions.
However, according to City economists, this year's PSBR is more likely to be
in the region of between Pounds 45bn and Pounds 48bn, helped by a
faster-than-expected economic recovery and lower debt-servicing costs.
On that calculation, the Bank would only need one or two more auctions,
perhaps supplemented with some tap issues. Last Friday, the Bank said it
would hold an auction on December 8, which the market expects to raise about
Pounds 3bn.
After that, it seems likely that the Bank will take advantage of bullish
market conditions to issue partly-paid stock in January and February, with
the second and third payment instalments falling in the following (1994-95)
financial year.
By the same token, the Bank would not need to include the 1992-93 overfund
in this year's calculation, and may prefer to carry that over for another
year, especially if conditions in the gilt market become more difficult.
Much of the funding this year has been in the five-to-10 year maturity
range, where there has been strong demand from overseas investors who can
borrow cheaply to fund purchases of medium and long-dated gilts.
With the shift in the gilt yield curve to a positive slope after sterling's
exit from the European exchange rate mechanism paved the way for more
dramatic cuts in the base rate, some economists point out that the Bank
should have issued more stock at the short end as a means of reducing the
government's borrowing costs.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Gencor chief cool over Billiton
deal prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision about the deal that would transform Gencor, the South African
resources group, into one of the world's biggest international mining and
metals businesses, will be made before the end of the year, but there is a
'less than 50 per cent chance' that it will go ahead, according to the
group's chairman, Mr Brian Gilbertson.
Gencor announced in May that it wanted to buy most of Billiton, the mining
and metals operations within the Royal Dutch/Shell group - assets with a
book value of Dollars 1.8bn. But Mr Gilbertson says: 'It is not in our
interest to buy assets that are fully valued. Billiton has to offer us a
good return.'
Billiton is heavily involved in the aluminium industry and Mr Gilbertson
says that negotiations have been complicated by the fact that a view has to
be taken about aluminium prices, which are close to their all-time low in
real terms.
Gencor's 40 per cent-owned Alusaf associate is building a Dollars 2bn,
450,000-tonnes-a-year aluminium smelter in South Africa.

<TEXT>
The most powerful computer introduced to the financial markets was switched
on yesterday by Merrill Lynch, the US's biggest broking firm.
In a sign of the growing importance of computing power to Wall Street,
Merrill has paid more than Dollars 1.75m for what is believed to be the
first supercomputer to support trading in the financial markets.
Supercomputers are high-performance machines capable of processing large
amounts of data very rapidly.
Mr John Galonte, a Merrill Lynch first vice-president, said the machine's
ability to process information was intended to give the firm an edge in its
trading activities. 'We want to improve the timeliness of some of our
calculations,' he said.
The machine, a Cray Research MP2E with two processors, is described by the
maker as 'the middle to low end of our product range'. Supercomputers are
used mainly for forecasting the weather or in other government or academic
applications, though companies in the aerospace, motor manufacturing,
chemicals and energy industries have begun to use them in recent years.
The need for greater computing power follows the development of both
derivatives and arbitrage trading, which rely on the analysis of large
amounts of financial data.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bowater plans workforce cuts and
property sales
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater, the US forest products group, is to reduce its workforce by about 7
per cent and sell some 70,000 acres of 'non-strategic' land to help cut
costs.
Over the past two years, the company has suffered from a sharp decline in
the price of newsprint, which accounts for about 37 per cent of its income.
The move will result in a net gain of Dollars 42m in the fourth quarter,
with a Dollars 10m pre-tax charge for workforce reduction offset by Dollars
52m in net proceeds from the sale of property in four southern US states.
The company owns or leases about 1.8m acres of timber land.
In the final three months of last year, Bowater posted a net loss of Dollars
20.9m, or 59 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 398.9m. Analysts have
forecast a small profit in the current quarter, and a loss of about Dollars
1 a share for the full year.
The company said it would save about Dollars 20m a year after shedding about
450 jobs by the end of 1994. The reductions are to be spread throughout its
North American operations.
On Wall Street, the stock closed Dollars 1/8 higher at Dollars 20 1/8.

Volvo

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo's campaign to win support for the merger of its car and truck
operations with Renault received a setback last night when Skandia, an
insurance company holding about 4 per cent of its voting capital, decided to
oppose it.
The move is a blow to Volvo's hopes of winning approval at a shareholders'
meeting on December 7.
Skandia said the merger was neither in the interests of Volvo shareholders
nor the country. It brought to around 8.5 per cent the number of votes
opposing the deal.
Aktiespararna, the small shareholders' association whose members represent
up to 6 per cent, is also opposed.
Volvo is certain of about 30 per cent of the votes but of six Swedish
institutional shareholders to have declared their stance, only two support
it.
Skandia's decision will narrow the chances of Volvo winning the majority it
needs to fend off a legal challenge from Aktiespararna. Even if the deal
goes through, Skandia said it will join a growing move among major
shareholders to reshape the Volvo board, a step principally aimed against Mr
Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman.

Qantas, the government-controlled Australian airline in which British
Airways holds a minority stake, yesterday announced that Mr Gary Toomey had
been appointed chief financial officer with effect from December 1.
He will also be appointed a director, filling one of two vacant positions on
the board, where British Airways holds three seats.
Mr Toomey's appointment follows the departure of Mr Graham Jones, former
finance director, who resigned in September after only 11 months with
Qantas.
According to industry sources, Mr Jones 'felt he could not make the required
commitment to Qantas to stay on for at a further three to five years,
encompassing the float and consequent bedding-down process'.
The government plans to sell its remaining holding in Qantas, although this
step has now been pushed back to 1995.
Mr Toomey's appointment is the latest in a series of senior management
changes at Qantas. It means that all three top executive positions are now
held by people previously connected with Australian Airlines, the large
domestic carrier which merged with Qantas last year.
Mr Toomey was chief financial executive of Australian from 1987 to 1992,
when he moved to become chief financial officer of Arnotts, the food group.
Aged 38, he is an accountant by training, having worked in the 1970s for
Peat Marwick Mitchell and Parkhill, Lithgow and Gibson.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Slow progress towards recovery -
Nikki Tait assesses a mixed series of results from Australia's banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a mixed results season for the Australian banking sector. Red
ink has been conspicuous by its absence, a sharp and welcome contrast to the
situation a year ago. Interest spreads have generally improved and the
benefits of cost-cutting are starting to show.
But the earnings reports have failed to answer questions about the pace at
which asset quality is improving, especially on the property front, or about
the lacklustre state of the business credit market.
Among the three big banks with September year-ends, National Australia Bank
(NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation (ANZ) both did
better than many industry analysts had predicted.
NAB's results were especially glowing, with profits bounding over the
ADollars 1bn (USDollars 663m) barrier. This puts the Melbourne-based
institution in a select class of Australian companies; in the past, only
Broken Hill Proprietary, the steel and resource group, has qualified as a
billion-dollar earner.
Conversely, Westpac disappointed. Restructuring costs featured far more
prominently than at ANZ or NAB, and led to a ADollars 325.9m charge for
abnormal items. After taking account of that, the bank was left with a
slender net profit of ADollars 39.2m.
The nation's smaller institutions, meanwhile, turned in creditable
performances for the most part - or at least produced few unpleasant
surprises.
On the plus side, all three big banks could boast an improvement in asset
quality and a decline in bad debt provisions, although in some cases the
picture is still far from pretty.
At NAB, gross non-accrual loans fell from ADollars 3.36bn to ADollars
3.15bn, while the charge to profit for doubtful debts was cut by a third to
ADollars 604.2m. At Westpac, non-accrual loans were down from ADollars
3.57bn to ADollars 3bn, while the charge for bad and doubtful debts was 46.1
per cent of the previous year's figure at ADollars 1.29bn.
But neither analysts nor the banks suggest that the going is about to ease.
Westpac, for example, noted that 'the trend in charges for bad and doubtful
debts will depend on whether there is a sustained improvement in economic
conditions affecting . . . customers,' adding that conditions in the
commercial property market would be 'particularly important'.
Here, the prognosis is equivocal. Most lenders and agents report some upturn
in sales activity. But they warn that the improvement is patchy, both by
area and type of property; that some of the larger markets are still heavily
oversupplied; and that prices are only just stabilising.
One analyst also points out that the big banks have generally found it
easier to offload relatively small property-related assets, and that large
blocks of their portfolios remain illiquid. This, he suggests, is a problem
of particular significance to Westpac.
Meanwhile, on the lending side, the only significant growth came in the
housing-related area.
Falling mortgage rates, coupled with expectations of an improving economy,
have led to a surge in interest from potential house-buyers.
According to one survey released this week, 76 per cent of Australians
reckon that this is a good time to buy a home. The problem for the lenders
is that everyone is eyeing the same opportunity, and mortgage price
competition is intense.
Demand for business credit, by contrast, remains muted and corporate
investment levels are extremely weak. 'The business community continues to
give priority to further rationalisation of operations and achievement of
efficiency improvements . . . total business credit actually contracted over
the past 12 months,' noted Mr John Gough, chairman of ANZ. Macquarie Bank, a
more specialised institution, said that 'in lending to the top end of the
corporate sector, margins are being cut to the bone'.
Inevitably, as the banks have concentrated on riding out the recession,
cutting costs and resolving past problems, they have been inward-looking.
Only NAB is thought to be in a position to consider significant expansionary
moves. Here, there has been speculation that the bank may add a US operation
to the clutch of interests owned in the UK, Ireland and New Zealand.
'I think an acquisition is very live and, internally, they're quite keen,'
says Mr Craig Turton, analyst at Pru-Bache. The caveat, he adds, is whether
opportunities in the US have become less attractive following the recent
wave of consolidations there, and the emergence of the 'super-regionals'.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Gencor chief cool on prospects
for Billiton deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision about the deal that would transform Gencor, the South African
resources group, into one of the world's biggest international mining and
metals businesses, will be made before the end of the year, but there is a
'less than 50 per cent chance' that it will go ahead, according to the
group's chairman, Mr Brian Gilbertson.
Gencor announced in May that it wanted to buy most of Billiton, the mining
and metals operations within the Royal Dutch/Shell group - assets with a
book value of Dollars 1.8bn. Mr Gilbertson makes clear that the price being
asked is the key issue. He says: 'It is not in our interest to buy assets
that are fully valued. We have to buy assets to which we can add value.
Billiton has to offer us a good return.'
Billiton is heavily involved in the aluminium industry and Mr Gilbertson
says that negotiations have been complicated by the fact that a view has to
be taken about aluminium prices, which are close to their all-time low in
real terms.
Gencor's 40 per cent-owned Alusaf associate is spending Dollars 2bn to build
a 450,000-tonnes-a-year aluminium smelter in Richards Bay, South Africa. If
this could be combined with Billiton's upstream operations, which produce
bauxite and alumina (the raw materials for aluminium), a world-class
business would emerge, ranking about fifth in the western world.
Mr Gilbertson is enthusiastic about prospects for aluminium - he suggests
the underlying annual growth in demand is between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.
'Remember the aluminium business is bigger than gold and to have a big stake
in a business like that is attractive. And our best judgment is that it
would be a very cost-competitive business, particularly when the price turns
up,' he says. But a combination of Alusaf and Billiton would be by far the
biggest part of Gencor, and it might want to take on a partner to share the
risks.
It has taken longer than expected to disentangle the Billiton assets from
those of other Shell companies and to carry out an extensive 'due-diligence'
survey, reports on which are now being drawn up. But Gencor has also used
the time to sound out companies which have pre-emptive rights to some of
Billiton's most desirable assets. Mr Gilbertson says that this will stop the
pre-emptive process being long and drawn out. He expects some pre-emption -
analysts suggest Minorco is likely to take up the rights to the Collahuasi
copper project in Chile - but says this would not kill the deal with Shell.
Mr Gilbertson, on his annual visit to London to meet UK investors, says that
if the Billiton deal fell through it would be a big setback to Gencor's
international ambitions. But Gencor is regularly offered mining and metals
investment opportunities, and has net cash of more than R500m (Dollars
148.8m), should the right one present itself.

<TEXT>
Noranda, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, is
further reducing its exposure to the forest products sector by cutting its
stake in Noranda Forest, its pulp and paper subsidiary.
Noranda is to sell 12m of its Noranda Forest shares to a group of
underwriters, which will re-sell them to the public at a price of CDollars
12 each, or a total of CDollars 144m (USDollars 110.8m). The underwriting
group is led by Gordon Capital of Toronto.
The deal will reduce Noranda's equity stake in the forestry company from 83
per cent to 74 per cent.
The proceeds are most likely to be used to finance an expansion of Noranda's
mining and metals business. 'The opportunities at this point do seem to be
on the metals side,' Noranda said yesterday.
Mr Jonathan Challis, analyst at ScotiaMcLeod, said yesterday the funds would
probably be earmarked for Falconbridge, the nickel producer 50 per
cent-owned by Noranda. Falconbridge is expected to exercise a pre-emptive
right to increase its one-third interest in the Collahuasi copper project in
Chile.
Billiton, the European metals group, has indicated its willingness to sell
its one-third stake in Collahuasi. The remaining one third is held by
Minorco, the South African-controlled mining group.
Noranda said funds were also required for the Louvicourt copper mine,
currently under construction in Quebec. The company is also considering an
entry into magnesium production.
Noranda and its subsidiaries have spun off several assets in an effort to
bolster cash-flow without taking on new debt. Sagging metal and forest
products prices have created a shortfall in recent years between cash from
operations and financing requirements for capital projects and dividends.
Earlier this year, Noranda Forest sold its controlling interest in MacMillan
Bloedel, the west coast forest products group. It has also sold its stake in
a British Columbia paper mill.
However, Mr Challis said he expected a marked improvement in Noranda's
cash-flows over the next year, thanks to the recent strength of natural gas
prices and brighter prospects in some other commodity markets.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Magna expands auto parts side in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Canada's Magna International is expanding its European automotive parts
interests with an agreement to buy a 74 per cent stake in Zipperle, a
German-based maker of mirrors, from Porsche Austria.
The Zipperle acquisition is part of a strategy by Magna to forge closer
links with European carmakers, partly with an eye to supplying new North
American assembly plants being built by BMW and Mercedes Benz.
Magna, which declined to provide details of the deal, said it would work
with Porsche to expand Zipperle's business. Zipperle has annual sales of
about CDollars 150m (USDollars 115.4m).
The Canadian company already has interests in several European parts
factories. It recently bought a 12.5 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt of
Germany, as well as a controlling stake in a Kolbenschmidt unit which makes
airbags and steering wheels.
The company is also keen to expand exchanges of know-how between its North
American and European operations. Several of its senior managers have
European roots.
Air Canada and rival Canadian Airlines have called in Mr Stanley Hartt, a
lawyer, to mediate in their dispute over ownership of the Gemini computer
reservations system.
Air Canada has been blocking Canadian Air's departure from the system
through the courts.

floating-rate bonds worth Rs10bn.
The shares will be offered at Rsl00, against the market price of Rs240, and
foreign institutions will be given an opportunity to buy into the bank.
The SBI is the first among 26 state-owned banks to offer equity to the
public.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mexico proves magnet to foreign
insurers - Growth and a poor domestic service is attracting US and European
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US and European investors are manoeuvring swiftly to take stakes in Mexico's
fledgling insurance sector. They are drawn by a market that has been
ill-served by domestic companies and is growing rapidly as the country's
incomes rise and inflation stabilises.
In the past three years the US's Aetna, Metropolitan Life, New York Life
Insurance Company, and Principal Financial Group, Grupo Santander of Spain,
and Commercial Union of the UK, among others, have taken up to the maximum
permitted 49 per cent stake in Mexican insurance companies.
In all, some 13 foreign insurers are minority owners of Mexican insurance
companies.
Asemex, the insurance group recently privatised for Dollars 582m, is looking
for a foreign partner, according to Mr Angel Rodriguez, the new company
president. The insurance company and Mr Rodriguez's financial group,
Mexival-Banpais, then plan to make a public offering on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Foreign insurers hope to bring to their Mexican counterparts capital,
technology, and global distribution. The Mexicans, meanwhile, will
contribute knowledge of the local market. Foreign companies generally have
better distribution systems, financial management and product development
skills than Mexican insurers, says Mr Bill Poortvliet, executive
vice-president of Metropolitan Life.
But is there sufficient room for all the foreign companies seeking a stake
in Mexican companies? While profit margins are high, many Mexican insurers
have high costs, and may be unprepared for competition.
'We expect some consolidation,' says Mr Poortvliet, whose company joined
last year with Santander to take a 49 per cent stake in Genesis, a new
Mexican life insurance company. 'Not every company is going to be a winner.'
The North American Free Trade Agreement will intensify competition by fully
opening up the sector to US and Canadian insurance companies. Under the
treaty, US or Canadian companies with at least 10 per cent of shares in an
Mexican insurance company can increase their holdings to 100 per cent by
1996. Other companies will have to wait until the year 2000. Mexico's
foreign investment law will permit up to 49 per cent investment in Mexican
insurers for non-US and Canadian companies.
There are also doubts as to whether foreigners are prepared for doing
business in Mexico, and ready to join forces with Mexican partners.
Commercial Union, the UK insurer, this year wrote off its 44.3 per cent
stake in Seguros La Republica after several executives defrauded the
company, and the UK insurer refused to inject more capital.
CU complained at the time that regulation in Mexico's insurance industry was
insufficiently advanced, and warned other companies to pick their partners
with caution, and conduct extensive due diligence.
The foreigners nevertheless keep coming, attracted by an under-developed
market. The average Mexican only spends about Dollars 55 a year on
insurance, while insurance premiums account for just 1.5 per cent of
Mexico's GDP, against 3 per cent in Chile, and 8.8 per cent in the US.
Investors tend to dismiss cultural explanations - such as Mexicans'
tolerance of risk and a somewhat fatalist attitude to death - for such low
insurance penetration, Instead, they blame Mexico's economic crisis in the
1980s.
Mexico's wages fell 40 per cent between 1982 and 1990, leaving little money
for insurance policies. Inflation was high throughout the decade, playing
havoc with calculations of the future value of life insurance coverage, and
reducing the incentive to save through such schemes.
Insurance companies are now convinced the conditions are present for a sharp
increase in the market. Mexico's inflation is down to single digits; incomes
have been steadily, if unspectacularly, rising; and the savings rate is
picking up.
This should bode particularly well for life insurance, which comprises just
one-third of the total Mexican insurance market, a much lower proportion
than that in other countries: only 2 per cent of Mexicans own a life
insurance policy. However, the sector is now growing fast, posting an
average 28 per cent a year gain in dollar terms since 1987.
The government's new state-sponsored individual pension scheme should
increase savings, and further boost the life industry. Mr Palden Namgyal,
vice-president of JP Morgan, which has advised on several insurance
transactions in Mexico, reckons that life insurance companies will play an
important part in managing savings generated by the retirement scheme.
The extension of credit - for the first time in a decade - is having a
beneficial impact, by increasing the number of first-time car and house
owners, and generating demand for car and property insurance. Banks in
Mexico generally demand insurance policies as a condition for lending money.
The question hanging over the new insurance companies is whether they and
their partners are the best equiped to meet the explosive demand all
participants predict.
Mexico's growing financial and industrial integration with the US is likely
to ensure that profit margins in the industry eventually fall to levels in
the US, and that, over the long term, only the most efficient companies will
survive.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Aerolineas needs Dollars 200m to
avoid collapse, says Iberia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AEROLINEAS Argentinas, the troubled carrier operated by Spain's Iberia, will
be allowed to collapse unless the Argentine government injects about Dollars
200m into the semi-privatised airline, a senior Iberia executive has warned.
Juan Saez, Iberia executive vice president, said in an interview at the
weekend that without fresh funds, 'the company will be dissolved. As simple
as that. It is not a political problem, it is a reality. Our pockets are
empty'.
His remarks substantially raise the stakes in negotiations with the
government over the loss-making company's future. Iberia maintains that the
airline needs fresh funds to finance a government-mandated investment
programme and rebuild its balance sheet.
The government, which holds 43 per cent of Aerolneas, has refused to
contribute to a planned Dollars 450m capital injection for Aerolineas.
Iberia owns 30 per cent of the airline.
Mr Saez warned that without this support, Aerolneas would run out of cash in
'two or three months' at the end of the busy holiday season.
'When the low season comes and it needs money, there is no bank that will
lend to it. And then if it cannot pay for fuel, wages or landing rights in
New York, then it will collapse.'
Mr Saez recognised that if this were to happen, it 'will have cost us
Dollars 1bn'.
He said Iberia has 'been injecting some Dollars 20m a month for current
spending and today the money has run out'.
A government official said: 'The situation has not changed at all.' However,
the government is understood to be looking for Argentine investors to take
its place.
Aerolneas has lost over Dollars 300m since an Iberia-led consortium paid
Dollars 1.87bn in a cash and debt for equity swap for 85 per cent of the
airline in 1990.
But last year the government had to take back 28 per cent of the company to
avoid its collapse, following the withdrawal of Iberia's insolvent Argentine
partners.
The government now owns 33 per cent of the airline plus a further 10 per
cent held in trust for employees. The remainder is held by Spanish and
Argentine investors.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Equitable to inject Dollars 800m
into life insurance arm - Deal values Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette at Dollars
1.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Equitable, the US insurer, plans to inject Dollars 800m into its US life
insurance company before the end of the year in a deal which values its
broking arm, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (DLJ), at Dollars 1.3bn.
The transaction is part of a move by Equitable to boost the capital of
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the US before the year-end, when
risk-based capital rules will come into force for the first time for all US
insurers.
Equitable said it will buy 61 per cent of DLJ from its life insurance
subsidiary with the proceeds from a new Dollars 304m debt issue launched
yesterday, together with around Dollars 500m of cash and other liquid
assets.
The Dollars 1.3bn valuation of DLJ implied by the deal, which Equitable said
had been arrived at through an independent valuation, is slightly ahead of
most market estimates, which had put the broker's worth at around Dollars
1bn. The transaction will allow the life assurance company to revalue its
remaining 39 per cent holding, boosting its capital position.
The deal will remove a large part of the DLJ equity holding from the life
company's balance sheet, which would otherwise have attracted a high capital
charge under the new regulatory rules, according to Ms Shelley Harris, an
analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency.
She added, though, that the DLJ valuation was already factored into the
company's A-plus rating for claims-paying ability, and the deal made little
difference to the life company's efforts to regain a double-A rating.
Equitable had said in May it planned to put a value on DLJ, the
institutional broking firm which it bought for Dollars 430m cash in 1984.
The move to revalue the subsidiary in this way, rather than partially float
it, does not alter Equitable's intention to take the broker public, though
the urgency to do so is reduced.
The brokers' founders include Mr Richard Jenrette, now chairman of
Equitable, and former New York Stock Exchange chairman Mr William Donaldson.
The group's US life insurance company, which has been suffering from the
effects of 1980s investments in real estate and junk bonds, had capital of
Dollars 2.46bn at the end of September under statutory accounting rules.
Equitable would not say to what extent the subsidiary's capital base would
be improved by the deal.
The Dollars 304m of debt issue yesterday will be loaned to a special trust,
which will use the money to buy preferred stock in Equitable convertible
into ordinary shares after July 22 1994.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: News Corp forces the super-share
issue at ASX - Nikki Tait looks at Rupert Murdoch's plan for a new class of
stock with stronger rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Super shares became a hotbed of controversy after Mr Rupert Murdoch
announced in September that his media group News Corporation would seek to
introduce them.
But differential voting rights do not feature in Australia, and the move
requires a change to Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listing rules. Critics
fear such schemes would be used to entrench management positions.
The potential problem for the ASX is that News Corporation - the second
largest company, in terms of share turnover, on the exchange - could move
its listing overseas if its wishes are not accommodated. The most frequently
mooted alternative is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The strength of this threat has also been debated. Yesterday, the Australian
Investment Managers Group (AIMG) said it understood, from informal talks,
that NYSE rules would not allow News Corporation to move and then introduce
super-voting shares, if ASX rules continued to forbid this.
However, 'if News Corp were to put its proposal in place, be delisted in
Australia, and then go to the NYSE with the arrangements already in place
when seeking domestic US listing, the NYSE seems likely to list on the basis
that the arrangement is already in place.'
The AIMG comments came as the deadline for the submission of views to the
ASX on the super-share issue was reached. But the exchange said it would
accept some late submissions, including those from the London Stock Exchange
and the Business Council of Australia. The BCA has asked for a December 9
deadline.
But the late arrival of some comments calls further into question the
timetable for a decision. Already, a parliamentary committee and the
Attorney-General have suggested that more time should be allowed to debate
all the implications of differential voting rights. The Australian
Securities Commission will also wants to review the implications of any
change for company law - especially in terms of takeover rules.
According to the ASX, however, News Corporation is seeking a speedy
decision. 'We have one company with tight deadlines. I understand that News
Corp has commercial opportunities open to it,' said Mr Ray Shoer, the
national director, companies.
He said December 21 was the earliest possible date for a decision, but the
timing should become clearer after the meeting between the chairman of the
ASX and the Attorney-General later this week.
Ironically, News Corporation was among those parties which failed to deliver
a submission by yesterday's deadline.
'I think the Thanksgiving holiday made them late - we're expecting it at any
minute,' said the ASX. No one was available to comment at News Corporation.
The Australian Mutual Provident, the country's largest life company and
owner of the Pearl Assurance in the UK, also expressed its support for the
AIMG's stance - the first time it has spoken out separately on the issue.
'There is no benefit to shareholders in departing from the principle of one
share, one vote. The reputation of the Australian market has improved
significantly and it is important that our reputation and integrity be
maintained and fostered,' it said.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Premium income falls at leading
Japanese insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Premium income at Japan's leading life insurance companies declined during
the six months ended September, the first half-year decline ever recorded by
the industry.
Combined premiums fell 1.5 per cent to Y10,647.3bn (Dollars 97.9bn). The
life companies, however, managed to post higher unrealised profits on stock
holdings for the period. These rose 8.1 per cent.
The value on stock holdings at the eight life companies rose by 52.3 per
cent compared with figures at the end of March, to Y12,800bn.
Returns on asset investment rose 7.1 per cent due to sales of securities
worth Y280.8bn. Life companies increased their disposals of shares in order
to cover for weak investment returns following the decline in interest
rates.
The fall in Japanese share prices has hit the life industry hard, although
unrealised profits on share holdings have acted as a buffer against losses
on high-risk investments.
However, some of the larger companies yesterday said they would begin to
increase securities investments during the current six months. Now was a
good time to buy, they said. Nippon Life and Sumitomo Life said they would
be committing more funds to the Tokyo stock market.
Although combined bad loans were 1 per cent lower at Y400bn, the worsening
economy increased bad loans at some life companies. The industry is likely
to raise premiums next April for the second consecutive year, while cutting
dividends on new policies for the fourth year in a row.
Nippon Life, the industry leader, saw a 7.8 per cent rise in total assets to
Y33,259.8bn. Policy payments rose 7.4 per cent to Y1,415.3bn while latent
profits on stocks rose 88 per cent from the previous year to Y4,489.9bn.
Dai-Ichi Life more than doubled its unrealised profits on stocks to
Y2,345.1bn while Sumitomo Life increased its latent profits by 5.2 times to
Y1,014.8bn.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi bank creditors approve
rescue scheme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bank creditors representing more than 85 per cent of the total borrowings of
Italy's Ferruzzi group yesterday gave their approval to a controversial
rescue plan drawn up by leading Italian lenders.
Reaching the 85 per cent level means shareholders' meetings to approve the
recapitalisation of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company and
Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, will go ahead today and
tomorrow.
Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank behind the scheme and Mr Guido Rossi,
Ferfin chairman, had stressed the plan could be put at risk if the level was
not reached.
Securing the agreement of enough creditors became a virtual certainty
yesterday after Deutsche Bank, one of the main critics of the plan, broke
ranks with other foreign creditors and accepted the proposal.
Credit Suisse said efforts to prepare an alternative scheme would continue,
in spite of Deutsche Bank's decision to resign from the committee of five
foreign banks. The other banks are Barclays, Union Bank of Switzerland and
Citibank.
The four remaining banks repeated their refusal to be railroaded into a
settlement, saying 'such a complex plan cannot be the object of careful
revisions and consideration within the very short time requested by
Ferruzzi'.
Credit Suisse said the foreign banks would meet on Wednesday and hoped to
share its conclusions with other foreign creditors before Christmas.
The Mediobanca plan calls for moratoria and below-market rates on interest
payments on Ferruzzi group borrowings, as well as reschedulings of most
debts. Ferfin had net borrowings of L22,600bn (Dollars 13.4bn) at the end of
June.
Last week, Mediobanca issued an 'updated plan' which went some way to
meeting foreign banks' criticisms by removing a number of companies, to
which foreign banks were most exposed, from the rescheduling proposals.
Ferfin and Montedison shareholders will be also asked to approve legal
action against Price Waterhouse, which audited the two companies. The boards
of Ferfin and Montedison say the firm failed to spot financial
irregularities which allegedly arose under the previous management.

Plans to sell part of the Turkish state paper company were cancelled
yesterday along with a rescheduling of the sale of the state aircraft tyre
factory. The developments deal a severe blow to Turkey's privatisation
programme.
Turkiye Seluloz ve Kagit Fabrikalari (Seka), the state-owned paper and pulp
group, confirmed that it had not received any bids for its Balikesir
factory, which the company had put up for sale in September at a minimum
price of Dollars 250m.
Seka is Turkey's largest producer of newsprint. The company, which is
arranging its own privatisation, is now expected to approach the main
newspaper groups Sabah and Hurriyet to seek a buyer.
Separately, the tender for the government's 99 per cent stake in Petlas, the
tyre manufacturer, which was due to close yesterday has been extended to
December 14, in order to give the government agency in charge of state
assets sales more time to attract buyers. The agency had set a minimum price
of around Dollars 100m.
Petlas was formed in the 1970s in the wake of the US arms embargo on Turkey,
following the invasion of Cyprus in 1974. It makes tyres for aircraft and
military land vehicles.

<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, one of the main critics of the restructuring plan for Italy's
troubled Ferruzzi group, yesterday broke ranks with other leading foreign
creditors and accepted the proposals.
The decision, ostensibly for 'political' reasons, weakens the front of
non-Italian banks, which formally opposed the restructuring scheme drawn up
last month by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, and leading Italian
creditors.
The plan calls for moratoriums and below market rates on interest payments
on Ferruzzi group borrowings, as well as rescheduling most of its debt.
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company, had net borrowings of
L22,600bn (Dollars 13.4bn) in June.
Last week, Mediobanca issued an updated plan which went some way to meet
foreign banks' criticisms by removing a number of group companies, to which
foreign banks were most exposed, from the rescheduling proposals.
In a message to other foreign creditors, Credit Suisse said efforts to
prepare an alternative scheme would continue. The other banks involved
include Barclays, Union Bank of Switzerland and Citibank.
Credit Suisse said the group would meet on Wednesday in Zurich and hoped to
be in a position to share its conclusions with other foreign creditors
before Christmas.
Deutsche Bank's defection increases the chances that Mediobanca and Mr Guido
Rossi, Ferfin's chairman, will be able to say banks representing at least 85
per cent of the Ferruzzi group's borrowings have accepted the plan. Board
meetings of Ferfin and Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, were
scheduled for yesterday evening to assess banks' responses.
Reaching the 85 per cent level means scheduled shareholders' meetings of
Ferfin and Montedison look set to go ahead today and tomorrow. The meetings
have been called to approve steps to recapitalise Ferfin and Montedison.
Shareholders will also be asked to approve legal action against Price
Waterhouse, the auditors of Ferfin and Montedison. The boards of the two
companies say Price Waterhouse failed to detect severe financial
irregularities under their previous management, replaced earlier this year.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sabena to strengthen alliance
with Delta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sabena is to strengthen its links with Delta Air Lines of the US, the
Belgian state airline said yesterday.
The airlines will share the Brussels - New York route from January 16.
Passengers booking through Sabena or Delta will travel on one of Sabena's
Boeing 747s to and from New York's JFK airport and Delta will supply cabin
crew.
Sabena, which has been working to cut costs and improve its service, said
the arrangement would save it some BFr600m (Dollars 16.5m) a year in
operating costs.
In March, the two companies announced a similar deal on the Brussels -
Atlanta route. Delta's Boeing 767-300s have been carrying Sabena passengers
on this route since June 1. Sabena said there was 'always the possibility'
that they might co-operate on other routes.
The Sabena announcement follows the collapse of talks on an ambitious merger
between four European airlines - Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines. The four groups
announced the end of talks last week after failing to agree on a suitable US
partner.
Delta, which has cross-equity links with Swissair, was one of the possible
partners. Sabena said yesterday that the success or failure of the four-way
'Alcazar' alliance had not been a factor in negotiations with Delta on the
Brussels - New York route.
European carriers have moved quickly to establish alliances with US
counterparts in recent years. Air France, which has a large stake in Sabena,
has links with Continental of the US. Sabena said yesterday competition
between the two alliances would be slight because Continental does not fly
between New York and Brussels.
'This co-operation (with Delta) is proof that Sabena can develop its own
strategy with the approval of Air France,' said the Belgian airline.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Italian banks close their ranks
 -Haig Simonian on the background to a spate of regional mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade ago, one big regional bank merger a year in Italy would have seemed
revolutionary. In the past month, three regional banks have taken over
like-sized counterparts, while another pair are merging amicably.
Two deals were finalised last week alone. Banca Popolare di Verona, a
stockmarket-listed bank based in Verona, clinched control of Banco San
Geminiano e San Prospero, a regional counterpart from Modena after a
three-week struggle.
Banca d'America e d'Italia, the Italian subsidiary of Germany's Deutsche
Bank, took a controlling stake in Banca Popolare di Lecco, a 89-branch
regional based just north of Milan.
The deal will cost BAI about L810bn (Dollars 479m) after an obligatory
public tender offer to buy out minorities.
Earlier in the month, Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza, a
fast-expanding savings bank, said it was planning to buy control of Credito
Commerciale, a Milan-based regional bank and trade finance specialist which
has fallen on hard times.
Even after handing 40 of Credito Commerciale's branches back to its parent
company, Sienna's big Monte di Paschi, the Parma institution, will be adding
70 branches to its network.
In Bologna, one of Italy's main business centres, two big regional banks
have advanced their plan to merge. Earlier this year, Credito Romagnolo, the
larger of the pair, reached agreement with the city's savings bank on a
share swap. The exchange was seen as the first step in a courtship leading
to an eventual marriage. Recently, the two banks have said they intend to
hurry the nuptials.
All the mergers have the blessing of the Bank of Italy, which has in recent
years encouraged mergers to create stronger, more competitive financial
institutions.
Italian banking is still very fragmented compared with France, Germany or
the UK, where the sort of concentration now taking place is largely history.
Concerned about the growth in foreign competition expected after the
European Union's free internal market, the central bank began in the early
1990s to encourage regional banks to merge.
The aim was to form bigger, more efficient and better-capitalised banks,
reaping economies of scale offering more services than one bank alone.
Concentration was also stimulated by substantial tax breaks for mergers.
Competition also played a part. The elimination in 1990 of tough
restrictions on branch expansion meant once tame regionals started opening
branches on each others' territory. Bigger nationwide banks could also
expand in areas, especially in the rich north, they had been viewing
enviously for decades.
The bank of Italy's fears of a foreign incursion have proved largely
unfounded. Only two big transactions had taken place until last week. In
1986, Deutsche Bank spent Dollars 603m on BAI.
Three years later, Credit Lyonnais of France bought an interest in Credito
Bergamasco, which it now controls.
Takeovers from abroad have been limited by very high asking prices for the
sort of well-located regional banks in demand, and by their scarcity.
Although the recession has flushed out additional supply, changes in
business priorities among many foreigners, now pre-occupied by domestic
downturns, has tended to dampen their interest.
Worries about Italian political and economic uncertainty have also played a
part. Significantly, neither of the two 'White Knights' believed to be
interested in Banco San Geminiano were foreigners.
Italian banks may also be better placed to understand the opportunities in
their market and judge whether asking prices are reasonable, even if they
remain high.
The amounts paid for Banco San Geminiano and Banca Popolare di Lecco appear
astronomic, in spite of the recession. That is especially true if the deals
are seen against next month's privatisation of Credito Italiano, Italy's
seventh biggest bank, which has almost 800 branches nationwide. Analysts
estimate the 67 per cent stake being floated will raise about L2,000bn.
The continuing attractiveness of regional banks has various causes. The
protection offered until 1990 by the Bank of Italy's branch expansion rules
allowed the biggest regionals to build up sizeable networks, which were
highly concentrated in a specific part of the country.
Fierce local loyalties meant the regional banks often enjoyed near
monopolies, even when competition increased after the central bank relaxed
its branching rules. And the established presence of the regional banks and
strong local roots often provided unparallelled access to both depositors
and growing small and medium-sized businesses, on which the regional banks
tend to concentrate.
Together, that could spell big profits, especially for regional banks in the
richest parts of northern Italy, such as Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and the
Veneto.
Combined with relatively low staffing costs and good management, many
northern regional banks have gained a cachet that this month's price tags
are beginning to show.

FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: NCC aims to raise SKr545m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NCC, the Swedish property and construction group, plans to ask shareholders
for up to SKr545m (Dollars 64.9m) in new capital following a return to
profit for the first nine months of 1993.
The company said a stronger capital base would enable it to participate more
actively in the restructuring of the construction industry which is under
way in Sweden.
NCC is to offer new shares on a two-for-five basis at SKr27.50 a share, a
substantial discount to the SKr64 at which the shares were trading last
week.
The issue, which will raise the group's equity-to-assets ratio by two
percentage points to 22 per cent, is being supported by Nordstjernan, the
Swedish property and construction group which with 55 per cent of the
capital is NCC's largest shareholder.
NCC had a pre-tax profit of SKr548m for the first nine months, compared with
a SKr252m loss in the same 1992 period.
However, before extraordinary items, profit amounted to just SKr73m,
compared with a SKr101m deficit last time.
The improvement was helped by cost-cutting and reduced losses from
associated companies.
It came in spite of the continuing collapse of the Swedish construction
market, which pushed down revenues to SKr13.0bn from SKr14.9bn.
NCC expects a full-year pre-tax profit of between SKr400m and SKr500m,
before an expected SKr300m in write-downs on property developments.

<TEXT>
Air Liquide, the French industrial gases group, should achieve net profits
for 1993 similar to the FFr2.2bn (Dollars 372m) recorded in 1992, according
to Mr Edouard de Royere, the company's chairman.
In a French press interview yesterday, Mr de Royere said he was unable to
give any forecasts for next year as the company's subsidiaries have not yet
set their targets. But he said that steps had been taken to ensure
profitability.
Mr de Royere said the group was in a position to expand and was ready 'to
seize the opportunities of acquisitions'. He added that the group has the
financial resources to be aggressive and the experience to take 'controlled
risks'.
At the end of last year it had net debts of about FFr4bn and a debt to
equity ratio of 20 per cent. The company said that gearing had been reduced
during the current year.
Mr de Royere cited China as an area of geographical expansion.

Varta, the German battery manufacturer, may omit its dividend this year, Mr
Erhard Schipporeit, chairman, warned yesterday. The company is also
considering plant closures but no decisions have been made.
The company, which paid a DM10 dividend last year, blamed increased
competition, industry-wide overcapacity and currency upheavals for a
'considerable fall in profits'.
Markets had already been warned of a reduced payout after Varta announced a
75 per cent decline in net earnings to DM5m (Dollars 2.9m) for the first six
months of 1993.
Turnover had fallen 8 per cent to DM1.56bn in the nine months to
end-September, Mr Schipporeit said. The group had reduced its workforce by 6
per cent in the period to less than 14,000 and the cuts would continue next
year, he added.
Earlier this year Varta announced plans to reduce vehicle starter battery
capacity.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptional credit leaves
Borthwicks lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim pre-tax profits at Borthwicks, the natural flavours company, fell
from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds 1.13m in the first results since the company
completed its exit from the meat processing industry.
Figures for the half year to September 25 were distorted by a one-off Pounds
442,000 credit booked in the comparative period related to tax on a New
Zealand lamb contract which had been sold.
Sales fell by more than a third to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 23.2m). Turnover in
continuing businesses increased to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 12.9m).
'As far as the future is concerned, clearly we are going for organic growth
but we are also working on joint ventures and partnerships and are searching
for acquisitions,' said Mr Peter Brackenridge, chief executive.
'In the UK, despite a difficult economic situation, and despite the
well-documented price pressure from Mr Sainsbury and Mr Tesco et al, we did
increase sales from the UK operations, although operating margins slipped.'
Borthwicks said operating margins in the UK businesses fell to a little more
than 9 per cent (10 per cent) over the period partly because of price
pressure and partly because of sterling's devaluation which affected more
than 60 per cent of raw materials.
Operating margins across continuing businesses fell to 8.5 per cent (8.8 per
cent).
Interest charges dropped to Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 324,000), reflecting
disposals in the second half of last year.
Net borrowings fell to Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 6.62m) but had climbed Pounds
500,000 since the year end. Gearing was 47.5 per cent (58.6 per cent).
Unrelieved tax losses of Pounds 4.7m and planned US tax losses of Pounds 6m
should ensure a tax charge of about 13 per cent for 'the foreseeable
future'.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.5p although earnings per share fell
to 1.6p (1.9p).

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Merrydown tops Pounds 0.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrydown, the Sussex-based cider and soft drinks maker, increased first
half pre-tax profits by 23 per cent to Pounds 932,000, helped by
contributions from Shloer and PLJ, the adult soft drinks acquired in
January.
'Their combined impact on revenue and profit is expected to be significantly
greater in the second half,' said Mr Richard Purdey, chairman. 'The
Christmas period, which normally accounts for 45 per cent of Shloer's annual
sales, will be crucial.'
Earnings per share for the six months to September 30 fell 8 per cent to
5.72p (6.22p) after a 3m share issue to fund the acquisitions. The interim
dividend is maintained at 1p.
Trading profit rose 17 per cent to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.07m) on turnover
31 per cent higher at Pounds 11.29m.
Soft drinks, which also include Piermont and Sorelle, accounted for 27 per
cent of turnover compared with 8 per cent in the same period last year.
Shloer sales in Ireland were largely responsible for an 85 per cent rise in
export revenue to Pounds 830,000.
Cider sales were affected by a slower than expected relaunch of Merrydown
Original, the company's leading brand. By September, however, sales were
running ahead of last year, and Original retained leadership of the Scottish
take-home market.
Sales of Premium Draught cider progressed and sales of own-label ciders
accounted for 10 per cent of group revenue.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo sustains revival with Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalamazoo sustained its revival in the six months to September 30 with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.53m, against a restated loss of Pounds 936,000
last time.
Fortunes started to revive at the computer services and printing systems
group in last year's second half as losses in its printing systems division
were brought under control. The division made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
730,000 in the period, against a first half deficit of Pounds 1.51m.
But as Kalamazoo concentrates on the expansion of its computer services
business, the future of the printed systems business within the group looks
doubtful.
Mr Peter Harrop, the chairman, said that he did not perceive the necessity
of a fire sale.
During the first half, computer services contributed Pounds 21.9m to total
turnover of Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 27.6m).
Mr Harrop said that Kalamazoo intended, from the base of its net cash
balances, to spread its computer services business across Europe.
The interim dividend is raised to 0.85p (0.25p), payable from earnings of
4.2p per share.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Control Techniques up 47% - Success of
corporate strategy behind organic expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Control Techniques, the Powys-based controls and drives producer, lifted
pre-tax profits by 47 per cent, from Pounds 6.22m to a record Pounds 9.14m,
in the 12 months to September 30.
The outcome was struck on turnover of Pounds 105.3m, up 20 per cent from the
previous Pounds 88m.
The recommended final dividend is raised to 5.15p, taking the total for the
year to 7.5p, against 6.85p.
With earnings ahead from 9.8p to 15.3p per share, the distribution to
shareholders is now covered twice by earnings, against 1.4 times in 1992.
Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the directors had been 'mindful of the
need to rebuild dividend cover to a level appropriate to a company such as
Control Techniques which, to maintain its competitive edge, must invest
significant sums in capital expenditure and research and development.'
Mr Wheatley said the results were a direct reflection of the successful
application of CT's corporate strategy - which focuses exclusively on drives
and controls for electric motors - and this had produced a welcome
improvement in organic growth.
'The strategy is to maintain CT's commitment to research and development, to
standardise and centralise production in state-of-the art manu-facturing
facilities in mid-Wales and to concentrate the marketing and sales effort on
expanding the company's worldwide network of CT Drive Centres.'
Worldwide, CT has 24 Drive Centres, small factories which take equipment
from the Newtown manufacturing base and provide a tailored service to local
customers.
Six more will be opened this year as the company moves towards its ultimate
target of some 50 units worldwide.
Mr Wheatley said the rate of growth in orders had slowed somewhat in recent
months and the board was not expecting any substantial improvement in
economic conditions.
The company had therefore been positioned to increase sales and profits even
in this environment.
COMMENT
Rationalisation has played a part in CT's success this year - some 200 jobs
have been cut worldwide. But there's more to the strategy than cost-cutting:
100 manufacturing jobs have been added in Wales and the overall worldwide
headcount is only slightly down at about 1,300. CT is benefiting from its
focused strategy, from the highly profitable Drive Centre development and
from overseas expansion. The product substitution that has followed foreign
acquisitions has increased output from Wales even though the US and German
businesses - together accounting for Pounds 40m in sales - are not yet
contributing to profits. But both are expected to contribute significantly
this year, and in spite of market conditions, suggest a further rise in
profits to perhaps Pounds 12m to Pounds 13m, putting the company on a
reasonable prospective multiple of 16 to 17.

<TEXT>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Keeping an eye on the ratings - Michael
Smith on how the City evaluates the electricity companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity today opens the interim results season of the 12
regional electricity companies in perhaps a rather more relaxed mood than
that to which it is accustomed when reporting to the City.
On previous occasions it has been among the lowest rated of the recs, but in
recent months its shares have moved ahead strongly as investors have
re-examined its prospects.
Three years after the regional electricity companies of England and Wales
were floated, Eastern's improved fortunes highlight the way the City
evaluates in a sector where each of the companies is remarkably similar.
How do analysts judge the companies, and do differentials between the
various companies' share prices matter?
In most sectors the danger of a low stock market rating is that it increases
the chances of a company being subjected to a hostile takeover bid. The
government's ownership of a golden share in each of the 12 recs makes that
less of a consideration in electricity.
Even after 1995, when the golden share expires, few analysts expect
contested take-overs in the sector, in part because the differential in the
ratings, whether measured in prospective yields or price/earnings ratios, is
relatively small when compared to other sectors, including water.
However Mr Nigel Hawkins, an analyst at Hoare Govett, is among those who
believe that agreed mergers are more likely. The stronger a company's share
price, the stronger its bargaining position would be in merger talks.
Mr Nigel Burton, electricity analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says there
are two other motives for the rec executives to keep their ratings high.
'The first is that high share prices act as an incentive on staff.
'Most recs' employees look regularly at their company's share price and see
how it is faring against others in the sector.
'The executives' second motive in keeping their rating high is their pride.'
If Mr Burton is right, the pride of Mr John Harris, chairman of East
Midlands Electricity, must have taken a fair knocking in the past three
years. East Midlands has never been highly rated since its flotation and
yesterday was no exception.
Its shares were, at yesterday's closing price of 561p, the lowest of the
recs, all of which were floated at 240p. But what signifies its low
valuation in City eyes is its prospective yield for the current year.
If Warburg is right in its prediction that the company will pay out 22p to
shareholders in 1993-94 the prospective yield is 4.9 per cent.
This, again, is among the highest of the recs, signifying the City's
relatively poor view of the company. On Warburg's analysis Norweb was
sitting on the top of the rec pile at noon yesterday, with its shares
trading at a prospective yield of 4.4 per cent.
In evaluating electricity shares investors are strongly influenced by their
perceptions of the managements and their strategies. One reason why Eastern
has climbed from the bottom of the heap is that it last year appointed Mr
John Devaney as chief executive.
Prior to his arrival there had been concern that Mr James Smith, now
chairman but then chief executive as well, was not doing enough to improve
the company's efficiency and the City felt staff numbers remained stubbornly
high.
Mr Devaney, whose previous job was in the US motor industry, is credited
with implementing significant job cuts and improved efficiencies in the past
year.
At East Midlands, Mr John Harris, chairman, is considered by some potential
investors to take too high a profile. While other rec chiefs kept their
heads down during the national debate over coal last year and this, Mr
Harris could often be seen on television putting forward the industry's
case.
The City prefers the quieter, more cautious approach of someone like Mr Ken
Harvey, chairman of Norweb. One analyst relates how he recently visited a
small institution for the first time in six years. 'Ken had been there the
week before. The personal touch can make all the difference.'
But however personable a company chief is, he has to have a convincing story
to sell if a round of City visits is to pay off. Here again, investors have
been sceptical about East Midlands' diversification into areas such as
electrical contracting.
They tend to prefer the stick-to-basics approach of Manweb, the only one of
the 12 recs that has not participated in joint ventures to set up combined
cycle gas generating plants.
Mr Simon Williams, electricity analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, says
Manweb's shares are among the most attractive in the sector because they
have the lowest risk strategy.
This, he says, is also reflected in its drive to improve efficiency. 'The
only way to consistently beat the regulator is to cut costs and Manweb has
consistently demonstrated it can do that.'
In the coming months controllable costs will come increasingly to the fore.
This year's interim results will be treated with relative caution by
investors who are wary of drawing too many conclusions from a half year
which contributes far less than half of annual profits.
The focus will be on how the company can present itself to the regulator as
he prepares his review of the companies' distribution businesses.
Distribution is where the recs make most of their money; if companies show
they have done as much as they can to make them efficient they may suffer
least in the review and, therefore, in their share price.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Merrett to scale back underwriting
activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrett Holdings yesterday outlined plans to radically scale back its
Lloyd's underwriting activities, focusing future operations on loss
adjusting and other insurance services businesses.
Merrett, chaired by Mr Stephen Merrett, the former deputy chairman of
Lloyd's of London, lost support from members' agents - which channel Names
to its syndicates - earlier this year. Plans by Travelers' Insurance, the US
company, to provide backing for the agency's biggest syndicates, 418 and
1067, collapsed earlier this month.
Mr Alan Cleary, group chief executive, said yesterday it was 'virtually
certain' that 418 and 1067 would not be underwriting in 1994 'as they have
not attracted sufficient capacity to enable them to go forward on a viable
basis.'
However, the blow to Names - the individuals whose assets support the market
 -and to Lloyd's itself, will be softened by a deal that Janson Green, a
rival managing agency, has negotiated with Mr Barnabas Hurst-Bannister,
418's existing underwriter. Mr Hurst-Bannister and 418's existing
underwriting team will insure at least some of its existing business.
Mr Peter Cowell, managing director of Janson Green, expects Mr
Hurst-Bannister's syndicate, which has a provisional number of 1215, to have
a stamp of about Pounds 60m in 1994, against Pounds 150m traded by syndicate
418 in 1993.
He said that Janson Green would endeavour to close 418's 1991, 1992 and 1993
years into the ongoing syndicate but was unable to say whether that would be
feasible.
Mr Cleary said Merrett had the 'expertise, systems and experience' to handle
the 'open' underwriting years 'in house'. Lloyd's said it would monitor the
run-off of both 418, whose 1985 and 1990 years were already 'open', and
1067. Merrett is negotiating the transfer four of its smaller syndicates -
179, 332, 1038 and 1184 - to other agencies.
Mr Cleary emphasised that the problems of Merrett's underwriting activities
had had no impact on other trading divisions.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis accounts change just a 'storm in
a teacup'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysalis, the music and media group, is to amend the treatment of one of
the companies in which it owns shares following discussions with the
Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog.
The company is to change the 1992 figures in its reserve notes for the
treatment of its associated undertaking in Metro Radio, in which it held an
18.7 per cent stake.
The accounts show that it wrote off Pounds 3.94m in goodwill against
reserves after purchasing 3.18m Metro shares for Pounds 4.99m.
However, it then revalued the investment to its original cost by an amount
equal to the write-off, which the panel ruled to be contrary to SSAP 1, the
accounting standard on associated companies.
The treatment was highlighted in the 1992 accounts, which stated it was 'not
in accordance with accounting standards'. No such statement had been made in
the 1991 accounts after the shares were first acquired.
Neither Stoy Hayward, the auditor in 1991, nor KPMG Peat Marwick, which
replaced it in 1992, had qualified the accounts to draw attention to the
treatment.
Mr Nigel Butterfield, group finance director, said: 'I would like to say
it's a storm in a teacup, but it's not much of a storm. It's irritating. We
wasted a lot of time and professional fees on it.'
The directors maintain that they are justified in showing the aggregate
value of their investment in Metro, and will achieve this by attributing the
fair value to the company's intangible assets - its radio licences.
They will also provide a more detailed explanation, and amend the reserves
to add back a Pounds 3.94m write-off to the profit and loss account reserve
and deduct it from the revaluation reserve.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: AAF sells US offshoot for Dollars 33m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AAF Industries, the mini-conglomerate which plunged into the red in its
first half, is to sell its US modular building subsidiary for a total of
Dollars 33.3m (Pounds 22.3m).
Mr Alex Brown, chief executive, said yesterday that the disposal 'takes a
lot of the pressure off and gives us a chance to look at the group afresh.'
No decision had yet been made on making further disposals.
On April 1 the company announced a 1-for-4 rights issue at 175p which was
97.6 per cent subscribed. It was followed by profits warnings in July and
September which sent the shares tumbling.
Last month AAF reported an interim loss of Pounds 11m compared with a profit
of Pounds 2.26m.
The deficit stemmed directly from expansion of its prefabricated building
manufacturing business, which it bought in 1989, into an on-site contractor.
The group warned that further costs of Pounds 7m would be incurred in the
second half because of the closure of the lossmaking division.
Yesterday the shares, which have traded as low as 19p, rose 11p to 49p.
The group has agreed to sell Diamond Engineered Space to GE Capital Modular
Space, a unit of General Electric of the US, for Dollars 27.3m cash and a
further Dollars 6m in consideration for the giving of a non-competition
covenant.
Ohio-based Diamond had a book value of some Dollars 30m at the end of
September. Last year it contributed Dollars 1.9m to profits on turnover of
Dollars 24m.
GE Capital will not be assuming Dollars 15.9m of Diamond's debt and
liabilities.
AAF said the net proceeds of the sale would be about Dollars 13.3m of which
Pounds 4.3m would be used to reduce debt to about Pounds 24m, leaving
gearing at between 110 per cent and 115 per cent.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Dorling shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santa has not been kind to Dorling Kindersley, the recently floated
publisher which impressed the stock market with the quality of its
illustrated reference books and futuristic multimedia products.
Its shares fell nearly 10 per cent yesterday after the publisher warned that
trading in the important pre-Christmas period had been disrupted by a
computer problem at its distributor, Tiptree Books, which is owned by Random
House, the US publishing group.
Mr Richard Harman, managing director, said he could not quantify the impact
of the problem, but a claim was being assessed by Arthur Andersen, the
accountants, and would be pursued against Tiptree.
Tiptree was named distributor of the year at the British Book Awards in
February, but difficulties started when it installed a new computer system
in July.
Mr Harman said the problems at Tiptree were continuing in spite of the
appointment of a new chief executive and round-the-clock working to clear
the backlog. Although the disruption had been spotted in August, it was
still affecting distribution to trade outlets and the DK Family Library,
which sells directly to homes, offices and schools.
Mr Harman said the UK represented only about 30 per cent of Dorling
Kindersley's sales. Although Christmas accounted for about 60 per cent of
sales, that was a lower weighting than other publishers, some of whom did 75
per cent of their business in the run-up to Christmas.
Mr Peter Kindersley, group chairman and chief executive, told yesterday's
annual meeting that it was too early to quantify the financial effect of the
problem. However, BZW, the house broker, reduced its forecast of pre-tax
profits for the year to June 30 from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 10m.
Dorling Kindersley's shares yesterday closed down 31p at 293p, still well
above last October's flotation price of 165p. Most of the City's excitement
has been generated by the link with Microsoft, the US computer software
group which has a 20 per cent stake in the UK company.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Expanding ANS rises to Pounds 1.26m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated Nursing Services, the nursing home operator, yesterday announced
interim pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 725,000 in the 28 weeks to October
10 1992 to Pounds 1.26m in the six months to September 30.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 7.23m) as the number of beds rose
to 1,374 (1,245). ANS said the identification and publication of best
practices across the company had helped reduce costs, improving operating
margins from 33 per cent to 36 per cent.
'We looked at best practice in all of our homes and put together a single
best practice document,' said Mr Tony Robinson, finance director.
Controlling the wage bill had been a significant element, according to Mr
Nick Dhandsa, chief executive.
He said: 'Overall, I am very confident about the future.' An interim
dividend of 0.5p (nil) is payable from earnings per share of 9p (6.6p).
Mr Dhandsa said that the Care in the Community Act, introduced in April, had
caused some delays to appraisals of potential residents, some of which had
been politically motivated.
Dudley in the West Midlands was the quickest, turning appraisals around
within 5 days, while Liverpool's authorities were the slowest, the company
said.
There was also confusion between local authorities and health authorities
over which were responsible for some elderly people's care.
Net interest charges fell to Pounds 545,000 (Pounds 914,000) as total
borrowings fell to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 17.1m).

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tring postpones planned flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tring International, the budget price compact disc company, said yesterday
that it had postponed its planned flotation because of the weakness of the
new issue market.
The flotation, which had been scheduled for next month, would now take place
in the first quarter of next year, the company said.
Tring said the decision was not the result of legal action it faced for
allegedly selling unauthorised recordings of Olivia Newton John, Cat
Stevens, Bob Marley and other artists. Record companies PolyGram, EMI
Records and MCA have served writs on Tring.
'The timetable has most definitely and categorically not changed because of
the litigation,' the company said.
Tring says the legal actions will not have a material effect on its profits,
which were Pounds 3.3m pre-tax last year. It adds that it always pays
royalties to the companies it believes hold the copyrights and withdraws
music from sale if complaints are made.
Tring announced last month that Mr Alan Wheatley, former chairman of venture
capital group 3i, had agreed to become chairman. Mr Wheatley has not yet
formally taken up the position, however, and is not yet a director of the
company. It is understood that he will make a decision on whether to become
chairman of Tring at the time of flotation, depending on his other
commitments.
Mr Tony Morris, a former vice president of PolyGram International, has
already taken up his position as Tring's deputy chairman.
Tring said that sales in October had been at a record level and it appeared
that November had also been a successful month. There was no pressure on it
to go for a quick flotation. 'We're a very successful company with masses of
cash. There's no need to raise cash to pay off huge debts.'

<TEXT>
Tops Estates, the shop and office property company, yesterday announced a 30
per cent rise in rental income from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 6.84m for the six
months to September 30, but saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 918,000 to
Pounds 825,000, writes David Blackwell.
The group, which is lifting the interim dividend by 5 per cent from 0.5775p
to 0.6064p, lifted earnings per share from 1.33p to 1.41p. However, the
earnings increase reflected a lower tax charge of Pounds 175,000, down from
a previous Pounds 305,000.
Mr Everard Goodman, chairman, said the six months had been 'a progressive
period' for the group, which would continue to grow. He described the
consistent rise in consumer spending as encouraging.
Net interest charges rose from Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 5.16m. Mr Goodman said
high interest borrowings of Pounds 16m would be repaid next May 'removing
this short-term burden.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Evening Post at Pounds 3.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An 80 per cent higher contribution from its newspaper and printing
activities helped the Bristol Evening Post lift pre-tax profits by 17 per
cent to Pounds 3.1m in the 26 weeks to September 30.
The regional newspapers and retailing group had been stalked until May by Mr
David Sullivan, publisher of the Sunday Sport and Daily Sport, who was keen
to move into mainstream newspapers.
Mr Stanley Clarke, chairman, said the possible imposition of VAT on
newspaper cover prices made it difficult to comment on the prospects for the
second half of the year.
Group turnover declined by almost 3 per cent to Pounds 30.1m, with the
contribution from newspapers and printing down at Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 17m)
and from retail activities down 5 per cent at Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 12.9m).
The latter was mainly due to 'an acceleration of the disposal of kiosk
shops'.
Profits from newspapers and printing grew to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 731,000),
though Mr Clarke said that the circulations of the two main newspapers - the
Bristol Evening Post and the Western Daily Press - remained depressed. The
kiosks reorganisation led to the retailing side making less at Pounds
215,000 (Pounds 288,000). Features agencies and film production was flat at
Pounds 47,000, while transport and vehicle repair lifted profits to Pounds
249,000 (Pounds 202,000).
The group offset the increased reorganisation costs of Pounds 342,000
(Pounds 244,000) by profits from the sale of further Reuters shares which
accrued Pounds 371,000 (Pounds 276,000).
Earnings advanced to 8.47p (7.27p) per share and the interim dividend is
lifted to 4.25p (4p).

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Institutions back Ferranti board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both sides in the increasingly bitter battle over the future of Ferranti
International, the defence electronics group, have begun marshalling their
supporters ahead of next week's offer deadline.
As expected, institutional investors are falling in behind the board, which
is backing a 1p a share rescue bid from GEC.
According to Ferranti, institutions controlling 28.6 per cent of the group's
936m ordinary shares and 20.6 per cent of its 79m special shares have said
that, in the absence of a higher bid, they will accept the GEC offer.
The institutions backing the bid include the three biggest shareholders,
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management with about 10.4 per cent, Guardian Royal
Exchange with 4.76 per cent and Prudential Portfolio Managers with 3.9 per
cent. Other supporters include Electra Investment Trust and Co-op Insurance
Society.
Ferranti's 100 largest shareholders control 60 per cent of its equity and
the next 8,000 speak for a further 30 per cent. The final 10 per cent is in
the hands of about 40,000 individuals.
GEC has said its will not proceed with the bid unless it receives
acceptances covering least 90 per cent of the outstanding equity.
If the bid fails, Mr Eugene Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, has warned that
the group's banks will call in the receivers.
Shareholders opposed to the Pounds 11.4m offer, which they have described as
'derisory', have formed the Ferranti Shareholders Support Association,
chaired by Mr John Katz.
The association, which claims a membership of some 230 shareholders speaking
for more than 22m shares, said it had received letters and phone calls from
more than 1,000 shareholders expressing opposition. It expects to speak for
35.5m shares by December 8, the closing date for acceptances.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace yesterday confirmed its intention to continue its regional
jet operations and seek another international alliance for that business
even if it were forced to abandon its proposed joint venture with Taiwan
Aerospace.
Although BAe has continued negotiations with Taiwan, the future of the joint
venture remains in serious doubt.
The company yesterday sought to reassure its regional jet workforce, based
at Woodford, near Manchester, that it would maintain the business should the
Taiwan negotiations break down.
Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, confirmed the company's 'ongoing support'
for the business in a message to employees. He added that the strategy of
establishing an international partnership 'will continue to be pursued'.
BAe is believed to have had contacts with other possible partners. However,
it believes it can now keep its restructured regional jet business going on
its own while it seeks an international alliance.

Dalgety, the food and agricultural supplies group, yesterday took its plans
to become a leader in European petfood a stage further by buying Paragon
Petcare from British Petroleum for Pounds 42m cash.
Paragon, which earned a Pounds 3m operating profit on sales of Pounds 103m
last year, is among the last remaining businesses sold by BP's nutrition
division, which the oil company put on the market last year.
Dalgety says the deal will give it continental sales of more than Pounds
100m annually and 12 per cent of the European petfood market by volume. That
would be ahead of Nestle of Switzerland and close to Quaker Oats of the US,
which holds second position to Mars, also of the US.
Dalgety's petfood sales have grown rapidly since the mid-1980s to about
Pounds 225m annually. About 80 per cent are in the UK, where Dalgety's
Spillers subsidiary is the second largest producer after Mars, with about 20
per cent by value of the Pounds 1.2bn market.
As well as raising Dalgety's UK market share to about 24 per cent, the deal
will give the group manufacturing capacity, a bigger customer base and new
distribution channels on the Continent, where Paragon had sales of Pounds
61m last year.
Mr John Martyn, Dalgety's finance director, said: 'We see petfood as a
European business, and this is a very significant step in our expansion.'
Though recession has recently dampened European markets, he expected growth
on the Continent to outstrip the UK in the medium term.
Paragon, which employs 850 people, has plants in France, Germany and the
Netherlands, as well as in Britain, and is particularly strong in sales to
petshops. Its main brands are Beta in the UK and Doko and Dokat on the
Continent. About half of its business is private-label production.
Most of Dalgety's continental sales are to supermarkets and are supplied by
exports from the UK. The group's main continental petfood operation is
Hopermann, a German distribution company acquired four years ago. However,
Hopermann's efforts to launch Dalgety brands, such as Prime and Bonio, on
the Continent have made little headway, and the group has less than 1 per
cent of the German market.
Paragon's financial performance this year is expected to be similar to last
year's. Mr Martyn said Dalgety's aim was to quickly increase the business's
margins much closer to the 8-9 per cent return on sales earned by Spillers.
Dalgety would be looking closely at ways to eliminate duplication between
the two businesses. Paragon's four British plants are believed to be much
less efficient than Dalgety's four UK factories, in which the group has
invested heavily in recent years.
Dalgety is thought to be interested in making further continental
acquisitions and is believed recently to have held talks with Nestle, which
holds small shares of six European petfood markets.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Carlton takes its cue for the super league: Raymond Snoddy
examines the first of the big ITV takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consolidation of the ITV network followed the expected script to the
letter yesterday as Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications made an agreed
bid for Central Independent Television valuing the company at Pounds 758m.
Mr Green, who bought a 20 per cent stake in Central for Pounds 29.5m in 1987
from Ladbroke Group, pounced less than a week after Mr Peter Brooke,
national heritage secretary, proposed changes that will allow one company to
own two large ITV licences.
The deal - subject to parliamentary approval of the rule change - will make
Carlton by far the largest ITV company, broadcasting to 20m people and
accounting for about 30 per cent of the ITV advertising market.
If the rest of the script runs to form, Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive
of Granada Group, and Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, the dominant
shareholder in Meridian Broadcasting, could soon join Mr Green as power
brokers of the ITV network.
Granada, which owns 20 per cent of LWT, is expected to make a - probably
hostile - bid for the rest of the London Weekend station. Lord Hollick's
likely targets are Anglia Television or HTV.
Three super-ITV companies would then control more than 70 per cent of ITV's
Pounds 1.5bn-plus advertising revenues. With this would come the power to
take decisions, which at present lies with an unwieldy 14-company structure.
Talks between Carlton and Central began on Wednesday, the day the proposed
rule change was announced. Central was still planning to bid for Anglia but
on Thursday decided to put it on ice to see whether a deal could be done
with Carlton. Negotiations continued over the weekend and the Central board
agreed the deal late on Sunday.
The deal values Central's shares at Pounds 26 each - two years ago they were
less than Pounds 7. It comprises Pounds 204m cash, Carlton shares and
Carlton preference shares.
Carlton accompanied the takeover news with preliminary results for the year
to September, showing a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
126.1m on turnover up 56 per cent to Pounds 1.09bn. Earnings per share rose
from 33.4p to 42p, and a final dividend of 11.3p makes a total of 18.7p, up
10 per cent. Carlton Television - nine months after going on air in London -
made a Pounds 14.6m contribution to profits.
Ten years ago Mr Green reversed the unknown Carlton into the Fleet Street
Newsletter to produce a company capitalised at Pounds 10m. The newly
enlarged Carlton would be capitalised at more than Pounds 2bn.
Yesterday Mr Green, shoes kicked off, chomping contentedly on a cigar,
expressed exasperation at Labour MPs who condemned him for jumping the
legislative gun. He suggested the agreed bid was a model, with commitments
to regional production underlined and plans for more programme production.
'In television English is the international production language,' said Mr
Green, who is looking at the possibility of following BBC World Service
Television into international markets, particularly in Asia. He is also
chairman of Independent Television News, in which Carlton has an 18 per cent
stake.
'We now have a platform to go all over the world,' he said, promising an
increase in programme production in Central's Nottingham studios. The two
companies are complementary in that Carlton is a publisher-broadcaster
commissioning most of its programmes from independent producers, while
Central makes a significant proportion of programmes in house.
However, savings will have to made to protect earnings. First signs are that
the target will be to take Pounds 10m a year out of costs which could mean
job losses, mainly in administration.
Mr Leslie Hill, Central's chairman and chief executive, will continue to
lead it as a separately run subsidiary and will join the Carlton board.
Yesterday he said that the proposed deal - for which Carlton already has
acceptances representing 39 per cent of the equity - meant an end of
uncertainty for Central. 'We can go on and build the business without
looking over our shoulder all the time.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / Queens Moat deal is months away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses may need until April next year to finalise details of a
Pounds 1.3bn refinancing agreement with its 65 banks, Mr Stanely Metcalfe,
chairman, told shareholders yesterday.
He told a packed, and sometimes angry, annual meeting that the group hoped
to persuade banks to extend the standstill agreement which is due to expire
at the end of January. Earlier, the company had hoped to have an agreement
by then.
Only after agreement has been reached with the banks can a restructuring
plan for the hotel group's debt be put to shareholders. If that is approved
the shares would then be relisted.
On a show of hands shareholders voted against adopting the annual report.
However, on a poll the resolution was carried by 356.7m to 52.5m.
Some shareholders attacked the new board, which has replaced former
directors who have all resigned since the group's shares were suspended on
March 31. Some supported the previous management, although others attacked
them. One said he now realised 'my money has been moved about by a load of
Essex cowboys'.
Argument centred on the group's valuations of its hotels. Two firms of
surveyors had put widely different values on the assets. Weatherall Green &amp;
Smith had valued the hotels at Pounds 1.35bn in May, after a draft valuation
had shown a figure of Pounds 1.86bn. Jones Lang Wootton was then appointed
to revalue the hotels and came up with a figure of Pounds 861m, which had
been incorporated in the 1992 accounts.
Mr Metcalfe said that it was the previous board under Mr John Bairstow, the
former chairman, which had appointed JLW. After the meeting Mr Bairstow said
that appointment had been made because the board thought the WG&amp;S valuation
was too low.
Mr Bairstow admitted he carried most responsibility for the mess the company
was in. While praising the new directors, some of whom he had appointed, he
said the new board did not have sufficient property expertise and was
'shooting itself in the foot' over the valuations.
Mr Metcalfe repeatedly told shareholders that the company could only
continue trading with the banks' support. He said the group was not paying
interest on Pounds 800m of its Pounds 1.3bn debt. Cashflow was too low to
sustain the company without 'a significant reduction' in debt and a further
'significant' amount becoming non-interest bearing. He could give no
indication of the size of the debt-for-equity swap being negotiated and thus
the dilution of shareholders.
After the meeting Mr Michael Harkavy, one of the leaders of the shareholders
action group, said there could be a way of avoiding a debt-for-equity swap
on the scale he believed was being contemplated.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Australian securities industry votes against super shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fund managers and members of Australia's securities industry are strongly
opposed to the introduction of shares with 'super voting rights', according
to a poll conducted by the Securities Institute of Australia.
In a submission to the Australian Stock Exchange, which is canvassing
opinion, the Securities Institute of Australia said a poll of members
delivered 'a resounding 92 per cent vote against such shares'.
The results of the poll are a further blow to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation which in September announced plans for an issue of shares with
enhanced voting rights. Critics fear such schemes would be used by
managements to entrench their positions. The company has yet to issue formal
details.
The SIA represents individuals working in the securities industry, and
members come from banking, insurance, stockbroking and other professions.
Significantly, stockbroking members voted 91 per cent in favour of the
existing 'one share, one vote' principle, the SIA said.
Meanwhile, the Australian Investment Managers Group, which speaks for most
of the major fund management businesses, said that the 'one share, one vote'
principle had worked well and that 'any move to bring in another regime,
whose only purpose can be to allow a minority investor to have effective
control in perpetuity, will have adverse implications for the integrity of
the Australian capital markets'.
Earlier this month News Corp toned down key features of its proposed super
share issue. The media company said it would place a 'cap' of 40 per cent on
the aggregate number of votes which could be exercised by the holders of the
super shares.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Pearse to hand over reins at Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, is to retire in March and
be succeeded by Mr Keith Whitson, in changes to the Midland board that
strengthen HSBC Holding's grip on the UK clearing bank it acquired last
year.
At the same time, Sir William Purves, chairman of the HSBC group, is to take
over from Sir Peter Walters, whose impending departure as chairman of
Midland was announced earlier this year.
Sir Peter is becoming chairman of SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals
group.
It had been widely expected within Midland that Mr Pearse, 60, would succeed
Sir Peter as the bank's chairman.
Mr Pearse refused to comment on whether he was disappointed at leaving
Midland, though he said he had achieved what he 'set out to do' when he
joined the group from Barclays in 1991.
'I think there could be an advantage (in Sir William's becoming chairman)',
Mr Pearse said.
'It will help to knit the two cultures of the bank even closer together.'
However, he added: 'I don't feel 60.'
Although Midland's after-tax profits were wiped out in 1990 and 1991 by
losses on loans to UK companies and consumers, its more recent performance
has been much improved.
In August it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 385m in the first six
months, against Pounds 60m in the same period last year.
HSBC said it was standard practice within the group for the chairman of the
group to chair subsidiaries - Sir William already chairs, for example, the
British Bank of the Middle East.
Mr Whitson, aged 50, has been deputy chief executive of Midland since 1991
and has worked for HSBC for more than 30 years. He said yesterday that he
saw his task as maintaining the progress that had been made since the
acquisition, and in continuing the emphasis on customer service.
As chief executive of Hongkong Bank's operations in the UK from 1987 to
1989, Mr Whitson worked closely with senior Midland executives, after HSBC
acquired its first stake in the clearing bank in late 1987.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Banks to investigate Euro Disney finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney's bank lenders plan to commission a special investigative audit
of the troubled leisure group's finances to prepare for negotiations leading
to an emergency financial restructuring.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, presented its assessment of the company's finances this month to the
60 international banks within the lending syndicate. The banks now want to
appoint their own team of investigative auditors.
'It's not that we have any doubts about the accuracy of Disney's figures,'
said one senior banker in the syndicate. 'But the condition of Euro Disney
has changed so dramatically since we first negotiated our loans (in the late
1980s) that we need to have our own numbers.'
The team is expected to be named in Paris this week. The banks hope the
audit will be completed before Christmas so they can start intensive
discussions early next year with Euro Disney and its US parent.
Euro Disney desperately needs to restructure its finances. It has been badly
affected by the European recession and recently announced a net loss of
FFr5.3bn (Pounds 606m) for the year to September 3. There are fears that the
group could face a cash crisis early next year, but Walt Disney has agreed
to support it financially until March 31.
The Disney camp hopes to persuade the banks to exchange roughly half their
FFr20.3bn net debt for equity, as part of the restructuring package which
could also involve a rights issue.
The final composition of the package, however, will be influenced by the
value of Euro Disney's shares, which has fallen steeply in recent weeks. The
price recovered yesterday from FFr30.90 to finish at FFr31.75.
The banks, which include Credit Agricole, Dresdner Bank, Credit Suisse, Bank
of Tokyo and Midland Bank, are now close to forming a single steering
committee to co-ordinate negotiations with the Disney camp.
At present the banks are divided into two main groups. One syndicate, led by
Banque Nationale de Paris, represents the 39 institutions that helped to
finance the construction of the EuroDisneyland theme park.
The second syndicate, with Banque Indosuez at its head, includes the 30
banks that provided capital for Euro Disney hotels. Some banks, notably
Citibank and Deutsche Bank, are members of both groups. But the banks are
believed to have agreed in principle to create a single steering committee,
to be led by either BNP or Indosuez.

FT  30 NOV 93 / VW links with Wales in project to transform car assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small North Wales company is partnering Volkswagen in developing a process
that could transform the way cars are assembled.
Germany's largest vehicle maker is considering progressively scrapping spot
welding as a way of joining car body panels in favour of a self-piercing
riveting process. The system, which will be used to build the group's
aluminium-bodied Audi car for launch next year, has been developed with
Henrob, a company which employs 34 people.
The project has been kept secret for nearly four years and is now covered by
patents held jointly by Audi and Henrob. 'We're just glad that Audi are at
last letting us talk about it,' said Mr Keith Jones, managing director and
majority shareholder of the privately owned Henrob.
Under a confidentiality agreement, Henrob would have been required to pay a
DM1m (Pounds 390,000) penalty to Audi for any breach of confidence that
prejudiced the DM1.1bn aluminium car project.
Self-piercing riveting as a technology for joining sheet materials is around
30 years old and Henrob acquired the rights to the basic processes 12 years
ago. But the bulk and inflexibility of the plant and equipment, and the
corrosion risks associated with the way the system then worked, severely
restricted its application. It has been largely ignored by the motor
industry.
However, the process and equipment developed by Henrob and VW produces
joints 30 per cent stronger than spot welds and virtually eliminates the
corrosion risk, according to Mr Klaus Gugisch, Audi's manufacturing planning
director. 'Another advantage is that it requires a lot less energy than spot
welding,' he said.
Crucially, the two companies say it is as fast and flexible as the robotic
multiwelders now used to assemble conventional steel car body shells and
requires less electrical energy than spot welding.
The new Audi, to be called the 300, will have 68 per cent of its body joints
made with the riveting process.

FT  30 NOV 93 / France and UK split over airlines crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France and the UK will today set out widely opposing views on how the
European Union should respond to the financial crisis in Europe's airlines.
Paris will call for capacity-sharing and an EU-backed plan to reduce
capacity, while London will insist on an end to state aid.
Both members are expected to present papers at a ministerial debate in
Brussels preparing the ground for a report due in January on the future of
the airline industry.
As losses among Europe's flag carriers grow, pressure is increasing to roll
back some of the deregulation measures put in place over the past seven
years.
The European Commission is firmly opposing any return to the old cartel
structure of European air transport, with carriers colluding on setting
fares and sharing passenger loads. But Brussels still has to adjudicate on a
queue of member government requests to inject finance into national
airlines, including Air France.
The French paper says Europe is in danger of losing control of the industry
in 'a downward spiral of lower fares and ever-increasing losses' - over
Ecu3.5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) on international business alone in the past three
years.
European carriers have seen their share of international air traffic fall
from 38.8 per cent in 1972 to 32.2 per cent last year. The number of flights
using French airports increased by 54 per cent in 1987-92, but passenger
numbers rose by only 33 per cent. The percentage of total capacity filled by
airlines - the load factors - fell from 64 to 57 per cent in the same
period, the French paper says, 'substantially below break-even level'.
Paris therefore wants immediate moves to allow more capacity-sharing between
airlines and a freeze on all air traffic fees. In the short term, France is
seeking an EU-wide crisis plan to speed up the pace at which older aircraft
are taken out of service.
France calls for a better balance between competition rules and the
long-term objective of creating a 'powerful and prosperous air transport
industry'.
The UK paper, by contrast, points to the return to profit of airlines in
countries with more liberalised markets - Lufthansa in Germany and KLM in
the Netherlands - arguing for effective management rather than protectionist
measures.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Railtrack delays pricing after row with Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack, the company which will run Britain's rail infrastructure from
next April, has delayed announcing its prices because of a dispute with the
Treasury.
The company believes the value of its assets, set at around Pounds 7bn by
British Rail, is no more than Pounds 5bn and could be as little as Pounds
3bn.
The dispute has prompted Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel and
head of the government's private finance working group, to offer his
services as an arbitrator between the two sides.
A downward revaluation of Railtrack's assets would enable the company to set
lower prices for the use of its track. It believes lower charges would
encourage more private operators and BR management buy-outs to bid for
franchises under the government's rail privatisation initiative.
But in spite of backing by the Department of Transport, which would like
Railtrack to announce its pricing as soon as possible, the Treasury has
refused to countenance revaluation of the assets.
The Treasury believes that on a replacement cost basis the track is worth at
least Pounds 7bn. Furthermore, it argues that higher prices for private
operators to use railway lines would be offset by government subsidies.
Private sector train operators have warned that if charges are too high they
will be unable to offer a competitive service. Many fear that subsidies
could be clawed back in the future by the Treasury.
Railtrack is also in dispute with the Treasury over the rate of return the
company should earn from the government's investment. The Treasury is
adamant that Railtrack's rate of return should be set at 8 per cent, while
the company is arguing that 5 per cent would be more appropriate.
The differences between the two sides are worth hundreds of millions of
pounds to Railtrack. Eight per cent of assets valued at Pounds 7bn is Pounds
560m compared with Pounds 250m on a 5 per cent return from assets which are
valued at Pounds 5bn.
Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, is expected to continue to argue that he
should have greater freedom from the financial limits that apply to
nationalised industries. He is not expected to announce the company's
pricing structure until the new year.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: HSBC Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the Bank of England which brought in Sir Peter Walters and Mr Brian
Pearse to sort out Midland Bank long before HSBC's successful bid. Now that
the job is done, a natural break seems in order. That, rather than
disagreement, seems to be behind yesterday's announcement that the two men
are moving on. Set against expectations that Mr Pearse would eventually
assume the chairmanship of Midland, though, the news re-inforces the
impression that HSBC is tightening its grip on its new acquisition. The
market will thus be alert for any shift - more probably of emphasis rather
than direction - in strategy.
One issue relates to the loan market, where Midland has become noticeably
more aggressive. It admits to concern over the fall in margins on large UK
corporate loans. How far it is prepared in practice to restrain its lending
as competition for business increases is another matter. Then there is the
question of the speed with which HSBC's sophisticated retail technology can
be adapted to the UK market.
Getting the answers right requires local experience of the type HSBC is
forfeiting with the departure of Mr Pearse. Admittedly, a group with such a
far-flung empire always has to wrestle with the question of how
decentralised control should become. The latest message from Midland is that
its parent knows best.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent fall in the oil price must be making a few eyes water in the
Lasmo boardroom. Even though oil prices have averaged Dollars 17 a barrel
this year, Lasmo is likely to lose money in 1993. This is despite Pounds
426m of exceptional items, including asset write downs, which the company
took in respect of last year.
In part, the unprofitability arises because the carrying value of some
assets is still too high for current market conditions. Excluding
depreciation, the cash flow position does look more healthy. That argues for
a further write down, but Lasmo's balance sheet is already 70 per cent
geared, so institutions and banks may bridle at a further sharp rise. The
company's debt is also predominantly in dollars, and further falls in
sterling would raise gearing too.
Aside from accounting issues, Lasmo may have to conserve cash if the oil
price continues below Dollars 15. The remains of the dividend must be under
threat, and the capital expenditure programme may be curbed even though that
threatens future development. The alternative of combining a capital
injection with a passed dividend would be difficult to sell to shareholders.
A bid for Lasmo's assets also seems unlikely while prospects are so
uncertain and estimates of its asset value differ so markedly. Lasmo will
have to hope that its US shareholders, who seem unconcerned about dividends,
are in for the long haul.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The downward slide of the Nikkei average should not send a shudder through
the world's financial markets just yet. While previous bouts of weakness
have tempered the enthusiasm of Japanese investors for foreign stocks and
bonds, the overall pattern of buying has remained intact. True, Japan
recorded a rare long-term capital account surplus in 1991 after the bubble
economy burst. But a sharp decline in direct investment abroad by Japanese
companies - and heavy buying of Tokyo equities by US and European
institutions - were to blame. Japanese portfolio investors remained net
buyers of overseas assets even as the Nikkei fell below 15,000 last year.
With four months to go before their financial year-end, Japanese
institutions have little immediate need to take overseas profits to cover
book losses at home. Low interest rates have anyway diminished the
attractions of yen bonds or deposits. The recent weakness of the yen is an
additional incentive to hold foreign currency assets. The exchange rate
might also serve as evidence that Japanese investors are not preparing to
take capital home. Even though the currency market remains preoccupied with
other factors - notably the grim economic outlook in Japan - widespread
portfolio selling might be expected to nudge the yen higher.
Still, experience suggests that a tumbling domestic equity market and
economic uncertainty at home will cause bullish Japanese investors to pull
in their horns. European bond markets which have thrived on Japanese
interest so far this year may have to learn to live without.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Carlton opens the box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With Mr Peter Brooke still fumbling to load the starting gun for the ITV
takeover race, Carlton Communications has leapt out of the blocks by making
a Pounds 624m conditional offer for Central. If the bid proceeds, Carlton
will emerge as the dominant force in UK commercial television, commanding 30
per cent of ITV advertising revenue and with further shareholdings in ITN,
GMTV and Meridian.
But Carlton is paying a fat price for the privilege, forking out the
equivalent of 25 times Central's forecast earnings for the shares it does
not already own. The talk of resultant cost savings is also worryingly
vague. Central is leanly run and has recently reduced its staff from 2,050
to 840. But it is probably fair to take Mr Michael Green's assurances about
non-dilution on trust, given his ability to leaf freely through Central's
management accounts as a non-executive director. Carlton can certainly
channel more production through Central's loss-making Nottingham studios and
rationalise some overheads.
Moreover, Carlton's balance sheet will not be unduly strained by the move.
Indeed, with post-acquisition gearing of just 30 per cent, Carlton will
remain strongly placed for further expansion if the ITV rules are again
relaxed. That would further improve the quality of Carlton's earnings,
supporting the case for a stock market re-rating.
There remains a slim threat that either parliament, the MMC or a rich
foreign bidder could stymie Carlton's plans. The serious longer-term worry
is whether the combined group's management will prove volatile, given both
companies' strongly independent cultures. But such traditions could also
hinder the emergence of a powerful rival, creating resistance to any suit by
Granada for LWT. The sector's first hostile bid may yet result.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Levitt's law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The message sent by the outcome of the Roger Levitt case is unpalatable: one
law for white collar criminals and another for the rest of us. More than 40
per cent of people found guilty of theft of less than Pounds 200 are sent to
prison. Mr Levitt, whose financial services company traded fraudulently,
leaving debts of Pounds 34m and many investors with serious losses, walked
from court with a sentence of 180 hours community service.
The case represents another low point for the Serious Fraud Office. Just 18
months ago, following the collapse of the second Guinness prosecution and
the failure of the year-long Blue Arrow fraud trial, the SFO was in the dock
for throwing the book at defendants and presenting prosecution cases of such
size that the process became unmanageable. Now it appears to have swung to
the opposite extreme, allowing a white collar criminal to escape trial on
charges of forgery and false accounting as a result of a botched plea
bargain.
What went wrong? The SFO says sentencing is a matter for the judge alone. It
admits that it knew Mr Levitt would not go to jail when it accepted his plea
in return for dropping the other charges, but felt it could not then back
out. The judge, Mr Justice Laws, felt a non-custodial sentence was
'commensurate' with the offence to which he had pleaded guilty.
In reality however the case had begun to go wrong months before when,
because of its size, the judge ordered it to be split in two. After the SFO
had decided to proceed with the fraudulent trading charges, the judge later
ruled much of the prosecution evidence of Mr Levitt's alleged deception of
investors inadmissible in the first trial. The SFO appears then to have
panicked. Faced with the prospect of a three-month trial in which Mr
Levitt's lawyers would be able to put up a defence telling only part of the
story, which it could not refute, the SFO decided to offer him a deal. Mr
Levitt held out for a guarantee that he would not go to jail. When the SFO's
worst fears were realised in the first days of the trial, he got his wish.
Three steps need to be taken to avoid another such case. First, the SFO does
not appear to have learnt the lessons of Blue Arrow. In spite of reducing
the charges against Mr Levitt from more than 60 to 22 the judge still
regarded the prosecution case as too cumbersome to be handled in one trial.
The SFO must concentrate on a limited number of good counts, so bringing the
case down to a manageable size.
Second, the case underlines the need for any system of plea bargaining to be
open and formal, allowing the judge to take into account the wider picture
when deciding sentence. Plea bargaining can save a lot of public money. It
should be encouraged, provided an appropriate sentence results. The Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice recommended it. But the government has not
found space for the idea in the criminal justice bill. If further study is
needed, money should be made available at once.
Finally, judges need to come up with a consistent approach to fraud. The
contrast between the sentences passed in the first Guinness trial for an
arguably victimless crime and the result in this case is an unhappy one. The
Lord Chief Justice should take the lead.

Elizabeth Symons is that unusual creature, a popular civil servant. Well,
popular enough to be re-elected general secretary of the First Division

Symons, aged 42, has sometimes seemed a voice in a veritable wilderness,
speaking out for an independent, impartial civil service in an era of
privatisation, market testing and greater competition for Whitehall's top
jobs.
An effective television performer, she has defended the values of the
independent British public service. Her 10,700 members are clearly grateful;
normally they are unable to defend themselves in public, a galling situation
when daft political decisions not of their taking are pinned on to them.
Her re-election should also ensure the continuation of a little brightness
at the Trades Union Congress. The printers' Brenda Dean and the university
lecturers' Diana Warwick have gone; Symons is now the sole remaining female
general secretary on the ruling general council.

The Institute of Directors, the talking shop for Britain's boardrooms, is
running short of directors. Director-general Peter Morgan bows out next
year, and his deputy, John Nicholas, is waving goodbye today after eight
years on the job.
Although Nicholas's departure from the free-market pressure group is being
described as a 'management restructuring', he appears to have been just
another casualty of the recession.
Faced with a drop in membership from 35,000 to 33,000 over the past couple
of years, the IoD has cut its staff by 10 per cent and frozen its annual
fees at Pounds 160 for next year.
However, the IoD's management has yet to get to grips with its biggest cost
centre - its opulent headquarters in Pall Mall, gobbling up a large part of
the organisation's Pounds 12m a year running costs.
Will Morgan's successor have the stomach to close it down, or at least
relocate it to a cheaper end of town?

Never accuse Carlton Communications' boss Michael Green of not covering all
his bases.
Just three days before he launched his bid for Central, which will give the
combined TV group more than a fifth of total UK advertising revenues, he
recruited a new non-executive director - Sir Sydney Lipworth, former
chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The quietly efficient Lipworth should be able to see off any self-important
official who starts asking impertinent questions about absence of
competition.

Roger Levitt, famously bankrupt financial adviser, didn't have such a bad
weekend after all.
On Friday he avoided a jail sentence despite pleading guilty to fraudulent
trading. Then on Saturday he watched Arsenal Football Club win a
close-fought battle - two goals to one - against Newcastle United at
Arsenal's London home turf, Highbury.
At the match Levitt occupied a familiar spot, a private box. In his glory
days, when Pounds 34m losses were but a distant speck on the horizon, he had
a box of his own.
Now Levitt must make do with one belonging to his friend Panos Eliades, an
accountant and financial backer of heavyweight boxer Lennox Lewis - another
interest they share, since Lewis was promoted by Levitt before he ran into
his sticky patch.
The lack of his own box did not perturb Levitt. Chomping on a foot-long
cigar, he remarked: 'Arsenal haven't played better for months,' an
assessment no doubt bolstered by his own easier breathing.
Still, however chuffed, Levitt chose not to sport his own rather special
Arsenal shirt. When his cash was in greater supply he is thought to have
paid Pounds 4,000 for the Gunners' shirt worn by Michael Thomas when Thomas
scored the winning championship goal against Liverpool for Arsenal four
years ago.
Arsenal's detractors, peeved at the club's success, refer to it as Lucky
Arsenal; but where would we all be but for a bit of luck?

FT  30 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Frank talk, Mr Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Franco-German summit, due to start today, is not just another routine
event. It is also an opportunity for frank, private talk about the European
Union's role in the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. With
the deadline two weeks away, this may be the final chance.
Last week, Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, agreed with the British prime
minister that failure of the round would be 'intolerable'. He will need to
transmit this understanding to the French leaders. Public denunciations
would be counter-productive. But this should not prevent a quiet proffering
of both a carrot and a stick.
First, though, must come appreciation of the position. It is in the
interests neither of the European Union nor of any single member to see the
round fail. It would be still more ruinous if that failure were to be caused
by the recalcitrance of the EU. Maddest of all would be failure over
agriculture. Even in France, agriculture employs only 6 per cent of the
population and generates 3 per cent of gross domestic product. This French
neurosis does not show appreciation of the country's long-term economic
interests.
Should the round fail over the issue, the European Union would confront
three crises. The first would be over the credibility of its desire to act
as a positive force on the world stage. The second would be in transatlantic
relations. The last and deepest would be over Europe's place in the world.
If the round were to founder, to what role, other than a marginal one, could
the EU aspire? The US has alternatives, notably its close relationship with
the world's most economically dynamic region, as this month's meeting on
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) in Seattle indicated. Is the EU to
focus its efforts on increased trade with a bankrupt Russia, a troubled
eastern Europe and the mostly stagnant members of the Lome convention?
Both the European Union and France must remove themselves from the hook on
which they are impaled. This can be done by accelerating the EU's move
towards world prices for agricultural commodities and simultaneously
increasing compensation to farmers. The latter would be particularly
important if - as the French fear, but the European Commission denies - the
Blair House accord were to prove more restrictive than the EU's agreed
reforms of its common agricultural policy.
In addition, the French should be assured of strong support where their case
is rather stronger, as it is over audiovisual services and, above all, over
the obstacles being created by the US. The EU needs to go on the offensive.
It can readily do so. The US is vulnerable over its miserly attitude to
liberalisation of trade in textiles, over its last-minute amendments to
rules governing anti-dumping and services and, first and foremost, over its
desire to play fast and loose with multilateralism itself.
The Germans are right not to hector the French in public, but they must play
the frank friend in private. France needs to understand that it cannot
exercise a veto that it does not, in fact, possess. This is the stick.
Assistance with the resultant political problems is the carrot. In the end,
however, it is up to French politicians to persuade their people of the
evident truth that clinging to an agricultural past will not give them a
better future.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Silent enemy stalks the aisles: Neil Buckley scours the
retailing horizon as warehouse clubs arrive in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is being called the most important development in UK retailing since the
arrival of the supermarket in the 1950s. In Thurrock, Essex, US company
Costco today opens its doors as Europe's first US-style warehouse club.
With six more clubs scheduled to open in the next few months, UK retailers
are getting distinctly nervous. The three biggest superstore chains recently
waged a costly - and ultimately doomed - legal battle to try to stop Costco
opening, while another national chain has warned suppliers it may stop
buying from them if they supply the clubs.
The retailers' anxiety is understandable. In the US these huge sheds, which
stock goods at ultra-low prices for sale to business and individual members
 -in practice, almost anybody in steady employment - have been nicknamed the
'silent enemy' because of the insidious but devastating impact they have had
on more traditional shops. In the UK, while their market share may be
limited, they are expected to force many other retail chains to lower their
prices, and persuade some of them to change their entire style of operating.
'I think it is right to talk about a new epoch in UK retailing,' says Mr
Paul Morris, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
His prediction is based on research in the US, where in 10 years, warehouse
clubs have taken retailing by storm. Their numbers have increased from 21 in
1983 to an expected 750 by the end of this year, and their sales from barely
Dollars 1bn to about Dollars 40bn, although their growth has slowed in the
past two years - one reason why club operators are looking towards Europe.
While US supermarkets usually trade at a gross profit margin of about 25 per
cent, warehouse clubs cut that to 10 per cent.
The key to their success lies in taking an old retailing strategy - 'pile it
high and sell it cheap' - to its logical conclusion.
Clubs offer branded products at prices 25 to 30 per cent cheaper than high
street retailers, with some up to 60 per cent cheaper. They achieve such
prices by cutting costs and profit margins to the bone, with the aim of
shifting huge volumes of goods.
Every area of the business is examined with an eye to cutting costs. Clubs
spend virtually nothing on advertising, and employ very few staff. Goods are
sold in bulk off steel racking, in vast, spartan sheds built on the cheapest
available sites; and clubs stock a highly selective range numbering only
3,500 items (compared with 15,000 in a typical grocery superstore), but
stretching from corn flakes to computers and car accessories.
A final important element is membership, on which clubs rely heavily. They
typically have more than 40,000 members, each paying about Dollars
25-Dollars 30 (Pounds 17-Pounds 20) a year, and membership income can
account for 80 per cent of trading profit. So far, clubs in the US have not
experienced problems with non-payment of fees but it could prove one area of
weakness in the UK.
As they cross the Atlantic, the question facing warehouse clubs is whether
they can replicate their success in rather different conditions. Sceptics
argue that UK land prices are up to five times higher than those in the US,
pushing up warehouse clubs' cost bases significantly; and that UK shoppers
may be less willing than their US counterparts to drive large distances to
shop, to pay annual membership fees, or to buy in bulk.
On some of the narrow questions, consumer research is inconclusive. A recent
survey by market research group Harris International Marketing found 51 per
cent of UK shoppers prepared to buy in bulk to save money. But only 27 per
cent said they would pay an annual fee.
As to the larger question of whether clubs can have a viable future in the
UK, the predictions are more positive. Verdict Research, the retailing
consultancy, believes land costs will not be a problem: warehouse clubs do
not demand prime retail sites, and the higher margins prevalent in UK
retailing will make it easier than in the US for clubs to undercut existing
shops.
Verdict has identified 50 potential sites for clubs in the UK. Assuming what
it regards as realistic annual sales of Pounds 65m for each outlet, that
could give them a Pounds 3.25bn share of the Pounds 150bn total UK retail
market by the end of the decade.
Goldman Sachs is more optimistic. Taking only metropolitan areas, its retail
analysts say there is scope for 51 clubs. If less densely populated county
districts were considered as available sites, a further 39 could be built.
The firm believes clubs could expand at the rate of 10 or more a year, and
could achieve sales of Pounds 100m each, giving them a Pounds 9bn market
share over the same period.
Verdict's sales forecast for warehouse clubs is equivalent to only 2 per
cent of the total UK retail market, while Goldman's would give them 6 per
cent.
'What is surprising about the market share forecasts for warehouse clubs in
the UK is they are actually so small,' says Mr Richard Hyman, Verdict's
managing director. He sees one reason for constrained growth in the lack of
areas with a sufficiently large population to support the clubs.
With such moderate forecasts, why are rival retailers so hot under the
collar about them?
Part of the answer may be the clubs' expected upmarket customer profile.
Although one-third of club members in the US are small businesses, the other
two-thirds are individuals drawn mainly from higher income brackets.
According to Nielsen Marketing Research, most club customers have an annual
income of more than Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 27,000), and many earn more than
Dollars 60,000. Clubs have done much to make discount shopping not just
acceptable, but fashionable.
That could pose a problem for some UK retailers. The high-street food
discounters which have expanded rapidly in the past three years, such as
Germany's Aldi, France's Netto, and the UK's Kwik Save, have tended to
target poorer customers. But warehouse clubs may tempt the more affluent
households which currently shop at superstores such as Sainsbury's and
Safeway.
The breadth of warehouse clubs' product categories means it is not just food
superstores which fear they could cream off their best trade. Electricals
retailers such as Dixons and Comet, consumer durables retailers such as
Argos, and furniture and DIY stores such as MFI and B&amp;Q, could also suffer,
according to industry observers.
The most important effect of warehouse clubs, however, could be the most
subtle, evolving over several years. By offering such low prices, in
combination with the growth of high-street discounters such as Aldi, the
clubs could set a new, lower 'price floor' across the retail trade,
squeezing retailers' profit margins.
This, in turn, could be bad news for manufacturers. Dixons, for example, has
told its suppliers it intends to match Costco's price on any product sold by
both chains - but it also says it intends to continue making its usual
profit margin. The message is clear: supply Costco and you must cut your
prices to us.
'Dixons is wielding the big stick,' says one supplier. 'With times so tough,
they know they have the whip hand over suppliers.'
Other retailers may find different ways of competing. UK foodstores may
follow their US counterparts, which have attempted to fend off the warehouse
club threat by offering savings of 30 to 50 per cent on bulk purchases of
basic goods, often bundled together in 'club packs'. Sometimes these are
sold off warehouse racking in 'club aisles', to mimic conditions in a club.
Some US retailers have adopted even more of the warehouse clubs' low-cost
techniques, to enable them to offer lower prices, while selling a larger,
often more specialised range. The south-western chain Mega Warehouse Foods,
for example, invites customers to 'Shop us like a supermarket. Save like a
warehouse club.' It sells goods cheaply in club-style surroundings, but
offers 20,000 items compared to warehouse clubs' 3,500 and has no membership
fee.
This trend may already be starting in the UK. J Sainsbury, which has the
largest sales and second-highest profits of any UK retailer, is opening an
annex to its existing Savacentre hypermarket at Beckton, east London, which
will sell mainly own-label tinned, packaged and household goods in bulk.
There have been reports in the retail trade - denied by Sainsbury's - that
the store will incorporate some basic design features of a warehouse club.
The opening of the annex may signal a sharp change of direction for the UK's
top supermarket chains. The arrival of warehouse clubs is likely to
accelerate the move away from the margin-led approach of the 1980s towards a
more volume-driven strategy. But as in the US, some chains may decide they
are fighting a losing battle if they try to compete with the clubs on price.
Instead they could decide to concentrate on developing their strengths, such
as choice, service and convenience.
The result could be both lower prices and a wider variety of styles in UK
retailing - and the main beneficiary would be the consumer.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Building quality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Times Architecture Award, which reached its final stage
yesterday, shows that the best building in the UK today remains of a
remarkably high standard. A large entry probably reflects the culmination of
the UK development boom of the 1980s - many of the entries were commissioned
at that time and completed later. But to be able to field a set of recent
buildings as distinguished as Stansted Airport, the Cranfield Library,
Schlumberger Research, the IBM/MEPC joint venture at Bedfont Lakes near
Heathrow, as well as the winning Queen's Stand at Epsom, is a real
achievement.
With almost one third of the architectural profession in the UK unemployed
and the top practices having much of their work abroad, the question is
whether these standards can be maintained. Recession in the construction
industry is the main worry. But business could do more to encourage good
work, as could the government - especially when it comes to the few new
buildings it commissions directly.
As Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of the FT jury, said at yesterday's
presentation, quality buildings require good clients as well as good
architects. But Britain lacks the 'culture of good design' that is
understood at the highest level in other European countries.
Buildings that have been let or sold well in the City in recent years have
tended to be those that were well designed. Better buildings do mean better
business, while employees rightly have rising expectations about their
working environment. A glance at the empty and decaying Paternoster Square
by Saint Paul's Cathedral shows the real cost of poor architectural and
planning standards.
Cost paring by fee bargaining and 'design and build', where the architect
plays a minor role in the design and construction team, does not provide the
best long-term value for money. Award schemes are one way of raising
clients' sights. But the main answer lies in visual and architectural
education that should continue, with informed and sustained advice, into the
cabinet room and the board rooms of Britain.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Where bulk is best: Richard Tomkins visits a Costco outlet
in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 10 o'clock on a Saturday morning and the 650-space carpark outside
Costco's Clifton warehouse, on the New Jersey fringes of New York city, is
filling up.
The building itself is nothing out of the ordinary: it is just one of
several featureless sheds on a business park off the expressway. The
attraction is the goods on sale - or more particularly, the price tags they
carry.
One man coming out of the warehouse is pushing a trolley stacked with car
tyres and tins of motor oil. He is a local taxi driver named Brett Lines,
and he has just spent Dollars 240. But he says the same goods would have
cost a third more anywhere else. 'I just saved close to 80 bucks.'
Howard Myers, a metal dealer, has spent Dollars 237.19 on an assortment of
food, car accessories, electrical appliances and household goods. 'I have no
idea how much I saved,' he says. 'But I came in here for some dog food and I
came out with a vacuum cleaner and a hairdryer.'
The inside of the cavernous warehouse is austere, but brightly lit and
clean. Goods are stacked on pallets laid out on metal racks. Fork-lift
trucks move continually up and down the aisles, replenishing supplies as
fast as the customers exhaust them.
More than a third of the 117,000 sq ft floor space is devoted to food and
household supplies. The rest is taken up mainly by electronic goods (desktop
computers, television sets, audio equipment and white goods), office
furniture and supplies, do-it-yourself equipment, clothing and toys.
Warehouse clubs make their money by selling large quantities of a limited
number of lines. Even so, the variety is wide: goods range from paper clips
(Dollars 20 for 2,000) to grandfather clocks (Dollars 999.99 for one). Other
products include Huffy 18-speed mountain bikes at Dollars 129.99, janitors'
brooms at Dollars 4.79, men's underpants at six pairs for Dollars 8.99, and
the Bible at Dollars 25.
Food and drink sells mainly in bulk: sugar, for example, is sold in 50lb
bags for Dollars 15.49, Hellmann's mayonnaise comes by the gallon at Dollars
7.19, cans of Green Giant asparagus spears come in six-packs costing Dollars
8.99, and Budweiser beer is sold in 24-can cases at Dollars 10.49.
Shopping at Costco is for members only, but it is easy to get in. Anyone in
business can buy a membership card for themselves at Dollars 30 and six more
for employees, friends or relatives at Dollars 15 each. Membership is also
open to all public sector employees and their partners.
Costco says 60 per cent of its sales are to business customers, but it is
clear that many people are buying for personal consumption even when using
their business cards. So are conventional stores feeling the pinch?
John Zuza, manager of the A &amp; P supermarket half a mile down the road, seems
unconcerned: he says his sales have risen since the warehouse opened last
year. 'Most of our business is small orders,' he says. 'Costco is fine if
you have a big family or you're having a party, but most people don't want
to buy 24 rolls of paper towel at a time.'
He may be right. Even so, back at Costco, there are plenty of people like
Jerry Marrone, a postal worker, and his wife, Joan, who have driven 20 miles
to stock up on food and household goods.
Mr and Mrs Marrone say the Dollars 95 they paid for their booty was less
than half what they would have paid elsewhere.
Joan Marrone delves into their trolley-load of goods and produces a pack of
chocolate chip muffins. 'You go in a normal bakery and a muffin that size
would cost you Dollars 1,' she says. 'We have got 12 for Dollars 3.99. You
just can't beat that. Britain is going to love this store.'

<TEXT>
Nobody with a rational cast of mind can imagine a settled solution to the
problems of Northern Ire-land - or certainly not one that could be in place
this century. There is, however, a faint chance, a sliver of hope, that the
cycle of violence may be brought to an end somewhat sooner than that. This
hope has been kept alive, even nurtured, by the weekend storm over the
government's back-channel contacts with the IRA.
Let us take each of these propositions in turn. The first tells us why the
news from the six provinces is always so doleful. There is not space enough,
nor time, to go through the long history that led to the establishment of
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on the same island. The
elusiveness of a solution to the consequent troubles is sufficiently
demonstrated by reminding ourselves that the Protestants are a separate
tribe from the Catholics. There is a sad record of mutual hostility. You
have only to read republican literature, or see the anger in the face of the
Reverend Ian Paisley, the Buthelezi of Belfast, to appreciate that. No
arrangement that completely satisfies the one tribe will be acceptable to
the other.
Establishing a united Ireland tomorrow might create a new Bosnia in its
north-eastern quarter. So might a unilateral withdrawal of troops; likewise
the creation of a quasi-independent state of Ulster, followed by the
relieved turning of John Bull's back on the lot of them. Fully incorporating
Northern Ireland into mainland British institutions would not bring peace
from the republican side.
Going back to the use of internment of known terrorists would at best
deliver only a temporary respite from the killing. It did not work last
time, and would not again. Wiping out the opposing terrorist groups is not
an option for a liberal democracy. In short, there is no military solution,
and no plausible political solution.
This might appear to invalidate the proposition that there may be a way to
end the violence. Yet by all accounts Ulster is war-weary. There is a strong
desire for peace. This is recorded in many opinion polls and has recently
been made clear in statements and marches on both sides of the border.
Partly for this reason, and partly as a result of a perhaps over-optimistic
reading of intelligence gathered from and about the IRA, the British
government has perceived an opportunity. We do not know precisely when this
shaft of light struck Whitehall, but the documents released yesterday
suggest that it was in February this year, or possibly earlier. The
government took its chance, and launched the peace initiative that was
nearly destroyed by Sunday's news that it has been in communication with the
IRA.
No one can be happy at hearing that ministers have failed to be wholly open
and frank about their actions, particularly when political honesty is in
such short supply. That said, it can hardly be denied that Mr John Major and
Sir Patrick Mayhew were correct to use an intermediary to explore,
supposedly in secret, the possibility of a ceasefire by the Irish Republican
Army. The fact that they did so was heavily disguised by protestations that
they were not negotiating with terrorists. Nor were they, but nobody with
any sense would have assumed that there was no means of communicating with
the opposing forces.
All that has happened over the past few days is that the prime minister and
the Northern Ireland secretary have been caught using weasel words in a
worthwhile cause. It looks as if they have got away with it, and rightly so.
Rightly? Forget, just for the moment, about Mr Major's weak points. His
peace initiative is too important to be stopped in its tracks by the
unserious custom of finding fault with his motives, or his methods or, alas
too often, his results.
Admittedly his score in all three areas is less than perfect. Mr Major's
attempt to find a formula that brings peace may be founded on the ignoble
proposition that, if he pulls this one off, his reputation will be restored.
His method, that of the whip, has involved at best verbal acrobatics - and
at worst statements that do not convey the whole truth. It is evident that
the balancing act that gave so much hope last week nearly came unstuck this
week; the curse of our butterfingers prime minister may be that much of what
he touches seems to fall through his fingers.
Yet the potential prize, a cessation of the random killings of innocent
civilians, is too valuable to be lost by reminding ourselves of one
politician's negative characteristics. It took courage for Mr Major to
assume personal responsibility for negotiating a settlement. Cynics will
point out, yesterday's documents in hand, that he had reason to believe that
a ceasefire was about to be announced by the IRA. This does not materially
diminish the political risk he took. As we can see, the IRA is not easily
pinned down, and it was always possible that the veil of secrecy would be
sundered.
That is what has now occurred. It has not destroyed the government.
Conservatives united behind the prime minister yesterday, in itself a
striking indication of the ripeness of the time for his peace initiative. Mr
James Molyneaux, leader of the larger Unionist party, cemented his alliance
with the government by opening his remarks with the observation that
Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland speaks for Mr Gerry Adams, leader of
Sinn Fein. Labour has held its hand, knowing the penalty for appearing to
jeopardise the chances of peace.
Thus fortified, Mr Major will press on. The back-channels will be used
again, if necessary. The IRA may have been given an overdose of what Lady
Thatcher called 'the oxygen of publicity'; it should now announce the
permanent ceasefire that the government repeatedly calls for in the
published documents. The Protestant paramilitaries should do likewise. There
is no reason not to, so long as the government is committed to giving the
voters of Northern Ireland the power to decide on any arrangement that may
be made about their future.
There may be no obvious political settlement of this tribal conflict, but at
least getting everyone to lay down their guns and rely on negotiation and
the democratic process would bring a period of respite. Ireland's history
suggests that the odds are strongly against success. Mr Major may fail. Yet
he is right to carry on, secret communication links and all.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Other textiles barriers must come
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J A NIGHTINGALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The policy adviser to Christian Aid, Mr Peter Madden, in his letter on
textiles in the Uruguay Round (November 23) omits one vital point. Agreement
to phase out the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade multi-fibre
agreement (MFA) is dependent on action being taken at the same time to
remove other barriers - many of them far more stringent - which restrict
international trade in textiles and clothing, not least in developing
countries.
The linkage was recognised by all the Gatt contracting parties when the
original Punta Del Este declaration initiating the round was drawn up, and
remains an essential component of any final agreement.
Import bans and prohibitively high tariffs (many currently exceeding 100 per
cent) can have no place in the post-Uruguay Round world. Their removal will
stimulate development of trade between less developed countries and this
will provide at least as great a stimulus to their economies as will the
phasing out of the MFA.
It will also, together with the equally necessary reduction of peak tariffs
by developed countries, enable our own industry to seize essential new
export opportunities.
Time is running very short to allow a complex set of tariff negotiations to
be completed by December 15. It is time for all concerned to knuckle down to
some serious bargaining.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A restriction on exercise of choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY HOCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is heartening that Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the
Office of Fair Trading, has decided that the OFT should investigate the net
book agreement ('Book pricing scheme faces review', November 24). The timing
of his announcement is impeccable. While the industry is purporting to
defend the public interest with its 'don't tax reading' campaign, he has
highlighted the degree of self-interest that the campaign is also serving.
Based on experience elsewhere, the freeing of book prices from the grip of
the publishers would do at least as much to promote literature as the tax
break. Regardless of the direct costs and benefits, however, the current
situation is both economically and politically unacceptable. It has a
negative impact upon competition from other modes of communication and
reflects a view that taxpayers should be restricted in their ability to
exercise their own choices.
Even if the publishing industry does manage to survive this latest attempt
on its empire, at least the inquiry will raise public awareness of ways in
which we are subsidising it, not only through taxation but through prices.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Monitoring of radioactive discharges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BRYAN EDMONDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was concerned that Mr G A H Watts letter (November 27/28) and indeed
its headline - 'The unmeasured threat from nuclear power station emissions'
 -may have misled your readers.
Monitoring of radioactive discharges from all Nuclear Electric's power
stations is of course continuous, 24 hours a day. Wide-ranging environmental
sampling and measurement checks demonstrate the negligible effects of our
discharges, as our area medical officer confirmed to Mr Watts in previous
correspondence.
All monitoring results are published - both Nuclear Electric's and those of
independent regulatory agencies. They confirm that there has been no build
up of radioactivity in the environment around our power stations.
I am sorry that Mr Watts has developed such a serious illness. Thirty years
of detailed environmental monitoring both in the vicinity of our power
stations and around Mr Watts's home, strongly suggest, however, that he
should look elsewhere for the cause.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Levitt - integrity can never be
relative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM ROSS RUSSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Levitt case raises the question of the role of integrity in
financial affairs. An individual's integrity is important in all business
dealings, but nowhere more so than in financial services where the
repercussion of having a rotten apple in the barrel can affect such large
sums of money and hurt so wide a range of victims.
The greatest hurt to victims occurs when a financial services company fails
and is not able to meet its liabilities or compensate for past misfeasance.
Firms fail for one or a combination of two reasons - over-trading or
dishonesty. Hopefully, the action now taken by regulatory authorities in
monitoring the trading and capital requirements of firms means that the
chances of a financial services company failing through over-trading are
much reduced. However, there still remains the danger of dishonesty, when an
individual's integrity gives way to greed or fear.
It is recognition of the vital importance of integrity in financial dealings
that the Securities Institute has as the first of its two main purposes the
maintenance and strengthening of standards of integrity. It is in
recognition of the importance of this purpose, and of the institute's second
purpose of promoting competence and training, that the institute has
received overwhelming support from individual practitioners in financial
services and their firms since it was founded in March 1991. A member of the
public dealing with a member of the institute knows that he is dealing with
a professional whose integrity and competence is recognised by his peers.
It would be a sad day for the City and for the future of financial services
in the UK if it were ever thought that 'small' lapses of integrity are
excusable and in a different category from other forms of dishonesty. Surely
integrity, like pregnancy, is not relative? An individual who lacks
integrity in 'small' matters is unlikely to resist temptation if and when he
is really put to the test in 'large' matters. 'Borrowing' money from a
pension fund and lying to a regulator are both failures of integrity, and it
is not clear that the latter is less serious than the former.
Graham Ross Russell,
chairman, Securities Institute,
Centurion House,
24 Monument Street,
London EC3R 8AJ
From Mr Richard McManus.
Sir, As the self-confessed fraudster Mr Levitt declares himself 'a great
believer in British justice' ('City anger at community service order for
Levitt', November 27) there must be many of us who are questioning our own
beliefs.
Mr Justice Laws asserts that 186 hours community service is 'commensurate'
with the crime that Mr Levitt committed but the same cannot be said for the
squandering of millions of pounds from the strained public purse in a futile
three-year prosecution and costly trial.
One cannot help feeling that the money could have been better spent directly
on a host of worthy projects aimed at improving the lot of those in need of
support from the community. It is indeed possible that Mr Levitt may have
accepted his onerous sentence without the Serious Fraud Office and members
of the legal profession labouring quite so long. Aside from the specifics of
this case it does seem foolhardy to indulge in long-winded investigations
and prosecution when the main result may be to demonstrate publicly to
prospective criminals that they have little to fear from the vagaries of the
British justice system if they are brought to book.
Is it possible both to deter wrongdoers and leave the judiciary complete
discretion in sentencing?

FT  30 NOV 93 / Toil and trouble: Nasa needs to repair its public image, as
well as the Hubble telescope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral
tomorrow morning on what Nasa calls a routine servicing flight - and critics
say is a risky make-or-break mission for the troubled space agency.
The objective of the 11-day flight is to service and repair the Hubble Space
Telescope, a Dollars 2bn orbiting observatory which caused Nasa huge
embarrassment after its launch in 1990, when it turned out that the
instrument's 2.4 metre mirror had been ground to the wrong shape. Three
hundred miles above the earth's obscuring atmosphere, Hubble should have
enabled astronomers to see seven times further into the universe than ever
before; instead, the faulty mirror produced fuzzy pictures only slightly
better than the most powerful ground-based telescopes.
The mission is routine only in the sense that Hubble was designed for
maintenance in orbit every three to five years. No one had imagined when it
was launched that so much would need to be put right now, nor that Nasa
would be so desperate for a spectacular success to reverse the steady
deterioration in its public image after a catalogue of disasters - most
recently the loss of the Dollars 980m Mars Observer craft.
Nasa has picked a crew of seven space veterans, with an average age of 46,
for what is sure to be the most complex and challenging of the 59 shuttle
flights undertaken so far. The senior member is Dr Story Musgrave, 58, who
has been an astronaut since 1967.
On Friday the Swiss flight engineer, Mr Claude Nicollier, will use
Endeavour's robot arm to pull the bus-sized Hubble on to a special stand in
the cargo bay. Then the mission plan includes five days of space walks, each
lasting six hours, during which the astronauts will work in pairs to put
right as many as possible of Hubble's defects.
The single most important job will to fit 'spectacles' to correct the
telescope's short-sightedness. An instrument called Costar (for corrective
optics space telescope axial replacement) will slot in behind the famous
flawed mirror, containing 10 small coin-sized mirrors ground to compensate
optically for the defect.
But there are 11 other items to repair or replace. They include faulty
electronic components, three failed gyroscopes and Hubble's solar panels,
which have been disturbing its delicate instruments by juddering in response
to temperature changes whenever the craft passes from sunlight into
darkness. Indeed, changing the 12-metre solar arrays  - made by British
Aerospace as part of the European Space Agency's 15 per cent contribution to
the project - may turn out to be the most delicate operation of all.
The schedule is bound to change 'as events unfold', Mr Nicollier said last
month. 'There will be surprises, of that we can be sure. We therefore have
to visualise the unforeseeable.'
To prepare for unexpected events, the astronauts have trained longer and
more intensively for the Hubble repair mission than for any previous shuttle
flight. They have spent 700 hours rehearsing for their 11 days in space,
including 400 hours under water in a huge tank built to simulate
weightlessness at the Marshall Space Flight Centre in Alabama.
'I may have been in the water hundreds of hours, I may have been in the
clean room hundreds of hours (getting to know Hubble's replacement parts),'
Dr Musgrave said at the end of training, 'but, like the Olympics, it boils
down to a few seconds. You've got one shot at it. It's got to go right.'
As the astronauts know only too well, far more is at stake than their
ability to make Hubble work to its original specifications - and possibly
give astronomers a view of the distant universe good enough to set off a
scientific revolution like the one after Galileo's first use of a telescope
400 years ago.
The future of Nasa could hinge on the Hubble mission. A success would begin
to shore up public and political confidence in the once-proud agency, which
has been undermined by a string of failures since the 1986 Challenger
explosion. In particular, it would show that shuttle-borne astronauts can
carry out a complicated series of manoeuvres of the sort that will be needed
to assemble and use the planned Space Station Freedom, due to go into
operation early next century.
A failure would feed ammunition to congressional budget-cutters, who
succeeded recently in killing the US's other big science project, the
Dollars 11bn Superconducting Super Collider, and are keen also to shoot down
the multi-billion dollar space station. Its cancellation would leave Nasa
without a clear future in manned space flight beyond the ageing shuttle
programme - and could lead to the agency's dismemberment.
Mr Daniel Goldin, who was appointed Nasa administrator by former President
George Bush early last year and has been kept on by President Bill Clinton,
put on a brave face when he appeared before the Senate science, technology
and space subcommittee this month. 'We are not afraid,' he said. 'If we fail
(in the Hubble mission), we will dust ourselves down and do it again.'
But Mr Goldin pleaded with the senators not to cut Nasa's budget any more.
The Bush administration reduced its five-year spending plan from an original
request of Dollars 106bn in 1991 to Dollars 96bn; since then, this had been
cut to Dollars 78bn - and it could fall to Dollars 71bn, according to the
latest proposals.
With everyone's attention focused on the space-walking astronauts and the
implications for Nasa of their success or failure, the astronomers - for
whose scientific benefit the repair mission is supposedly being undertaken -
are feeling rather left out.
'Although some people felt it was an outrageous waste to spend Dollars 2bn
on the original Hubble project, because so much money would have given far
better returns to science if it had been spent on earth-based observatories,
most of us welcomed Hubble because it brought in extra funds that would not
otherwise have been spent on astronomy,' said one European astronomer. 'The
same is true of the repair mission. Some astronomers were getting good
results from Hubble, faulty as it was, and they didn't want to risk spending
Dollars 620m to ruin it, but most of us recognise that Nasa has to try to
repair it for political reasons.'
Even if the Endeavour mission appears to be a spectacular success over the
next 11 days, it will not be clear for at least a month whether the
astronauts have repaired Hubble and Nasa's reputation. It will take several
weeks to remote-test all the new equipment, before Nasa can send the
telescope instructions to start observing. Few pictures in history will be
awaited with such anticipation.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: The Nutcracker meets goodie two-shoes - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN ACOCELLA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warner Brothers' film of New York City Ballet's Nutcracker, cumbersomely
entitled George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, was released in the US this
week, not without considerable advance publicity in the form of a fight
between the studio and Kit Culkin, father of 13-year-old film star Macaulay
Culkin, who plays the Nutcracker.
The elder Culkin has tender feelings about Balanchine's 1954 Christmas
ballet. As a boy he danced in it himself; he too was the Nutcracker. So when
Macaulay was offered this role in the film version, the Culkins accepted on
far more modest terms than the child star normally commands: Dollars 10,000
plus 5 per cent of the gross. (For Home Alone 2 Macaulay received Dollars 5m
plus 5 per cent of gross.)
In return, Kit Culkin expected that the producers too would have tender
feelings about the ballet - film it straight, not 'adapt' it: an approach
that everyone seems to have agreed on in the early stages. But at test
screenings it turned out, reportedly, that many children could not follow
the story. So the producers hired Kevin Kline to narrate it, over the music,
at various moments in the film. When Kit Culkin saw the narrated version,
according to an article in New York magazine, he told the producers, 'You've
s*** all over Tchaikovsky.' If the narration were used, Culkin said,
Macaulay would take no part in promoting the movie. If the narration were
not used, on the other hand, Macaulay would renounce his 5 per cent of the
gross.
After considerable scuffling, Warner Brothers rejected Culkin's offer. When
the film hit the theatres on Wednesday there was Kevin Kline's voice, smack
on top of the music, telling us, for example, as the Christmas eve guests
enter in Act I, 'Here they all came, the Christmas eve guests.' I do not
know where Warner Brothers obtains the children for its test screenings, but
every year I attend NYCB's Nutcracker in a theatre full of children, and
they all seem to get the drift.
Silly though it is, however, the narration is sparse. A far greater problem
is the camera work. 'We trusted the dance,' says producer Bob Hurwitz of the
film team's philosophy. 'We trusted Balanchine.' Nothing could contradict
that statement more flatly than the filming of the dances. Never is a dance
given its proper time and space: never is it allowed to establish itself.
Presumably for the same anxiety about our attention span the camera is
constantly moving into closeup. We gaze into the Sugarplum Fairy's armpit,
we inspect Macaulay Culkin's mouth. (He is missing the first premolar on the
upper left.) The nearer we get to any one dancer, the less we see of the
choreography. Nor do the closeups enhance realism of the movie. On the
contrary. Seen from a few inches away, the 'snow' is clearly paper; the ice
cream, plaster.
Crazy-wigged Drosselmeyer, who in the stage production is a figure of weird
glamour, here looks like a man who might ask you for a quarter in the
subway. Emile Ardolino, the film's director, produced and directed
first-rate dance programs for the Public Broadcasting Service in the 1970s
and early 1980s. When he went to Hollywood four days before the release of
the Nutcracker movie, he died of Aids at the age of 50. Ardolino's memory
should be honoured - for his earlier work. I do not envy anyone the task of
adapting the non-realistic medium of ballet to the realistic medium of
popular film, but in this case no interesting solutions were found.
In the film as in the theatre, the ballet is danced by New York City Ballet,
and the cast is well chosen. If for nothing else, the film is valuable in
that it records the cool, brilliant allegro work of Kyra Nichols as the
Dewdrop and the glorious expansiveness of Darci Kistler as the Sugarplum
Fairy. Twelve-year-old Jessica Lynn Cohen, who plays the heroine, Marie, has
a pretty face and a peppy spirit.
The only serious piece of miscasting is Macaulay Culkin. He has danced in
NYCB's production before - he played Fritz, Marie's truculent little
brother, in 1989 and 1990 - but he is not at home in ballet. His neck and
shoulders are tight and he walks as if his shoes hurt. Culkin is a comedian,
a rare gift in a 13-year-old, but not one that is required for the
Nutcracker. Culkin plays it with an ironic half-smile, as if he were in a
children's production of The Importance of Being Earnest. He was clearly
hired for box office reasons, which would have been fine had he been right
for the part.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: Abbado on white-hot form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In retrospect the 1960s and 1970s look a remarkably settled time for most
orchestras. The senior conductors of the day tended to stay with their own
orchestras for a long period, creating stable relationships which were
generally seen to be a good thing.
The next generation of maestros is facing all sorts of criticism, as a
revealing BBC documentary last week showed. Even those trying to follow the
same path find themselves ambushed. Perhaps the Berlin Philharmonic
Orchestra always was going to be a special case, but that does not explain
the hostility of a recent attack in the German press against Claudio Abbado,
accusing him of not being another Herbert von Karajan.
Abbado is known not to enjoy musical politics and has been keeping his eyes
down on the music-stand. This season he is conducting an impressive list of
concerts in Berlin, including two lavishly-cast concert performances of
Musorgsky's Boris Godunov at the weekend. This opera has long been among
Abbado's key works. The Royal Opera's production has been his outstanding
collaboration with the company to date; and if his interpretation has
changed over the years, he still recaptured in the warm and generous
ambience of Berlin's Philharmonie much of the intensity of those stage
performances.
By the time the performance reached the final scene, the playing was
white-hot. The swirling string figures as the crowd gathers tingled with the
frenzy of a Russian populace in open revolt. It is claimed that the Berlin
Philharmonic does not sound the same under Abbado. That may be true.
Whichever the orchestra, Karajan's Boris Godunov was a grandly-unfolding
epic, woven in a rich tapestry of sound; Abbado's is swifter, leaner, more
urgent, seething with tensions public and private below the surface. It did
not seem to me any less well played or sung. The choral singing, from the
Slovak Philharmonic Choir of Bratislava and the Berlin Radio Choir, was
especially effective.
The weakest link in the cast was probably Boris himself, Anatoly Kotcherga,
who has plenty of force in his voluminous (not always well-focused) bass
voice, but not the same force of personality. He did the obvious things
without making them fresh and personal.
It is unlikely that the Polish act has ever been more gloriously sung than
it was by this trio of Olga Borodina, Sergey Larin and Sergey Leiferkus, who
brought a splendid combination of vocal glamour and subtlety of character to
their three schemers. Philip Langridge got a vivid grip on Shuisky's
slippery personality. Gleb Nikolsky and Helmut Wildhaber were a wickedly
matched comic duo as Varlaam and Missail, every bit a present-day Laurel and
Hardy. Elena Zaremba was their young, vocally voluptuous hostess. There are
certainly other cities which have more pressing problems with their
orchestras than Berlin.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: An odd light on Butterfly - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stage is almost bare. The few things that remain - a solitary rock, a
chair, the people - seem to function principally as objects to be lit.
Everybody moves slowly, but less for any dramatic purpose, so it seems, than
for the requirements of the lighting. Light is the hero: light in the
phosphorescent blue on the rock, the white on a hand, or golden gleam on a
body.
And this is Madame Butterfly? No, this is Robert Wilson. In his productions
of traditional operas Wilson has stressed how his visual contribution must
be independent of the music and text, and yet his choice has hitherto fallen
on works which fit with his earlier original creations in their elongated
time schemes, their mythic resonances and their symbolism: Parsifal,
Lohengrin, The Magic Flute. Puccini's works are entirely different, and the
new Madame Butterfly at the Bastille in Paris (Wilson's third production
there in the theatre's short history) might seem to allow more scope for
independence to exert itself.
Most often the performers - who seem to be singing the characters' music but
not enacting them as people - behave with a sublime disregard for what is
going on, or for what they are having to deliver. Signal points in the drama
are registered not by these statuesque people but, typically, by the
lighting: by a sudden blackout, for instance, when the Bonze denounces
Butterfly's spiritual defection. Music that is customarily seen as demanding
movement - such as the rush for the child's entry near the end - sweeps,
most effectively, across an entirely still stage. Not only does the
production fail to deliver the expected visual appurtenances, it makes a
point of its failure, as when Pinkerton and Sharpless in the first act
ostentatiously mime holding glasses in their hands.
However, these displays of independence are a mite superficial, for it is
obvious that Wilson was attracted to Madame Butterfly by the Japanese in it,
and by the idea that he could bring this out in his setting. He uses a
wooden walkway like that of the Japanese theatre, and the severe costumes
(by Frida Parmeggiani) look in the same direction. But suggestion is all.
There remain two huge problems. One is that Wilson is dealing with opera
singers, not with actors trained for decades in a demanding tradition of
deportment and gesture. The other is that Madame Butterfly is not a noh
play.
Wilson's attempt to make it one smacks disturbingly of the scorn and
opportunism which the opera makes an effort to denounce in Pinkerton. Alien
manners are being tried on without any care for the density of meaning they
convey. For all the atmosphere of seriousness, the production is
disturbingly hollow: one can read the director's signature, but it is placed
on an empty and ignorant canvas.
There is one area of exception. Some of Wilson's earlier work made startling
use of non-professional performers, and here the child (a grave Steeve (sic)
Lopez) becomes a major participant. In the long nocturne-interlude he alone
moves about the stage in childish games while Butterfly and Suzuki wait, and
it is his hand, warding Pinkerton off, that provides the final gesture.
However, the very poignancy of this proves how far the production has come
from its stated aim of following an independent, parallel path.
The orchestra, under Myung-Whun Chung, occasionally remind one of Puccini's
admiration for Debussy, though the sound is thin in this theatre and the
balance odd. Valentina Sedipova was the Butterfly I heard, coming to
firmness and lustre in the second act; she shares the title role with Diana
Soviero. Of the rest of the cast, only Georges Gautier as Goro stood out.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: Back to brushstrokes at the galleries - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the event, the result of the Turner Prize has a certain inevitability,
and even logic. Looking back, I now realise that Sean Scully, the one artist
actually to put paint on canvas by means of a brush - a sort of stick-thing
with bristles at one end - was no more than a token entry. In a fixed field
of conventional conceptualists, he had no chance at all. The pity of it is
that we have plenty of painters of just his sort - minimalist, or at least
highly-simplified abstraction - who might have given him and us a run for
the money. Such artists as Alan Green, Alan Charlton, Edwina Leapman, Marc
Vaux and Peter Joseph have records that are no less long and distinguished
than his. Set against them on equal terms, Scully might well have won, but
he would have done so against his peers. But rules are rules, and any such
race was just not on.
Such rueful ruminations were brought on not so much by Scully's failure to
come home the winner, as by Edwina Leapman's current exhibition at Annely
Juda, altogether quieter and more properly modest an affair. Miss Leapman
has been working to much the same programme for about 25 years, during which
she has been principally concerned, she tells us, with 'close tonalities and
vibrating light'. As for her colour, 'it is to do with space and the
vastness of space: with the limited space of the picture and the endless
space beyond its edge'.
What she actually does is to lay a thin but resonant colour-field, these
days usually fairly dark, a rich blue or green perhaps, over the entire
surface of the canvas. She then lays another near-complementary colour,
fairly close in tone, in regular, careful, albeit free-hand horizontal
stripes across the canvas, leaving the ground-colour visible at the margins
and through the abutments between the stripes. Some little variation, of
size and format, is admitted in this process but most particularly in the
actual working of the stripes themselves, according to the choice as to the
thickness of the paint, stiff or flowing, the gauge of the brush and the
load of paint it should carry. She fills the brush, moves it across the
surface until it requires refilling, and so continues until the stripes fill
the canvas.
Nothing could be simpler, indeed quite worthy, some might feel, of the
unregenerate Turner Prize. Quite why these paintings should be so beautiful
and satisfying is probably beyond the sceptical, yet beautiful they are, and
monumental, and profound in their teasing of the visual imagination. For the
simple truth is that to set one mark upon another, one tone against another,
is to propose an infinity of possibility of space and substance that only
the imagination can explore. Just how close within its pictorial space is
that delicate lattice of horizontal bars, and quite how deep the firmament
beyond?
The work of Mary Potter, who died in her eighties 10 years ago, has much of
this same quality of apparent simplicity married to imaginative complexity.
Here again the range of colour and tone is closely limited and controlled,
in this case to the earth colours, ochres and umbers touched up with faded
blues, greens and pinks. And again, in the characteristically dry impasto of
the paint itself, we are made immediately and quite physically aware of the
fact of the surface and the stroke of the brush. Such is the act of painting
itself.
Nominally figurative, these paintings withdraw from their subjects of
landscape or still-life to the point of abstraction, teasing us on the very
point of association and recognition, wryly fugitive and elusive. And they
too are unexpectedly, subtly, irresistibly seductive. This exhibition,
sadly, is to be the last at the New Art Centre in its present incarnation,
for the gallery in Sloane Street, its home for 30 years, is to be bulldozed
for redevelopment. Business in the meantime is to continue at Roche Court in
Wiltshire, off the A30 just short of Salisbury, until new premises are
found.
Here in London we see too little of current French painting, for which both
sides are equally at fault. The admirable Galerie Matisse of the Institut
Francais, from its tiny space at South Kensington, does whatever it can on
limited resources to supply the deficiency. Its current show of the work of
four painters is perhaps too constricted physically to do either itself or
its subjects full justice, especially given the size of some of the
canvases.
The great bonus is to see for the first time the work of the youngest of the
quartet, Helene Delprat. She draws upon some obvious references and
influences within the currency of international painting - from Picasso and
Dubuffet to Paladino and Basquiat, with a generous helping of tribal art,
and graffiti too - but she works it all with commendable vigour and
confidence, and makes of the confection something quite her own. She seems
to be a real painter, someone adventurous and ambitious and yet at ease with
her medium on a large scale. Without the fashionable preoccupations, she
could be better still.
Edwina Leapman - recent paintings: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street
W1, until December 22. Mary Potter - An Unique Vision: New Art Centre, 41
Sloane Street SW1, until December 24. Four Artists from France: Galerie
Matisse, Institut Francais, 17 Queensberry Place SW7, until December 16,
then on to the Institut Francais, Edinburgh.

<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are fascinated by the trials and tribulations of being a rich pop
star, tonight's the night. Remember 'The Singing Nun'? In 1963 Jeanine
Deckers recorded that intensely irritating number which began 'Domi-nique,
nique, nique' and in 1966 she left her convent and became a 'celebrity'.
Without Walls (C4, 9.00) tells how she set up house with another woman and,
in 1985, agreed a suicide pact which resulted in the death of both.
The second half of the programme considers those photographic posters for
Benetton which are so successful at creating attention.
In 1986 the androgynous pop star Boy George was a heroin addict, but he beat
the addiction and today, we are told, 'He is back on top'.
Filmed against a background of a trip to America, Omnibus (BBC1,
10.30)reveals a funny, complex, sensitive survivor.
Assignment (BBC2, 7.45) considers the problems facing the ANC in South
Africa and the chances of the movement managing to form a successful
'government of national unity'. John Harrison interviews Nelson Mandela.

FT  30 NOV 93 / People: Cooper moves to Vestey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Cooper, 47, is joining the Vestey group as finance director. Since
1988, he has been a director of Robert Fleming, and head of corporate
finance worldwide since 1990.
At the Vestey group he will be working closely with Sir John Collins,
appointed chief executive in September, with effect from January 1994;
together they will have responsibility for overseeing the future strategy of
the group through the mechanism of a new holding company yet to be formed,
and to be called Vestey Group Holdings. Currently the group is divided into
two main operating entities, Union International and Frederick Leyland.
After qualifying as an accountant with Peat Marwick Mitchell, Cooper spent a
short time with first BAT and then Rank Xerox in 1971-72, before leaving to
join Robert Fleming in December 1972, where he first became a director in
1977. In 1984 he joined Kleinwort Benson as a director in the corporate
finance department.
In 1986 he joined the clothes retailer Next as group finance director,
returning to Robert Fleming in 1987 as a director of corporate finance,
becoming head of UK corporate finance in 1988 and head of corporate finance
worldwide in 1990. Robert Fleming said yesterday that no replacement has yet
been chosen.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Isaac, European president of the management consultancy ALEXANDER
PROUDFOOT, chaired by Lord Stevens of Ludgate, has left after 20 years with
the group.
The news broke yesterday, after an internal memo circulated in the company
and jointly signed by Isaac and Proudfoot's chief executive, John Prosser,
was leaked to the media.
Proudfoot has been going through tough times recently; at its interim
results in September it reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 13.2m to
Pounds 5.6m. A spokesman for the company said yesterday that Isaac's
departure was not connected with its recent financial problems.
But the company's European business, which Isaacs took over in November 1992
when Prosser was made chief executive, has been performing poorly.
Staff levels have been reduced from more than 1,500 a year ago to about
1,300 now, as part of a Pounds 15m a year cost-cutting programme. Neither
Prosser nor Isaac was available for comment.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: When national limits are legal -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National laws restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements do not
infringe Rome treaty rules on the free movement of goods, provided the laws
are not aimed at imports from other member countries and provided they have
the same effect on the commercial freedom to market domestic products as on
imports, the European Court ruled last week.
In a landmark ruling, all 13 judges said that, where those conditions were
satisfied, this kind of national regulation was not by its nature intended
to prevent or hinder access to the market by imports any more than it
impeded the access of domestic products.
The Court's ruling was in response to questions raised by the Strasbourg
Tribunal de Grande Instance in connection with criminal proceedings against
a Mr Keck and a Mr Mithouard.
They were prosecuted for reselling products in an unaltered state at prices
lower than their actual purchase price, in contravention of the French law
which prohibits resale at a loss.
In their defence, they argued that a general prohibition of resale at a loss
was incompatible with the treaty ban on import restrictions as well as other
rules on free movement and competition.
At the outset the ECJ said that it was only appropriate to look at
prohibition of resale at a loss from the perspective of the free movement of
goods, since the prohibition was concerned with the marketing of goods.
The Court confirmed its 1974 ruling in the Dassonville case that any measure
which is capable of directly or indirectly, actually or potentially,
hindering intra-Community trade can constitute an import restriction
prohibited by the treaty.
However, the fact that such legislation may restrict the volume of sales in
the market concerned, and therefore the volume of sales of imports, is not
decisive. It was not the purpose of national legislation imposing a general
prohibition of resale at a loss to regulate trade between member countries.
Before making its new ruling clarifying the scope of Community law in the
context of import restrictions, the Court referred to its 1979 landmark
decision in the 'Cassis de Dijon' case.
The Court said this held that, in the absence of harmonisation of
legislation, import restrictions prohibited by the treaty included obstacles
to the free movement of goods where they were the consequence of applying
national rules laying down certain requirements to be met by goods to
imports from other member countries where they are lawfully manufactured and
marketed, even if those rules apply without distinction to all products.
The only exception was when the application of the rules can be justified by
a public-interest objective taking precedence over the free movement of
goods.
But the Court then said: 'However, contrary to what has previously been
decided, the application to products from other member states of national
provisions restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements is not
such as to hinder directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, trade
between member states within the meaning of the Dassonville judgment',
provided that the non-discrimination conditions are satisfied.
The Court said this kind of rule falls outside the scope of the treaty ban
on import restrictions.
The judgment is important for business. First, the Court has set out to
clarify the Rome treaty's ban on import restrictions in the context of
national rules which limit commercial freedom but are not aimed at products
from other member countries.
It specifically refers to the need to re-examine and clarify its case law in
view of the increasing tendency of businesses to invoke the treaty ban on
import restrictions as a means of challenging any rules which limit their
commercial freedom, even where such rules are not aimed at imports from
other member countries.
Second, the Court expressly acknowledges that this new ruling is 'contrary
to what has previously been decided'.

November 1993.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Views sought on simplifying trust
rules - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Commission has issued a consultation paper on simplifying the
English law of trusts, almost 30 years after Parliament last had a go at it.
The paper asks whether the time has come to change the complex rules - 'the
rule against perpetuities' and 'the rule against excessive accumulations' -
that effectively limit the period for which a trust may last.
Among the questions being considered are: Should we seek to curb the 'dead
hand control' of former owners, reaching out to control their property
beyond the grave? Do other provisions, such as inheritance tax, exert enough
pressure to stop trusts lasting too long? If an estate is tied up a long
time, does it unreasonably hamper development or discourage economic use of
land? And would accumulating money for a long time damagingly concentrate
wealth in the hands of only a few people?
Law commissioner Trevor Aldridge says it is clear the present law is
'convoluted, obscure and capricious. If it is still important to keep
control of trusts in this way, the rules should be easier to understand and
simpler to apply. On the other hand, if we need no controls, the rules
should be scrapped.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / People: Inchcape reduces its board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Inchcape's most senior directors are leaving the international
services and marketing group, and the company has decided to take the
opportunity to have a smaller and more strategically focused main board.
According to Charles Mackay, the chief executive, the move to a smaller
board is not intended to diminish the importance of the group's business
streams - motors, marketing and business services. Indeed, the intention is
to give each its own own board and increase their operational and financial
autonomy.
Alan Marsh, 57, who will take early retirement in May, is responsible for
Inchcape's worldwide businesses with Toyota. He will be succeeded by David
John, 55, currently the main board director for Inchcape's marketing
business stream.
Reg Heath, 52, who will leave on September 1 next year, is the main board
director responsible for the group's other motor businesses, apart from
Toyota. He was chief executive of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the motor
distributor which Inchcape bought for Pounds 376m at the end of 1991. A
well-known figure in the UK motor trade, Heath is credited by Inchcape with
having done a 'terrific' job in integrating TKM. He is likely to receive
plenty of offers, but so far has made no plans.
Alan Davies, 44, will replace David John as chief executive of the marketing
business stream. Maurice Rourke, 45, will succeed Heath as chief executive
of Inchcape's motor businesses, other than Toyota. Neither Davies nor Rourke
will be appointed to the main board.
Simon Arnold, 60, will also step down from the main board in May, having
reached retirement age. He will, however, continue as chairman and chief
executive of Bain Clarkson, a position he has held since 1985 as part of his
overall responsibility for Inchcape's worldwide insurance services business.
John's move to run the Toyota businesses reflects the continuing importance
to Inchcape of its links with the Japanese group. In 1990 Toyota paid
Inchcape Pounds 60m for a stake in Toyota (GB), the UK distribution company,
which will rise to 51 per cent in 1998. John has known Toyota from his time
as chief executive of Inchcape Berhard, when he was responsible for Toyota
operations in Singapore and Brunei.
Davies, who replaces John as chief executive of Inchcape's marketing
business stream, joined the group in 1989 and became chief executive of
Inchcape Middle East last year. Before joining Inchcape, he spent 16 years
with Rothmans International, the tobacco group.
Rourke, who succeeds Heath, is currently development director for Inchcape's
motor businesses other than Toyota. He has 20 years experience in the
European motor industry and worked with Renault UK and BMW before joining
TKM in 1977.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: View from America - US lawyers claim
they are better than Europeans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will come as no surprise to European law firms that US lawyers have a
pretty high opinion of themselves when it comes to providing international
legal services.
Their opinion of European lawyers, however, is not so flattering. According
to a survey of America's top 400 law firms, conducted by Global Research,
the market research organisation, US lawyers believe their European
counterparts are less hard-working and less capable of taking an aggressive
commercial stance in deal-making.
Comments ranged from the relatively restrained: 'We are ahead on the
cutting-edge developments in capital markets' - something Linklaters, Allen
&amp; Overy, Clifford Chance, Slaughter and May and Freshfields might dispute -
to the more forthright: 'US firms take a more proactive approach, whereas
the Europeans only react when asked to.'
Historically, there may be some justification for such a viewpoint. Many US
corporations active in international markets have preferred to take their US
lawyers with them rather than look for a suitable local alternative. US
investment banks also appear to be more comfortable working with US lawyers.
But it is questionable whether such a gap still exists between the leading
US and European firms, particularly in western Europe, which is viewed by US
law firms as their most important international jurisdiction. Even in the
Asia/Pacific region, regarded by the Americans as their second most
important market, the gap between the US firms and the UK and Australian
firms has closed in recent years.
Nevertheless, respondents to the survey felt they had a competitive
advantage over non-US law firms when operating in foreign jurisdictions for
several reasons. These included greater knowledge and understanding of
multinational commercial transactions, a stronger work ethic, more expertise
in specialist areas, greater efficiency and more competitiveness on price.
The price question - whether US law firms are cheaper than European ones -
is likely to remain unresolved while there continues to be such a difference
of approach in the way that firms bill their clients.
The American claim to be cheaper appears to be based on the assertion that
they are more productive. The number of hours billed by US lawyers last year
averaged 1,752 for partners and 1,864 for associates, compared with an
average of 1,570 and 1,520 respectively in Europe.
But these figures ignore the revolution that has taken place in charging
practices over the past two years, such as contingency and success fees,
brought about by the recession. US firms apparently still rank the number of
hours spent on a job as the most important criterion when billing clients.
It is doubtful whether many European firms take that view.
In spite of the upbeat responses to the survey, the US profession seems much
less confident of its standing in the global legal services market and, in
many instances, unsure of how best to position itself as recession turns
slowly to re-covery, according to Global Research.
About 60 per cent of respondents see themselves as international rather than
US law firms, but few have invested in new overseas offices recently.
Resources are scarce after a couple of lean years, and many have not decided
how to allocate the limited spare cash they have available.
The survey suggests that US firms must answer several difficult questions
when working out their strategy. Should they concentrate on Europe, where
competition from UK and other European firms has made market conditions more
difficult? Or should they be opening offices in the Asia/Pacific rim to
target the emerging markets of Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia
and India?
Given the tough time many firms have had of late, few will be able to afford
such a high-cost strategy, particularly as most firms must expect to wait
two or three years before seeing any return on their investment.
On the other hand, can they afford to wait until they have built up
sufficient cash reserves at home to fund such overseas expansion? The risk
of allowing their competitors to become established in these markets is
considerable.
Those who, owing to limited resources, have little alternative but to wait
for domestic recovery before contemplating further expansion should take
heart from the fact that two of the three firms rated the best in the US by
their peers - Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore, and Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz -
have achieved such a reputation in spite of their relatively small size,
their low-key approach to marketing and without a large overseas presence.
They should also be encouraged by the Dollars 1bn Singapore Telecom
privatisation, one the biggest deals ever to come out of Asia. Two New York
firms, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton, neither of
which had an office in Singapore, were appointed this year as lead advisers
on the deal, much to the dismay of the US and UK firms which bid for the
work from their Singapore bases.
This deal, says Global Research, underlines more than anything that there is
no right or wrong approach to overseas expansion.
Those firms still undecided on their best strategy must also bear in mind
that the international legal market is changing. US and UK firms are
increasingly competing for international work on each other's home
territory.
The first indication of a change in the relationship came recently with the
decision by Clifford Chance, the UK law firm, to hire a US-qualified
regulatory lawyer in its New York office. It was followed by the
announcement by several New York firms that they would shortly begin
appointing English solicitors to their partnerships.
Such open competition for international work in each other's backyards is
set to become more common, as there is an increasing volume of work that
could be done as easily under UK or US law.
Perhaps in recognition of the difficult trading conditions overseas, US
lawyers appear to be pushing a revival in domestic markets. Mr Joseph Flom,
the doyen of Wall Street mergers and acquisitions lawyers, was quoted
recently as saying the big companies now had money available and soon they
would be saying: 'I've got money to lend - where am I going to lend it?'
It is unlikely that we are on the verge of a mergers and acquisitions boom
such as that of the late 1980s, but Mr Flom is not alone in predicting an
upturn in M&amp;A activity.
Respondents to the survey said corporate work was currently the most
important source of business, followed by securities, bankruptcy and
insolvency work, M&amp;A, banking, tax and litigation.
Immigration, telecommunications, investment management and product liability
were identified as the main growth areas, with M&amp;A leading the list of
specialities making a comeback. Other areas expected to show a recovery
included environmental issues, asset finance and intellectual property.
Bankruptcy and insolvency will become progressively less important.
This optimism, however, is dampened by the knowledge that the dynamics of
the market have changed. Lawyers have to learn the trick of maintaining
market share in the face of increased competition. Or, as one lawyer put it
to Global Research, they have to learn to live in a market characterised by
'fee pressure downward, cost pressure upward'.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Technology: A challenging skill to master
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the networking neophyte, entering the Internet feels like arriving in a
foreign city where you don't know a soul and can't speak or read the
language. At first, you suffer from culture shock and finding your way
around is a real challenge.
To master the Internet, you should be prepared to invest considerable time
and effort. 'User friendly' is not a term that has penetrated cyberspace.
Prior experience in using commercial on-line information services such as
Compuserve, Prodigy or America Online will give you a head-start. For many
PC users, these easy-to-use services may prove more rewarding than launching
into the unstructured world of the Internet. They have recently started
offering an electronic mail service over the Internet at a small charge.
If you have a taste for something more adventurous, or a more limited
budget, sign up with one of the Internet public access services  - CIX in
the UK and The Well in California are well-known among Internet aficionados.
Participating in one of the numerous conferences or newsgroups that are
constantly under way on the Internet is a good way to get your feet wet.
While you can learn a lot from these, the most valuable function of the
Internet is the access
that it provides to remote databases. Learning how and where to find useful
information is the biggest challenge for Internet users.
Several information search-and-retrieval tools are available on the
Internet. The best known include Archie, Gopher, WAIS and World Wide Web.
Each offers a standard method of finding information and downloading it from
various computers on the Internet. Details of how to use these programs can
be found in several Internet guidebooks.*
But even if you know where to look for whatever it is you are trying to find
on the Internet, you still face the challenge of figuring out the commands
needed to get to the files you are seeking.
Unfortunately, depending upon the type of computer you are using, and where
your travels take you on the Internet, you may find yourself facing
computers that 'speak' several different dialects.
A knowledge of the Unix operating system is 'useful', the experts suggest.
This is rather like saying that it may be useful to speak French if you are
going to live in France. You can survive without the language, but will be
at a big disadvantage.
Even disconnecting from the system can be a challenge. 'Try one of these
commands: exit, quit, logout, leave, goodbye, ciao, disconnect, CTRL-D or
CTRL-Z,' Tracy LaQuey and Jeanne Ryer advise in The Internet Companion, a
beginner's guide. If none of these works, 'press lots of keys to abort'.
With luck you will hit the right combination.
If this sounds like too much to handle, do not despair. America Online, one
of the easy-to-use commercial information services, is promising to deliver
full Internet access via its point-and-click graphical interface next year.
In the meantime, the good news is that sending and receiving electronic mail
on the Internet is quite straightforward. Put an Internet address on your
business card and everyone will assume you are already a network wizard.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Technology: Experts tackle the bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity is one of the highest costs for the water industry because of
the power needed to run pumping stations 24 hours a day. An Israeli company,
with a staff of six, is now winning orders from UK water companies for a
computerised control system to cut those bills.
Welsh Water, the first to have the system running, says it is saving up to
15 per cent of its electricity bill at its biggest treatment works, Court
Farm, supplying Cardiff and Newport. This should mean an annual saving of
more than Pounds 100,000. The system, called WaterExpert and designed by
Intellect Expert Systems, is also being developed at two of its other
plants.
The impetus for WaterExpert was the electricity price pool - the complex
wholesale market set up when the electricity industry was privatised - and
the need to match water demand with the optimum tariff. Michael Harrington,
divisional operations manager for Welsh Water, says: 'With the electricity
price changing 48 times a day, the only way to control that is with some
form of expert system. It is a very difficult job to do it manually or
mentally.'
Fed into WaterExpert, which uses a PC with software tailored to each plant,
are factors such as reservoir levels, river abstraction rates, water
quality, weather forecast and likely demand. It then produces a 24-hour
operation schedule, either on-line or off-line, to initiate the opening and
shutting of pumps and valves. The plan is modified automatically to take
account of changes in demand or a mechanical failure, but it can also be
adjusted by the operator.
Intellect Expert Systems says WaterExpert should pay for itself within a
year and the company has orders from three other UK water companies. John
Roberts, works controller at Court Farm, says: 'The system is very user
friendly. It does save electricity costs and management time - there is not
so much time spent with paper and pencil.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / Technology: Casting the net worldwide - The Internet global
network is leading the way down the information superhighway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intrigued by glowing accounts of rich information resources and lured by the
promise of a free international electronic mail service, computer users are
signing up in droves to services that offer access to the Internet, a global
web of computer networks.
Already, the Internet links thousands of computers and an estimated 15m
computer users. One million new subscribers a month are said to be hooking
up their computers to 'the Net'.
Public awareness of the Internet has been raised in part by the Clinton
administration's promotion of the 'national information infrastructure' as a
development that will bring broad economic and social benefits to all
Americans.
The Internet is the precursor of the high-speed information superhighway
system. It provides free access to thousands of computer databases, the
opportunity to engage in a myriad of on-line debates or special interest
group discussions and the ability to exchange electronic messages with other
users almost anywhere in the world at little or no cost.
From its genesis in a 1969 US Defence Department project to provide computer
links between researchers at US universities and national laboratories, the
Internet has grown into a vast web of public and private computer networks,
about half of which are in the US. Although it lacks the speed and bandwidth
of future information superhighways, the Internet demonstrates the potential
value of data communications, as well as some of the challenges that lie
ahead on the information superhighways. By creating digital links to distant
information resources, for example, the Internet is beginning to eliminate
the constraints that geography places on access to education, jobs and
services.
'(Students) can now access Nasa, leave messages for the astronauts, browse
around in libraries larger than they will ever be able to visit . . . read
world and national news that appears in newspapers that are not available in
their small towns . . . change the way they feel about the size of their
world,' a teacher from a small Texas school district writes in 'The National
Information Infrastructure: Agenda for Action', a report by Clinton's
Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF).
Businesses are taking advantage of the vast libraries of research reports
available on the Internet. Small companies that cannot afford private
computer networks can use the Internet to link distant sites. Software
developers and insurance companies are using the Internet to shift
labour-intensive programming and data processing jobs to low-cost regions of
the world.
The growing use of the Internet also points to an urgent need for higher
capacity information highways. Already, there are data traffic jams on the
Internet as millions of new users explore its resources. New high-speed data
channels are essential if the whole system is not to become gridlocked.
Widening the 'roads' of the Internet may not, however, be sufficient to
provide broad public access to information resources. Indeed, the history of
the Internet would suggest that it may encourage even more traffic. The
establishment in the 1980s of the National Science Foundation Network, which
provided a high-speed 'backbone' for the Internet, spurred a vast increase
in its use.
The entire information infrastructure - 'bridges' linking different networks
and 'on and off ramps' providing access to individual computers - will have
to be upgraded if there is to be 'universal access' to information resources
as the Clinton administration is insisting.
The shortcomings of the Internet also raise questions about the design of
information superhighways. Despite its rising popularity, the Internet can
be fully exploited only by people with a significant degree of computer
expertise.
To be accessible to a broader spectrum of society, information superhighways
will have to be far easier to use. This will require the development of
interface software that hides the complexity of the network from its users.
The lack of any central control over the Internet has enabled it to grow
rapidly as thousands of regional and local area computer networks have
plugged in. However, the flexibility of the Internet also makes it far more
complex.
There is, for example, no catalogue of resources on the Internet. The
Internet is therefore difficult to use unless you know exactly what you are
looking for and where to find it. Similarly, the Internet lacks the
equivalent of a telephone directory. To send messages to another Internet
user you have to know their Internet address, but there is nowhere to look
it up.
Data security is another weakness. As numerous security violations have
shown, however, ensuring data privacy may prove difficult. The thorny
question of the rights of law enforcement officials to 'snoop' on the data
highway has also to be addressed.
Access to vast amounts of information is not the whole answer. The power to
discover the right information quickly and easily, to separate 'nice to
know' from 'need to know' information is essential if information
superhighway users do not drown in electronic 'junk info'.
Perhaps the most critical issues raised by the Internet relate to
intellectual property rights. On the Internet, anybody can copy any material
 -whether it be a newspaper article or a graduate thesis - without charge.
Essentially, this means an individual who posts information on the Internet
forfeits rights of ownership.
The IITF is currently evaluating the need for a system that enables
information providers to collect royalties for copyrighted products
delivered or made available through information superhighways.
The Clinton administration has acknowledged that unlike the Internet, the
information superhighways of the future will be built and controlled by the
private sector. However, the government will have a critical role to play in
determining that all Americans have 'universal service at affordable prices'
and in writing the 'rules of the road'.
Commercially owned, government-regulated, high-speed information networks
will be capable of delivering a myriad of services, ranging from interactive
television and on-line shopping to video-conferencing and information
services akin to those of the Internet.
Ironically, however, while newcomers to 'telecomputing' may welcome such
developments, veteran Internet navigators fear commercialisation and
regulation will doom the free-wheeling spirit that has enabled the Internet
to thrive.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Barclays lends more EIB
money - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank is revamping a scheme to lend European Investment Bank funds
to small and medium-sized businesses making capital investments.
This Friday the EIB will provide Barclays with the first Pounds 50m line of
low-cost credit - larger sums are expected later. The bank will lend between
Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 10m for a minimum of four years.
Companies should have fewer than 500 employees and net fixed assets of less
than Pounds 60m. The EIB will lend half of the total investment cost but
borrowers do not need to borrow from Barclays for the balance.
Barclays has already lent Pounds 130m of EIB money over the last four years.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Filing accounts can help
your rivals - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Filing accounts at Companies House, as required by law, is betraying vital
information to competitors at home and abroad, according to the Small
Business Bureau and the Union of Independent Companies.
Privately owned British manufacturing companies, particularly those with
only one product range, have become 'hopelessly exposed to both UK and
foreign competition', the two groups say in a report*.
Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs and deregulation tzar, has
been sent the report which says sensitive information on small companies is
more readily available in the UK than anywhere in the world. The SBB has
asked Hamilton to persuade his European colleagues it is potentially
damaging for small and medium-sized companies to publicise accounts.
The SBB wants small companies, where shareholders are also directors, to be
exempt from filing accounts. Hamilton is studying the issue.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Twelve acorns for a hair
cut - Local Exchange Trading Systems are taking off in nearly 200
communities across the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you do when you have a product or a service to sell, but your
customers have no money to buy? The answer is you shun sterling and accept
'bobbins', 'acorns', or 'beaks' instead.
Recession has worked wonders for home-grown local currencies. Two years ago
there were five. Now, nearly 200 towns and cities in the UK are busily
buying and selling in their own units. Businesses including dentists,
solicitors, shops and cafes are finding that receiving payment in local
barter currencies is a lot better than not trading at all.
The networks, known as Local Exchange Trading Systems, started as a way of
helping the unemployed use their skills. Members open an account in the
local currency with a central administrator and are issued with a cheque
book.
When one member buys something from another, the cheque is sent on to the
central administrator who acts as banker, debiting one account and crediting
the other. No physical tokens are involved.
Members enter their products or skills for sale in a local directory, with
many members offering a range of services. Paul Johnson of Tradelink in
Wiltshire is fairly typical: he will program your computer or decorate your
house. The founders of the scheme view money with strong suspicion and have
a moral repugnance for the payment of interest. But Lets are now moving away
from their hippy roots and businesses are beginning to accept payment in
Lets units as part of a hard-nosed business strategy.
A solicitor in Stroud who accepts Lets payments does so because he
recognises that it brings in customers who otherwise might not use a
solicitor. Moreover, customers acquired in that way may be more likely to
stay loyal.
'Initially we joined the scheme because we were new in the area and because
we felt we couldn't say no,' says Carolyn Whitwell of the Bishopston Trading
company which runs five ethical clothing stores in the west country. 'But
now we do it out of pure self interest. Recession has hit us very badly and
this is a way of creating a market for people who have no money.'
The shop accepts 25 per cent of the value of its goods in Lets units, but
when it increased the proportion to 50 per cent during a recent sale, it was
surprised at how sharply its turnover increased.
While businesses are finding no shortage of customers willing to buy through
Lets, some are struggling to spend the currency they have accumulated. In
Stroud, which has one of the oldest and biggest schemes with about 300
members, there are plans to employ a Lets councillor to show businesses how
to meet many of their needs - decorating, electrical work, accountancy and
so on - locally and pay for them through Lets.
Some enterprising companies have started paying their staff through Lets. At
the Bishopston Trading Company, local residents are being paid in Lets units
to make clothes, thus not only meeting a genuine need, but easing the
company's cash flow.
At Mills cafe in Stroud, meals and drinks can be bought via Lets and with
the proceeds the proprietor is paying workers to till a nearby plot of land
for her. Meanwhile, the owner of a market stall has earned enough Lets units
to hire an architect to redesign his home.
As the idea of the schemes is to keep business within a community, they tend
to work best in places where the spirit of the community is strong. Many of
the people who are the keenest users like them because, unlike money, they
make trading less impersonal.
'The years of Thatcherism have taken the humanity out of doing business,'
says Harry Turner of Letslink UK, the national co-ordinating body. 'There
are lots of people who prefer a more human way of doing things.'
He describes his first Lets transaction when he had just moved to the town
and was in need of a haircut. 'I rang up someone in the directory to sort
out a haircut and I took some of the cards I had made over. I ended up
having a meal there and now we are friends.'
Some larger towns have more than one network. In Bristol there are two, each
with a different ethos. One prides itself on its equality: all members must
charge a standard rate for their services per hour, regardless of whether
they are accountants or cleaners. The other, like most Lets, allows members
to charge whatever they like. The second scheme, complains Carolyn Whitwell,
is rather too heavy on people offering alternative healing or aromatherapy
at fancy prices.
Lets keep tabs on how much each member of the scheme is trading and sends
them regular statements. There are no credit limits: most feel that the
local nature of the schemes as well as the types of products on offer will
prevent people from spending a million bobbins and then doing a runner.
The Inland Revenue is watching the growth of Lets with interest. A
spokeswoman said that if local currencies were used for occasional
babysitting or gardening, the revenue would turn a blind eye. But if
businesses were using them, all amounts should be declared in the usual way.
'And we want tax paid in sterling. The chancellor will not appreciate having
his lawn mowed,' she said.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Silk flowers and chips -
Victor Mallet examines a father-son business in Thailand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like his father, Richard Han is an entrepreneur to the core. When he was
studying for his MBA at City University in London, the man who is now chief
executive of Thailand's Hana Microelectronics group had a sideline importing
Thai silk flowers and selling them to shops such as Harrods.
He went on to exploit a loophole in British customs regulations, importing
watch straps and cheap digital watch movements from his father's factory in
Thailand (tariffs were lower than for completed watches), assembling them at
home and selling them in Petticoat Lane, London; the business grew and he
once sold 1m watches to Texaco for a UK petrol station promotion.
But when he returned to Thailand four years ago, Han, now 36, took on the
more daunting task of turning round the troubled family business. In common
with other second or third-generation ethnic Chinese businessmen, he was
able to supplement the family's entrepreneurial skills with a more modern
management style, essential for the fast-growing, high- technology
businesses at the forefront of south-east Asia's economic boom.
His Fukkienese grandfather and his father Swie Yam Han had fled the
anti-communist, anti-Chinese massacres in Indonesia in the 1960s and
established car distribution and assembly businesses in Thailand.
His father, says Han, quickly 'figured that micro-electronics was the thing
to be in and he was absolutely right'. Hana developed a profitable business
making light-emitting diode and liquid crystal display watch modules, before
moving on to the manufacture of circuitry for analogue quartz watches.
Then the company branched out into integrated circuits, creating Hana
Semiconductor in 1984.
By the time Han returned to Thailand, Hana was suffering from two problems:
the integrated circuit and semiconductor packaging business was
undercapitalised and the traditional management structure was such that
nobody dared to tell his father - the revered, paternalistic and
all-powerful boss - what was going wrong. Losses on the semiconductor
business almost matched the watch profits and the watch market was becoming
increasingly competitive.
'No manager ever told my father he was wrong,' says Han.
'In Thailand, because of this respect for one's elders, initiative in middle
management is lacking. My father would never be questioned so he could never
get feedback or decision-making from middle management. The company had
grown and it was still very much a top-down management structure.'
His father's mistake, says Han, lay partly in creating a financial framework
for the capital-intensive semiconductor business that was almost identical
to the successful formula adopted for its more labour-intensive forerunners.
'The capital was enough to buy half of one of those wirebonding machines,'
he says. 'Now we've got 50 of them.'
With his father still urging him to sell the semiconductor business, Han,
applying what he had learned at business school in between selling flowers
and watches, set about raising money and building a new factory to introduce
the economies of scale he believed were necessary.
Whereas his father had balked at mass production and thought Hana could
operate as a 'niche player', Han realised that customers wanted to be sure
that Hana could produce large runs of good quality at a reasonable price.
'We are in a service industry. I'm not selling a product, I'm selling a
service,' he says.
Promising to go public, Han sold 10 per cent of the company to outside
investors, who diluted the absolute power of the family and were able to
offer advice on financial strategy in the boardroom.
Today, Hana is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand and its shares - in
contrast with those of other Thai electronics groups which have suffered
falling profits - are sought after by foreign investors. Net profits have
risen eightfold since 1988, and third-quarter profit this year was Baht84.7m
(Pounds 2.24m), nearly double the figure in the same period last year.
Han says the company, which now employs 3,700 people, counts Kodak among its
customers (it makes small circuit boards for Kodak cameras), is building a
new factory in northern Thailand, will spend Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) on new
equipment next year and is looking for suitable acquisitions.
Han credits his father for spending time in Hong Kong and letting him tackle
the restructuring. 'It very much depends on the parent-son relationship,' he
says. 'It depends if the father is willing to release the reins. There are
companies where the father still retains a stranglehold over the whole
operation.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Architecture Award: Horden gallops past the post with
a classic - A report on the 'high-tech' appeal of this year's winning entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two English obsessions were united in the presentation yesterday of the
Financial Times Architecture Award to the designers of The Queen's Stand at
Epsom Racecourse - horse racing and 'high-tech' architecture.
Some critics might say that the third national obsession, gambling, was also
part of the winning equation. The architects, Richard Horden Associates, is
a young practice, set up in London in 1985, and it was an adventurous choice
 -indeed something of a gamble - for United Racecourses to chose it for this
prestigious commission at Epsom, Surrey.
The chairman of United Racecourses is Sir Evelyn de Rothschild - a man used
to winning in the world but also a man with a stern eye for quality. The
members of the jury of the FT Award were unanimous in their selection of The
Queen's Stand as this year's winner - they were in fact bowled over by the
consummate elegance and practical beauty of the design.
What is 'high-tech' architecture and why is it a purely English obsession?
Put simply, it is an architecture that celebrates the glories of
contemporary technology and turns mere functionalism into something
expressive - almost poetic.
'High-tech' buildings such as the Lloyd's building in the City of London
elevate the language of engineering and structure above and beyond any
simple single purpose or function. There is something almost gothic about
the expressiveness of structure which combines with an enjoyment of the
symbolism of our times.
'High-tech' architects enjoy new materials and the application of
technologies learned in other fields to the development of architecture.
Many sources of ideas are plundered to feed the god of high technology -
architects have learned from car manufacture; prefabrication and space and
rocket technology; and marine engineering, aeronautics and computing has
also nourished its growth.
Why is it so much an English phenomenon? Architects would say that
'high-tech' grew out of engineering and the pioneering traditions of designs
like the Crystal Palace by Sir Joseph Paxton, or Brunel's bridges and
railway stations. But it is also closely linked to ship and aircraft design
 -the skills that went into Concorde and the QE2 have also enriched
'high-tech' architecture.
England's 'high-tech' pioneers such as Sir Norman Foster and Nicholas
Grimshaw are enthralled by yachts and aircraft - indeed, Sir Norman is
famous for arriving at site meetings by helicopter.
Richard Horden, this year's winner of the Financial Times Architecture
Award, is a pedigree product of the best 'high-tech' stables. He started in
an office with Nicholas Grimshaw and then worked for 10 years in Norman
Foster's office. While he was with the Foster practice he was involved in
the design of the Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts at the University of
East Anglia, and the remarkable headquarters of the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Bank in Hong Kong. He also helped evolve the early design of the Nimes art
gallery and the Stansted airport proposals.
On setting up his own practice Horden faced the problem of how to utilise
his experience of working with the design leaders of the profession while
developing a distinctive style of his own.
During the early 1980s he was fortunate to secure several commissions for
private houses. An aluminium house in the New Forest generated several
revolutionary ideas. He was also teaching and continuing to practice his own
particular interest in yachting and boat design.
Like many of the best contemporary architects Horden moved into the design
of furniture and interiors. His small 'Yacht House' and 'Ski Haus' projects
are the result of his own wide sailing experience and his work with yachting
engineers and carbon craftsmen. Direct work in the factory gives Horden an
edge over many of his contemporaries: a sense of control is evident in his
buildings.
The Queen's Stand at Epsom is beautifully sited and has a remarkable view of
the Epsom Downs and the surrounding seven counties. The club stand for the
racecourse, it is located opposite the finishing line of the Derby. As the
brief demanded a series of balconies and boxes all with a clear view of the
course, it was natural for the architect to draw parallels with a large
ocean liner with sleek deck forms. Masts and flagpoles add to the impression
of a ship, especially as the whole building is painted white.
Continuous balconies create the sense of a grandstand and provide racegoers
with views of the Royal box and of other racegoers as well as the horses.
While the stand is well equipped for racegoers it also has fine facilities
for jockeys.
Part of the competition brief for the stand (which was drawn up in 1988) was
that the building should be in use for as much of the year as possible for
functions and entertaining. It runs like a great hotel on the Downs and the
sleekness of the design makes it an agreeably neutral setting that can be
transformed easily for a variety of events.
The design team included engineers Ove Arup and Partners with Peter Rice and
the quantity surveyors were Davis Langdon and Everest, Clyde Malby. Planning
permission was granted in March 1991 and a phased fast track construction
programme allowed the completion of the whole project within 18 months.
Richard Horden has several promising successors to this award-winning
building in the pipeline. His practice won the European-wide competition for
a 100 metre high tower for Glasgow, to be built (funding permitting) in the
city centre to mark the millennium. An important scheme for Shell UK for a
new headquarters building in The Strand in London is currently awaiting
planning consent. Land Securities and NM Rothschild have both commissioned
important projects from the Horden practice.
Any visitor to the offices of this London firm, in Golden Square just behind
Piccadilly Circus, will sense a new architectural spirit. The office
includes a showroom and cafe and tourists are welcomed to glimpse the design
process at the heart of the capital.
The FT jury felt that the Queen's Stand was magnificent and saw in it the
seeds of many future projects of high quality. Awards should encourage as
well as reward and Horden seems to have a golden future as one of Britain's
band of world leaders in the 'high tech' architectural market.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Architecture Award: A talent for picking winners over
three decades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Times Architecture Award 1993 is the 26th to be made. It began
life as the FT Industrial Architecture Award and grew out of a desire to
find ways of improving the working environment in the 1960s.
Industry and manufacturing then took more conventional forms and the award
juries were restricted to looking at the manufacturing process and its
visual consequences. Looking back at those early days it is significant to
note how successful the juries were in spotting talent. Norman Foster,
Richard Rogers, Nicholas Grimshaw and Michael Hopkins were all singled out
as key developing talents long before they reached their current
international fame.
This has been a record year with 154 entries - remarkable in a recession.
The jury had a new layman - Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of WH Smith and a
former chairman of the Design Council. He is known for his interest in
architecture and his own developed skills as a patron. The architect members
were Nicholas Grimshaw and John Outram.
The FT has always tried to ensure that the jury represents all sides of the
architectural debate. Grimshaw is a leader of the 'high tech' school and the
opening of his Waterloo Channel Tunnel Eurostar Terminal is eagerly awaited.
He is also currently engaged in the design of the new Berlin Stock Exchange
 -a scheme he won in international competition. Outram has recently won two
important architectural competitions - the Judge Management School at the
University of Cambridge; and a key new facility for the Rice Campus of the
University of Texas.
The jury always visits as long a 'short list' of buildings as possible and
this year the members were especially impressed by the very high
architectural standards. The final shortlist of commended schemes for 1993
was:
Stansted Airport by Sir Norman Foster and Partners.
Bracken House, City of London, by Michael Hopkins and Partners.
Schlumberger Research Centre, Cambridge, by Michael Hopkins and Partners.
Cranfield University Library by Sir Norman Foster and Partners.
Bedfont Lakes, (IBM, joint venture with MEPC), near Heathrow Airport, by
Michael Hopkins and Partners.
Chichester Car Park, Avenue de Chartres, Chichester, West Sussex, by Birds
Portchmouth and Russum.
City Offices in Winchester by Hampshire County Architects.
The jury looked for that elusive quality in a winner which shows the hand of
the architect in every aspect of the design. But a key realisation every
year is that the best new buildings come about through the collaborative
efforts of a good client with a talented architect. Such creative
partnerships not only produce businesslike new buildings but also provide
ones which are aesthetically rewarding.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Nadir trial judge 'hurt' by probe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Justice Tucker, the judge in the case of fugitive tycoon Mr Asil Nadir,
yesterday told how he was 'shocked and angry' when he learnt of an
investigation into an alleged plot to bribe him.
In comments after he had received an apology from the Serious Fraud Office
for the offence caused to him last November, when questions were raised as
to whether he should remain in charge of the Nadir trial, he said: 'I was
very offended and hurt when I heard these allegations made in open court. I
have known from the start it was arrant and outrageous nonsense.'
The apology came during an application made in court by Mr Andrew Nicol on
behalf of The Independent newspaper to lift a reporting ban on court
proceedings on November 6 last year, in which details of the allegations and
the high-level police inquiry into them first emerged.
Mr David Calvert-Smith, representing the SFO, said it now realised the
allegations were 'spurious and groundless'.
After receiving a report of the police investigation the Crown Prosecution
Service said this month that allegations of a Pounds 3.5m bribery attempt
had not been sustained. The allegations were said to have been made by a
known informant and a female business acquaintance of Mr Nadir who are now
believed to be in northern Cyprus.
Mr Nadir, who is accused of fraud involving Pounds 30m and was head of Polly
Peck, has made his home in northern Cyprus since fleeing Britain.
Mr Calvert-Smith told the judge yesterday: 'We apologise deeply for the
offence your Lordship felt, but we were attempting to act in the very best
interests of the trial.'
Mr Justice Tucker agreed to lift the contempt order, saying the only reason
he made it in the first place was to try to ensure Mr Nadir would receive a
fair trial, not to protect his own position.
At the November 6 hearing the judge was told by Mr Robert Owen QC, then
prosecuting for the SFO, that there was 'a probability' that officers
involved in investigating what he only described as 'matters' would wish to
interview him.

FT  30 NOV 93 / London to Dublin air service planned
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways is finalising an agreement with
a new Irish airline to start a franchised service from London City Airport
to Dublin, Paul Betts writes.
Virgin yesterday said negotiations with a privately owned Irish carrier
called Cityjet were 'very advanced' and that an agreement was likely this
week.
The Irish airline would operate British Aerospace 146 regional jets with
Virgin licensed services.
Under the franchising agreement the aircraft would be painted in Virgin's
red livery and Mr Branson's airline would provide support for maintenance,
catering, marketing, sales and training.
The Irish carrier plans to operate up to five services a day between Dublin
and the London City airport in Docklands.
While Virgin intends to continue focusing on long-haul intercontinental
routes, Mr Branson sees franchising as an opportunity to expand in the
European market.
London City airport yesterday announced the start of its first domestic
service. In January VLM, a Belgian airline, will start a twice-daily link to
Liverpool using a Fokker 50.

<TEXT>
Three-quarters of adults say they are unlikely ever to use the Channel
tunnel, according to a survey published today by the market research
organisation Mintel.
Fear is largely to blame for the apparent hostility towards the new service,
which is due to start in May. Mintel said more than half of the 1,000 adults
questioned were 'fearful that the tunnel would increase the risk of rabies
and other diseases entering the UK'. Half expressed concern that the tunnel
could be a target for terrorists.
Professional male business travellers, particularly those living in London,
are most enthusiastic about the tunnel but, overall, only 15 per cent of
those living in the south say they are likely to use the service, in spite
of living so close to it.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Lecturers vote for disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lecturers at seven further education colleges are to take industrial action
over new contracts which would halve their annual holidays and add an hour
to each working day.
At Furness College in Cumbria two-thirds of lecturers voted for indefinite
strike action while workers at other colleges voted to work to rule or to
ban marking registers.
A further 14 colleges plan ballots as part of the campaign being run by the
National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education against the
new contracts.
Plans for a national one-day strike in September were abandoned when the
Colleges Employers' Forum, which represents most college principals, agreed
to start national negotiations.
In September the employers agreed to stop introducing the new contracts,
which affect only people starting a new job and people being promoted.
Ms Sue Berryman, Natfhe negotiating secretary, said: 'This local action
shows the strength of feeling around the country and members' determination
to resist the introduction of sub-standard contracts.'
But the forum described the votes as a breach of the spirit of the September
agreement. It said that December 31 had been set as a deadline for the
talks, and that Natfhe had agreed to suspend any action until then.
Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the forum, described Natfhe as 'lions led
by donkeys'.
He added: 'They are throwing their ground forces into attacking the
introduction of modern managerial practices which the further-education
sector has been avoiding for 15 years.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / Driving a new product to the heart of carmaking: A small
factory which is on the brink of big sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Keith Jones, managing director of Henrob, a small company based in Wales,
was flying to Detroit yesterday to talk with US manufacturers about applying
its self-piercing riveting technology 'which every month is gaining
momentum'.
Its partnership with German carmaker Audi marks the first application of the
technology, which replaces spot welding, to a complete car body assembly.
The machines and rivets installed at Audi's Ingolstadt plant have all been
designed and manufactured in Flint.
Henrob, Mr Jones said, had been 'pushing' its technology for some time, but
everyone was comfortable with spot welding.
'Then the technology changed, with aluminium and plastic coming in as the
need has grown for lighter vehicles. At that point, they (Audi) realised
that welding wasn't suitable - and at that point it became really exciting
for us.'
Henrob is already active in other fields - about 1,000 of its riveting
machines are installed worldwide in applications such as washing-machine
assembly lines in Iran and India. The electronically operated sliding roof
of Toronto's all-weather sports stadium is held together by Henrob's system.
In the motor industry the catalyst for the surge of interest has been the
prospect of aluminium cars being produced in volume.
But manufacturers are realising that the technology is applicable to steel
as well, particularly as they move to corrosion-resistant coated steels.
Spot welding can destroy the coating and leave the vehicle vulnerable to
rusting.
Ford US, in a research paper presented to the International Body Engineering
Conference in Detroit in September, said: 'Only the self-piercing rivet
shows a significant strength advantage over spot welds.'
The size of the potential market is enormous. Mr Jones said: 'There are
about 130bn spot welds put into cars each year - an average of 3,000 per
vehicle.'
There is no heat involved in the new process, so it can join unlike
materials, such as the plastic composite body panels some vehicle makers are
using as an alternative to steel.
Other advantages claimed are low energy consumption compared with the hefty
electrical current required for welding, near-noiseless operation and only
about half the investment.
But Henrob executives accept that the motor industry's need to amortise
large investments in spot-welding plant and equipment makes an 'overnight'
switch to pierce riveting unlikely.
The French Peugeot group is also introducing a simpler form of the
technology to assemble part of the body shell of its 106 and 306 car ranges.
A simplified form of the process is being used to assemble seats for Ford's
new Mondeo model.
Only 68 per cent of joints on the Audi aluminium car are riveted because the
design of the car was under way when Henrob was approached. 'Now that the
technology has been accepted future cars will be designed with it in mind
from the start, bringing it much closer to 100 per cent,' Mr Jones said.
Henrob set up in Flint in 1986 - helped by a Pounds 500,000 grant from the
Welsh Office - after acquiring technology rights which originated in
Australia.
It is investing Pounds 1.8m in expansion and creating 20 jobs in addition to
the current 34. Mr Jones predicted 'significant' further growth in
employment.
The company has enjoyed a 40 per cent growth in turnover this year 'and
we're expecting 80 per cent compound over the next three years,' Mr Jones
said. 'Audi isn't even on stream yet.'
Henrob exports more than 80 per cent of the output of its small Flint plant,
which produces several million rivets of varying size each week.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Surge in factory output expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing output is set to rise sharply in the next few months, boosting
recovery hopes, says a survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply published today.
The survey indicates an increase in orders and a fall in stock levels while
delivery times have lengthened. All these indicators point to a continuation
of the recent relatively strong growth in manufacturing.
An index published by the institute giving a view of output trends came out
at 54.2 this month, the highest figure since April. In October it was 53.6.
The November figure indicates that the rate of expansion in manufacturing
activity has increased for the second successive month. It also shows that
activity has increased compared with the previous month for the 10th
successive month.
The index is calculated from data supplied every month by purchasing
managers in 300 manufacturing companies. A figure above 50 shows that
activity is higher than in the previous month. A number higher than the one
recorded in the month before shows expansion has accelerated.
The output component of the index was at 59.3 this month, indicating a rise
in the level of production for the 13th successive month. Full order books
and a high volume of sales were widely reported as the main reasons for the
continued upturn.
The new orders component of the index came in at 55.8 this month, down from
56.3 in October but well above the levels of about 50 in both August and
September.
The survey shows raw material prices were stable in November in line with
the general view that inflationary pressures are muted. Companies reported
an overall expansion in staff numbers during the month, fitting in with
matching recent evidence that unemployment is falling.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Watchdog attacks 'flaws' in GCSE marking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's GCSE exams, which showed an improvement in standards, were more
rigorously marked than last year's but still showed 'serious flaws', it was
announced yesterday.
Mr John Patten welcomed the findings by Ofsted, the education watchdog, but
called for a 'back to basics' change to the marking scheme for exams next
year to ensure consistent marking for spelling, punctuation and grammar.
He said: 'We must ensure that a consistent system is in place before the
next round of GCSE examinations.'
The Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the education department
quango chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, has been charged with introducing the new
system. Sir Ron echoed Mr Patten's call: 'We will work with the examining
boards to eradicate remaining weaknesses in the GCSE including, in
particular, the way that the basic skills of spelling, punctuation and
grammar are assessed.'
Inspectors found that criteria for assessing basic literacy skills were
flawed, with some candidates being penalised for spelling mistakes when they
were attempting to use complicated vocabulary.
In science exams some candidates were marked down for poor spelling and
grammar even though their exam scripts provided little evidence of this.
Inspectors were also concerned that the correct balance was not being struck
between exams and coursework, both of which count towards the GCSE
qualification - the principal examination for 16-year-olds in England and
Wales.
They said levels of attainment were 'worryingly uneven' across the whole
syllabus, while there was a danger that some more demanding parts of a
syllabus 'will be given insufficient attention in the classroom'.
In English, coursework was strongly presented and organised but 'let down by
an inability to rise to the challenge of a timed, formal examination'.
Last year the inspectors delivered a damning report on the GCSE results,
saying they had 'little confidence' that standards were being maintained.
The GCSE was introduced in 1988.
Mr Patten welcomed the inspectors' latest finding that the exams had been
marked more rigorously than in 1992.
This followed the introduction of a new code of practice by the examining
boards after Mr Patten had said that apparent improvements in results were
due to lower standards, rather than improved performance by pupils.

FT  30 NOV 93 / BT comes top in telecoms poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications provides a better service than Mercury, says a
survey of telecommunications managers in Britain's largest companies.
The survey of 439 companies by the Telecommunications Managers Association
says that, on a scale of one to 10, BT was rated at an average of 6.95
against 6.18 for Mercury. Nearly half the companies surveyed have an annual
telecoms expenditure of more Pounds 5m.
The survey reflects the tension between price and quality. Competing
aggressively on price, Mercury has about two-thirds of outgoing
long-distance traffic from the City, although its national market share is
only about 10 per cent.
Mr David Harrington, director-general of the association, said: 'BT's
strength is the resilience of its network, which is widely seen to be
greater than Mercury's. They have got more people on the ground.'
Most telecoms managers claimed to have a good understanding of pricing
packages but the growing complexity of tariffs was a source of concern.
A large number of companies said they planned to use network operators which
have entered the UK markets since the abolition of the BT/Mercury duopoly in
1991.
Colt, a new operator building a network in the City, said yesterday that it
expected to be serving at least 100 sites within a year.
In the six months since gaining a government licence Colt has laid more than
20km (12.5 miles) of cable and is providing private networks for six City
organisations.
Colt plans to extend its network to Westminster early next year and to
install a switch enabling it to connect traffic with BT, Mercury, and other
long-distance operators.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Few former Swan Hunter workers find jobs, say unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fewer than 20 per cent of Swan Hunter employees made redundant since the
company went into receivership six months ago have so far found jobs, says a
survey by trade unions campaigning to retain shipbuilding on the Tyne.
The survey findings were released yesterday as the remaining Swan Hunter
workforce learnt the names of the 510 workers to go in the latest round of
redundancies, announced earlier this month. Those named left the Tyneside
company immediately, reducing the payroll to 1,040.
All union members made redundant by the receivers before yesterday were
contacted by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions to
discover whether they had found work.
Of 750 contacted, 207 had replied in time for the survey. Of these, 40 had
found jobs, a handful of them on short-term contracts. The rest were still
unemployed. The bulk of those contacted were made redundant between four and
six months ago.
The survey highlights the disparity of job opportunities for different
employee categories. Fewer than one in 10 ancillary workers, pipeworkers,
painters and wood machinists had found work, and 88 per cent of fitters and
85 per cent of electricians and steelworkers were still jobless.
Among white-collar employees more than three in 10 had found work. The most
successful were managers, of whom 50 per cent were in new jobs.
The survey did not include former Swan Hunter directors. One of them, Mr
George Thompson, shipbuilding director, has moved to the Barrow-in-Furness
company VSEL as project director for the Ministry of Defence helicopter
carrier contract whose loss triggered Swans' receivership.
Mr Fred Oman, formerly Swans' frigates project director, is now a consultant
to VSEL on surface ships.
Some technical staff have moved to Clyde-based Kvaerner Govan to work on the
helicopter carrier contract, won by a VSEL-Kvaerner consortium.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, who this month met European competition
commissioner Mr Karel van Miert to press Swans' case for an intervention
funding subsidy, has told the unions Mr Van Miert wants 'additional
consultation'.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Jobless scheme is 'sabotaged'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The academic who invented Workstart, the scheme for reducing the number of
long-term unemployed introduced in the Budget last March, has accused the
Department of Employment of sabotaging it.
Professor Dennis Snower, of London University's Birkbeck College, says the
scheme has been 'flagrantly mis-designed' with the intention that it should
fail.
Prof Snower's idea was that the long-term unemployed should be able to offer
a large proportion of whatever benefits they received to a prospective
employer as a subsidy.
He was unhappy when, in four Workstart pilot schemes in south London, Devon
and Cornwall, Tyneside and east Kent, with 1,000 places, the unemployed were
only able to offer a subsidy of Pounds 60 per week for six months and Pounds
30 per week for the following six months.
The employment department said that take-up had indeed been low - only about
108 people compared with the target of 1,000 - but said employers had been
offering unsuitable vacancies. 'There have been some successes, such as an
ex-offender who had been unemployed for seven years, and interest is now
growing,' said the department.
But one official confirmed that there was no great enthusiasm for the
Workstart scheme in the department because the idea had been tried before
with limited success, and had been forced on it by the Treasury.
Officials say that in many cases unemployed people would have been hired
even without the subsidy. 'We've had several schemes like this over the last
20 years and none of them have been very effective,' said one official.
Prof Snower is convinced that the low take-up for the scheme is the result
of inter-departmental politics. He said: 'They have not advertised the
scheme properly. In some areas you have to be unemployed for four years. And
they are not letting employers and workers make their own arrangements.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / MPs vote to reform shop laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons last night voted by 311 to 26, a majority of 285, to reform
Britain's antiquated and widely ignored Sunday shopping laws.
The vote, on the second reading of the Sunday Trading bill, was hailed as a
historic breakthrough by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, a key retail
pressure group.
The council, which represents mainly large stores, said the vote was 'a
clear indication that when it comes to choosing between the three options
for change, MPs will again do what shoppers and shopworkers alike are
demanding'.
The future of Sunday shopping was left wide open, however, by the
announcement of complex procedural arrangements for the passage of the bill
through the House.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, opening the debate, confirmed that
Conservative MPs would have a free vote on three options for de-regulation:
Full de-regulation, supported by Mr Howard, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, and some other ministers.
Limited opening for small shops, DIY shops and centres, with unrestricted
opening on four Sundays before Christmas - supported by the Keep Sunday
Special campaign and the Retailers for Shops Act Reform pressure group of
smaller shops.
Unrestricted trading hours for small shops, with a six-hour limit on larger
stores - supported by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, mainly representing
chain stores.
The Commons will choose one of the options during the line-by-line committee
stage debate, which will be taken on the floor of the House to give all MPs
a chance to vote.
The procedure adopted by the government will require MPs to vote in sequence
on three groups of amendments to the bill, each of which would implement one
of the options.
This means that the first option to gain a majority of votes will be chosen
even if a greater number of MPs supports an alternative option which has not
been voted on.
Mr Howard said: 'It is not a question of which option gets the biggest vote.
Conceivably, only one option will be voted on if that secures a majority.'
The procedural mechanism means that the choice of option could, in practice,
rest with Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, who will determine the order in
which amendments are debated.
Mr Howard said the government would adopt a neutral approach to the options
to encourage parliament to end the 'muddle' which has developed over Sunday
trading since the defeat of the last attempt at reform in 1986.
'The government's aims are straightforward,' he said. 'We want parliament to
choose one of these options. We want that option, whatever it is, to work in
practice and command the respect throughout the country which the current
regime sadly lacks.'
The government has resisted Labour pressure for a free vote for Tory MPs on
the employment protection provisions of the bill, which will apply to
whichever option is chosen.
Employment rights are expected to emerge as a key issue during the passage
of the bill, in spite of government assurances that shopworkers' rights to
refuse to work on Sundays will be protected.
The government has refused to accept calls from Usdaw, the shopworkers'
union, for compulsory premium payments for Sunday working.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said reform was urgent because the law
had been widely ignored.

The Crown had wanted Mr Roger Levitt tried on a 'number of charges', Sir

'The charge upon which he was tried was a single charge,' Sir Derek said.
He added: 'The Crown wanted him tried on a number of charges, and they
argued strongly for the inclusion in the indictment of a number of charges.
'After the indictment had been reduced to a single charge, they argued
strongly for the inclusion in the trial of a wide range of evidence. The

FT  30 NOV 93 / Abu Dhabi firm on BCCI payout
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Abu Dhabi, majority shareholder in the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, appears to have ruled out any increase in
payments it would make to compensate creditors.
It yesterday rejected any suggestion that it was preparing to raise its
payments as part of a negotiated settlement with the liquidators to the
bank.
Speculation has surrounded the shape of new proposals since the unexpected
decision of the Luxembourg Appeal Court at the end of last month to reject
an agreement between Abu Dhabi and the liquidators.
Abu Dhabi is believed to have ruled out any increase in its contribution
from between Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) and Dollars 2.2bn, which it would
have paid in exchange for a waiver of legal claims against it.
It said it was 'considering options to overcome the technical problems
thrown up' by the court.

<TEXT>
Coca-Cola has become for the first time Britain's biggest-selling grocery
brand, toppling Unilever's Persil detergent which has fallen to third place
after arch rival Ariel, made by Procter &amp; Gamble, Guy de Jonquieres writes.
Coca-Cola, which had UK supermarket sales of Pounds 247m in the year to
August, topped an annual list of 100 grocery brands compiled by Nielsen, the
market research firm, and Checkout magazine.
The fastest-growing brand was Muller yoghurt, sales of which rose 32 per
cent. Unilever had 13 of the top 100 brands, the most for any company,
followed by P&amp;G with nine and Mars and Kellogg with six brands each.
In spite of increased competition from private-label and discount products,
sales of the top 100 brands rose 2.6 per cent in the year to Pounds 6.4bn.

FT  30 NOV 93 / NHS executive pay rises alarm ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Health ministers were said to be 'extremely unhappy' yesterday about recent
pay rises for senior National Health Service managers. This follows reports
that the average salary increase for hospital trust chief executives in the
past 12 months was about 9 per cent.
The government yesterday gave public support to the rises, arguing that top
NHS managers did a 'very difficult job' and that their salaries amounted to
only a fraction of the total bill for any hospital.
But Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, was said to be concerned about
the increases. The government is trying to impose a wage freeze on most
public-sector workers next year.
Officials said she would 'let her feelings be known' at meetings with NHS
trust managers.
The government has no formal role in setting pay levels for managers in
hospital or service trusts, but officials said yesterday that Sir Duncan
Nichol, NHS chief executive, would soon urge trust chairmen to publish
salary figures for top managers in their annual reports.
It was emphasised that trusts could not expect to be competitive in the
de-regulated NHS if they continued to pay high salaries to top managers.
According to Incomes Data Services, an independent group of researchers,
average pay for NHS trust managers ranged from Pounds 46,567 for those
running ambulance trusts to Pounds 73,727 for those in charge of general
acute units.
The chief executive at Guy's and Lewisham in London received a 33 per cent
rise in 1992-93, the biggest increase.
Yesterday Mr Tom Sackville, a junior health minister, backed the pay rises,
saying that few people could do the jobs involved. 'This is a very difficult
job and we need top-line managers,' he said.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'It is an insult to
patients and staff that this pay should have risen more than for those who
are doing the hard job, day in, day out, nursing or caring for patients.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / Expenditure watchdog attacks market testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The introduction of market testing into the civil service is making it
harder to keep track of public expenditure, says Sir John Bourn, head of the
National Audit Office.
The office, which is parliament's public expenditure watchdog, has no right
of access to the books of companies that win contracts for providing public
services, Sir John told the Commons public accounts committee yesterday.
Sir John contrasted his lack of power to inspect contractors' papers with
those of the Audit Commission, which has the right of access in auditing
local authority and health service activities.
Apart from the defence and transport ministries, most departments and
agencies had no experience in letting contracts, Sir John told the MPs. The
NAO was keen to monitor the great expansion in the programme, which he
regarded as 'an area of concern'.
Sir John said that the NAO should be given more auditing work for more than
1,400 central government quangos. Most of these non-departmental public
bodies are audited by private-sector accountancy firms, chosen by the
secretary of state in charge of their sponsoring department in consultation
with the Treasury.
Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the committee, expressed concern about the
way that accountancy firms used audits to win more lucrative consultancy
work.
Mr Terry Davis, Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, said opportunities to
find ways of improving value for money in public services could be lost by
excluding the NAO, which could generalise from the experience of several
cases.
Sir John also said the office was paying increasing attention to examining
the vulnerability of management systems to fraud. There was a rising
incidence of white-collar crime associated with computers, he said.

FT  30 NOV 93 / City foresees life ban on Levitt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation is mounting in the City that Mr Roger Levitt, chairman of the
collapsed Levitt Group, will be the first individual banned for life from
the investment business.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has the
power under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act to ban individuals who
it considers have damaged investors' interests severely, but it has never
used those powers.
The chairman of one self-regulating organisation said yesterday: 'Mr Levitt
is a classic example of where Section 59 ought to apply.'
SIB declined yesterday to say whether it intended to apply Section 59 in the
Levitt case.
The use of Section 59 in the Levitt case would meet concern in the financial
services sector that the light sentence given to Mr Levitt has undermined
the regulators' position and that a sterner deterrent to such conduct is
needed.
Leading City figures have expressed frustration at the sentencing of Mr
Levitt to 180 hours of community service for misleading regulators about his
company's health.
The company later collapsed with debts of Pounds 34m, causing millions of
pounds of losses to individual investors.
The Investors Compensation Scheme, funded by a levy on the industry, paid
out Pounds 616,000 to 25 investors, most of whom lost far more than the
Pounds 47,000 ceiling on claims.
Mr Joel Joffe, former deputy chairman of life insurer Allied Dunbar, said
the sentence given to Mr Levitt would 'do great harm to the regulatory
system'.
Mr Garry Heath, the chief executive of the National Federation of
Independent Financial Advisers, said the regulator had acted properly. He
said: 'The judge has let us down.'
Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for financial advisers, yesterday
said it could only re-emphasise that it was disappointed that the tough
action by the regulators had not been mirrored by the sentence. 'On the
positive side, Mr Levitt's company was stopped from trading three years ago
by Fimbra, which shows the need for effective regulation to be there to stop
those unfit to do business. In this and many other cases, we can stop them
for good.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / Three faults caused big Tube breakdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of three separate failures was responsible for the
unprecedented breakdown which crippled a large part of the London
underground network during the past six days, it was revealed yesterday.
Much of the blame for the widespread failure was traced to two burnt-out
cables in one of the two power stations supplying the network. But a fault
in a cable running from the second power station and a defective transformer
elsewhere combined to bring the system down, London Underground said.
These faults led to the most serious breakdown on the Underground network
since the second world war and prompted calls for increased spending on its
ageing infrastructure. At one stage 20,000 people were trapped in trains in
tunnels.
London Underground said it expected to operate a full service from today.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said investment in the Underground
was at its highest level for three decades in spite of complaints in the
Commons from Labour MPs.
Mr MacGregor also said that modernisation of the Central Line, which was at
the heart of last week's chaos, amounted to Pounds 750m and was due to
finish in 1995.
Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, London Underground managing director, said Mr
MacGregor was right, but that there were 30 years of underspending to make
up. In addition, annual spending of up to Pounds 800m promised in 1991 had
since been reduced by more than Pounds 200m a year.
'If we had received the money we were promised, the power supply system
would have been more up-to-date,' he said. 'It is unattractive spending,
with no charisma, but it is vital.'
London Underground put the cost of the breakdown at Pounds 2m, because of
lost revenue, ticket-holder compensation and the cost of 24-hour engineering
work needed to track down the fault.
The problems of the past six days might have been avoided if London
Underground had been able to take power directly from the national grid, but
only parts of the network are connected, Mr Tunnicliffe said. It is working
on a project which will allow the entire Underground to draw on the grid.
Engineers had originally been looking for the fault at the eastern end of
the network. But discovered from data print-outs that the main problem,
burnt-out cable, was at its Lots Road power station in Chelsea, west London.
The Central Line had been worst affected because the equipment for shutting
down the line in the event of a leakage of current was very old. It is to be
replaced next year.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Debts of Pounds 34m before collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the legality of Mr Roger Levitt's financial manoeuvres, the Levitt
Group was in dire trouble, with debts of Pounds 34m, before its final
collapse in December 1990.
Salaries and other costs were wildly out of control. Sales figures were
boosted in unorthodox ways, giving a falsely optimistic impression of the
company's actual business. In addition, the company's internal book-keeping
was, by common consent, a complete mess.
According to the Serious Fraud Office, the company made a loss of Pounds 13m
between January 1989 and June 1990 and was heading for the rocks.
The total prosecution case against Mr Levitt, intended to be brought in two
trials, alleged widespread fraud by him and others in an attempt to keep the
company going.
The substance of the raft of criminal charges involved:
Improper inducements to attract investors' funds.
The routing of investors' money into the Levitt Group's company account to
keep it afloat.
The misrepresentation by Mr Levitt of Pounds 21m obtained through loans and
other sources as the result of genuine business.
The falsification of documents to turn the Pounds 13m loss into a Pounds 13m
profit, presenting the outside world with a false picture of the company's
viability.
The deception of Fimbra to maintain membership of the regulatory body.
The last charge was the only one to which Mr Levitt pleaded guilty. The
others have been left on the file, not to be acted upon. Mr Levitt maintains
his innocence with regard to these.
The Levitt Group went into liquidation owing money to assorted creditors.
The largest of these, technically, was Mr Levitt himself, owed some Pounds
22m as a result of investments in his company made in his own name. These
transactions, however, were the subject of some of the charges that will not
now be pursued.
The next largest creditors were Barclays and Midland banks, which had both
extended overdraft facilities of Pounds 4.5m. Other creditors included the
Inland Revenue, which was owed Pounds 1.5m.
The rest was made up of smaller creditors, including some 50 individuals. A
number of these later received compensation totalling Pounds 625,000 through
the Investors' Compensation Scheme. The largest individual investor was the
writer, Mr Frederick Forsyth, who lost some Pounds 900,000 through his
involvement in the company.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Second review of two counties is ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, yesterday ordered another review of
local government structure in Derbyshire and County Durham.
The move underlines the government's determination to do away with the
two-tier system of county and district councils used in rural England and
replace them with all-purpose 'unitary' authorities.
It also further undermines the position of the Local Government Commission,
chaired by Sir John Banham, charged with advising the government on the
review.
Sir John had recommended continuing the two-tier system in parts of both
counties, although he had suggested unitary status for Darlington, Derby,
and north-east Derbyshire.
His recommendations were made before Mr Gummer announced revised guidance
which made it clear that he expected unitary authorities to be the norm.
Uncertainty over local government in the two counties could now continue for
at least another year.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Prison officers can 'stop admittances'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prison officers have some legal powers which may have the effect of
disrupting admissions to prisons, an emergency conference of their union was
told yesterday.
Lawyers told delegates it was within officers' powers to refuse to allow new
inmates into overcrowded jails on the grounds that there was a risk of a
disturbance.
The High Court has ruled that the Prison Officers Association cannot call on
members to refuse admissions as part of their campaign against privatisation
of prisons. It ruled that prison officers had the legal status of
constables.
The POA executive yesterday argued that this legal status meant that
officers had a duty to prevent breaches of the peace. Mr John Bartell, the
POA chairman, said: 'Where officers believe there are likely to be
disturbances or disruption, they will be within their rights not to let new
inmates in. I have every reason to believe that will happen.'
The POA's tough response could signal a fresh period of prison service
unrest, first triggered by the High Court injunction which blocked the use
of locking out prisoners as a form of industrial action.
But the Home Office last night argued that the court ruling did not imply
any changes in the duties of prison officers, and it said officers had the
powers and privileges of a constable only when carrying out their duties as
laid down in prison rules. 'Preventing a breach of the peace is not
something that comes within their duties,' it said.
The Home Office insisted that it had no desire to take away prison officers'
employment protection rights when it sought the court injunction.
Mr Derek Lewis, director general of the Prison Service, said he hoped to
resume talks with the POA to place industrial relations on a 'proper
footing'.
He said the court ruling meant that a change in the law would probably be
needed for employment protection rights to be restored. Some trade unions
fear the government may try to legislate to prevent strikes in essential
services.
Mr Lewis said: 'We have made it crystal clear that we want the Prison
Officers Association and the Prison Governors Association and other unions
to continue to play an active part in the prison service.'
The status of the POA has also been called into question because most of its
members are classed as constables, and industrial relations law says a trade
dispute can only involve people classed as 'workers'. The Prison Governors'
Association is similarly affected.
The certification office of the Trade Union and Employers Associations is
reviewing the union's status. Mr Graham Osborne, assistant certification
officer, said: 'The judge has said they are not workers and if they are not
workers, they are not a trade union and if they are not a trade union they
cannot be on the list of trade unions.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / Unions sue over Tupe work rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five unions yesterday issued writs against the government for failing
properly to implement the European Union's Acquired Rights Directive which
provides certain protections to employees in the event of a transfer of
ownership.
The government has recently rectified its implementation of the directive by
extending coverage to public-sector employees. But such employees who were
not covered between 1981 and 1993, and who suffered as a result, might be
able to claim damages after a ruling in the European Court of Justice.
The five unions - Unison, the public-service union; the TGWU and GMB general
unions; NUCPS, the civil service union; and the Northern Ireland Public
Service Alliance - have issued writs on behalf of 128 affected individuals.
The unions say that tens of thousands of people may have claims but that a
'negotiated settlement' is still on the table. The writs have been issued
now because any claims had to be registered within three months of the Trade
Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 coming into operation. That act
corrected the omission of 'non-commercial' ventures from the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (Tupe), which
implemented the Acquired Rights Directive into British law.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The IRA Connection: Sinn Fein rails at Britain over
'duplicity'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SINN FEIN, the IRA's political wing, yesterday accused the British
government of duplicity, while at the same time declaring that it remained
committed to helping secure peace in Northern Ireland.
Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein chief of staff, said last night: 'Patrick
Mayhew read a text which he claims to be a communication sent by me to the
British government in late February. I totally refute his claim. The text he
read is a counterfeit. No such communication was ever sent.
'It is a lie, yet another lie which has emanated from Patrick Mayhew and
John Major in recent times.'
His comparison of the version of a March 19 document indicated 'they are now
counterfeiting their own documents to meet their current needs'.
He said the version of a communication sent by Sinn Fein to Sir Patrick on
May 10, and the circumstances surrounding it, were 'equally at variance with
the truth and will be proved to be so'.
He added: 'His claim that a communication of November 2 to the British
Government was from Sinn Fein is equally bogus.'
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused the British government of being
behind the leaking by unionist politicians of details of secret talks
between intermediaries and Sinn Fein. He said that the aim was to divert
'public attention from IRA conditions for peace and to sow confusion and
division among republicans.'
Four hours before Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, spoke
to the Commons, Mr Adams held a press conference in Belfast to release three
documents - two from UK government representatives and one from Sinn Fein.
He said they made clear that 'the British were quite blatantly abusing the
lines of communication for their own narrow short-term interests'.
But he produced no documents to support his central allegation that an IRA
offer in March of a two-week ceasefire in return for talks had been rejected
by the UK government for 'internal political reasons', missing an
opportunity for peace days before the IRA's Bishopsgate bomb attack.
Neither the press conference nor the documents drew attention to the fact
that the IRA had continued its bombing campaign in the province and on the
mainland.
The press conference was preceded by an IRA attack on a police barracks in
Belfast. The attack was small and caused no injuries, consistent with the
IRA's apparent decision not to mount a spectacular attack prior to the
Dublin summit. But it was a reminder of its capacity to act in the absence
of a political breakthrough.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The IRA Connection: Extracts from the talks - the British
government's version
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JANUARY 11 1993: Sir Patrick Mayhew says that pressure within the IRA for an
end to violence is mounting
FEBRUARY 22: Oral message from Provisional Movement leaders:
The conflict is over but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.
We wish to have an unannounced ceasefire in order to hold dialogue leading
to peace. We cannot announce such a move as it will lead to confusion for
the volunteers because the press will misinterpret it as a surrender. We
cannot meet secretary of state's public renunciation of violence, but it
would be given privately as long as we were sure that we were not being
tricked.
FEBRUARY 26: Warrington bomb explodes gasworks.
A British government message:
We understand and appreciate the seriousness of what has been said. We wish
to take it seriously and at face value. That will of course be influenced by
events on the ground over the coming days and weeks . . . It is not possible
to give a substantive reply immediately.
MARCH 5: Message from Provisional leaders:
We would like two representatives, Martin McGuinness and Gerry Kelly, to
have an exploratory meeting with you as soon as possible.
MARCH 7: IRA bomb injures 4 policemen in Bangor
MARCH 11: British message:
In the light of the continued violence of recent days since the first
response we are not yet able to send a substantive response.
MARCH 19: British message:
1. The importance of what has been said, the wish to take it seriously, and
the influence of events on the ground, have been acknowledged.
2. It is essential that there should be no deception on either side.
3. The position of the British government on dealing with those who espouse
violence is clearly understood . . . We confirm that if violence had
genuinely been brought to an end, whether or not that fact had been
announced, then dialogue could take place.
4. Once a halt to activity became public, the government would have to
acknowledge and defend its entry into dialogue.
It would do so by pointing out that its agreement to exploratory dialogue .
. . had been given because . . . it had received a private assurance that
organised violence had been brought to an end.
5. The British government has made clear that:
No political objective which is advocated by constitutional means alone
could properly be excluded from discussion.
The commitment to return as much responsibility as possible to local
politicians should be seen within a wider framework.
New political arrangements would be designed to ensure that no legitimate
group was excluded from eligibility to share in the exercise of this
responsibility.
In the event of a genuine and established ending of violence, the whole
range of responses to it would inevitably be looked at afresh.
6. The British government . . . wants to see included in this process all
main parties which have sufficiently shown they genuinely do not espouse
violence.
7. The British government cannot enter a talks process . . . with the
purpose of achieving a predetermined outcome.
It has accepted that the eventual outcome of such a process could be a
united Ireland, but only on the basis of the consent of the people of
Northern Ireland.
But unless the people of Northern Ireland come to express such a view, the
British government will continue to uphold the union.
8. Evidence on the ground that any group had ceased violent activity would
induce resulting reduction of security force activity.
9. It is important to establish whether this provides a basis for the way
forward. We are ready to answer specific questions or to give further
explanation.
MARCH 20: Warrington bomb explodes in shopping centre.
MARCH 22: Oral message from Provisional leaders:
The last thing we needed at this sensitive time was what has happened. It is
the fate of history that we find ourselves in this position, all we can
think of at this time is an old Irish proverb: 'God's hand works in
mysterious ways.' Our hope is that this hand will lead to peace and
friendship.
APRIL 10: SDLP leader John Hume meets Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams.
APRIL 24: Bishopsgate bomb explodes in City of London.
MAY 10: Message from Provisonal leaders:
We welcome face-to-face exchanges with your representative . . . We wish now
to proceed without delay to the delegation meetings . . . We would like to
nominate someone to liaise with Martin McGuinness on this.
We also have a number of questions:
(a) Who will represent you?
(b) When will the British government be politically represented in this
process and by whom?
(c) We need clarification of the phrase 'progressive entry into dialogue'.
(d) When will this start?
(e) Where is the proposed venue?
It would be more practical and quicker if these details could be agreed
directly with Mr McGuinness.
UK government note: The 'face-to-face exchanges with your representative'
referred to in the first sentence was the unauthorised meeting between Mr
McGuinness and a British official.
MAY 20: 1,000lb bomb explodes in Belfast, injuring 20.
JUNE 1: Message from Provisional leaders:
The Provisional leadership is dismayed that it has not yet received a formal
reply to its offer.
JULY 22: Message from Provisional leadership:
4. British sovereignty over the six counties, as with all of Ireland before
partition, is the inherent cause of political instability and conflict. This
must be addressed.
5. We seek to assist the establishment of, and to support, a process which .
. . culminates in . . . the end of your jurisdiction.
6. We believe that the wish of the majority of the Irish people is for Irish
unity.
7. Your disavowal of any prior objective is contradicted by your commitment
to uphold the unionist veto. The consequence of upholding the veto is, in
effect, to set as your objective maintenance of partition and the six-county
statelet . . .
The potentially historic opportunity which this represents for the cause of
peace in Ireland should not be lost. We have outlined our position. You have
outlined yours.
It is now time to move on. You should arrange for us to do so as speedily as
possible.
JULY 17: British message:
There was no ulterior motive in any delay . . . Although it was absolutely
clear from the attacks which took place in March that events on the ground
could halt progress, these attacks following the May elections went ahead .
. .
Does the ending of conflict remain your objective, and is there a way
forward?
JULY 23: Major wins vote of confidence.
AUGUST 14: Message from Provisional leadership:
You asserted the belief that a two-week suspension to accommodate talks
would result in republicans being persuaded that there is no further need
for armed struggle. Because of our commitment to a lasting settlement . . .
we sought and received a commitment to facilitate that step. You failed to
grasp that opportunity.
As for events on the ground. The greatest number of fatalities for some time
now in the conflict have resulted from the actions of loyalist groups acting
both on their own agenda and as surrogates for British intelligence . . .
SEPTEMBER 3: British message:
The importance of clear mutual understanding has already been recognised.
Minds do not seem to be meeting at the moment. This needs to be over-come.
The note you sent on August 14 did not . . . confirm that you envisage a
peace process which is aimed at an inclusive political process and that a
lasting end to violence does not depend on your analysis being endorsed as
the only way forward . . . On a further point in it, the government side has
not asserted a belief that a two-week suspension would have the result
described . . . Can you confirm that you want a peace process which is aimed
at an inclusive political process and that a lasting end to violence does
not depend on your analysis being endorsed as the only way forward?
OCTOBER 23: IRA bomb in Protestant Shankhill Road kills 10 inlcuding one
bomber.
OCTOBER 27: Gerry Adams helps carry the bomber's coffin.
OCTOBER 29: John Major and Albert Reynolds set out six guiding principles
for a settlement at Brussels summit.
OCTOBER 30: Seven murdered by loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters in Greysteel.
NOVEMBER 2: Message from Provisional leaders:
This problem cannot be solved by the Reynolds-Spring situation, although
they're part of it. You appear to have rejected the Hume-Adams situation
though they too are part of it . . . Now we can't even have dialogue to work
out how a total end to all violence can come about.
We believe that the country could be at the point of no return. In plain
language please tell us though as a matter of urgency when you will open
dialogue in the event of a total end to hostilities.
We believe that if all the documents involved are put on the table -
including your nine-paragrapher and our May 10 - that we have the basis of
an understanding.
NOVEMBER 5: British message:
1. Your message of November 2 is taken as being of the greatest importance
and significance.
2. We hold to what was said jointly and in public by the prime minister and
the Taoiseach in Brussels on October 29. A copy of the statement is annexed.
3. Any dialogue could only follow a permanent end to violent activity.
4. If, as you have offered, you were to give us an unequivocal assurance
that violence has indeed been brought to a permanent end, and that
accordingly Sinn Fein is now committed to political progress by peaceful and
democratic means alone, we will make clear publicly our commitment to enter
exploratory dialogue with you.
Our public statement will make clear that, provided your private assurance
is promptly confirmed publicly after our public statement and that events on
the ground are fully consistent with this, a first meeting for exploratory
dialogue will take place within a week of parliament's return in January.
5. Exploratory dialogue will have the following purposes:
(i) To explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to be admitted to
an inclusive political talks process . . . but without anticipating the
negotiations within that process.
(ii) To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a period to play
the same part as the current constitutional parties in the public life of
Northern Ireland.
(iii) To examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence.
6. The attached Annex summarises the sequence of events and provides answers
to the procedural questions concerning exploratory dialogue which have been
raised.
7. If, in advance of our public statement, any public statement is made on
your behalf which appears to us inconsistent with this basis for proceeding
it would not be possible for us then to proceed.
8. If we receive the necessary assurance, which you have offered, that
violence has been brought to an end, we shall assume that you are assenting
to the basis for proceeding explained in this note and its attachment.
The procedural annexe included the following points:
2. The sequence of events would be as follows:
(i) There is an unequivocal private assurance that violence has been brought
to a permanent end, and accordingly that Sinn Fein has affirmed that it is
henceforth committed to political progress by peaceful and democratic means
alone.
(ii) Soon after receiving the necessary satisfactory assurance, and on the
assumption that events on ground are consistent with this assurance, we will
make a public statement indicating our agreement in principle to enter
exploratory dialogue in January provided the private assurance is promptly
confirmed publicly and continues to be demonstrated on the ground.
(iii) If a genuine end to violence is brought about within the next few
days, a first meeting for exploratory dialogue would take place within a
week of parliament's return in January.
3. At the first meeting of exploratory dialogue each party could field up to
three delegates to be seated at the table. The possible need for the
additional presence of advisers on each side is something which could be
addressed at the logistical meeting.
4. It is for each party to decide who should represent it at this and at
subsequent meetings . . . It is assumed that each party will wish its
representatives to have the seniority appropriate to its authorised
representatives.
The British side will be represented by senior officials acting under
political authority and direction . . .

FT  30 NOV 93 / The IRA Connection: Mayhew chronicles the years of secret
contact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A chain of communications existed between the IRA and the British government
for some years, and messages were conveyed indirectly in secrecy, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons yesterday.
'Clearly such a chain could only function if its secrecy was respected on
both sides,' he said in a statement.
In February a message from the IRA stated that it wanted a ceasefire so that
it could begin a dialogue with the government, leading to peace. But it said
it could not make such a move public - it argued that to do so would lead to
confusion for the IRA volunteers, as the press would interpret it as a
surrender.
'We cannot meet secretary of state's public renunciation of violence, but it
would be given privately as long as we were sure that we were not being
tricked,' it said.
Sir Patrick said the government had a duty to respond to the message as it
came from Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief of staff. The government
responded on March 19, confirming that if violence had 'genuinely' been
brought to an end, whether or not that fact had been announced, dialogue
could take place.
The government had also made clear in the same message that 'no political
objective which is advocated by constitutional means alone could properly be
excluded from discussion in the talks process'.
It said Sir Patrick had 'no blueprint' and that the government wanted an
agreed accommodation, not an imposed settlement.
In his statement, Sir Patrick said the government had accepted that the
outcome of such a process could be a united Ireland, but only with the
consent of the people of Northern Ireland.
'Should this be the eventual outcome of a peaceful democratic process, the
British government would bring forward legislation to implement the will of
the people here,' he said.
However, unless the people of the province came to express such a view, Sir
Patrick made clear that the government would continue to uphold the Union.
He insisted: 'It is clear that this message was consistent with our declared
policy: namely that if such people wanted to enter into talks or
negotiations with the government they first had genuinely to end violence -
not just temporarily, but for good.'
Sir Patrick said the IRA's reply on May 10 'did not constitute the
unequivocal assurance of a genuine end to violence on which we had
insisted'. A temporary ceasefire would not do.
Substantive contact resumed on November 2, when the IRA sent a message
warning that Northern Ireland could be 'at the point of no return' and
asking when dialogue would be opened. Sir Patrick said yesterday that the
government's reply sent on November 5 said: 'Your message of November 2 is
taken as being of the greatest importance and significance.'
He said it repeated the government's insistence that there could be 'no
secret agreements or understandings between governments and organisations
supporting violence as a price for its cessation'.
He said the reply insisted dialogue could only follow a permanent end to
violent activity. Then a meeting could take place within a week of
parliament's return in January.
'It is for the IRA and their supporters to explain why they have failed to
deliver the promised ending of violence. They should do so at once.'
Sir Patrick concluded by saying that if an end to violence was promised, the
way would still be open for Sinn Fein to enter the political arena 'after a
sufficient interval to demonstrate that they mean it'.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The IRA Connection: Paisley suspended from Commons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rev Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionists, was yesterday
suspended from the Commons for accusing the government of 'falsehoods'.
Mr Paisley challenged Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary:
'The people of Northern Ireland today demand that you explain why you issued
falsehoods yourself, got officials to issue falsehoods, and Downing Street
backed up those falsehoods.'
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, intervened and asked Mr Paisley to
withdraw the word falsehoods since it meant only one thing: 'lies'.
After he refused to do so the Speaker again intervened to insist he withdraw
the word 'falsehood'.
But he told her: 'Because of the seriousness of the situation, I cannot
oblige you. And I stand by what I said - it was a falsehood. It was worse -
it was a lie.'
Miss Boothroyd then ordered Mr Paisley under Commons standing orders to
leave the precincts of the Palace of Westminster for the rest of the working
day.
When the DUP leader remained in his seat, she named him and Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the Commons, put the motion that led to Mr Paisley's suspension.
The vote was overwhelmingly carried and Mr Paisley left the chamber.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The IRA Connection: Commons backs lines of communication
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday received the
overwhelming backing of the House of Commons for the lines of communication
that he admitted had been established between the government and the IRA.
Ministers were relieved to hear no criticism from Mr James Molyneaux, leader
of the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Molyneaux reserved his anger for Mr Kevin
McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, whom he accused of acting
as a spokesman for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
The government also received crucial support from its right wing. Mr Andrew
Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench committee on Northern Ireland
and a prominent supporter of the union with Northern Ireland, said Sir
Patrick had acted 'entirely correctly and honourably'.
The Labour party also supported the government's approach. Mr McNamara
referred to the government's 'recent mishandling of these matters', but said
it should not deter ministers 'from believing that risk-taking is essential
if progress is to be achieved'.
Opposition to the government came mainly from a combination of the
Democratic Unionists, led by the Reverend Ian Paisley, and Labour
leftwingers. This was reflected in the votes of 16 Labour MPs who joined
eight Northern Ireland unionists in opposing Mr Paisley's suspension from
the Commons.
Mr Dennis Skinner, the Labour leftwinger, told Sir Patrick: 'In this
democracy, when ministers say that they are doing one thing and yet behind
the people's backs they are doing another, then there is a question of
honour and resignation.'
To Conservative protests Mr Skinner insisted: 'You ought to do the
honourable thing and resign.'
Mr Ken Livingstone, another Labour leftwinger, recalled that he had faced
condemnation from successive Northern Ireland secretaries and from former
prime minister Baroness Thatcher when he held talks with Sinn Fein.
The Reverend William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, said the
IRA and Sinn Fein had been 'playing the government along'.
Mr Doug Hoyle, Labour MP for Warrington North, said he and the people of his
town wanted peace. 'But there was a feeling of outrage and revulsion there
that contacts took place with Sinn Fein two days after the bombing in
Warrington in which two small boys died and 56 people were injured - and one
of those boys was still fighting for his life,' he said.
The government received the support of Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of
the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, who told Sir Patrick:
'You were right to enter the deliberations you entered into. Had you not
done so, it would have been a dereliction of duty on your part.'

FT  30 NOV 93 / Labour urges Clarke to provide investment boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to abandon the
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and to deliver a substantial
increase in investment in his first Budget today.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, told a meeting of backbench Labour
MPs that the Budget should maintain public services, introduce an emergency
job-creation programme and rebuild Britain's social and economic fabric.
Mr Brown also released a pamphlet, published by the Tribune group, setting
out details of his claim that tax revenues could be increased by Pounds 10bn
by closing tax loopholes.
The pamphlet argues for abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme, reform
of corporation tax, withdrawal of government plans to abolish stamp duty on
share transactions and a windfall tax on the profits of privatised
utilities.
In his speech Mr Brown said tax loopholes allowed many millionaires to pay
little or no tax, while many companies avoided their full share of taxation
by using offshore tax havens.
Mr Brown said that typical families already faced tax increases of Pounds
8.50 a week as a result of the last Budget. The imposition of VAT on
domestic fuel would further weaken those least able to cope.
Mr Brown said that tax reform would generate substantial funds to finance
both the abolition of VAT on domestic fuel and a 'business plan for Britain'
which would help create jobs and increase investment.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Nissan UK suffers 61% fall in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan UK, the former importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles which is
controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, suffered a 61.3 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 24.87m in the year to the end of July 1992 from Pounds
64.2m a year earlier.
The company, which was at the heart of Britain's biggest corporate tax
fraud, is fighting in the High Court against a petition from the Inland
Revenue seeking to put it into liquidation.
The High Court has appointed Mr Colin Bird and Mr Dipanka Ghosh of
accountants Price Waterhouse as provisional liquidators of Nissan UK.
This appointment was extended yesterday pending a hearing of the case.
Nissan UK is challenging the appointment of the provisional liquidators and
the winding-up petition.
According to the company's latest annual report, turnover in the year to
July 1992 fell by 47.7 per cent to Pounds 307.6m, from Pounds 588.6m a year
earlier.
The company was deprived from the end of 1991 of the lucrative franchise to
import and distribute Nissan vehicles in Britain.
According to its latest directors' report signed at the end of last month,
the company is now engaged chiefly in property and in the leasing of
dealerships to car retailers.
The report states that it intends 'to maximise income and profits from the
company's property portfolio in the hope that the market for retail garage
properties will improve'.
After losing the Nissan franchise, the company completed the disposal of its
parts business and remaining vehicle stocks by February this year, says the
report.
The previous seven-man board has been reduced to two. These are Mr Botnar
and Mr Manfred Weder, a Swiss lawyer.
The annual report shows that Mr Botnar was paid Pounds 316,000 by Nissan UK
in 1991-92. It also reveals that another unidentified director received
emoluments totalling Pounds 1.89m excluding pension.
Mr Botnar, aged 80, who remains chairman of the company, has been living in
Switzerland and has not returned to the UK since January 1992 when a warrant
was issued for his arrest.
The report shows that Mr Michael Hunt, former assistant managing director of
Nissan UK and a significant individual shareholder in Nissan UK Holdings,
resigned from the board on June 28. He was jailed on June 30 for eight years
for his part in the tax fraud. He is to appeal against both his conviction
and sentence.
Mr Hunt was convicted for conspiring to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 55m in
corporation tax.
The Revenue has issued an estimated assessment against the company of Pounds
238m, but the company claims in its latest annual report that it is
contesting 'vigorously' the assessment 'as having no basis in fact'.
Mr Hunt's co-defendant Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director with the
company, was sentenced to three years at the end of June after pleading
guilty before the trial began to one offence of cheating the Revenue.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Pressure mounts on Taiwan over tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US last week formally asked Taiwan to lower tariffs on 2,800 products
and to reduce its protection for other products, before being accepted into
membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, tabled the list of US demands
with Gatt a week after the Asian-Pacific summit, where the US made no
visible gains with China on trade. In fact, determined wooing of Taiwan's
rival by President Bill Clinton seemed to yield little in the political and
military facets of the bilateral relationship.
Mr Kantor asserted that the tabling 'should advance the accession process in
Geneva' for Taiwan. China has made known it will not tolerate Taiwan's
acceptance into Gatt before its own.
The US wish-list for Taiwan was formulated after 'substantial consultation
with the broad range of US private sector and Congressional interests,' who
represent companies hoping to sell into the Taiwanese market. It seeks a
reduction in tariff peaks, commitments to maintain current low tariff
levels, and the elimination of import bans, quotas and other non-tariff
restrictions - mostly on farm products - which Gatt prohibits.
US exports to Taiwan are expected to reach Dollars 16.9bn by the end of this
year. According to the US trade agency, fulfilment of the US request alone
would slice the average tariff in Taiwan by more than half and open major
new areas of the market to US goods.
Other Gatt members are expected to make similar requests of Taiwan over the
next several months.
A Gatt working party established to move Taiwan into the global trading club
has complained about restrictive market access practices and special
bilateral deals with the US. It raised questions about Taiwan's allegedly
discriminatory import tariff structure, burdensome import licensing
requirements, intellectual property violations, discriminatory government
procurement practices and investment barriers in the services sector.
Taiwanese trade officials say their country has made progress in reducing
protection. Its nominal industrial tariff was reduced from 24.4 per cent in
1986 to 6.5 per cent in 1992. Tariffs for farm goods were reduced from 34.8
per cent to 21.6 per cent.
Mr Kantor's office said it expected negotiations with Taiwan 'on the full
range of subject areas such as services and intellectual property which will
be within the Gatt's purview as a result of the Uruguay Round'.
After years of knocking at the door, Gatt accepted Taiwan's request for
negotiations for membership in September 1992. Taiwan offered to join as a
developed nation but said 'certain industries' would still require
protection. In the negotiations, it is expected to reduce its tariff and
other import barriers to the same level of protection maintained by other
developed economies and to match concessions offered by current Gatt members
in the Uruguay Round.
Besides China and Taiwan, Gatt is now considering 13 such membership
applications.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Fears grow over services liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade diplomats yesterday voiced fears that continuing differences between
the US and the European Union could sabotage ambitious plans to liberalise
services in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
With just two weeks of negotiating time left before the round ends in
mid-December, divisions between the two biggest traders over financial
services, ocean-going shipping and audio-visual services seem as intractable
as ever.
Negotiators say failure to resolve any one of these issues would almost
certainly lead to that sector being pulled off the table, with the risk that
the others would follow.
'We might end up having no deal at all in services', one senior trade
official warned yesterday, as US and EC services negotiators converged on
Geneva in an effort to make progress before tomorrow's crucial meeting in
Brussels between Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative.
In advance of the meeting, President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl
yesterday held a 30-minute telephone conversation during which they
discussed 'their mutual desire' for a Gatt deal, said a White House
spokeswoman.
Mr Lawrence Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs,
and Mr Rufus Yerxa, US deputy trade representative, yesterday met Mr Peter
Sutherland, head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and key
trading partners, including the EU, to explain Washington's controversial
plan for two-tier access to the US financial market.
The proposal, which has aroused a storm of protest from Gatt members, would
distinguish between countries that have or have not, in Washington's
judgment, made adequate market opening offers of their own. While all
countries would be given equal access to the present US market, only those
with adequate offers would be able to benefit from future liberalisation.
The EU has already said the two-tier idea is unacceptable, and a number of
developing countries have threatened to take their own financial services
offers off the table, the exact reverse of what the US hoped to achieve.
US officials stressed yesterday the alternative to the two-tier approach
could be a move to pull the entire sector out of the Uruguay Round accord.
The US financial services industry, once a prime mover in the round, now
says the offers by Japan and some other East Asian and Latin American
nations are too poor to justify opening the US market equally to all comers.
In the maritime sector, the US is holding firm in refusing to include
ocean-going shipping in its services liberalisation offer. EU officials, say
this sector is of vital importance for members Denmark and Greece, and they
may be obliged to pull audiovisual services out of the agreement if deep-sea
shipping is excluded.
The Commission is hoping to secure ministerial approval on Thursday for its
stance on audio-visual services, such as films and television programmes,
which would keep the sector within the services accord but with important
restrictions. These restrictions are certain to be opposed by Washington.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Paris call to boost dumping defences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France wants the European Union to come to a quick agreement to beef up its
defences against dumping and other unfair trade practices, as insurance
against the US agreeing to submit itself to tougher multilateral disciplines
in a new world trade organisation.
Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said in an interview with Les Echos, the
French business daily, that this issue would figure in today's Franco-German
summit in Bonn.
'We wish to share with the Germans the same vision, a non-protectionist
vision, but at the same time not one of the free market without any rules of
the game,' he said.
Increased French calls for the EU to reinforce its commercial defences do
not necessarily bode ill for a Gatt accord.
Indeed, to the extent that France gets concessions on this issue it will
need fewer concessions from the US on other issues.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil and China, two of the world's largest developing countries, have
signed two agreements in an effort to boost trade during a week-long visit
to Brazil by China's president Jiang Zemin and foreign minister Mr Qian
Qichen.
Trade between the two countries remains small but is increasing after
several years of decline and this year is expected to reach Dollars 1bn.
Brazilian exports of steel and primary products are growing, while Chinese
consumer goods have appeared in Brazilian shops as the country has lowered
tariff barriers.
China is to set up a joint venture to extract iron ore from the huge Carajas
mines in northern Brazil. This will be shipped to supply China's growing
steel industry.
The two sides have also agreed a Dollars 150m joint venture satellite
project, where the first of two planned Brazilian-owned satellites is
scheduled to be launched in October 1996 by a Chinese rocket.
The satellite will be used to monitor atmospheric pollution and forest
reserves.
John Burton adds from Seoul: Samsung Aerospace yesterday signed a memorandum
of understanding with Aviation Industries of China (Avic) to develop
mid-size commuter aircraft with 50 to 100 seats.
It is the third civilian aviation project to be announced in as many months
by a Korean company and the second involving Avic.
Daewoo Heavy Industries and Korean Air are also co-operating with Avic in
developing passenger jets with a 100-130 seat capacity.
The two Sino-Korean projects are meant to tap the potentially large aircraft
market in China, while reducing both countries' dependence on western
aircraft manufacturers by developing their own aerospace industries.
Samsung estimates that the Chinese demand for commuter airliners could reach
200-300 aircraft by 2010, while Korea may need 100.
The Phoenix project involving Samsung and Avic will begin development of the
airliners next year and plans to start production in 1998.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan may partially lift rice ban -
Compromise offer before Gatt deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan will present a compromise offer to partially lift its ban on rice
imports to its trade partners under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
talks early next month, government officials said yesterday.
After weeks of public denial that Japan and the US have been under
negotiations over a plan to open Japan's rice market, the government has
waited until the last minute before the December 15 deadline of the Uruguay
Round officially to reveal Japan's position.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the time had come for
the Japanese government to seriously sort out its opinions on the rice
issue. Japan is poised to propose a plan in which it will accept minimum
access of 4 to 8 per cent, and a six year moratorium period before
tarification of foreign rice imports.
The government is trying to convince those who oppose rice imports, by
stressing the danger of Japan being blamed for the failure of the talks if
it does not agree to a compromise deal on rice. Last weekend, Mr Takemura
said Japan could not break up the Uruguay Round, and it would have to allow
foreign access to the rice market. Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of
the Komeito, a member of the seven party government, also expressed support
for a compromise deal.
Mr Takemura said the partial lifting of the import ban would not contradict
a parliamentary resolution and an agreement within the coalition opposing
the replacement of the ban with tariffs.
The government faces staunch opposition from the Socialist party, also a
member of the coalition. The party has a large support base in rural areas
of Japan, and has threatened to walk out of the coalition if the government
reaches a decision to lift the import ban. Mr Takemura yesterday went out of
his way to try and win over the socialists.

FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: 'Bio-piracy' under new fire - Frances
Williams on concern at Gatt patents draft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed Uruguay Round accord to strengthen worldwide protection of
intellectual property, virtually unchallenged since it was drafted two years
ago, has resurfaced as a focus of discontent.
In a belated and almost certainly doomed effort to change the terms of the
accord before the global trade talks are due to end on December 15,
representatives from groups as diverse as Guaymi Indians in Panama, Indian
farmers and Latin American drugs manufacturers have been trooping through
Geneva to air their grievances.
Last week the pharmaceutical industries of Canada, Egypt, India and 13 Latin
American countries issued a chilling warning on the consequences of
obligatory protection of pharmaceutical patents. This, they claim, will
reinforce monopoly rights of the leading drugs multinationals, raise
domestic drugs prices by as much as 1,000 per cent, increase the costs of
essential health care and put much of their indigenous pharmaceutical
industries out of business.
In the past, industries in these countries have been able to copy patent
medicines, often without paying royalties, which has enabled them to produce
drugs cheaply for home consumption and undercut patent-holders in export
markets.
The new rules would stop unauthorised copying by placing strict limits on
government powers to license production of a patented drug without the
patent holder's consent. This would be possible on payment of an 'adequate'
royalty only if a company refused to authorise use of the patent 'on
reasonable commercial terms and conditions'.
Gatt officials concede that industries in countries obliged to introduce
pharmaceutical patent protection for the first time will have their
long-term prospects dimmed. However, in the short term production of
existing drugs will not be affected. Nor will production of most new drugs
coming on the market in the next 10 years or so because they stem from
inventions already made and patented and now going through the lengthy
process of testing and authorisation.
A bid by Washington to secure 'pipeline' protection for pharmaceuticals,
which would have involved retroactive recognition of patents, was firmly
rejected by other nations. US negotiators, though not yet the US industry,
appear to have abandoned the struggle.
Gatt officials also point out that the alternative to a Gatt accord would
not be the status quo but increased bilateral pressure from the US, which
has already secured better terms for its pharmaceutical industry from
several developing countries under threat of trade reprisals.
'On the whole, governments think this agreement is as good as they will get
and they don't want to re-open it for fear of something worse,' says a
senior trade official.
The other main contentious and even more emotive issue - 'patents on life' -
is less easily disposed of. The draft accord specifically allows countries
to exclude animal and plant inventions (and bio-technological processes for
their production).
But many environmental and third world development groups argue that it
should outlaw patents on life-forms altogether on the grounds that it
sanctions 'bio-piracy' or the expropriation of poor-country resources by
rich-country drug multinationals.
Indian farmers have demonstrated in their hundreds of thousands against the
patenting of plant varieties, which they fear will threaten traditional
breeding of seed hybrids and the sale or exchange of seeds among farmers.
Though plants as such are excluded, the Gatt accord will require new plant
varieties to be protected by patents or other means.
Even more concern has been expressed over the patenting of human genetic
material, highlighted recently when a Canadian-based third world development
group uncovered a patent claim by the US secretary of commerce on a Guaymi
Indian cell line. The blood sample from which it was derived was taken from
a 26-year-old Guaymi Indian woman while she was being treated for leukaemia
in a Panama hospital. It is now held by the American Type Culture
Collection, in Rockville, Maryland, where it can be drawn on for genetic
research.
The Guaymi woman's cell line is of special interest to researchers because
some Guaymi people, the largest indigenous group in Panama, carry a unique
virus and its antibodies which may prove useful in Aids and leukaemia
research.
The draft Gatt intellectual property agreement contains some safeguards
against exploitation, but not much. Apart from the permitted exclusion from
patenting of plants and animals, it requires patented items to be the
product of an invention, not a discovery of something occurring naturally.
The Guaymi patent application did not deal with an invention 'but rather the
discovery of an antibody which is part of the blood of the Guaymi woman,' Mr
Isidro Acosta, president of the Guaymi General Congress, wrote to Mr Ron
Brown, US commerce secretary, last month.
However, such objections can be circumvented by quite minor modifications or
by the patenting of techniques to stabilise genetic material or extract it
from its source.
The Gatt accord provides for a review of the 'patents on life' provisions
four years after coming into force (probably some time in 1995). The battle
lines are already being drawn between Washington, which wants greater
international patent protection for life forms, and a growing body of
opinion keen to see better safeguards and fairer sharing between rich and
poor of the benefits of gene-related research.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Mr Continuity set to succeed Salinas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The atmosphere at the headquarters of Mexico's ruling party on Sunday night
was jubilant; Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the former party leader and favourite
of the rank and file, had defeated his rivals to be declared the nominee to
succeed President Carlos Salinas next year.
While competitors for the nomination may have higher intellectual
reputations, none enjoyed Mr Colosio's broad party support, his mix of
technical and political skills, nor had they shown such unwavering loyalty
to Mr Salinas's economic and political goals.
In the end such qualities won the 43-year-old social development minister
the presidential nomination, which is traditionally in the gift of the
outgoing president. With the Institutional Revolutionary Party in power for
the last 64 consecutive years, and more popular than six years ago, Mr
Colosio is overwhelming favourite to become president after the election
next August.
Mr Colosio's total fidelity to the current president and reticence in public
about his own ideas have raised questions about whether he has the
independence of mind to lead Mexico into the next century.
'It is a huge mystery what he believes in,' said one ministerial colleague
from a rival team before his nomination. The minister, like others, argued
that Mr Colosio's lack of enemies indicated that he was afraid of making
tough decisions. Some question Mr Colosio's record in government, which over
the last year has consisted mainly in spending a lot of money on public
works projects.
But in his acceptance speech on Sunday, Mr Colosio did give some clues as to
how he would govern Mexico. He strongly endorsed Mr Salinas's pro-market
economic policies: 'I have seen the social cost of mistaken policies and the
awakening of hope from correct policies,' he said. 'Discipline in public
finance has come never to leave again.'
Mr Colosio pledged himself to a continuation of Mr Salinas's anti-poverty
programme, which he said would become the backbone of the new government.
Many have criticised the programme, including, privately, at least one
cabinet member, as too centralised around the president and responsive to
political rather than social development needs.
The greatest change from Mr Salinas may lie in Mr Colosio's attitude to the
capital and the regions. Mr Salinas's economic revolution has been top-down
and highly centralised. Governors who have fallen out of favour have been
dismissed and states given almost no power to raise their own money.
Mr Colosio is from the agricultural north of Mexico, from a small village,
Magdalena de Kino in Sonora, not far from the border with Arizona. He is
thought to find Mexico City and its domination of Mexico stifling and
unhealthy. He says he will give more independence to state governors and
perhaps allow them to raise property taxes. He said he would encourage them
to deregulate the state economies as had been done at federal level.
Like the other leading members of Mr Salinas's cabinet, Mr Colosio is a
US-trained technocrat - he has a graduate degree in regional development and
urban economics from the University of Pennsylvania. Unlike them he has held
elective office, having been both a deputy and a senator.
He started working with Mr Salinas in 1979 in the budget ministry and has
been a close colleague since.
Since last year he had been in charge of the social development ministry - a
post he has now formally resigned. The portfolio, which has a multi-billion
dollar budget to reduce poverty, improve the environment and build houses
and other infrastructure projects, had helped him solidify political
alliances across the country.
The job has now been given to Mr Carlos Rojas, the under-minister in charge
of the government's anti-poverty programme.
Mr Colosio's nomination has spawned other political developments. Yesterday
it led to the surprise resignation of Mr Manuel Camacho, the powerful mayor
of Mexico City one of the closest colleagues of President Salinas. Until
Sunday he was considered a leading contender for the presidency.
Mr Colosio has appointed Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the education minister, as his
campaign manager. Mr Zedillo, who resigned his post, is a Yale-educated
economist and former central bank official and budget minister, and his
presence is likely to reassure investors of Mr Colosio's support for further
economic reforms.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court yesterday accepted for judgment next year a
controversial case which appears to cut to the heart of the US
constitutional division between church and state.
The case concerns the establishment in 1989 by the New York State
legislature of a special school district in Orange County, 40 miles from New
York city, catering to the needs of the disabled children of an Hasidic
Jewish sect which makes up most of the population of a local village.
Most of the children attend private religious schools but about 220
physically handicapped children were taught at a local state school.
However, their parents withdrew them on the grounds that their lessons were
incompatible with their strict religious beliefs, leading the legislature to
create a special district.
This was challenged by the state board of education on the grounds that
government thus violated the constitutional separation of church and state.
State courts upheld this argument, but lawyers for the Hasidic sect, backed
by the New York attorney general, Mr Robert Abrams, petitioned the Supreme
Court for a review.
Mr Abrams's brief maintains the creation of a special school district had no
wider impact.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Canada sees sharp rise in budget deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Canada's budget deficit will be almost 40 per cent higher in the current
fiscal year than previous estimates, Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister,
said yesterday.
Blaming a combination of over-optimistic forecasts by the previous
Progressive Conservative government, a burgeoning underground economy and
unexpectedly large tax refunds, Mr Martin said that the shortfall for the
year to March 31 1994 was now projected at CDollars 44bn-CDollars 46bn
(Pounds 22.3bn-Pounds 23.3bn).
The Conservatives last spring forecast a deficit of CDollars 32.6bn for this
fiscal year.
'We are going to have to restore control over the nation's finances,' Mr
Martin said. The new Liberal government last month revised the estimate for
the 1992-93 deficit upwards from CDollars 35.5bn to CDollars 40.5bn.
The revised forecasts, which were widely leaked last week, had a limited
impact on financial markets yesterday. By midday, the Canadian dollar had
lost about a third of a cent to 74.90 US cents.
The size of Canadian federal and provincial budget deficits has for some
time been a source of concern to foreign investors. Standard &amp; Poor's, the
rating agency, last week downgraded Ontario's credit rating. Mr Martin's
strategy for containing the deficit will emerge in his first budget, due to
be tabled early next year. But he reaffirmed yesterday the Liberal election
campaign pledge to bring the budget deficit down to 3 per cent of gross
domestic product by 1996-97 from 5.9 per cent last year. He added however,
that achieving this target 'will not be easy, to say the least.'
One economist said he was encouraged by signals that the Liberals plan to
overhaul the budget-making process and seek a more co-operative approach in
fiscal policy between Ottawa and the provinces.
The Conservatives consistently failed to meet their deficit-reduction
targets during their nine years in office. The budget estimates made earlier
this year were based on a 1993 growth rate of 2.9 per cent, rising to 4.6
per cent in 1994. These forecasts have now been scaled back to 2.5 per cent
and 3 per cent respectively.

The Democratic party in New Jersey has dropped its lawsuit seeking to
invalidate this month's election to pick the state's new governor, in which
Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate, defeated incumbent
Governor Jim Florio, reports George Graham from Washington.
The suit had been filed after Mr Ed Rollins, Mrs Whitman's campaign manager,
said the campaign had paid black preachers to stop their congregations from
voting.
Mr Rollins later said under oath that he had made this up to taunt Mr
Florio's campaign manager. Democratic leaders concluded they could not prove
the Republicans paid to suppress black votes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlos Roberto Reina of the centre-right Liberal party has ousted the
National party in a landslide presidential election victory in Honduras.
With 80 per cent of the vote counted, according to the national electoral
tribunal, he was leading his chief rival Mr Oswaldo Ramos of the governing
conservative National party by 52 per cent to 41 per cent, the largest
margin since civilian government was restored in 1981.
The Liberal party was also expected to secure majorities in congress and the
municipalities from Sunday's vote.
Mr Reina, an urbane 67-year-old former president of the Inter-American Court
of Human Rights, said as he claimed victory that he would implement a 'moral
revolution' in public service.
He has promised to attack rampant government corruption, and reform partisan
state institutions, including the judiciary and the national electoral
tribunal which organises elections.
According to a political analyst close to the Liberals, Mr Reina's chances
of implementing the reforms will depend on how quickly and effectively he
can create his own team and marginalise traditional party barons.
Despite accusations from Mr Ramos that he was a communist, Mr Reina, who
takes office in January, has said he will continue to honour Honduras's
Dollars 3.6bn foreign debt, and the structural adjustment programme with the
Washington-based international financial institutions. He said he would,
however, add a 'human face' to the programme - which may be difficult in the
face of declining foreign aid.
The plan was implemented in 1990 by President Rafael Callejas of the
National party, who renegotiated foreign debt and paid some Dollars 600m in
arrears, began a privatisation programme, and liberalised the economy.
Although the economy has stabilised this year and the government is
predicting 6 per cent growth, rising prices of basic foodstuffs, a swift
devaluation of the lempira, plus an increase in poverty, produced a
'punishment vote' against the National party, say observers.
The country of 5.5m people has some of the poorest social indicators in the
Americas. Despite a growth in non-traditional exports, including shrimp and
melons, it remains captive to the volatile prices of coffee and bananas,
which account for almost two-thirds of exports.
One central challenge for Mr Reina will be to reform the Honduran army, the
dominant political force in recent decades.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government maintained a cool stance yesterday, after share
prices fell to the lowest level for a year because of gloom over the
coalition's reluctance to offer an economic growth initiative.
The Nikkei 225 index fell by 1,000 points at one stage, recovering slightly
to end at 16,078.71, down 647.66 points or 3.9 per cent. That left the index
24 per cent below its mid-September high for the year. Yen bonds rose to a
six-year high as investors sought an alternative haven for cash.
This morning there was a slightly firmer tone to early trading, with the
index up more than 100 points after an hour.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said yesterday the government was
planning no measures to support share prices, in contrast to the previous
Liberal Democratic party government, which poured public cash into the
market early this year in a temporarily successful attempt to lift prices.
'Supply and demand are up to the market, so we will continue to monitor it,'
he said. Senior finance ministry and central bank officials admitted they
were worried about the fall in share prices but planned no direct action.
'We will use all means at our disposal, political, fiscal and tax, to help
the economy,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. 'The
level of stock prices is not something the government should act on
directly.'
Last week's string of poor banking results and mounting bad debts were
factors in the share price fall. There was also growing disappointment that
the government has not yet specified a date or amount for an income tax cut,
widely believed to be the only way to stimulate depressed consumer spending.
The coal-ition is divided on how to fund an income tax cut.
'This is one of those very rare times, once every 50 or 70 years, when
monetary policy is not working,' said Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at
Nomura Research Institute, referring to Japan's record low interest rates.
'Now it is time for fiscal policy to act.'
On average, companies reported a 23 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for
the six months to September and expect profits to fall by 22 per cent in the
full year to next March, the Wako Research Institute of Economics said. Half
of manufacturers cut overtime, hired fewer people or reallocated staff in
the three months to September, up from 40 per cent the previous quarter,
said the Labour Ministry.

Share prices in Hong Kong fell sharply yesterday as investors reacted to the
apparent breakdown in Anglo-Chinese co-operation over the territory's
political future.
Hong Kong's politicians called on Governor Chris Patten to give a full
account of the talks when he appears before the Legislative Council (LegCo)
on Thursday.
The Hang Seng index, the blue chip barometer of investor confidence, ended
down 261.65 points, or 2.82 per cent, at 9,012.77. Traders attributed the
fall to concerns about an aggressive reaction by China, as Mr Patten
proceeds toward tabling his democracy legislation without Beijing's consent.
However, they said that unless China was prepared to sacrifice Hong Kong's
economic well-being for political gains, other factors would prove more
important. Mr Adrian Faure, head of research at Baring Securities, said:
'There are two things that matter: interest rates and the Chinese economy.
The rest of it is largely irrelevant.'
Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie, a local
brokerage, said: 'It doesn't really matter what Mr Patten does; it is how
China reacts to it.'
Exactly a year ago, China first threatened to damage Hong Kong's economy in
retaliation for Mr Patten publicising his democracy plans. It questioned the
Hong Kong government's right to develop the colony's next container terminal
 -the contract is still a matter of dispute.
Beijing limited itself to blaming Britain for the lack of progress in the
17th round of talks, which ended in the Chinese capital on Saturday. Britain
offered an 18th round of talks but the two sides did not set a date.
Mr Jimmy McGregor, an elected member of LegCo, yesterday urged Mr Patten to
push ahead with the first stage of his legislative programme. After these
measures have been passed he should then seek to engage Beijing in talks
about the more difficult issues dividing the two, he said.
Mr Tam Yiu-chung, a pro-Beijing legislator, said it was worrying that the UK
and China had not given a date for future talks. He said if Mr Patten
decided to table his reform bill, the talks would break down irrevocably.
Peter Wise adds from Lisbon: China said yesterday Britain was entirely to
blame for the breakdown in talks. Mr Wu Jianmin, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman, said Beijing was deeply disappointed by the collapse of the 17th
round of negotiations and that 'the responsibility lies solely with the
British side,' but declined to elaborate.
Mr Wu was speaking during a state visit to Portugal by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin for talks on the transfer of Macao to Chinese rule two years
after Beijing takes over Hong Kong in 1997.
No difficulties had been raised over the transfer of Macao and good
relations between the two would ensure the territories' prosperity and
stability, he said.

A fortnight before Israel is due to begin pulling troops out of the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank's Jericho region, dissident members of the PLO's
mainstream Fatah faction threatened yesterday to resume the armed struggle,
and Israeli and PLO negotiators remained at loggerheads over a number of
crucial issues.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said that while he still hoped all
autonomy arrangements would be finalised in time for the December 13 start
of the troop withdrawal, he did not intend to give ground merely to ease the
negotiating process.
He said Israel needed satisfactory understandings on security for Jewish
settlers and for other Israelis travelling on main roads of the occupied
territories, on the precise Jericho boundaries and on control of the
autonomous areas' external borders. It would be better to delay autonomy by
two or three weeks, he said, if that would guarantee 'a clear agreement
which won't cause misunderstandings in the implementation'.
Delegates from Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation resumed
their autonomy talks in Cairo yesterday.
Mr Nabil Sha'ath, chief PLO negotiator, said there had been progress on the
demand for release of the 10,000 Palestinians prisoners held in Israeli
jails. But he said that 'the Israelis are really not moving on the issues
that separate us. . . There is the threat that Israel will not withdraw on
December 13'.
In the occupied territories there were signs of growing impatience at the
lack of progress. On Sunday night, undercover troops shot dead a member of
the Fatah Hawks in a Gaza refugee camp. About 5,000 people attended his
funeral yesterday, and members of the Hawks distributed leaflets announcing
a return to the gun. Shots were fired at two Israeli police stations and
three army bases.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exports from Australia fell 3 per cent last month, but an even sharper 4 per
cent decline in imports left the current account deficit roughly in line
with market expectations.
The country registered a seasonally adjusted current account deficit of
ADollars 1.257bn (Pounds 540m) in October, up from ADollars 1.077bn the
previous month, according to latest official figures.
Analysts expressed no surprise at the exports fall: the September figure had
been boosted by a high level of gold sales, and the merchandise exports - at
ADollars 5.475bn - remains the second highest on record. The fall in
imports, down ADollars 217m to ADollars 5.317bn, was also partly explained
by the timing of transport equipment deliveries. The seasonally adjusted
balance of trade stood at ADollars 158m, up ADollars 48m on the September
surplus.
Although the data was generally viewed as encouraging, the Australian dollar
came under pressure, with Japanese selling blamed. BIS Shrapnel, the
economic forecasting firm, also warned that long-term problems may be
building up, given the low levels of business investment.
'By the end of 1995, strong growth and supply constraints will produce a
surge in imports and a deterioration in the current account deficit to some
ADollars 23bn by the end of that year,' it predicted. Opposition parties
tried to capitalise on tension between the Australian government and
Malaysia over remarks made by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, at the
recent Apec conference in Seattle.
Mr Alexander Downer, opposition treasury spokesman, said that the prime
minister should apologise over his comments about Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the
Malaysian prime minister. He said that Mr Keating's description of Dr
Mahathir as a recalcitrant for not attending the Asia-Pacific summit was
putting export trade with Malaysia in doubt.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Beijing urged to keep up inflation fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has urged China to stay the course in its inflation fight and
has warned of the risks of a painful retrenchment if credit restrictions are
eased prematurely.
The assessment, published prominently in People's Daily yesterday, seemed
designed to bolster the arguments of those in the Chinese leadership
advocating continued restraint.
'Relaxing the credit squeeze too early could ruin the hard-won fruit of
controlling inflation, and inflationary pressures could emerge again,' wrote
Mr EC Hua, a senior economist in the World Bank's Beijing bureau.
The conspicuous use of the views of international institutions to influence
a bruising internal debate in China is a relatively new phenomenon and one
that indicates the growing importance of bodies like the World Bank and IMF
as sources of advice. Mr Hua had prepared his assessment as an internal
document in September, which makes its prominent use in People's Daily all
the more significant.
Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, has
been engaged in a fierce argument with senior colleagues and provincial
chiefs who believe credit restrictions imposed in mid-year are too severe.
Mr Zhu is the chief architect of a 16-point austerity programme announced in
July aimed at calming China's overheating economy which is expected to grow
this year by 13 per cent for the second year running.
Mr Hua described these projected rates of growth as 'unsustainable' . He
warned that it was much too early to claim a 'complete victory' in the
anti-inflation fight.
Figures for October showed a resurgence on inflationary pressures to an
annualised 21.1 per cent in the 35 main urban centres, up marginally from
the previous month.
The World Bank economist blamed spiralling growth in the money supply in the
first half of the year for the surge in inflation. M1, the broad measure of
money in circulation, grew 54 per cent in the 12 months to June.
Mr Hua, in his preliminary assessment of progress in China's macro-economic
reforms, said there was cause for optimism that the 'worst had passed'.
Since his assessment was circulated, however, China's anti-inflation resolve
appears to be weakening. Mr Zhu has been obliged to give ground to the state
enterprise lobby.
His case was not helped by remarks attributed to Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's
senior leader, in which he is said to have advocated growth at almost any
cost.
Foreign companies operating in China are facing steep rises in local labour
costs, according to a survey, writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor.
The Wyatt Company, a US-based consulting firm, says salaries of Chinese
nationals working for foreign ventures have risen 22 per cent this year,
faster than the 15 per cent increase in 1992.
Foreign managers in Beijing have reported that it is increasingly difficult
to hang on to good Chinese staff because newly established enterprises lure
them away with offers of high salaries. Inflation is also a factor.
Salary levels are still, however, low by western standards. A manager
working for a foreign representative office earns about Dollars 7,800
(Pounds 5,230) per year including allowances, while a manager in a joint
venture earns about Dollars 3,000.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Changes to industrial structure seen as key to growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Macroeconomic structural adjustment combined with microeconomic reforms
would lift economic growth in Japan by about 0.6 per cent and reduce the
current account surplus to around 1.5 per cent of gross national product, a
government advisory council says, Michiyo Nakamoto reports.
Failure to change industry's structure would leave the Japanese economy
unable to 'break out of the current impasse to achieve stable growth', warns
the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory board to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
In a report released yesterday, the council - whose members include leading
industrialists, such as Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, labour leaders and
academics - recommends Japan carry out substantial upgrading of the social
infrastructure to stimulate domestic demand, implement deregulation to
create new industrial fields and combat business practices which restrain
competition.
Adopting such measures would take real economic growth rate to about 3.2 per
cent in the years to 2000, instead of the 2.6 per cent or less expected if
no action is taken.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Industrialists urge economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian industrialists have urged the government to put economic reform back
to the top of the political agenda following the ruling Congress (I) party's
partial success in this month's state elections.
Industry leaders believe Congress has done well enough in the polls, for
which vote-counting started at the weekend, to have taken the steam out of
demands from the Bharatiya Janata party, the militant Hindu opposition, for
an early general election. Businessmen now expect parliament to run its full
term to 1996, giving Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao and colleagues time to
press on with reform.
'I hope the next 2 1/2 years will be assigned only to economic reforms,'
said Mr S K Bhargava, chief executive of Eicher, an engineering group. Mr K
N Memani, president of the Federation of Indian Exporter Organisations, said
the results should give Congress enough comfort to go ahead with reform.
In Bombay, stockbrokers expected the results to give a further boost to the
stock market, where prices have risen by an average of 23 per cent in the
past three weeks, as measured by the Bombay Stock Exchange's index of
leading stocks. The market was closed yesterday for a religious holiday.
Shares are in the middle of their biggest rally since last year's scandal in
the interbank securities market triggered a prolonged sell-off.
The elections are a delayed consequence of the storming of the Ayodhya
mosque last year by militant Hindus. Soon after the sacking, the
BJP-controlled assemblies in four northern states - Uttar Pradesh, Himachal
Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh - were suspended by the central
government for allegedly supporting the mosque's destruction. The elections
were for new assemblies for these states and in two others - the city of
Delhi and the small north-eastern state of Mizoram.
In the states where counting began at the weekend, Congress has won Himachal
Pradesh and won enough seats in Rajasthan to rob the BJP of an outright
majority, though the BJP may still form a government with support from
independents. In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has lost its majority and control is
likely to pass to an anti-BJP coalition led by Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, head
of the Samajwadi party, a populist grouping representing lower castes. The
BJP has swept control of Delhi, where elections were held for the first time
after 40 years of central rule.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Carmakers adjust to a rougher road

Japanese carmakers are coming under increasing pressure to consolidate their
activities, amid a continuing slide in personal spending at home, the impact
of the high yen overseas and the increased competitiveness of Detroit's
manufacturers in the US, Japan's biggest export market.
In a deal revealed yesterday, Honda has agreed to supply Mitsubishi Motor
with drive shafts for use in front-wheel-drive Mitsubishi cars. Neither
company would reveal the volume or value involved.
The deal reflects a growing trend for Japanese carmakers to seek alliances
with each other in a bid to reduce costs, make more efficient use of
facilities and survive the downturn.
Honda will benefit from the economies of scale provided by a big buyer for
its drive shafts, which the company has not sold to its competitors in the
past. Mitsubishi, for its part, will be able to reduce its development
costs.
Statistics yesterday showed that Japanese vehicle exports last month
suffered the largest year-on-year fall on record. Automotive exports in
October, including parts, were down 25 per cent in unit terms, according to
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. In value, exports were down
nearly 10 per cent.
The largest falls came in exports to countries of the European Union, which
were down 42 per cent in the ninth consecutive year-on-year decline. Exports
to the US and Asia fell 21 per cent. In the domestic market, vehicle unit
sales fell 9.5 per cent.
Carmakers have been struggling to reduce costs and adjust production levels
to meet lower demand. Mazda closed its factories yesterday for the second
time this month to adjust inventories. Isuzu said it aimed to reduce its
seasonal workers by 1,000, or 50 per cent, in a year.
Earlier this year, Honda and Isuzu began providing each other with cars to
supplement their ranges. Isuzu and Mazda also have an agreement to provide
each other with engines.

FT  30 NOV 93 / J R D Tata: symbol of the Indian spirit of enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr J R D Tata, the urbane industrialist who headed Tata, India's largest
commercial grouping, for more than 50 years and was a symbol of his
country's entrepreneurial spirit, died yesterday aged 89.
Tributes flowed into Tata's Bombay headquarters, including a message from
President Shankar Dayal Sharma, who said Mr Tata would 'always be remembered
for his patriotic services' in many fields.
Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhai Tata, the son of an Indian father and a French
mother, was born in Paris in 1904 into one of India's wealthiest families.
He made full use of the opportunities offered by his privileged life:
businessman, pioneer aviator, and champion of many causes ranging from
India's nuclear development to population control. He piloted aircraft until
well past 80, skied until he was 85 and retained his seat on the board of
Tata Sons, the group's core company, until his death.
He spoke French better than English and both better than any Indian
language, yet he devoted his life to India. He stayed out of politics, but
he often criticised India's socialist programme, an approach which cost Tata
companies dear when it came to securing government investment approvals.
Flying was Mr Tata's passion. As a boy in France he watched Louis Bleriot's
earliest flights. In 1925, he became one of the first Indians to secure a
commercial pilot's licence. In 1932, he founded Tata Air Services, a
forerunner of Air India, the national flag carrier, and piloted its maiden
flight. After the nationalisation of aviation in 1953, Mr Tata was made Air
India's honorary chairman - a post he retained until 1978, when he was
sacked by a government jealous of his influence. Mr Tata later said it was
his life's biggest setback.
Mr Tata's business career began at 21 after he completed military service in
France. Mr Tata wanted to go to Cambridge, but his father told him to move
to India to join Tata as an unpaid apprentice in the group's steel business.
A year later, Mr Tata's father died and Mr Tata inherited his seat on the
Tata Sons board. In 1938, the chairman died and, at the age of 34, Mr Tata
was chosen to succeed him.
Mr Tata ruled with a light hand and gave managers freedom to work
independently. Just as Mr Tata pursued aviation, other executives expanded
the group's interests in engineering, motors, chemicals, hotels and many
other industries. As the group's sales rose to their current annual total of
over Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3.04bn), so investments became increasingly
diverse.
Until the late-1970s, Mr Tata's charisma held the group together. But in the
1980s, the group began to look increasingly incoherent, with its ageing
managers often too busy guarding their own fiefdoms to respond to commercial
challenges. Mr Tata was criticised for retaining to power for too long. In
1991 he finally handed over the chairmanship of Tata Sons to his cousin, Mr
Ratan Tata.
Mr Tata gave much time to causes of national interest. In 1945, he set up
the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, a pioneer of India's nuclear
programme. In the early 1950s, he was one of the first advocates of
population control - an issue over which he quarrelled with Jawaharlal
Nehru, who believed a large population made for a powerful country. In 1992,
Mr Tata received the United Nations Population Award.
Mr Tata, who had no children but is survived by his wife, died in a hospital
in Geneva, where he had gone for a holiday and for medical treatment.

</HEADLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's two main political parties have each entered a period of
turmoil. Prospects of a political realignment have increased, following the
general election earlier this month which saw the right-wing National party
hang on to power by a one-seat majority.
Mr David Lange, the former Labour party prime minister, said last night that
an acrimonious brawl over the continued leadership of Mr Mike Moore, his
successor, could wreck the party. The battle erupted within days of Mr Moore
proclaiming that he had resurrected the party's fortunes by nearly winning
the election.
Many see the struggle as the first in a series of party wrangles which will
prompt members of the two main parties to form new political groups.
Politicians are seeking to take advantage of the introduction for the next
election of the German proportional representation system, which favours the
development of small parties, rather than the Westminster-style two-party
system which New Zealand has had for much of the past 133 years.
Divisions also exist within the National party amid speculation that a new
hard-right party might be formed. Ms Ruth Richardson was toppled as finance
minister by opponents within the party at the weekend.
She has said she will not hesitate to vote against the government if it puts
her economic policies at risk.
The new finance minister, Mr Bill Birch, is a close ally of prime minister
Jim Bolger. Mr Birch was the architect of many reforms introduced over the
past three years including the Employment Contracts Act which has
effectively broken the power of the unions and cut wage costs.
The struggle within Labour between Ms Helen Clark, a left-leaning academic,
and Mr Moore, a former trade unionist, has divided the party into two
roughly equal factions. About half apparently want to follow Ms Clark, Mr
Lange and others into turning Labour back to a centre-left group which is
already pledging to raise taxes to help the under-privileged. Aligned
against them are Labour MPs who supported economic reforms, as well as Maori
MPs and a number of traditional union and other working-class Labour MPs.
In a letter of support for Ms Clark, who is standing against Mr Moore in
tomorrow's caucus vote for leadership, Mr Lange accused Mr Moore of
campaigning as if the Labour party was his own property. 'He'd rather see
the party wrecked than let caucus chose a new leader,' he said.
The left wing argues that the party must refocus on its roots in order to
survive under the proportional voting system; Mr Lange and others say the
party must abandon the centrist approach favoured by Mr Moore of 'being all
things to all men'. Mr Lange said on television last night that Labour could
never govern on its own again.

FT  30 NOV 93 / EU's latest Bosnia plan passes test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of Bosnia's three warring parties yesterday agreed to restart
partition talks on the basis of a revamped package put forward by European
Union foreign ministers.
Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, announced that Moslem, Croat and
Serb military leaders had re-affirmed their commitment to free access for
relief convoys in Bosnia. But the significance of the new agreement, which
followed an accord approved just 11 days ago, was unclear because General
Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, boycotted yesterday's session, the
first face-to-face meeting since the collapse of all-party talks in
September.
Lord Owen, the EU mediator, said bilateral talks would resume immediately.
He appeared to indicate that the 'action plan' stood some chance of success
because of the scaled-down aims of the package.
The Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, according to Lord Owen, had
abandoned his demands for demilitarisation of Bosnia, saying he would insist
on the deployment of Nato troops only in his mostly Moslem republic. The US,
according to diplomats, has backed off from its previous promise to despatch
peacekeepers to Bosnia.
The EU initiative also called for the revival as soon as possible of the
London Conference of August 1992, which demanded a reversal of 'ethnic
cleansing' and the return of territory acquired by military force.
However, hopes of territorial concessions by Bosnian Serbs to their Moslem
adversaries in exchange for a phase-out of sanctions against Serb-led
Yugoslavia seemed remote yesterday. Mr Izetbegovic said he would reject any
'unjust plan'. He is calling for the return of 'occupied territories' from
the Serbs and access to Adriatic ports from the Croats.
The Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and his Bosnian Serb proxy, Mr
Radovan Karadzic, renewed their demands for the immediate suspension of
United Nations sanctions before the Serbs made any territorial concessions.
But Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday said: 'The
first move has to come from the Serbs' offer of additional withdrawal, once
that offer had been implemented, and there was a ceasefire, and the aid was
flowing freely, then we, the Europeans, would think that the Security
Council should consider suspending sanctions,' he said during the first
all-party talks since the collapse of the peace process in September.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees, accused all three
leaders of reneging on their pledge of 11 days ago to allow the free access
of humanitarian aid to some 3m people in Bosnia.

FT  30 NOV 93 / More falls in German steel production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West German steelmakers said production of hot-strip steel would fall by 15
per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with the same period last
year, because of continued depressed demand, the German steel association
said yesterday.
The reduction is higher than had been anticipated, reflecting dire market
conditions, a spokesman from the association said. The reduction in
hot-strip output for the whole year will amount to 12 per cent.
Steelmakers have complained that the failure of the European Commission to
reach a European-wide agreement on reducing over-capacity in steel markets
would lead to drastic consequences in the recession-hit industry.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Ruhrkohle move on four-day week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ruhrkohle, Germany's largest coal producer, is to discuss a proposal from IG
Bergbau und Energy (IGBE), the mining industry trade union, for the
introduction of a four-day working week in forthcoming talks with union
representatives.
The union is hoping a shorter working week will avoid massive lay-offs
facing the recession-hit industry. Ruhrkohle, which produces 80 per cent of
Germany's hard coal, is due to axe 6,000 jobs in coming months.
The redundancies come on top of 20,000 jobs which must be eliminated between
1991 and 1995.
The move follows an agreement struck last week between the IG Metall
engineering union and Volkswagen which will introduce a 28.8-hour week and
lower wages in order to save up to 30,000 jobs.
Mr Hans Berger, president of IGBE, said the proposal from his union could
save up to 10,000 jobs in the mining industry.
The union is also offering pay cuts of 5 per cent in the talks which will
take place in two weeks, much lower than Volkswagen's proposed 20 per cent
reductions.
However, officials in German coal mining groups warned at the weekend that
the shorter week could only be a transitional measure to overcome the crisis
hitting the domestic coal mining industry.
Unsold stocks have been piling up at coal mining companies as orders from
steelmakers have plunged this year.

FT  30 NOV 93 / In search of fiscal wisdom for old age: Hugo Dixon on
pensions policy in a world of ageing populations and big deficits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pensions are already the single biggest item of government expenditure in
almost all industrialised countries. As populations age and schemes set up
after the Second World War mature, state pension transfers will consume an
ever-increasing share of national budgets. On current trends, they will
exceed spending on health care and education combined within the next 50
years.
These bald facts explain why most governments are considering revamping
their pension systems. Without change, there are fears that ballooning
pension budgets will become unsustainable. The next generation of workers
may not be willing to pay the higher taxes or social security contributions
that will be needed when the current generation of workers retires.
Politicians are reluctant to risk the electoral consequences of cutting back
people's pensions. They also have little incentive to take painful decisions
whose full benefits will only become apparent long after they have left
office.
The policy questions surrounding pensions are complex. Pension policy has a
powerful impact on the wider economy. In particular, it can affect
retirement ages, savings and investment, the competitiveness of industry and
job mobility.
Governments started to reform their pension systems in the 1980s. Japan,
whose demographic crisis came early, curbed the generosity of its state
scheme and raised the age of entitlement to pensions. In the UK, the
Conservative government, driven mainly by an ideological belief in the
superiority of private pensions, gave employees tax incentives to opt out of
its state earning-related pensions scheme and promoted personal pensions.
Continental European countries such as France, Germany and Italy face the
greatest pressure to change, partly because of the speed with which their
populations are ageing (see chart). But their pensions are also especially
generous, typically more than half final salaries.
The pressures are less intense in Anglo-Saxon countries such as the US, UK,
Canada and Australia. Their populations are not ageing as rapidly and their
state schemes are less generous, in part because of the greater role of
private pensions.
The main response of governments faced with such pressures has been to curb
the generosity of their state pension schemes, while keeping their basic
structure intact. They have included:
Cutting the growth in benefits. The US has several times frozen benefits.
The UK, which used to link pensions to average earnings, now uprates them in
line with prices. The basic pension, currently 15 per cent of average
earnings, is thus projected to fall to 7 per cent of average earnings over
30 years.
Raising the state pension age. This saves money by cutting the number
receiving pensions and governments hope it could reverse the trend towards
earlier retirement in most countries. Japan has raised its pension age from
60 to 65. The US has chosen 67, though this will not come fully into effect
for more than 30 years. Germany and Italy are also gradually increasing
their pension ages to 65. Other countries plan similar action.
A more radical reform is to shift from state to private provision of
pensions. It is possible to achieve this by allowing state pensions to
wither and relying on people to get the message that they need to save for
their retirement. Alternatively, governments can promote private pensions
through tax relief for pension funds or by compelling people to save for
their old age.
No industrialised country has made a wholesale switch, though Chile has done
so by making private saving mandatory.
Private pensions mean there would be less need to raise taxes in future to
finance the pensions of the growing number of old people. Enthusiasts also
argue that, by saving for their pensions, today's workers would channel
larger sums of money into productive investment so boosting long-run
economic growth.
But private pensions do nothing to curb public spending in the short run, as
those who have already retired still have to rely on taxpayers for their
pensions. Moreover, they impose a greater financial burden on today's
workers who have to save for their own pensions as well as paying taxes for
the pensions of those who have retired.
Advocates of private pensions point to their greater flexibility. Instead of
contribution rates and pension ages being fixed by governments, individuals
are able to choose how much to save and when to retire - though this is less
so with occupational schemes than personal pensions.
Backers of state provision point out how successful it has been in reducing
poverty in old age. Private pensions, they argue, are not well suited to
tackling poverty because they cannot easily redistribute money from the rich
to the poor. If people had to save for their retirement, the unemployed,
women who stayed at home and those on low incomes would suffer. Large chunks
of their savings could also be swallowed up in administrative fees.
This means that complete withdrawal of the state from pension provision is
unlikely to be socially acceptable in most countries.
However, the state might reduce its commitment by guaranteeing a basic
income for all old people, leaving additional saving to individual choice.
However, if this basic income was set at a generous level, the cost could be
high. If a low level was chosen, many pensioners could still face poverty.
An alternative is to target the state pension on those most in need, while
giving nothing to those who have accumulated decent private pensions. But
the danger is that people would have no incentive to save for their
retirement. In Australia where state pensions are means-tested an increasing
proportion of retired people qualifies because they ensure their wealth is
invested in ways that do not feature in the test.
Compulsory saving would negate the choice and flexibility associated with
private provision. From an individual's perspective, state-mandated
contributions to private pensions might not look so different from taxes or
social security contributions.
As short-term budget strains and long-term demographic pressures grow,
governments are increasingly finding inaction is not an option. Whether by
choice or force of circumstance, a shift from state to private pensions is
probably inevitable.

<TEXT>
European Union foreign ministers yesterday put forward their 'action plan'
to end the war in Bosnia, vowing not to lift sanctions against Serb-led
Yugoslavia until Bosnian Serbs handed over land to their Moslem adversaries.
Despite threats by EU ministers to suspend relief operations in Bosnia this
spring if the warring sides fail to endorse a settlement dividing the
republic into three ethnic mini-states, the leaders of the three communities
yesterday appeared to remain far from agreement.
The Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and his Bosnian Serb proxy, Mr
Radovan Karadzic, renewed their demands for the immediate suspension of
United Nations sanctions before the Serbs made any territorial concessions.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said the mainly Moslem republic
must receive additional land from the Serbs and access to Adriatic ports
from the Croats.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday said sanctions would
remain in place until the Serbs fulfilled their pledges to hand over land in
Bosnia. 'The first move has to come from the Serbs' offer of additional
withdrawal, once that offer had been implemented, and there was a ceasefire,
and the aid was flowing freely, then we, the Europeans, would think that the
Security Council should consider suspending sanctions,' he said during the
first all-party talks since the collapse of the peace process in September.
However, in a defiant speech, Mr Milosevic slammed the EU for doing
'enormous harm' to his country.
A statement from the Belgian EU presidency outlined the 'action plan', which
also called on Croat leaders to fulfil their pledge for concessions on ports
and on the Bosnian government to stick to its territorial demands of 3-4 per
cent. The Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, and Mr Mate Boban, the
Bosnian Croat leader, reportedly gave their support for the EU plan at the
Geneva session, also attended by Moslem and Croat military leaders but
boycotted by Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees, accused all three
leaders of reneging on their pledge of 11 days ago to allow the free access
of humanitarian aid to some 3m people in Bosnia.
Discussion of the latest EU-sponsored Bosnian peace proposals will continue
in Rome today as EU foreign ministers, together with their US and Russian
counterparts, join foreign ministers from the former communist states in a
broader review of European and central Asian security issues at a meeting of
the Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), Anthony
Robinson writes from Rome.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Van Miert heads off shipping dispute

<TEXT>
Europe's exporters yesterday claimed to have seen off an attempt by European
shipowners to broaden anti-trust rules on shipping cartels.
EU transport ministers last night withdrew a draft resolution calling for
clarification of the rules for maritime transport, after the European
Commission promised a report on the scope of its regulations by the middle
of next year.
The shippers - big exporters such as ICI and United Distillers - claimed
Europe's shipowners were trying to protect themselves from the latest, and
largest, investigation into an alleged shipping cartel.
Both the Commission and the European parliament had warned the ministers
against interfering with Brussels' sole authority to examine big European
anti-trust cases.
But Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, was able to defuse a
potential row yesterday by promising a report, which he said would take into
account the interests of shipowners, shippers and member states.
The idea of a resolution finally had to be abandoned when Ireland threatened
to veto the proposal. Ms Joan Burton, its transport minister, argued that
agreements between big shipowners punished Irish exporters who were obliged
to pay unfair prices to ship goods to big transatlantic container ports.
Mr Van Miert said the Commission would press on with its cartel
investigation into the Trans-Atlantic Agreement, signed by 14 shipowners
last year in an attempt to combat overcapacity and losses on transatlantic
services. He would not say whether Brussels was about to issue a statement
of objections to the TAA, but said more information on Brussels' attitude
would be available 'very soon'.
Several other member states were equivocal about yesterday's resolution,
among them France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Britain. Lord Caithness, the
British minister, said the UK would have supported the idea of a resolution
because there was a need to clarify the treatment of new door-to-door
container services.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Eta row blocks asylum progress

<TEXT>
Hopes that the European Union would speed up its faltering steps towards a
common policy on asylum for non-EU nationals were blocked by a row about
asylum for alleged Basque terrorists in Belgium.
Spain placed a general reserve on nine pieces of the asylum policy jigsaw.
It argued angrily that Belgium's decision to consider two wanted members of
the Basque separatist organisation Eta as possibly eligible for refugee
status meant there was insufficient confidence between member states in each
other's judicial institutions to proceed to a broader common policy.
The two suspects are wanted on suspicion of providing infrastructure for a
separatist commando unit. They were arrested in Brussels in June, but
lawyers acting for them have applied to Belgium's commissioner for refugees,
who is independent of the government and has yet to pronounce.
The Dutch were also unable to agree on the asylum proposals, because almost
alone among member states, they are obliged to inform their national
parliament on the secretive deliberations of EU interior ministers.
Justice ministers, meeting for the first time yesterday as a formal EU
council of ministers following the entry into force of the Maastricht
treaty, did agree to seek a common approach to extradition which would
effectively rule out any future political defence for criminal action inside
the EU. But, for the moment, 11 member states are signed up to a separate
Council of Europe convention which does allow for 'political infractions';
the exception, ironically, is Belgium, which can not sign the convention
because it retains the death penalty, although without applying it.
Ministers got further entangled yesterday when Spain also placed a reserve
on setting up Europol, the EU criminal intelligence unit which last month's
summit of the 12 heads of government agreed to locate in The Hague.

Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday criticised what he
called the 'nightmare' scenario of a European superstate, and declared he
was confident that the 'centralising tendency' in Europe was at an end,
writes Gillian Tett.
Speaking in Bologna, he insisted that the principle of subsidiarity should
now be the touchstone for the European Union. 'Subsidiarity is not only
about rolling back the frontiers of the Community, where these have advanced
beyond common sense; it also means moving forward with a lightness of
touch,' he said.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Efta states attack their EU farm terms: Austria and Finland
say Brussels plan on subsidies may hit accession votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bargaining over conditions of entry for new members of the European Union is
set to intensify after objections from Austria and Finland to the
Commission's proposals on farm subsidies.
Austrian officials say the plan to cut agricultural subsidies could
undermine public support for joining the Union. And leading Finnish
politicians argue that the Commission's suggestions do not go far enough to
meet the farming community's climatic and geographical difficulties.
The Commission said last week it wanted to end price support for farmers
from the day of accession, when local prices would drop to EU levels.
Governments would be allowed to compensate farmers for the difference
through state subsidies for a negotiated period, which officials in Vienna
say would cost Austria Sch7bn-Sch8bn (Pounds 395m-Pounds 452m) over three to
five years.
The sceptical response to the proposals by all four countries belonging to
the European Free Trade Association (Efta) - Austria, Sweden, Finland and
Norway - appears to be in part a way of persuading Brussels to put up more
EU funds for their farmers.
The Austrian and Finnish objections are likely to intensify negotiations
with Brussels over the financing of transitional aid for farmers in remote
or mountainous regions of the four Efta applicants.
However, a public row over agriculture could further weaken public support
for the EU in the four Efta countries, which hold referendums on entry next
year.
A senior official from the Austrian chancellor's office said the proposals
'were presented in an insensitive way. It had a very negative impact. They
could ruin the pro-EU atmosphere in our country.' Officials said ministries
were besieged last week with angry telephone calls from Austrians saying
they would vote against membership.
Mr Franz Fischler, the Austrian agriculture minister, said 'The Community
has changed its negotiating position. This is a new situation for Austria
and it is not acceptable.'
The proposals were rejected by Austria's farmers' association which said
they would ruin farmers and the local food industry. The government, which
is grappling with recession and a budget deficit, would not have the money
to pay for compensation, the association said. It threatened to advise its
members to vote against membership in the referendum.
Mr Heikki Haavisto, Finland's foreign minister and former president of the
Central Union of Agricultural Producers, said the proposals represented 'a
correct analysis', but produced 'wholly wrong conclusions and solutions'.
Finland has made regional aid and agriculture the key issues in its EU
membership discussions. It is disappointed that only four regions have been
designated as eligible for the highest level of structural aid, with
so-called Objective 1 status. It had asked for five to be brought into the
bracket.
In Sweden, the reaction has been more positive. A source close to Sweden's
EU negotiations said: 'This is definitely a step in the right direction, but
it is far from a final agreement.'
There is satisfaction that Norrbotten, the country's northernmost province,
has been awarded Objective 1 status, despite disappointment that other
regions have not been classified similarly.
The Norwegian government has welcomed the Commission's plans to grant
northern regions Objective 1 status.
However, Norway is concerned that its food processing industry could be
adversely affected by the Commission's proposals to lift trade barriers
immediately membership comes into effect.
The strong negative reaction from Austria seems to counter the Brussels view
that handling the needs of Austria's alpine farmers would present less
difficulty than dealing with agriculture in the three Nordic countries.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Russia restores import tariffs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is to reimpose import tariffs on a range of imported foodstuffs next
month, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, said yesterday.
Mr Gaidar said the tariffs would be low - but the move is a further sign of
an increasing tendency on behalf of the government, including reformist
leaders like Mr Gaidar, to protect Russian industry from foreign competition
at a time when the demands of industrial lobbies are being pushed hard.
Mr Gaidar, as head of the Russia's Choice political group, is particularly
vulnerable to calls for protection - having already promised the commercial
banks relief from competition from foreign entrants to the Russian banking
market.
A gathering of business leaders in the Enterprises for a New Russia group
which supports the Party of Russian Unity and Agreement, yesterday called
for further protection for the fledgling private businesses - and for a
relief from taxes which, the group's leaders said, sometimes surpassed the
level of profits.
Mr Gaidar said that 'with a responsible majority' in parliament, inflation
could quickly be brought down to around 15 per cent a month from its present
levels of more than 20 per cent a month.
At the same time, the budget deficit for the last quarter of this year,
which it had been hoped would be contained to Rbs5,500bn is set to grow to
more than Rbs10,000bn, according to Mr Oleg Soskovets, another first deputy
prime minister. Part of the increase, he said, was because of miners
threatening to strike over unpaid wages, and to make good the debts of
enterprises.
The cabinet is now showing considerable signs of disarray, as ministers  -
who have become leading figures in competing political group - find
themselves unable to keep their differences out of the business of
government.
Two leading ministers - Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for
finance, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign
economic relations, are clashing over which of them now has responsibility
for talks on debt and on relations with the international financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The latest opinion poll for the election, from the All-Russia Centre for
Research into Public Opinion, suggests Russia's Choice has a strong lead of
25.7 per cent - with the Yabloko bloc of Mr Grigory Yavlinsky at 17.9 per
cent, the Communist party on 6.6 per cent, the Democratic party on 6.4 per
cent, and the remaining nine parties far behind.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Belgium talks up role of the EMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian presidency of the European Union yesterday called for a stronger
role for the European Monetary Institute in the co-ordination of monetary
policies and the management of the exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, said the ERM crisis and
introduction of wider fluctuation bands last summer made closer co-operation
imperative.
Without 'a significant qualitative improvement' in this area, the goal of
monetary union by the end of the decade could be at risk.
In a speech to the European Finance Convention in Brussels, Mr Maystadt also
admitted that the January 1, 1999, deadline was more realistic than the
original 1997.
He offered several proposals for filling the political vacuum in the wake of
the August crisis which led to the introduction of 15 per cent fluctuation
bands for ERM currencies.
The EMI should be given 'an explicit role' in decisions leading to the entry
or realignment of an ERM currency.
States with low inflation might consider aligning their monetary policies to
a 'common intermediate target', in which case the EMI might be allowed to
issue joint statements on national policy decisions taken by central banks
in this low-inflation zone.
The ERM should be strengthened, possibly through a more equitable sharing of
potential exchange rate losses arising from open-ended interventions. This
is a response to Bundesbank criticism that its obligations to defend other
currencies was undermining its domestic monetary policies.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Kleinwort hopes stamina will bring big dividends: One of the
bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment management division of Kleinwort Benson, the London-based
investment bank, will be one of the foreign institutions bidding for a
mandate to manage one of the new funds. For Mr David Glasgow, the director
who heads the bank's Polish operations, the bid represents the culmination
of a commitment to the mass privatisation scheme which began in October 1990
and to which the bank has stayed faithful despite many setbacks and delays.
'We looked at the scheme and we liked it. It is clever, low risk and
structured in a way which made it possible to sell to our board. It also
fits into our global interest in joint venture deals in emerging markets,'
he says.
Part of the determination to stay the course stems from Kleinwort's
conviction that it has found the ideal partner in the Polish Development
Bank, a young private sector bank voted the country's best earlier this year
by Gazeta Handlowy economic newspaper.
Having chosen a partner the Kleinwort team then spent much of last year
'kicking the tyres' of 17 of the 180 companies then on offer for management
by the putative funds. 'We were encouraged because we found that although
most of them were in a 'cash-gridlock' they were surviving, even though in
some cases that meant just paying their staff and saying 'no' to the
government's tax demands. What surprised us most favourably was the quality
of management and the level of skills,' Mr Glasgow adds.
Kleinwort is one of at least eight UK-based groups who were initially
interested in taking a 10-year management role, even though the pay-off in
regard to the capital gains on their end-of-term equity share-out remain
difficult to quantify with any precision. Mr Glasgow believes that only five
UK groups have stayed the course, along with Italian, Swiss, French, a few
German and several US institutions.
The fund managers eventually chosen by the Polish authorities will not be
able to cherry-pick the companies of their choice. They will end up with a
mixed bag after an elaborate numbers game designed to ensure that all funds
are a mixture of almost sure-fire winners and assorted 'dogs'.
The funds will put in management resources, 'but you don't have to invest
millions to get a pay-off', according to Mr Glasgow who has set up a
management team staffed largely by bilingual Anglo-Poles.
Having been in on the scheme from the start, Kleinwort and other potential
foreign participants were able to get several modifications to the original
plan accepted by the Polish side. Most important was the change to
closed-end rather than open funds, so enhancing the possibility of
substantial capital gains for those who most successfully manage the assets
shortly to come under their control.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Runners in Polish sell-off stakes come under starter's
orders: Christopher Bobinski on the long-delayed mass privatisation scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's mass privatisation scheme has survived a fraught three year
gestation and is ready to move into the final stages of labour.
Today is the deadline for the acceptance of bids from would-be managers of
15-20 national investment funds (Nifs) which are being created to manage
batches of 30 Polish state sector companies for the next 10 years. Shares in
them will be offered to all Poles for a nominal fee.
The main aim of privatisation is to get a large chunk of medium-sized Polish
industry, which is still in profit, out of the state sector and under
competent management, both foreign and domestic. The foreign managers are
expected to make the companies involved more credible and thus ease the task
of raising capital to complement and facilitate their restructuring.
The managers' task will be to enhance the Nifs' value. They will be paid an
annual performance fee, in equity form, as well as a yearly management cash
fee. After 10 years a final payment based on the performance of the fund
will also be made. The funds will be quoted sooner rather than later on
Warsaw's booming stock exchange, giving the managers an indication of how
the market values their efforts.
Despite long delays caused by frequent changes of government and skirmishes
with opponents, privatisation - which aims to sell around 600 companies in
one go - is similar to that originally put forward in 1991 by the then
privatisation minister, Mr Janusz Lewandowski, and advisers SG Warburg.
Part of the reason why even the new centre-left government is pressing ahead
with the scheme is the firm backing given by the World Bank from the very
beginning. The bank has made implementation a condition for drawing several
tranches of a Dollars 450m (Pounds 302m) loan. It also reflects awareness,
shared by Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the new privatisation minister, that the
scheme's introduction is seen in the west as a litmus test of Polish
commitment to privatisation. At home, the act of putting Nif shares into the
hands of ordinary Poles is seen as a way of reconciling voters who have
grown increasingly suspicious of privatisation but who can now be seen to be
getting a small part of industry, free of charge, for themselves.
The new government, like its predecessors, is also looking to the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development to provide around Dollars 400m in
loans to the companies involved. Other potential lenders in the government's
sights are the European Investment Bank, the International Finance
Corporation and the World Bank. Other aid bodies, including the UK
government's 'Know-how Fund' have already provided vital technical
assistance.
The authorities say that around 50 consortia are 'preparing to apply' to
manage the Nifs. But they will not reveal who has already declared an
interest. Most groups will include a foreign partner such as an investment
bank or consultants working together with local banks and consulting
companies as well as accounting firms and lawyers.
A 19-person selection committee appointed by the prime minister, parliament
and the trade unions will sift the applications and produce a list of
applicants in order of merit with whom the privatisation minister will then
negotiate the final terms of the management contracts.
At the moment a list of 367 state sector companies is ready for inclusion in
the scheme and new tranches are being prepared. The selection committee,
which is being reappointed by the new prime minister, Mr Waldemar Pawlak, is
expected to finish its work early in the new year. The funds should be up
and running several months after that.

FT  30 NOV 93 / How the bombers took secret route to a desperate dialogue
for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was in the wake of the Greysteel shootings that the mask slipped.
Within three days of last month's murders of seven Hallowe'en revellers by
loyalist gunmen, the British government received a dramatic and panicky
message from the Provisional leadership.
'Please tell us . . . as a matter of urgency when you will open dialogue in
the event of a total end to hostilities,' the message said. 'We believe that
the country could be at the point of no return.'
Coming after eight months of tense and fitful dialogue, conducted in the
strictest secrecy, between protagonists more accustomed to staring at each
other down a gun barrel, it was the clearest possible signal it was time to
act.
Three days later, on November 5, as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
paid his first visit for eight years to Northern Ireland - the government
did just that. It spelt out its terms for a face-to-face meeting with the
Provisionals within 75 days, in the middle of January next year.
If a genuine end to violence was delivered 'within the next few days', the
government said, a first meeting for 'exploratory dialogue' would take place
within a week of parliament's return from the Christmas recess on January
11.
This message would have landed on the desk of the Provisional leadership
less than 24 hours after the Ulster Unionist party leader Mr James Molyneaux
 -who has an effective veto over the shape of any political settlement -
said Sinn Fein would have to wait at least five years before gaining
admission to the democratic process.
It came just four days after Mr Major told MPs that talking to Mr Adams and
the IRA would 'turn my stomach'.
These events of just four weeks ago are the most dramatic of the exchanges
between these mortal enemies covered by the nearly 40 pages of documents
released by the government yesterday.
But they are merely the culmination of a top-secret dialogue which began -
at the instigation of Provisional leaders - in February this year.
The documents released yesterday are an extraordinary record of a discussion
which, had it remained secret, would probably not have seen the light of day
for 30 years.
They indicate that the government set out its conditions for starting talks
with Provisional leaders in March - on the very eve of the Warrington bomb
blast which resulted in the deaths of two small boys and triggered worldwide
condemnation of the IRA's methods.
They show that the Provisionals later expressed their 'total sadness' in
accepting responsibility for this bombing in an extraordinary oral message.
They suggest relations between the Provisionals and the government cooled
significantly after the support of nine Ulster Unionist MPs helped prime
minister John Major to secure the ratification of the Maastricht treaty in
late July.
It took the escalation of violence in the wake of the IRA bomb which killed
10 people on the Protestant Shankill Road on October 23 to restore momentum
to the dialogue.
This appears to have led directly to that dramatic plea from the Provisional
leadership - which it was last night denying it made - and the British
response clearing the way for face-to-face talks next January.
The first contact referred to in the papers took place on February 22 in an
oral message from Provisional leaders.
'We need your advice on how to bring it to a close,' it said. 'We wish to
have an unannounced ceasefire in order to hold dialogue leading to peace.'
About six weeks earlier, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary,
had said publicly for the first time that pressure within the IRA for an end
to violence was mounting.
The government, in a brief response four days later, promised to take the
overture 'seriously and at face value'. On the day the message was sent -
February 26 - a bomb exploded at a Warrington gasworks.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Pre-Budget boost for Clarke as industrial output heads
upwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was given a pre-Budget fillip yesterday with
further evidence that the UK economy is continuing its recovery.
A rise in the money supply and indications of a sharp increase in
manufacturing output will encourage the chancellor later today as he
delivers a Budget statement expected to concentrate on reducing the large
fiscal deficit through a modest tax rise.
M0, the narrow measure of the money supply, rose 5.1 per cent in the year to
November to continue recent strong growth which has underlined buoyant
consumer spending. Sentiment about an upturn will be helped by a survey
today from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply which showed
manufacturing orders and output grew strongly this month.
Although the seasonally adjusted M0 figure was lower than the 5.4 per cent
rise in the year to October, growth in notes and coins, which accounts for
90 per cent of the measure, was particularly strong. This jumped 5.5 per
cent in the year to this month, after a comparable 5.3 per cent in the 12
months to October, and indicated that consumers are spending relatively
freely. The economic data heartened investors on the London stock market,
where the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares shrugged off a large fall in
Japanese stocks to gain 24.4 for a close of 3,135.8. Sterling was also
strong, rising 1 pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM2.5425, and nearly
a cent against the dollar to Dollars 1.4880. In late New York trading
sterling stood at Dollars 1.4895 and DM2.5417.
Long-dated gilts gained a quarter of a point on expectations that Mr Clarke
would predict a fall in public borrowing from about Pounds 50bn this
financial year to roughly Pounds 40bn in 1994-95. However trading was
subdued because of worries that anything less than a determined attack by Mr
Clarke on the gap between public spending and revenues could push down bond
prices after their sustained rise in recent months.
The City is expecting the chancellor to unveil a Pounds 2bn tax rise from
next April, on top of the Pounds 6.7bn already announced. Mr Clarke may also
shave Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn off the public spending control total for
1994-95, previously set at Pounds 253.6bn.
Mr Richard Kersley, equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the
investment group, said financial markets were confident Mr Clarke 'will not
risk anything aggressive' over taxation because of the need to sustain the
recovery.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Carlton agreed bid values Central at Pounds 758m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications launched the ITV takeover game
yesterday with an agreed bid for Central Independent Television which valued
the second largest ITV company at Pounds 758m.
The cash and shares conditional deal at the equivalent of Pounds 26 a share
came just five days after Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary,
proposed changing the ITV ownership rules to allow, for the first time, a
single company to own a total of two broadcasting licences.
Labour last night criticised Mr Brooke for the 'impropriety' of his
announcement, allowing Carlton to create by far the largest ITV company,
commanding around 30 per cent of total ITV advertising revenue.
Mr Green will become the most powerful figure in UK commercial television if
the Central deal, conditional on parliamentary approval, goes through.
Central owns 20 per cent of Meridian, the south of England broadcaster, and
Carlton owns 20 per cent of Good Morning Television, the commercial
broadcaster. Mr Green is also chairman of ITN.
The debate on the ITV ownership rules is expected within the next two weeks
and, if approved, the new rules will come into effect on January 1.
At the same time, Carlton, which has interests ranging from television
facilities and professional equipment to video-cassette duplication,
underlined its growing strength by announcing a 26 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.1m.
Central's share price rose more than Pounds 4 yesterday to Pounds 25.73 and
Carlton finished 30p up at 797p.
Eventually, Granada is expected to bid for London Weekend Television, a
company in which it holds 20 per cent, and Lord Hollick, chairman of
Meridian Broadcasting, is predicted to go for either Anglia Television or
HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west.

FT  30 NOV 93 / UK open to Sinn Fein talks: Optimism for peace grows as
documents suggest IRA may lay down arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, JIMMY BURNS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BELFAST, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night declared it was ready to reopen contacts with Sinn
Fein as hitherto secret documents suggested the IRA had been on the brink of
ending its 25-year campaign of violence in Northern Ireland.
An unapologetic defence by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary,
of extensive contacts this year reinforced the impression at Westminster
that Mr John Major believes the IRA may still lay down its arms.
The optimism was echoed by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who
said last night that there had already been a marked de-escalation of
violence in recent weeks.
Papers released by the Northern Ireland Office suggested there had been no
large-scale IRA attacks since November 12 and Downing Street indicated that
a declared cessation of violence lasting for two months or so might provide
the background for formal talks with Sinn Fein.
That in turn raised hopes that Mr Major and Mr Reynolds might inject
momentum into the peace process at a summit which might take place as early
as this Friday.
However continuing differences between the two governments over the drafting
of a joint communique at the summit were underlined last night by Mr
Reynolds who said 'lots of progress will be required for a successful summit
at this stage'. Government officials explained that Mr Reynolds was
considering not holding the summit if progress could not be made on the
communique beforehand.
Sir Patrick's comments came after the startling disclosure that the
government would have opened a dialogue with Sinn Fein as early as January
1994 if the IRA had kept an apparent pledge in November to end its campaign.
But the government's account of the messages passed to and fro between the
two sides from February to November - which Sir Patrick insisted did not
amount to negotiations - was challenged vigorously by Sinn Fein.
Mr Martin McGuinness, the leading Sinn Fein member involved in the contacts,
accused Mr Major of fabricating some of the 30 or so pages of documents
released in London. Most of the messages conveyed by what the documents
refer to as 'the Provisional Movement' also suggest the IRA has not shifted
from its position that Mr Major must accept that Ulster will eventually be
part of a united Ireland.
Sir Patrick, who weathered with relative ease a storm of criticism from
hard-line unionists, told a crowded House of Commons that if the IRA ended
the violence permanently 'the way would still be open for Sinn Fein to enter
the political arena'.
He insisted that the government's basic conditions for bringing Sinn Fein
into the political process had not changed. The IRA would have to offer a
permanent end to terrorism and the British government would not drop its
constitutional guarantee on the status of Northern Ireland.
That meant 'the key to peace is in the hands of the IRA'. But if current
efforts failed, the government would keep exploring 'the opportunities for
peace'.
Downing Street said his statement had been approved by Mr Major and senior
members of the cabinet at an emergency ministerial meeting earlier in the
day to agree a response to the weekend revelations about the contacts.
The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, was suspended
from the Commons after accusing Sir Patrick of lying. But his outburst was
brushed off as a theatrical display by moderate unionists.
Conservative MPs offered support for the government strategy and there was
only muted criticism from Ulster Unionists.
The most revealing document, dated November 5, sets out detailed
arrangements under which the IRA would halt its campaign and start
'preliminary dialogue' with the government in mid-January. Sir Patrick said
the offer had been in response to an explicit commitment to peace from the
IRA, which was denied by Sinn Fein.
Despite its insistence that basic conditions for Sinn Fein participation in
talks had been as strong in private as in public, the documents revealed the
government was prepared to offer considerable flexibility to Sinn Fein in
arranging an end to hostilities.
It told Sinn Fein that a declaration of a cessation of violence could
initially be kept private. The government would then be ready to enter into
a 'dialogue' within two or two-and-half months. Both offers appear
considerably softer than Mr Major has yet admitted in public.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Mahathir row with Keating intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Blunt-talking Australian politicians have often ruffled the sensitivities of
neighbouring governments in southeast Asia. But, now, just as Australia is
making a big push to become more interlinked with the dynamic economies of
the region, the country's straight-talking prime minister, Mr Paul Keating,
has provoked a row with Malaysia.
Mr Keating has been critical of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
non-appearance at the recent Apec summit, and Malaysia struck back at the
weekend.
Dr Mahathir had said that he did not attend the summit because certain
countries, mainly the US and Australia, were trying to railroad Apec into
becoming a organisation structured along the lines of the European Union.
'Please don't ask me any more questions about Dr Mahathir,' Mr Keating said
to the Australian press corps. 'I couldn't care less, frankly, whether he
comes or not. I am sick of. . . questions about Dr Mahathir. . . Apec is
bigger than all of us. . . Australia, the US, Malaysia, Dr Mahathir and any
other recalcitrants.'
At the weekend, Mr Mohamad Rachmat, Malaysia's information minister,
announced that Malaysia would be banning Australian-made TV programmes and
advertising material and that Malaysia's state-controlled broadcasting
service would be reporting only negative news about Australia.
'This,' he said, 'is to tell the Australian government and media that what
was said by Keating was not only an insult to our prime minister but also to
the Malaysian people and to the country.' He insisted that Mr Keating
publicly apologise.
Dr Mahathir, himself not averse to the occasional undiplomatic verbal
thrust, said that he was disappointed with Mr Keating but chose to lay most
of the blame on the Australian media: 'Some newspapers made me out to be a
difficult person and very unpopular and that Malaysia was about to burst
into racial violence.'
Australia's claim to be part of Asia was meaningless. 'How', he asked, 'can
Australia claim to be part of Asia when Australian journalists lack manners?
It is difficult for us to love Australia.'
While the Malaysian media and political opposition also joined in the war of
words, the row will probably be resolved by diplomacy.
Mr Keating, due for an official visit to Malaysia next year, has made closer
relations with southeast Asia the central point of his government's economic
and foreign policy. 'For the first time,' says Australian Foreign Minister
Gareth Evans, 'Australia is paying more attention to its geography than its
history.'
Australian exports to the region have been growing rapidly. Two-way trade
with Malaysia rose more than 30 per cent in 1992-93 to ADollars 2.3bn
(Dollars 1.6bn), with Australia showing a healthy surplus. Australian
investors are involved in several big projects in Malaysia, particularly in
the mining and petrochemical sectors.
But Australia's relations with its Asian neighbours are never easy.
Relations with Indonesia have only recently improved. A few years Malaysia
took offence over an Australian TV series which depicted life in an
Australian embassy. Kuala Lumpur said the series was modelled on Malaysia
and was very insulting. 'It's a clash of styles' says a Malaysian academic
who studied in Australia. 'Australia's politicians and its press can say
anything they want. We have to be a lot more careful about what we talk
about. Australians are going to find life very difficult as Asians.'

<TEXT>
European shipowners yesterday sought to take the heat out of a dispute with
their customers over freight rates across the North Atlantic, writes Charles
Batchelor in London.
European Union ministers will later today review a special exemption granted
to shipowners which allows them to group together in 'conferences' to agree
prices on certain routes. Belgium, as president of the European Union, is to
file a motion confirming the exemption for conferences.
Shippers have protested that the pact between large shipowners such as P&amp;O,
Nedlloyd and Hapag Lloyd has been used to push up freight rates.
The shipowners counter that before the agreement was reached freight rates
for a standard container had fallen from Dollars 1,600 to less than Dollars
900.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday called for 'unconventional solutions' and

Reuter reports.
Harking back to Bonn's 'economic miracle' of the post-war years, he told a

recession and structural crisis, just as we did with great success in the
1950s'.
'We need a healthy economy (with) secure and competitive jobs,' he told the
conference organised by the German Chamber of Handicrafts in Karlsruhe.

Disgruntled shareholders in Ferranti International, the defence electronics
group which is the subject of a token 1p-a-share rescue bid from GEC, have
appealed to the group's banks to reconsider their attitude towards
administration.
Ferranti's board, which is backing the GEC offer, has warned that if the
Pounds 11.4m bid fails to win 90 per cent support, its 15 banks, which are
owed about Pounds 100m, will put the group into receivership.
The shareholders' association argues that administration, or any other debt
and capital restructuring, would be in the interests not only of Ferranti's
48,000 shareholders and 3,000 employees, but also in the banks' interests.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Inventor scorns worries about cost of Euro-plug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An inventor campaigning for a harmonised European plug and socket system has
hit back at claims from UK manufacturers that replacing the UK's three-pin
system could cost Pounds 20bn and raise serious safety issues.
Mr Simon Hossack, a Hertfordshire-based inventor, says the adoption in the
UK of a proposed new two-pin plug would stimulate the contracting and cable
industries, be of great benefit to appliance manufacturers and save
consumers hundreds of millions of pounds a year.
Mr Hossack's attack is the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter debate in
the electrical industry over the future of the UK's 13-amp plug with its
three rectangular pins, introduced in 1947.
Last month Mr David Dossett, director of the Electrical Installation
Equipment Manufacturers Association, said the two-pin system:
Could cost about Pounds 1,000 to introduce for each of 20m UK households.
Would make redundant about half of the Pounds 1.3bn capital employed by the
UK's 20 plug and socket manufacturers.
Could raise an issue of 'dangerous compatibility', because the present
two-pin Euro-plug could be pushed into a three-pin socket with potentially
lethal consequences.
But Mr Hossack, who in the late 1980s invented Le Plug, an adaptor that
allows the Euro-plug to run on the British system, described the
association's arguments as 'absolute tosh' and deliberate misrepresentation.
He said the proposed new harmonised plug, which has thicker pins than the
existing Euro-plug, cannot be fitted into a UK socket, and even the
Euro-plug could only be inserted through deliberate misuse.
The Pounds 20bn figure, he said, was a worst-case scenario that would never
become reality.
With an adaptor such as Le Plug there would be no need to replace plugs and
sockets, and new houses could be fitted with the new sockets.
He said it was inconceivable that the costs for manufacturers of replacing
equipment with lathes to produce round pins would amount to Pounds 650m.
The association says it does not oppose harmonisation but is trying to kill
the new plug, which has been proposed by Cenelec, the European standards
setting body, and could eventually become the world standard.
Mr Hossack wants an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and the European Commission's competition directorate into the issue and its
handling by the British Standards Institution.
He claims UK manufacturers are over-represented on the institution's plugs
and sockets committee, which meets today to discuss the issue. The
institution rejects the charge, and says the committee includes
manufacturers, consumers, safety experts and academics.

FT  29 NOV 93 / NUM accepts Wearmouth axe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Miners at Wearmouth, the last pit in the Durham coalfield, voted yesterday
to accept closure of their colliery, where output ended last week.
The decision, taken at a meeting of virtually all 430 members of Wearmouth's
National Union of Mineworkers' lodge, follows British Coal's closure
announcement last week which said there was no market for its power station
coal. The 167-year-old pit employs 670 people.
NUM lodge secretary Mr Alan Mardghum said the mood at the meeting was one of
resignation and despondency. 'The vast majority of people made redundant
from Wearmouth will end up on the dole,' he said.
In the past four years British Coal has invested more than Pounds 24m at
Wearmouth. The NUM says Wearmouth has more than 100m tonnes of undersea
reserves.

Labour turnover in the hotel and catering industry has slumped in the past
decade and is at an all-time low of 27 per cent, figures from the Hotel and
Training Company, the main training body for the industry, show.
That compares with a turnover of 81 per cent in 1978 and 60 per cent in
1984. Although industry observers attribute much of the fall to the
recession, the industry also believes that it is a sign of better employment
conditions and training.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Doubts on value of exam grades
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers will need to seek new ways of testing job applicants because of
uncertainty about the validity of school examination grades, Professor Clive
Fletcher, professor of psychology at London University's Goldsmith's
College, says today.
He writes in Personnel Management, the magazine of the Institute of
Personnel Management, that changes in the educational system in England and
Wales are likely to lead to a greater reliance on psychological tests in
recruitment.
He says that the record A-level results of the summer and the improvement in
GCSE results for the sixth year in succession have led to uncertainty in
some employers' minds about whether standards were genuinely higher or
assessment standards lower.
Differentiating between grades, given the greater prevalance of higher
grades, he suggests, will lead to a search for other, additional ways of
assessing intellectual capacity.
Prof Fletcher warns employers that they should shop around for the best
tests. Tests of 'doubtful quality' remain on the market and too few people
are trained to use the good tests properly.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp warning that the Labour party risks relapsing into the complacency
which lost it the past four general elections is issued today by the Fabian
Society.
Ms Glenys Thornton, the acting general secretary of the centrist Labour
pressure group, says the party's unwillingness to confront change threatens
to paralyse attempts to create a strategy appropriate to the 1990s rather
than the 1960s or 1970s.
In a hard-hitting article in the latest issue of Fabian Review, she adds
that the backlash by traditionalists against the party's modernisers has
provoked a dangerous outbreak of faction fighting among Labour MPs.

Nevertheless, Israel's environment minister, Mr Yossi Sarid, declared

This follows an election setback for Mr Bolger's National party, which saw
its parliamentary majority slashed from 34 seats to a single seat. Mr Bolger
blamed the rebuff on uncompromising free-market policies, the dismantling of
a highly regulated labour market, and cuts to New Zealand's generous welfare
system.
Ms Richardson, regarded as an architect of those policies, was replaced by
Mr Bill Birch, a former labor minister. She refused another cabinet job.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Pound falls on profit taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surprise news last Tuesday that base rates in the UK were finally coming
down after 10 months had the surprising effect of boosting sterling writes
Peter John.
The pound rose sharply against the D-Mark as investors who had already
hedged their positions against lower rates responded positively to the
possible boost to growth rather than the direct impact of lower interest
rates on the currency. However, by Friday, the gains were looking overdone
and the pound finally succumbed to profit-taking to close at DM2.5325.
The dollar continued to move in a tight range against the D - Mark of
between DM1.68 and DM1.72 but dealers said it was persistently showing
'upside pressure'. Much depends on key non-farm payroll data for November
due on Friday. The jobs figures are considered to be the most important
pointer to US economic trends and economists are looking for a rise over the
month of up to 200,000 jobs. A higher figure could see the US currency
heading for DM1.74.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (34): Plenty of
high quality entries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The third year of the Business Software Challenge competition saw a record
number of entries, writes Claire Gooding. The projects described here are
from the shortlist of eight that provided the final winners in two
categories:
Best Business Solution.
Overall Winner.
The breadth, ingenuity, and, in some cases, professionalism of the entries
gives some indication of the standard as the report below indicates. The
hope is that several of these will develop into commercially saleable
products.
The Software Challenge was created to encourage students in higher education
to write applications to solve real business problems.
Sponsored and funded by Computer Associates with Pounds 20,000 worth of
prizes, this year's competition was supported by FT Software At Work, the
British Computer Society, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the Institute of Management.
The panel of judges consisted of competition sponsors, academics and
specialists from a number of disciplines.
The final candidates had to demonstrate how their designs addressed a
particular problem. At the top of the shortlist were those who showed a
flair for finding an unexplored niche and responding to the real needs of
users.
Two cash prizes were awarded, with the runners-up receiving software from
Computer Associates.
Readers requiring more information about the winners, or who may wish to
enter for next year's competition should contact:

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (35): Surprise
packages - Modelmaker for Windows, written by Andrew Walker, research
assistant at University of Nottingham, graduated 1991-92, MSc degree in
environmental science, measurement and modelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Walker's software solution is aimed at students and researchers who
are not (nor want to be) mathematicians and programmers, but who need to use
mathematical models and simulations in their research.
The system runs on IBM compatible PCs (486) under MS-DOS 5 and Windows 3.1,
written in Borland Turbo Pascal for Windows v1.5.
This program was written by a mathematician with unusual sympathy for
non-mathematicians. Initially baffling to the panel, it emerged as a winner
when it became clear that equally baffled students were being led gently by
the hand in building screen-models which came alive courtesy of ready-made
underlying mathematical formulae.
Simply choose your formula, feed in the figures, and forget the mathematical
grind. Scientists in the research and academic community often need to use
mathematical techniques. Too often, this means resorting to programming in a
language like Fortran or Pascal, and getting to grips with arcane
mathematical theory, a headache for students of subjects from social
sciences to environmental studies.
This program, and its excellent documentation, (complete with index) played
the same role as the top-of-the-class student who helps the less gifted with
their homework. Its aim was to deliver results - graphs and models - without
having to program or even understand the maths.
Equations, key relationships, are easily defined, referenced, and printed
out. If you want to use Runge-Kutter, here it is: the exercise of creating a
model, and the online help, (backed by crisp, encouraging documentation),
might even help you understand the Runge-Kutter formula.
This was a surprise winner: one that sprinted from the back in the home
straight to overtake other hopefuls.
The identification of a real need, the programming, presentation and
documentation (created to satisfy 30 eager users) all convinced the judging
panel that this was in the tradition of many successful software products
that have started in academia, and been taken out into the world by
enthusiastic users.
The judging team was unanimous in this choice of overall winner. Mr Abram
Azagury, managing director of Computer Associates, commented: 'Judging the
competition each year is proving more and more enjoyable, as we've seen a
steady increase in the standard of entries. It is most rewarding, as well as
a pleasure to help encourage such original work.'
The Sales Decision Support System
What was judged to be the best business solution was written by Richard
Maher, fourth-year student in manufacturing and engineering systems at
Brunel University.
This software aims to give sales people in a manufacturing environment quick
and accurate information, enabling them to see the effect on other
production of manufacturing decisions and promises to customers. The
software runs on an Olivetti PC under MS-DOS, using CA Clipper, DGE, Visual
Interface. This system was an ingenious approach to the eternal problem of
'make what you can sell, don't sell what you can make.'
The idea was to provide sales and marketing staff with dynamic manufacturing
information, so that they might assess the profitability of an order, and
see how it affected other work in progress.
Optimising capacity, and concentrating on profitable runs was the goal of
the system. The nature of manufacturing has changed, and resources have to
be flexible when demand is unpredictable. Leadtimes and costs depend not
only on the product itself, but what else is being manufactured, for what
delivery dates.
Manufacturers are increasingly concentrating on short runs, quick turnaround
and low stock, sometimes of products specifically made to order. This is
bringing about new pressures, and posing questions that factory managers,
let alone sales people, are rarely equipped to answer.
Richard Maher's application aims to fill that gap. Its ease of use, and
instant impact ('what if' 3D bar charts of factory loading) were persuasive,
and demonstrated a thorough grasp of the problem. Most impressive was the
addressing of a real problem, a communication gap between different groups
of workers, with a clear demonstration to both of what's possible - and
what's profitable.
Research with potential users, and a recognition of all the issues, some of
them highly emotive, paid off in a well-designed, system that is well on its
way to being a real live product.
The following three entries were commended:
Route Finder for Windows
Written by Ian Foster, BSc hons in computing science, Staffordshire
University; graduated 1993. This software is aimed at anyone needing
optimisation of route-finding, in buildings or theme parks, or more
traditional route-maps.
The programme runs on Compaq 386 portable under Windows 3.1, written in
Borland Pascal with Objects for Windows.
The application started as an exercise in mapping buildings, fire-escape
routes, circulatory flow, and so on. But it developed into general mapping
tool when the author assessed AutoRoute, Nextbase's de facto standard in
this area, and found no street-level facilities, and no way of optimising,
blocking, or costing specific routes with multiple stops.
A heuristic approach allows users to model alternative routes on different
criteria. The maintenance of data (on roadworks and so on) might pose a
problem, but while the author couldn't possibly create the database alone,
he knows an organisation that can, as the AA says.
Commended
Diamond Smiles
Written by Michael Walters, BSc honours, Computer Studies, University of
Glamorgan; graduated 1993.
Aimed at dental practices where there are several practitioners, but also
applicable to doctors' surgeries, and so on.
Runs on IBM PC and compatible, (386) under MS-DOS 5.0, written using Borland
DBase IV (v1.5) and the Leonardo expert systems shell 3.0.
An enticing name to solve a problem that makes few people smile: the need to
make multiple appointments, perhaps with different clinicians, for some
extended dental treatment.
After talking to dentists, examining compatible appointment and dental
charging systems, the author identified a real need, ably fulfilled with
this well-crafted, easy-to-use, and instantly understandable system. The
judges found this an attractive presentation and an 'intelligent' expert
advice system on when to recall patients was a bonus which put this on the
final shortlist.
Commended
Cadno
Written by Phil Thompson, BSc honours, University of Glamorgan, (1992), now
developing the product as a consultant to Metrology Systems Wales (MTS).
The software is aimed at steel mills, and other manufacturers involving
process rollers, such as aluminium, paper, and plastics.
The software runs on PCs, in conjunction with a special 'smart card' which
feeds in data from an electronic caliper. This program is already in
commercial use, because it arose from a real-life requirement, already
identified by the manufacturers (MTS) of an electronic caliper that measures
inconsistencies in roller quality.
The author took the smart-card used in the specialised measurement process
and created a PC-based solution, easily used and understood on the factory
floor to interrogate and display the data graphically. Commended
Among the other entrants, the following three were shortlisted:
QFD
Written by Andreas Ikonomou, graduated January 1993 from Buckingham
University in computer science with operations management. The software is
aimed at project teams developing, designing and testing new products or
services; it runs on IBM compatible PCs, with VGA/EGA graphics adaptors,
written in Topspeed Modula-2 compiler v3.02.
An interest in quality, and the application of quality function deployment
theories brought about this powerful application, which creates a systematic
method of comparing customer requirements and preferences with technical
features.
A potentially powerful tool for quality consultants, it is almost certainly
unique in its functions: research and feedback on its practical use would
make it even more convincing.
N-Plan
Written by a team of six: Stewart Waldie, Neil Peacock, Johnny Chan,
Jonathan Rees, Simon McCahy, and Samantha Ward, BTEC HND students at
Farnborough College of Technology, Computing and Maths Department.
Aimed at supervisors in health and fitness clubs, dieticians helping to
balance diets. Runs on IBM compatible PCs under MS-DOS 5, written using
Microsoft C V7.
Helping end-users to understand and eventually improve their nutritional
intake is the aim of this ingenious program, which displays food on one
side, chosen vitamins and nutrients on the other side of the screen, in a
cleverly linked, interactive and adjustable display, showing recommended and
actual amounts. Triggered by talking to the local fitness centre, it might
also save dieticians tedious searches through books.
City News Analyser
Written by Matthew Lett, BSc in computer science; graduated July 1993 from
University of Wales.
Aimed at private investors with a portfolio of shares, and stockbrokers as a
service to their customers, corporations.
Runs on IBM compatible 286, under MS-DOS 5 written in Turbo C, using
Teletext adaptor for downloading data.
Private investors who want to keep a check on share performance were the aim
of this tool. The author had spotted a gap in existing products at the home
and low-end of the market, and aimed to deliver faster, more up-to-date
data, through a very simple interpretation and presentation. Thorough
research of the technical potential was evident, but real users, if tested,
might require more flexibility in analysis and selection.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (33): Common
standards essential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The need for user education is not the only barrier to the acceptance of
object-oriented computing, writes Philip Manchester.
Like the open systems movement which it grew out of, object-oriented
computing demands that rival manufacturers agree on fundamental standards,
This has proved to be very difficult for the computer industry in the past.
Despite paying lip-service to international standards, manufacturers have
persistently found ways to lock customers into their software products.
The effort to spread object-oriented standards is caught up with the battle
to dominate the market for operating environments in client-server systems.
The main contenders are Microsoft with its Windows NT system and the Unix
faction backed by almost everyone else.
The adoption of common standards by both contenders is essential if
object-oriented computing is to succeed.
The Unix faction is largely committed to the standards published by the
Object Management Group (OMG).
But despite its membership of OMG, Microsoft has, so far, failed to back the
standards and has devised its own alternatives in some areas.
Reliable industry sources suggest, however, that Microsoft is about to
acquiesce and back certain important OMG standards publicly.
This will be a significant breakthrough. Microsoft's dominance of the
personal computer software market means that it has taken over IBM's role as
the authenticator of new software technologies. Its backing of common
standards for object-oriented computing will give millions of users the
confidence to look at the object-oriented computing more closely.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (32): Promise of a
golden era - Technology trends / Business briefing / Object-oriented
computing, like many earlier software technologies, has grown into yet
another bandwagon. The computer industry creates them regularly, usually to
try and put right the problems that were caused by previous technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Object-oriented computing promises to bring about a new golden era in
software. By enforcing engineering disciplines in software production, it
aims to create good software cheaply and quickly.
Object-oriented computing is being called a 'paradigm shift' and has
attracted more attention than any other 'breakthrough' in the past year.
Despite the noise and prattle, there is evidence that object-oriented
computing is not attracting as much support from users as the eager software
product suppliers would like.
Although there are encouraging results from pioneering users the vast
majority of companies have put objects on the back burner while they deal
with more pressing problems such as maintaining their old applications and
coping with the switch to client-server systems.
Advocates of object-oriented computing claim that many of these problems
could be solved by adoption of object-oriented methods.
But users, it would seem, still need to be convinced.
The computer industry has, after all, an uncanny ability to re-invent itself
and persuade us all that they really will get it right this time. Professor
Tony Hoare, one of the fathers of modern software, observed this trait in
his Turing Award speech in 1980:
'You shouldn't trust intelligent programmers. We can think up such good
arguments for convincing ourselves and each other of the utterly absurd.
Especially don't believe us when we promise to repeat an earlier success
only bigger and better next time.'
Every two or three years, a 'new' software technique is dragged from the
laboratory, turned into a marketable product and foisted on the bewildered
computer user as the answer to their prayers. Object-oriented computing is
only the latest in a long line of technologies claiming to be a panacea.
Relational databases, artificial intelligence, expert systems,
computer-aided software engineering, graphical user interfaces, open
systems, networking and work group software have all promised to solve the
problem of getting a computer to do what we want - quickly, easily and
cheaply. None of them has succeeded.
While it is true that some of these technologies have advanced computing a
little, the approach to designing a computer system to solve a business
problem is still essentially the same as it was 30 years ago.
But if the supporters of object-oriented computing are right, this is about
to change. They say that objects offer a new way to think about computer
software systems and how they are put together. In place of the traditional
technology-driven approach of the last 30 years, object-oriented computing
aims to relate computer systems more closely to the real world and to turn
software production into a genuine branch of engineering.
This has, of course, been the goal of software scientists since computers
were first used and all of the technologies listed above were aimed at
achieving this.
So why should we believe them this time? There are signs that many users are
not being taken in by the hype. A recent survey from UK-based market
researcher Spikes Cavell shows that most users do not consider
object-oriented computing an issue and do not let it influence their buying
decisions.
A survey, The Battle for the Buyer, published earlier this year, asked more
than 200 UK companies which issues were the most important in determining
the purchase of development tools. Object-oriented computing comes well down
the list with more traditional concerns such as maintenance and ease of use
rating much higher. Only 20 per cent of users saw object-oriented computing
as important.
'Software vendors continue to leap on the latest bandwagon. Today it is
object-orientation. While this technology is unquestionably important, the
market believes it will be some time before it is applicable to real-world
applications,' says Mr Luke Spikes, managing director of Spikes Cavell.
'Software vendors promote new technology in hopes of creating some
differential advantage and, although we need them to continue to push the
barriers of what is technically possible, this must be tempered with a
degree of responsibility and maturity in how these technologies are brought
to market,' says Mr Spikes.
The survey also asked how companies though their priorities might change.
About 60 per cent expected object-oriented to become more important in the
future.
In defence of software vendors, Mr Paul Ellis marketing manager of Inference
Europe, an object-oriented (O-O) tools developer, says that the market has
been confused by unjustified claims:
'There is lots of noise about object-oriented computing. There are so many
developers trying to claim the crown, when only half a dozen tools are
really object-oriented,' he says.
'But just because it is fashionable, this does not mean that it is not
useful. The importance of object-oriented computing is how it is closely
tied to other innovations like open, client-server computing,' says Mr
Ellis.
He claims that Inference's US-developed ART*Enterprise is one of the few
genuine object-oriented development tools. Like its rivals, it promotes the
tried-and-tested engineering principle of building systems from sets of
pre-written 'components'. In O-O jargon these are called class libraries and
contain a wide range of 'tested' objects which can be combined with new ones
to create applications.
This approach is widely used in graphical operating environments such as
Apple's Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows where the same print driver might
be re-used by many different programs.
This ability to re-use software is seen as one of the main virtues of
object-oriented computing. It helps to cut development costs, reduce
maintenance burdens and allows greater flexibility to change applications to
suit business needs.
All users can understand the benefits of this - but they seem less convinced
about the large investment needed to move to object-oriented computing.
Mr Ellis of Inference sees the issue as one of education: 'People have to
walk into this with their eyes open. It is a change in ways of thinking and
it needs commitment and investment for the long term,' he says.
This change in the way people think about information processing systems is,
perhaps, the main barrier to the acceptance of O-O computing.
The large skill pool which has built up around traditional data processing
software such as Cobol and IBM mainframe operating systems also needs to be
taught to think differently:
'It takes between three and six months to re-educate experienced people.
They traditionally think algorithmically and they have to learn how to think
in terms of objects. The whole issue is about seeing that software
engineering is different with objects,' says Mr Tim Hoverd, chief engineer
at Logica, the UK software company.
After 10 ten years' involvement with object-oriented systems, Mr Hoverd
acknowledges that it is not easy to get people to adapt. But he is
optimistic: 'We are seeing signs of movement and there are now demonstrable
applications in areas such as finance and telecommunications,' he says.
While some of the concepts of O-O computing are easy to follow, others are
less so. Objects can, for example, 'inherit' characteristics from other
objects. A 'secretary' object is a special case of an employee object.
Clearly, many of the characteristics of a 'secretary' object can be
'inherited' from the general employee object. While this is not entirely
alien to traditional programmers, it is not easy to grasp how it is applied
in object-oriented systems and inheritance rules can become very
complicated.
'Programmers traditionally think of lists of instructions and they need to
learn how to handle objects and things like inheritance and software re-use.
This is difficult to get through,' says Mr Richard Godfrey of system
consultant Infonet Systems.
'We meet very definite resistance at first. But the people we have taken
from the old programming world have adapted. When they grasp things like
inheritance, they see how quickly they can change things,' he says.
'We use a tool called Powerbuilder from Powersoft and find it very useful
environment. It encourages team working and helps people to think in the
right way,' Mr Godfrey says.
Right-thinking when it comes to O-O computing is a big barrier - especially
for experienced computer staff.
Mr Robert Pemberton, chairman of Software 2000, a US company specialising in
object-oriented computing for business, likens the transition to that which
happened in the 1960s:
'Many of the people that started on second-generation computers did not make
the transition to third-generation technology. Object-oriented computing is
the first genuine fourth-generation technology - and it is not a pleasant
experience for someone who has been around this industry for any length of
time.'
Mr Pemberton goes on to say that there are still not sufficient good
development tools which will help people understand and exploit
object-oriented technology.
It is still, perhaps, too early to judge object-oriented computing.
While it promises a great deal in the long term, the overstated ambitions
for O-O computing mean that it will, like its predecessors, fail to meet
many of its goals. And the computer industry's tendency to stick the latest
fashionable tag on every product it sells will slow its acceptance. In the
1990s, users cannot be so easily taken in.
Breakthrough predicted
The Object Management Group (OMG) predicts that 1996 will be the year
object-based systems break through into the mainstream. By this time, OMG
says that over more than half of the world's biggest computer users will be
making substantial use of object-oriented programming techniques.
Some brave pioneers have taken the plunge and the entrants for the
Infomatics Object Application awards at Objectworld UK in October gives some
indication of progress. Health insurance company Western Provident
Association (WPA) won an award for its Midas application - a system for
monitoring underwriting ratios in healthcare.
The system collects administrative and claims data from WPA's Bull and Wang
computer systems and brings them together on a Hewlett Packard 9000 computer
operating Unix and Sybase database software. Midas provides a simple
object-based workstation front end for use by WPA's general managers.
The Petroleum Science and Technology Institute also picked up an award for
its Hedera Project, a geological modelling package for use in oil and gas
exploration.
Other award winners included IBM UK, for the best use of object technology
in a large system environment, and BAeSema's marine division for its Necta
underwater environmental analysis program.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (31): VAT officers
go electronic / Customs and Excise application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portable computers have replaced report forms in the briefcases of VAT
control officers visiting VAT-registered businesses and traders, writes John
Kavanagh.
The VATPACE system, developed by HM Customs and Excise and running on
Toshiba computers, helps officers check VAT returns and payments by
providing programs to handle tasks such as cash reconciliation and margin
calculations.
The officers write up their reports of their visits using an electronic
form, displayed on the computer screen. The Fillaform system is based on the
Formware software product from UK company European Printing Systems.
Formware can include facilities for validating information as it is keyed
in, for example to check numeric calculations. VAT officers use this
facility to check the likely validity of VAT registration numbers.
Formware prints the completed forms on plain paper, printing graphical items
such as a logo, boxes and ruled columns at the same time as the textual and
numeric information.
Before HM Customs and Excise introduced VATPACE and Fillaform, the visit
report forms were supplied on pre-printed stationery and were filled in by
hand.
The form includes details of all aspects of the visit, from the people
interviewed and the items checked to any over or under declarations and
action that was taken - 'managers can now read the completed forms more
easily,' says the VATPACE deputy project manager, Mr Phil Townsend.
'In addition, if a manager asks for extra information the form can easily be
amended. By the same token it is easy to change the form design through the
system.'
Other benefits arise from the fact that the system uses plain paper.
'Pre-printed stationery is expensive and takes storage space,' Mr Townsend
says. 'When the form design changes, the old stationery is wasted. We can
now use plain photocopier paper, which is much cheaper. And we only print
the forms we need, and when they are complete.'
The project team looked at using a standard word processing package before
settling on Formware.
'We needed a package with a powerful macro programming language which would
enable us to put in a front-end to the word processor to prompt the users
through the system,' Mr Townsend says. 'We decided the Fillaform idea was
easier and it's certainly worked out no more expensive.'
HM Customs and Excise has 1,500 VATPACE computers and its bulk purchasing
means it pays around Pounds 90 per computer to use Fillaform.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (30): Turnover
doubled / An address look-up system based on postcodes has helped holiday
company English Country Cottages to cut the time of telephone calls for
bookings by a third and improved accuracy and information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH

<TEXT>
English Country Cottages sells self-catering holidays in 4,000 properties,
let on behalf of the owners, mainly in the UK but also now in Europe and New
England in the US.
Its annual Pounds 500,000 UK advertising budget produces 150,000 responses;
mailshots to 250,000 people bring in 75,000 enquiries; and 170,000 brochures
are sent to past customers. The company has 100 full-time and part-time
staff working from converted farm buildings in Fakenham, Norfolk, writes
John Kavanagh.
The company has doubled in turnover to Pounds 30m in the last five years and
puts much of its success down to its computer systems, running on ICL DRS
6000 equipment under the Unix operating system.
The booking system includes the Quickaddress package from UK firm QAS
Systems. This product is built around the Post Office's file of 1.7m
postcodes and 24.5m associated addresses.
The package produces complete addresses from a name and postcode or from
other partial and misspelt information. It can be used to clean up databases
and eliminate duplicates and to sort mailshots to give the best savings
through the Post Office's Mailsort discounts. Customised information
relating for example to sales territories or local authority wards can also
be held.
QAS Systems says the package cuts the number of keystrokes to enter an
address by up to 80 per cent if the postcode is known.
Many of these claims are confirmed by Mr Brian Soper, information technology
manager at English Country Cottages.
'A typical customer booking-call that used to take three minutes now only
takes two, and it now also includes all the confirmations we can provide,'
Mr Soper says.
Callers can now ask for properties in specific areas or near certain towns.
English Country Cottages sends property postcodes to QAS, which provides a
file linking postcodes to the holiday company's map references. Broad areas
can be entered and the system provides lists of properties in that area. The
address of the chosen property is transferred to the booking screen.
'Before we had this system we couldn't do such tightly-focused searches,'
Brian Soper says. 'Very few of our properties are in towns, so it was no use
searching by town name. Normally it meant searching by county, a much larger
area.'
Customers' own addresses are now generated automatically and accurately from
minimal information from the caller.
Operators can take credit or debit card payments and the booking system
checks the cards and authorises payments through on-line links to the
appropriate financial services organisations.
Telephone bookings are normally confirmed by the customer with a booking
form. Brian Soper says that because the use of Quickaddress guarantees the
address held by the system is accurate, it is no longer necessary to check
the address and postcode on the form.
'We are looking at eliminating booking forms and we couldn't do this without
knowing the address was accurate,' he says. 'We have very tight quality
assurance here.'
English Country Cottages paid Pounds 7,000 for Quickaddress. Prices range
from Pounds 875 for the first year and Pounds 250 for subsequent years for a
personal computer version to Pounds 35,000 and Pounds 9,000 for a system
running on a mainframe with more than 150 users. Maintenance ranges from
Pounds 275 to Pounds 12,000, including quarterly updates of the postcode
address file.
QAS Systems has 500 UK customers and is the biggest third-party outlet for
the postcode address file.
QAS was formed in 1990, and expects its turnover to grow 70 per cent in
1993-94 to Pounds 1.5m and net profit to grow from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds
200,000.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (28): Crackdown
against copying - Software piracy / Illegal copying, software viruses, games
and pornography are among the risks when office automation goes live
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One problem with giving staff personal computers (PCs) with word processing
and spreadsheet programs is that they can run other software, too. The
results can range from lost files wiped out by computer viruses, to fines
and imprisonment for company directors for illegal copying of software
products.
The issues surrounding the running of other software are related not so much
to the wasting of company time on games and pornography as to the risks of
viruses and illegally copied business software products being loaded into
office computers.
The Business Software Alliance, representing the world's biggest PC software
companies, says as much as half of its members' products are copied. UK
users are among the more responsible: the copying rate here is between 30
and 40 per cent.
Lotus Development, supplier of the 1-2-3 spreadsheet package, last year
appointed a director of copyright protection after estimating that half its
users worldwide were using pirated copies. Wordperfect and Microsoft
recently found pre-release versions of their products on on-line bulletin
board systems available to anyone who could communicate through a PC.
The UK's Federation Against Software Theft (Fast) says its 1,100
investigations last year found that most copying - almost 60 per cent - is
done by people who are unaware of the copyright law. A fifth is done by
computing managers seeking to cut costs. Only 12 per cent is by people or
companies which sell software.
'So many people simply don't realise it's illegal to copy the word
processing or database program that's passed across the desk,' says Mr Bob
Hay, chief executive of Fast and a former chief superintendent in London's
Metropolitan Police. 'Because it doesn't feel like a crime, they don't think
of it as one.'
Fast was formed in 1984 and has more than 450 member companies, including
leading computer companies and users.
Fast has also recently surveyed 600 company directors, who face up to two
years in prison and unlimited fines if their organisation is caught copying
software. About 45 per cent of directors believe copying goes on in their
organisations.
This survey shows that the main reason for copying is that it is so easy:
this was mentioned by 65 per cent. Cost was mentioned by 58 per cent.
Those questioned now take the whole issue seriously. More than 80 per cent
believe observance of the law should be tackled by top management, although
half feel it is the users who should be responsible for their own software
piracy.
More than 70 per cent would take action against employees found copying
software and a fifth of these make it a dismissal offence.
One fear connected with software piracy is that of the introduction of
viruses. Any disc brought from outside, whether it holds pirated software or
a legally bought product or is a give-away by a computer magazine, can
contain a program which at best periodically displays a rude message and at
worst deletes information. One estimate says there are more than 1,200
viruses in existence, although a dozen or so are the most prevalent.
As with software piracy, the introduction of viruses is generally down to
ignorance and an absence of safeguards. Surveys show that well over 80 per
cent are introduced by people loading a floppy disc.
Slack management is highlighted by Fast as a reason for software copying: a
third of directors questioned mentioned a lack of adequate software
management policies as a reason. Companies reported on in this issue of
Software At Work certainly believe firm policies pay off.
Mr Tony Fisher, audit and security manager at PC auditing company Safe
Guard, pinpoints the management issue as the main cause of the introduction
of both viruses and illegally copied software.
'Companies are spending thousands of pounds a year on office hardware and
software but it's being badly managed,' he says. 'The decentralisation trend
means more managers are getting their own budgets and spending authority and
often buy PC products on their credit cards. There's no central control over
these purchases and their use.'
Safe Guard, a joint venture by Barclays Computer Operations and systems
house Deverill Computers and Communications, uses the Incontrol Audit
package from Greenscreen to run its auditing service.
An auditor loads the Incontrol disc into each computer and the program scans
the system to record information about the software that is loaded and about
the equipment configuration. Incontrol later produces reports about all the
machines and software. It is then up to management to decide whether to
delete rogue software or buy extra licences.
'We find all sorts of things,' says Mr Fisher. 'We find viruses by the
bucketful. We always check for viruses before we load the Incontrol disc, as
we don't went to get it infected.
'One leading bank with tight control told us it has one or two in every 100
PCs infected every year. In offices where there are few or no controls we
find up to 10 per cent of machines infected.
'We find lots of pornography, sometimes animated. We find it on senior
managers' PCs and across whole departments. In a department it's probably
like a porno magazine: one person brings it in and it does the rounds. We
find machines full of rubbish: ancient files which no one needs. On one
machine recently we found 12 earlier versions of the DOS operating system.
'We also come across machines which are running vital work, but can't be
accessed. They might be managing all the files on an office network but
no-one has the password and the staff who set up the system have gone.'
One way of preventing staff from bringing in discs is to make it impossible
for them to load the discs until they have been checked.
Clerical Medical Investment Group does this by using the Disknet package
from Reflex Magnetics. The package is loaded on every PC and will only read
discs which have a special code, calculated from the disc contents. The code
is inserted by a known clean PC running one or more virus checking packages
and typically referred to as a sheepdip or gateway.
If the disc contents are changed by a user at his or her own PC, for example
by editing a document, the Disknet program on that PC calculates a new code.
A user can therefore move a disc between PCs which run Disknet, and are
therefore free of viruses, without having to put it through a virus scanner
every time.
This means that scanners only have to be installed and updated on specific
gateway machines, not on every office PC.
'We had a couple of very minor incidents and saw the likelihood increasing,'
says Mr Mark Oram, a computer security analyst at Clerical Medical. 'We
assumed that if we got a virus the source would probably be software brought
from home or from magazines, so we wanted to prevent staff bringing it in.
'We didn't want to rely on people going to a sheepdip PC to run a virus
check: it's very easy to forget. But this package forces them to do so.'
Enforcement and education are seen as the complementary ways of stamping out
viruses and software piracy.
Bob Hay at Fast comments: 'As long as software copying exists, we have a
role in education and enforcement - we must continue to work to increase
commitment from management.
'The battle is far from won.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (29): Software to
the rescue - Faster faxes / From PC to PC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fax machine has emerged as a wonderful piece of communications
technology which is held back by inefficient software - software in the form
of the human users. Computer software is now coming to the rescue in the
form of packages which enable users to send and receive fax messages
directly from and to their personal computers (PCs), writes John Kavanagh.
The trouble with the fax machine, the argument goes, is that the user
typically has to print the document to be sent, fill in a cover sheet, walk
to the fax, load the document and dial, wait around 45 seconds for each page
to go through the machine, possibly wait for the transmission report to be
printed, walk back to the office and file the document.
All this is eliminated if the user can send the fax directly from a PC. Mr
Tony Adams, telecoms manager at international law firm Clifford Chance,
points to this fact as a benefit of installing an automated system.
'People no longer spend time standing over a fax machine,' he says. 'That
was an expensive pastime because in effect they were doing nothing.'
UK and US studies highlight the costs of the manual procedures.
The International Computer Fax Association, based in the US, calculates that
if an organisation sends just 25 faxes a day it will save over Pounds 12,000
a year on labour costs alone by using an automated system.
In the UK, European Printing Systems, which sells a fax package, concludes
in a detailed costings report that in an organisation sending 40 three-page
faxes a day, the time spent on the task adds up to two-thirds of one
person's work. Its study shows that it takes over seven minutes to print,
send and file a document with two pages plus a cover sheet.
On incoming faxes there are variable costs of sorting and distribution,
depending on each organisation's individual arrangement.
Mr Martin Hannah, managing director of system supplier Topcall, says all
these costs, largely overlooked by senior management, need prompt attention,
given a Gallup survey showing that the number of faxes sent in the UK will
increase by over 130 per cent this year.
Tony Adams at Clifford Chance confirms that significant staff savings are
possible. The firm sends and receives more than 20,000 pages every day by
fax at its London head office and used to have 50 central fax machines and
50 more dotted around the building. By installing an automated system - and
without providing direct links to PCs - its central service has been
extended to a 24-hour operation without increases in the 22 fax and telex
support staff.
The European Printing Systems study also details printing and stationery
costs. These add up to 8.4p for a cover sheet and a two-page letter using
headed stationery. A three-page incoming fax costs 6p in stationery. If it
is then photocopied, this adds 4.2p. The organisation both sending and
receiving 40 faxes a day thus spends almost Pounds 1,935 a year on
stationery.
The other cost highlighted by system suppliers is that of transmission.
Costs can be cut by up to 30 per cent if faxes are sent at cheap rates.
Office fax machines can be loaded with a document and programmed to dial and
send unattended in the evening. However, Martin Hannah at Topcall believes
that 'very very few machines ever get programmed, and then only in some
limited way'.
Almost all the manual and stationery costs can be eliminated by automated
systems. Users do not leave their seats to send faxes but press a few keys
on the PC keyboard. Images of incoming faxes are typically inspected on a
screen by an operator and directed electronically to the addressee. Any
number of recipients and transmission times can be set through the keyboard.
Stationery costs are cut because documents do not have to be printed.
Incoming faxes can be filed on an optical disc (CD-ROM), although the
European Printing Systems report assumes half will be printed.
However, achieving the savings demands initial investment. Clifford Chance
operates a Faxswitch system from Comwave, a combined package of equipment
and software. Prices for this system from the top of the range start at
Pounds 30,000 and go up to Pounds 120,000. Comwave also offers a package for
local area networks: this starts at Pounds 1,495 for up to 20 users and goes
up to Pounds 4,500 for 100 users. A system for a single self-contained PC,
including the circuit board to attach the computer to the telephone line,
costs Pounds 595.
Tony Adams at Clifford Chance says the system cost 'a lot of money' but adds
that the benefits of tighter control, enhanced service, staff savings and
automated archiving have more than justified the cost.
The benefits have been achieved even though Clifford Chance has stopped
short of linking staff personal computers to the Faxswitch. Tony Adams
believes having incoming faxes directed automatically to people's computers
raises important issues such as what happens when a person is away for a
fortnight: an important fax demanding immediate attention could disappear
into the person's computer until his return.
The central switching system supports 35 document scanners and 35 laser
printers installed over 18 floors and serving 2,000 staff. Central operators
can view incoming and scanned documents through 10 A3 screens.
Two supervisor screens handle a range of tasks, including queue management
and time deferrals.
'All faxes are now logged automatically, so we know if a fax has arrived or
been sent,' Mr Adams says.
'The built-in accounts package means jobs can be costed accurately and
automatically. This was previously done on paper, which meant people forgot
to log
faxes and the information might be illegible - we can now account for a
greater proportion of faxes, so we have better management control. The
accounting information is passed to our accounting system on our IBM AS/400
computer on floppy disc.'
Fax images are archived on to an optical storage system. Mr Adams says the
introduction of this system 'was like moving from a quill pen to a word
processor': faxes used to be photocopied and filed manually.
The broadcast facility is used extensively. As Tony Adams puts it, 'It's
much faster and easier to send a 15-page document to 50 people.'
Service to staff has improved considerably, Mr Adams says. Previously the
fax service was similar to a central internal mail service. Today incoming
faxes are directed automatically to a laser printer in a mail room on each
floor and delivered by hand. Outgoing documents can be put through a local
scanner operating 12 times faster than a fax machine.
The number of fax machines has been reduced to around 15. Tony Adams says:
'we're realistic enough to know you would never do away with them
completely. There will always be someone who wants his own machine and they
provide back-up in case of a disaster.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (27):
Standardisation, a two-edged sword - Consultant's critique / Polygram and
DHL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a stable operating environment, standardisation offers benefits via
economies of scale and reduced re-training. This is balanced by loss of
flexibility.
Standards can be applied to inputs, processes or outputs. For word
processing, input standards would cover such things as the layout of
documents, house styles and so on. Process standards would cover the
software package used and output standards would apply to the file formats
used.
POLYGRAM has chosen to standardise processes and outputs by insisting on the
use of Wordperfect only. Mr John Higgins, the group's director of
information technology, claims that this gives massive savings. It could
equally be argued that companies buying in the quantities claimed by
Polygram can also obtain considerable discounts, providing similar scope for
savings.
A commitment to a single vendor has advantages but also carries risks. Once
a supplier knows that a customer is locked in by an agreement, the balance
of power shifts subtly. Many large companies deliberately avoid such
agreements in order to keep vendors on their toes.
In a changing software market, a commitment to a sole supplier can prevent a
company from taking advantage of new software trends. Wordperfect was slow
in coming outwith a Windows version of its software. Indeed, Microsoft was
able to tempt away Wordperfect users by offering a migration path on to its
Word for Windows package.
Mr Higgins clearly believes in keeping tight control, though obviously this
does impose extra costs of monitoring and verification. Staff entering
Polygram who are already very familiar with a different package will need to
be re-trained.
DHL has a more flexible approach and does not appear to standardise as much.
They admit that they lose some formatting when transferring documents via
the Uniplex system.
If the object is to increase connectivity, it is usually better to
standardise on outputs - such as a standard file format, rather than the
processes. Both companies could simply insist on a common file format (say,
the Wordperfect format) which all packages must support to be approved. Most
of the leading word processors can read each other's formats. It would be
sensible to select one that all the software can use and then insist that
everyone generates that format.
Given that the aim is to produce readable documents, it might even be better
to move the focus on to presentation. I have seen far too many documents
that are poorly laid out or which contain spelling errors.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (25): It's all
change at the ministry - Maiden project at the Ministry of Agriculture /
'Change management' is the key to success for an office automation project
involving 3,000 staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is equipping 3,000 staff
with office automation over the next three years, reports John Kavnagah.
The Maiden project (Ministry of Agriculture Integrated Desktop Environment
for the Nineties) is a big challenge for the computing department, which is
running the project with support from Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems.
The end-users are divided into more than 20 work groups in half a dozen
towns and cities; some are split between sites. The work groups are largely
autonomous and to an extent control their own computing. Most of these
staff, who have not used personal computers (PCs) in their work before, are
now being given the most powerful standard office PCs available, based on
Intel's 486 processors. They are also getting Microsoft Windows software as
needed: Word for word processing; the Excel spreadsheet package; Powerpoint
for graphics and MS Project for project management. Siemens Nixdorf is
supplying all the equipment and software, including the company's own most
powerful office computers as local processors.
The whole lot is being tied together in an electronic mail and data network,
providing text communication and access to mainframe computer systems for
those who use them.
'We've introduced a management of change process,' says Mr John Kennedy, one
of the project's managers. 'We start talking to a work group six to nine
months before installation. We have to anyway, because we need to know the
numbers of staff and so on. But this is an opportunity for us to start the
group thinking about change management, what needs to be done and the
benefits.
'One of our main tasks is to help them in this management of change. We meet
them at least every two weeks in the run-up, but it's their project. Work
groups typically hold awareness sessions, run newsletters for staff, work on
operational procedures and look at the ergonomics aspects and plan new
furniture.'
The ministry has analysed the skills of individual users and Siemens Nixdorf
has developed training at different levels. PC appreciation courses are
available for people new to computers. There are basic courses on the word
processing and spreadsheet packages and intermediate courses for already
experienced users. Advanced courses on the applications, local networking
and system administration are provided to local systems administrators.
The most detailed training is on word processing - 'the spreadsheet package
is available to everyone but initially we just make people aware of the
potential rather than give detailed instruction,' Mr Kennedy says.
Everyone gets half a day on electronic mail. Mr Kennedy says all the work
groups see big benefits in this facility, especially those split across
sites.
Standard templates have been set up for documents of different types, with
specific typefaces and character sizes. As Mr Kennedy says: 'A package such
as Word offers a large number of fonts and if you give people free rein you
risk getting some horrendous looking documents.' (That is also a reason why
the trainers do not over-emphasise the availability of the graphics
package.)
User preference was a key factor in the ministry's selection of the
Microsoft products. Many who already used PCs had the Microsoft Windows
system, which uses a mouse pointer and little colour pictures of functions,
rather than keyboard instructions, and therefore more acceptable to users.
'We looked at the Lotus products but Microsoft's packages were already
available under Windows and the company was starting to take over the world
at the time,' John Kennedy says.
'Many work groups have their own budgets and users can choose what they want
but we won't support them. Non-standard products can be a problem if you
want to send a document by electronic mail, but it's not insurmountable.'
Work group autonomy means the computing department does not control the use
of the systems. The ministry is very serious about illegal software copying
(it has recently joined the Federation Against Software Theft) and about
viruses - programs which can destroy files.
'We provide any number of sheep-dip PCs loaded with virus checkers,' John
Kennedy says. 'Every PC has a big sticker saying it should only be used for
the purposes for which it is intended. We have two virus experts in our
department. We have not had any viruses in the first four months.
'We constantly hammer home the point about viruses in particular, but it's
up to the local managers to set up policies and 'police' their systems. Most
of them are concerned anyway. One work group even puts a physical lock on
each floppy disc drive, so no outside discs can be loaded.'
Every work group has at least a system administrator and, in many cases, one
or more computing specialists to look after the office network and act as
the first line of support. They liaise with a central computing department
help-desk in Guildford, Surrey.
'We don't have central control,' John Kennedy says. 'This is in line with
the way the ministry is decentralising budgets and computing. We keep
telling the users that it's their system and it's up to them how they use
it. We're user-driven and I'm perfectly happy for users to run their own
systems.'
He adds, 'When we started it was seen as a computing department project. Now
the users are clamouring for it.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (24): Best of both
worlds - Case study / Courier service company / DHL has standardised on an
integrated office automation package - yet staff still have freedom of
choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DHL International has standardised on a single program package which
combines word processing, spread-sheet processing, electronic mail and a
database. Yet despite its worldwide investment in the package it still
allows staff to use software of their own choice.
DHL settled on the package from UK company Uniplex in 1986 and it is now
installed in most of the 200 countries in which DHL operates. A worldwide
network of computers running under the Unix operating system enables any
user at any terminal or personal computer to send a message to any other.
In the UK, 1,000 of the 1,700 staff have terminals or personal computers
linked to local Hewlett-Packard minicomputers; these connect to the central
Pyramid machine, which provides the UK link to the international network.
The staff without terminals are those who do not need them - for example,
parcel sorters in warehouses and van drivers, although the drivers are set
to be linked in, too.
The Uniplex system provides basic office automation facilities and offices
also use it to send each other details of movements of customers' parcels.
Even so, DHL allows staff to use other word processing and spread-sheet
software and even has support teams for some of these non-standard products.
'Any organisation would naturally love to standardise, but I believe in
giving choice,' says Mr Ian Benger, UK information technology director, who
personally prefers to use the Wordperfect product for word processing. 'If
someone's very familiar with another system it can be frustrating to have to
switch.
'With a good office automation system it shouldn't matter what word
processors people use as long as when they send their messages the
recipients can understand them.
'The power of Uniplex is that it allows people to communicate very quickly
and easily across different computers and in any format.
'Uniplex supports different word processors and ensures the messages are
received in the right formats, although you lose character attributes such
as bold and italic. Spread-sheets from different packages can also be
handled in this way, although not quite as well.'
Ian Benger's department supports Uniplex, Wordperfect and the Microsoft Word
word processors. All training on Uniplex in particular is done internally.
Staff can request other packages outside these three but there would be no
internal support.
Mr Benger is very conscious of the need to control the introduction of
non-standard software.
'Any organisation has a responsibility to control what its staff are doing,'
he says. 'If someone wants to use a different package, my department buys it
and installs it. That ensures our people do not bring in software which they
have copied illegally. In addition, we keep the supplier's master discs, so
they cannot be handed round and loaded on different PCs. This means we know
what software is loaded and where.
'We run a constant audit exercise. There is no formal check every three
months, but when we get calls for support we take the opportunity to examine
the local PCs and if we find software that shouldn't be there we delete it.
This ad hoc auditing means users can't prepare for a check.
'Software piracy hasn't been a real problem for us, perhaps because of our
view that you must stamp it out before it starts. Piracy is a disciplinary
offence here.'
Although staff are allowed to use software of their choice, the electronic
mail facilities of the Uniplex system have been a great success. DHL
previously used fax machines and the telephone for internal communication.
'Everyone uses electronic mail now, as a matter of course,' Ian Benger says.
'All internal mail and memos go by electronic mail, regardless of whether
the recipient is in the next office or on the other side of the world.
'It's certainly affected our use of the phone: if a message is not urgent,
people don't even bother with the phone; and if it is urgent, people try the
phone and if there's no answer they send an electronic mail message. We've
looked at voice mail twice, including just three months ago, but still
decided we wouldn't make full use of it because of the success of electronic
mail.'
One new move is a switch from computer terminals to personal computers.
There are currently 300 personal computers; the remaining 700 terminals will
be replaced over the next three years. During that time, DHL is likely to
move to the new Uniplex Ongo package, which brings in the graphics of
Microsoft Windows and the Unix equivalent - Motif. The original version used
by DHL uses standard terminals largely limited to text only.
DHL has tended to buy Compaq personal computers but Ian Benger says the
relationship with the supplier is more important than standardising on
particular products. DHL has a 'very good relationship' with supplier
Corporate Computers, he says.
Another development is planned outside the office. At present, couriers in
the UK have a small bar-code reader and data recorder for gathering data
about parcels as they are picked up and delivered, plus a receive-only radio
linked to a printer which prints instructions about customer pick-ups.
DHL is now looking at the new so-called personal digital assistants such as
Apple's Newton notepad: information and commands are entered by writing on
the small screen with an 'electronic pen.' Mr Benger points out that such
devices could store and gather much more information. Two-way radio links
would enable couriers' devices to transmit information back to the Uniplex
system as soon as a pick-up or delivery was made, giving DHL more up-to-date
tracking information.
An important benefit for staff morale and motivation would be that people
working away from an office, largely on their own, could be sent internal
memos and notices through the Uniplex system to their hand-held computers.
COMPANY SNAPSHOT:
DHL International is a leading international air courier, operating in 200
countries and moving 80m packages a year. There are 28,000 staff worldwide;
1,700 in the UK, working from 36 sites. The company turnover is Dollars
2.5bn, worldwide.
Computers: worldwide network of computers running under the Unix operating
system, especially Pyramid and Hewlett-Packard machines.
In the UK, 35 sites have Hewlett-Packard computers, all linked to a Pyramid
machine at the head office near Heathrow Airport, west London, which
supports head office processing and connects the UK network to the
international network.
There are 700 Wyse terminals and 300 personal computers.

Cost-efficient worldwide strategy - User view, Entertainment company /
Polygram aims to cut automation costs by strictly enforcing a one-product
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Entertainment company Polygram International's office automation strategy is
clear and simple, writes John Kavanagh. Everyone worldwide must use
Wordperfect for word processing and Lotus for spreadsheets. Anyone using
some other product is not only denied access to local and international
networks but can face a severe reprimand. And running illegally-copied
software or even games can lead to dismissal.
The worldwide policy is managed by Mr John Higgins, group information
technology (IT) director, from the company's headquarters in London. He
controls an international networking linking four IBM mainframe computer
data centres, including one in Romford, Essex, 30 IBM AS/400 business
minicomputers and a large number of personal computers. Here, too, the
company has a straightforward policy of standardising on the IBM PS/2.
The equipment is linked across the world through British Telecom's Global
Network Services operation. The Wordperfect Office package is used for
electronic mail.
John Higgins' reasons for standardising on a single word-processing package
are as simple as the policy itself.
'It's very cost-efficient,' he says. 'We're in the entertainment business,
not the IT business, so we have to be careful with our investment in IT. IT
is a service to the company, so we have to find the most cost-efficient and
technically efficient ways to do things.
'Our latest agreement with Wordperfect will save us hundreds of thousands of
pounds. If we had contracts with five different word processor suppliers we
couldn't get such savings or such a partnership.'
The supplier's willingness to take a partnership approach is the main reason
why Polygram settled on Wordperfect.
'The product was as good as any but more importantly they showed a desire to
be a partner,' Mr Higgins says. 'This has meant they have shown flexibility
and have changed the next release of the product to fix problems we have
highlighted. We have close contact: if we hit a problem I can phone the
individual technician who worked on that facility.'
Polygram and Wordperfect are further cementing the relationship with an
agreement negotiated under what the supplier calls its Customer Advantage
Programme. Such programmes have been set up by many big personal computer
software suppliers, including Microsoft and IBM, to offer large customers
bulk discounts and a simple way to distribute software among their users.
Under Wordperfect's programme, customers typically get a licence to
duplicate software and manuals and undertake periodic reviews to ensure
users are not breaking the licence terms, for example by taking extra
copies. The programme is open to customers buying at least 500 copies at the
same time.
Polygram is signing a single worldwide agreement which will give the company
new releases of the Wordperfect package as part of the maintenance fee. The
company is setting up centres of expertise on the package around the world
to hold the master discs and control distribution.
Polygram is now negotiating a similar arrangement with Lotus on spreadsheet
software.
John Higgins happily describes himself as 'autocratic' over the
single-product strategy. 'As long as I'm here, we'll only use Wordperfect,'
he says. 'If you join Polygram International you follow our rules: we don't
adapt to your rules.
'There is a degree of flexibility, in that some people do use non-standard
products on stand-alone PCs. But sooner or later they need to communicate
and then they must come into the fold.'
Flexibility is being forced on Polygram to an extent by its recent
takeovers, which have brought other computers and program products into the
group.
'Our recent takeovers have different strategies and we are attempting to
adapt and compromise,' Mr Higgins says. 'For example, we currently have no
Apple computers linked to the network: I don't allow them. But we recognise
a need to accommodate them and we will be looking at how to do this.'
The strict policy across a worldwide network demands strict control. As a
company with interests in the likes of Elton John, Abba and U2, Polygram is
'very very sensitive' about copyright, as John Higgins puts it. It extends
this sensitivity to its own dealings with software suppliers.
'Software copying is simply not tolerated,' Mr Higgins says. 'In some
countries the local management make it a dismissal offence. We have very
elaborate control and approval procedures for buying and installing
software.'
The approved software is installed on local office processors, supporting
personal computers through local networks. Mr Higgins says this means
software use can be controlled by professional computing staff.
Self-contained computers pose more of a problem but there are audits of
equipment and an inventory of all authorised software is kept strictly up to
date.
Staff are not allowed to bring in games software. This is partly to prevent
the use of illegally copied products and partly to remove the temptation to
play games at work. Even the two simple games supplied as part of
Microsoft's Windows software are deleted from the package.
'Putting it politely, running games is frowned on,' Mr Higgins says. 'If you
were found playing games, your manager would probably meet you in the alley
after work. We consider bringing in games as serious as running pirated
software. It's simply not allowed.'
The banning of games and other non-standard software brought in by staff is
also part of the defence against computer viruses: programs which can
destroy files or slow the processing speed.
Polygram runs virus checking programs on both the office processors (known
as servers) and on individual personal computers.
'When a PC is plugged in the first thing that happens is that the server
checks the discs and memory for viruses,' John Higgins says. 'This is done
every day when a user signs on. If a user signs off and then on again during
the day, the system just checks the memory, to save time. This procedure is
not fully installed yet but when it is, every PC in the network will be
checked every time it connects.
'We have had virus problems but our policy means we always catch the problem
at the point of entry.' He believes viruses normally get into a system
through 'honest mistakes': for example, running programs from discs issued
with computing magazines - 'very few people are vindictive: it's mostly
incompetence or insufficient training,' he says.
On the training front, Polygram has a similar policy to that on software. In
the UK and for parts of Europe it has settled on one external consultant who
has put together a standard training package on each product.
'No one gets on the network without training,' Mr Higgins says. 'In some
areas electronic mail has changed the way we do business and made us much
more efficient. In particular, time lags across the world have disappeared.
We can send electronic mail to the Far East at the end of our day, giving
them a whole day to work on the issue and send us back their work in time
for the start of our next day.
'We're now looking at remote electronic mail from people's homes and from
portable computers.'
Far from using computers and electronic mail grudgingly, senior executives
are leading the way, Mr Higgins says.
'All the corporate controllers world-wide use electronic mail,' he says. 'My
boss, the executive vice-president for finance, administration,
manufacturing and distribution, says it has changed his whole business
style. He now communicates personally through a computer with his associates
worldwide.
'This demonstrates the extent to which Polygram recognises that IT is an
integral part of the business and its future.'
Mr Higgins underlines this last comment with the fact that one of the
hottest properties in the rock music business, U2, touched on the corporate
attitude to IT as one reason why the band signed an exclusive international
publishing agreement with Polygram.
Mr Paul McGuinness, U2's manager, referred to Polygram as 'this new, heavily
resourced, modern publishing business' and to the band's desire to be with a
company which would keep ahead and deal efficiently with changes in the
international administration of music rights.
Compliments like that from a band which has sold more than 40m albums must
be music to an IT director's ears.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (22): The fun
starts when users switch on - Analysis / How to avoid breaking the law is
just one of the many management issues surrounding office automation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a lot more to office automation than giving everyone a personal
computer (PC) and a word processing package. There is the worry about how to
avoid ending up in prison for two years - the maximum penalty for copying
softare. Or losing all the document files. Or seeing time wasted on computer
games.
These are management issues which, according to companies interviewed for
this issue of Software At Work, need at least as much attention as technical
matters such as building the office network.
The benefits of basic office automation systems, built round a word
processing package and a spreadsheet system, appear to be widely assumed, if
not accurately measured. these days. A UK survey carried out for
Computervision Services, a support services company shows that nine out of
10 managers believe office networks contribute significantly to productivity
 -but only one in 10 measures the gains.
Organisations expect an average increase of 65 per cent in the number of
office network users over the next year. But 40 per cent of companies and 80
per cent of public sector bodies do not make any business case for network
purchases.
A European study by research firm Ovum says sales of word processing,
spreadsheet, desk-top publishing and associated graphics software will
double between 1992 and 1997, growing faster than the software market as a
whole. Word processor sales will grow the most quickly.
'Many new word processing packages enable users to prepare high quality
linear text documents without the need for desk-top publishing,' says Dr
Heather Stark, author of the Ovum study report. 'So while word processor
sales grow, desk-top publishing sales decline.'
Dr Stark, too, sees rapid growth in networked office PCs, especially for
electronic mail - 'personal computers will become interpersonal computers,'
she says. 'Most people will use their computers to communicate with each
other.'
The take-up of office automation suggested by the Ovum and Computervision
surveys raises considerations which were highlighted by managers interviewed
for this issue of Software At Work. These managers put special emphasis on
management issues rather than on technical matters - perhaps reflected in
the fact that, these days, word processing, spreadsheet, graphics and
database software packages are bought in large numbers as commodity items
off the shelf, often over the telephone, from direct marketing companies.
Even the more technical network products are now bought in this way.
However, management issues arise from the fact that giving office staff PCs
and word processing packages also gives them the opportunity of bringing in
games software and other business packages. This raises the issues of
viruses - programs which can destroy files and slow down processing speed -
and of illegal software copying.
These risks, and how to avoid them, are covered elsewhere in this issue. But
it is worth underlining here that directors of companies found guilty of
copying software face up to two years in prison and unlimited fines.
WHAT also emerges from the Software At Work interviews is that proper
training is vital if these other risks are to be avoided and if the massive
investment in PCs and office software is to be fully exploited.
The Computervision survey highlights this, too. When asked to name the most
frustrating or irritating aspect of dealing with the company office
networks, almost 30 per cent of computing managers mentioned 'the users'.
Users were the biggest single problem, provoking more than twice as many
mentions as the second aspect, 'diagnosing problems'.
Respondents' comments here underlined the need for training: 'user-ignorance
causes many problems'; 'users pull plugs out by mistake and then complain
that their PCs are not working'; 'users interfere with the networks without
authority: for example, by disconnecting their PCs'.
One manager summed up these views when he said: 'The users cause the
problem, not the network: we need better education for our users.'
Every other 'frustrating and irritating' factor - generally technical issues
 -was mentioned by less than 10 per cent of managers. Indeed, 8 per cent
reported no frustrating aspects at all.
It is clear that getting over the technical issues of installing PCs and
word processing software is just the start. The fun starts when the users
switch them on.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (21): Goodbye to
dusty box files - Leeds University helps in environmental study / Ready
accessibility of the system has enabled researchers in different areas to
integrate and share information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Leeds City Council wanted tourist information and an environmental
study, it turned to the local university, writes Claire Gooding.
Leeds University, regarded as one of the top GIS establishments in the
academic community, has plenty of experience in integrating data from
different sources. It has given rise to the GMAP organisation of around 60
GIS specialists, which undertakes commercial projects. With limited
resources, and a Macintosh environment, the choice of a GIS was limited.
Geo/Navigator was chosen for its flexibility - 'we needed to 'hang' data on
an existing structure,' says Jim Harbidge, a PhD researcher involved in
Leeds' environmental study.
'It was ideal because it could take in any sort of data.'
Ease-of-use is a great advantage, and Mr Harbidge says that the ready
accessibility of the system has enabled researchers in different areas to
integrate and share information in such a ways that they can benefit from
one another's findings: 'In the old days, it would have meant a search
through box-files.'
Many different authorities apart from the local Leeds Council have an
interest in the geographical data gathered by the GIS team, including the
National Rivers Authority and Yorkshire Water. Based on a Macintosh Centra,
the system has no problems connecting with other computers, and back-up is
done on a Sun Unix computer.
Mr Harbidge adds: 'It's easy to get data in, from over the road - or from
California. The GIS is a tool not just for specialists but for environment
and management - a general tool to enable people to see their assets on a
spatial scale.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (19): Less work to
cut the grass - Local government application / Horsham can pass on some of
the benefits of its GIS to its contractors when they tender
</HEADLINE>

Like many local councils, the need to manage housing and developments
triggered the development of a GIS at Horsham District Council, writes
Claire Gooding. Horsham covers a community of 110,000 inhabitants in 200
square miles in West Sussex.
'Because of the extent of data, we looked at GIS as a tool we could use to
act as a link between departmental systems, and provide a common say of
access method to look at spatial development,' explains Robert Pope,
Horsham's IT manager. 'Typically, what we needed to do was to bring up a
map, and look at such factors as planning applications and how they affect a
particular plot of land.'
Horsham District Council's interest in GIS as a way of handling spatial
information originated with the Cholsey Report in the 1980s. In 1989 it
looked at several options - from McDonnell Douglas, IBM, ICL, and Siemens.
Flexibility was vital; one of the main considerations was that the system
had to be able to access data held on the BS2000 mainframe, and connect with
textual data held on an IBM AS400.
In 1991, in the first phase of a project worth over Pounds 1m, Siemens
Plessey developed a blueprint for the council's IT strategy, using a
corporate data model based on analysis of the work-patterns and information
flow between the council's 700 or so employees.
Next came the implementation (managed by Siemens Nixdorf) of SICAD on the
BS2000 mainframe, networked with four Unix and three PC workstations in the
council's planning department.
The basis of the information included 700 OS maps covering the area, and
postcode grid-reference files from Pinpoint. Now 130,000 planning records,
dating back as far as 1948, have been captured on to the system, and each
property in the area has been assigned a unique property reference number,
used as a reference by all departments.
Horsham believes it is the first local authority to have established a
corporate property database of this sort. There can be as many as 32
different constraints on a planning application: for example, the land might
be designated an SSSI - site of special scientific interest. 'It used to
take days to collate the information needed for one planning application
from index cards, various maps and other sources.'
The system went live this November. According to Mr Pope, it promises
dramatic improvements in the service to the public.
'We can now turn round land searches within an hour,' he says.
Other applications under way are a 'land terrier,' (asset register), a
charges system for land searches. Other future uses may include a register
of contaminated land. One of the most ingenious uses for the system is the
management of compulsory competitive tenders in such areas a grounds
maintenance.
There might be as many as 500 sites covered in one estimate for
grass-cutting.
From the beginning of 1994, those submitting tenders will be helped by
digitised maps of the areas for grass-cutting.
'If prospective contractors get proper information, we will get a more
realistic price,' concludes Mr Pope.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (16): Northern
Electric turns on to maps - Utility, Power supplier / Disparate sources of
information and replicated, duplicated data made it almost impossible to
deliver specific, up-to-date details to users who needed, often urgently, to
access or maintain equipment. GIS came into its own as a way to digitise the
information
</HEADLINE>

Maintenance of accurate records is a chore for any organisation. For
Northern Electric, supplier of electricity in the north-east region of
England, the problem is escalated by connecting paper-based data with
spatial diagrams of the network, writes Claire Gooding.
Updating maps, sometimes in three different scales, was a time-consuming
operation. Since the 1920s Northern Electric has kept paper-based records of
assets, routes of cables, wayleave agreements, technical descriptions, and
other maintenance details. Disparate sources of information, and replicated,
duplicated data made it almost impossible to deliver specific, up-to-date
details to users who needed, often urgently, to access or maintain
particular equipment.
'Like every other utility, we have historically had information, but it's
been a major problem maintaining its concurrency,' explains Ian Homer, GIS
project engineer. 'It takes a large amount of effort and manpower to keep
the information in step.'
Homer's service on the industry body, the Electricity Council (now the
Electrical Association), had given him an inside view of what might benefit
Northern Electric. 'What we wanted was an integrated plant and circuit
database, an intelligent model, and GIS was the only way.' At one time,
Northern Electric used real models, miniatures of the network, but, like any
form of information, the maintenance of the model was itself a problem.
'Traditional database technology wasn't man enough. We could record
information about plant, but not cable and overhead lines: it wasn't easy to
establish connectivity,' explains Homer. He masterminded the ILIAD project,
(Integrated Line Information and Asset Data), a classic GIS prototype that
would create a single integrated database to locate all its assets and
associated information.
Nearly 20 GIS products were reviewed, but narrowed down to a shortlist of
software from Unisys, ICL, Intergraph, Smallworld and ESRA. Northern
Electric chose Smallworld because of its promising data conversion tools,
unique at the time of selection two years ago.
GIS came into its own as a way to digitise the information: a job beyond
ordinary Computer Aided Design tools. 'Data conversion used to be the
biggest cost of GIS, but it's not so any more, as we've proved with
screen-digitising tools,' comments Homer. Around 200 of Northern Electric's
4,500 employees use the system, currently available on nine workstations,
but likely to expand as works management and financial systems become fully
integrated.
A valuable result of the exercise has been a unique reference for each
customer-premises, a permanent, precise identifier which may prove as useful
to finance and marketing as it is to the asset system. The main business
benefits, says Homer, have been in efficiency. 'We can reproduce maps and
plans to any scale without replicating and maintaining three separate
scales, a great saving of manpower. We can do current work more efficiently,
giving customers notice of planned interruption to the supply, because the
identifier gives us an automatic trace of who is connected, at which point,
and can even issue notices automatically.'
Now the database is in place, Homer argues that it could be used more widely
for optimising the use of assets, identifying spare capacity, and even for
the better targeting of potential customers. in marketing exercises. The
process of validating the company data has itself been valuable, checking
the consistency and accuracy. It has also given Homer's team a realistic
grasp of what's involved in providing a GIS, before other departments start
getting their own bright ideas for using the information. 'We know all of
the questions before we roll out full scale,' says Homer.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (18): East Midlands
focus was on open system - Utility application / An asset database which
would otherwise have needed separate investment, is an extra benefit. Other
applications are emerging, from network analysis to project management

The need for a GIS evolves, it doesn't happen overnight, says East Midlands
Electricity.
Like other electricity suppliers, a lot of the information East Midlands
Electricity uses in its day-to-day operations is held on maps.
Once fully operational, its new system will serve around a thousand
end-users via 350 workstations, eventually spreading to 2,000 users
including managers, writes Claire Gooding.
The company supplies electricity to 2.2m customers in its area, and has a
turnover of Pounds 1,570m.
Information on cables, voltage, and other assets was spread around different
departments, held on paper-based systems including 30,000 different maps,
accessed typically 400,000 times a year.
Digitising the maps was one option, but the review team in 1992 started with
the business need rather than technologies. What emerged was the need to
link and network various information, some of it geographical, so that it
was truly integrated in all its forms.
One priority was an open system, running on several platforms of hardware.
'It took us 12 months to do the evaluation,' explains GIS business manager
Alan Wright. 'Above all the products we looked at, Smalltalk linked with
other systems, and went beyond mapping and other systems to an integrated
information system.'
The accent is on distributing the data, with local accessibility. 'Data
capture is a massive part of the project,' adds Wright.
'Purification and data accuracy is a vital part of the process, when you're
taking data from a number of different sources and different systems: they
don't always stay in step.' The company is currently using Ordnance Survey
digitised maps as a basis.
Once all other information is in place, it will be able to do detailed
analysis of the efficiency and stability of its network.
The cost benefits are difficult to quantify. Wright sums them up as
'avoidable investments': the effort, and manpower otherwise expended on
keeping maps up to date.
An asset database is a welcome spin-off that would otherwise have needed a
separate investment. Other applications are emerging, ranging from network
analysis to wayleave payment management, resource management, planning and
scheduling, project management and teamwork.
End users have already identified 1,200 specific needs, in every different
department. Some Wright dismisses as 'Star Wars' ideas but the majority deal
with practical requirements.
'We aim to hold that information in one place and present it as the user
wants to see it. The relational database is handy for storing large amounts
of data, for instance, types of switch gear, who uses it.'
The applications go well beyond the mapping of associated data with the
electricity network. 'The advantage is that we put the data where the user
is,' says Wright.
'It will grow from an engineering-based to encompass finance and marketing.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (13): Firefighters'
key to quickest route - User view, Emergency services / Claire Gooding looks
at a pioneering GIS in Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The more information we have, the better prepared we are if there's a fire'
 -Andrew Marles, senior divisional officer at the Gwent Fire Brigade in
Pontypool, sums up the problem facing his emergency service and others.
'It's a matter of whether to send one or multiple appliances, and whether
there might be specific risks, chemical danger or hazardous materials.'
Inspired by Terry Glossop, the chief fire officer, Gwent's approach to GIS
is an original one, comparable with some of the on-board tracking systems
used by commercial courier and security companies.
To make all the relevant information available at point of need, a mobile
control unit on the appliance is updated from a land-based system. The
information includes the quickest route to the scene, available water
sources and, when available, detailed notes on the building, including
likely location of occupants and hazardous materials.
Gwent has made imaginative use of the information available from companies -
in some cases garnered from fire prevention inspectors in the course of
their duty.
Digitised 'walk throughs' of the internal layout of a building will be a
great help to firefighters once they are inside - they can take a print-out
with them. Loading such data has not proved a problem, especially where
building plans exist in Computer Aided Design formats. 'By loading plans of
premises, a firefighter can have a hard copy of the plan, and see which
doors to open, which corridors to go down, and have that in their hand,'
says SDO Marles.
Something as specialised as the Gwent system demanded a custom-built GIS -
and something that would be easy to use for everyone, including people with
no experience of computers. An enormous amount of data storage - estimated
at 1.7 gigabytes - and fast retrieval were also important considerations.
Gwent chose the Pafec product as its base, at a cost of Pounds 50,000 or so.
PafecGIS is not an 'off-the-shelf' GIS, and this implementation is designed
to integrate with the Brigade's call mobilising system.
After initial customisation by Pafec, Gwent is doing the application
development in-house, even employing radio technicians for the specialised
communications. The system runs on two Sun SPARC stations, chosen on the
grounds of ruggedness and price-performance; one at headquarters, one on a
mobile control unit which attends large incidents. 'It's all about improving
the service,' says SDO Marles. 'If the GIS helps us to save a life, or save
property, by being able to form a fire-stop, so that the company can go back
into production quickly, then that's better service.'
At present the system is not in full use, but future plans include the
analysis of incidents, and useful statistics, presented graphically, on
events such as car fires.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (10): Well worth
the cost - User view, Health authority / Maintaining plans of premises can
be as labour-intensive and error-prone as updating maps. St Martin's
Hospital in Canterbury is using a GIS for efficient estates management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Estate management is as much a problem for hospitals as it is for any large
organisation with buildings to maintain.
Expanding departments, new equipment, and constantly changing regulations
mean that the carpenter's van and the concrete mixer are common sights in
the hospital car park.
Keeping track of alterations is the job of the estate management and
technical services department within the Canterbury and Thanet Community
Healthcare Trust.
At one hospital, St Martin's in Canterbury, the facilities directorate has
been using a geographical information system for several months as a way of
keeping all the estates information in step.
It was the duty of Bob Taylor, the estates information manager, to provide
information about the clinics, small hospitals, health centres and mental
health units in the area to planners, architects and engineers.
With a paper-based system, it was difficult to tell whether the plans were
up to date. Taylor wanted something that would dovetail the information from
the NHS WIMS asset database with architectural drawings done in AutoCAD.
'We wanted centralised information on one property or building: an
all-embracing system that would have the CAD facilities as well as the
database, so that we could bring in word processing files, drawings, files
and photos. The trouble was, no one could really define exactly what they
wanted.'
He found few packages available under Macintosh, but was sold on the
GeoNavigator product at its first demonstration by Pax.
'It all happened very quickly,' he says. 'It was installed by DataPro ABS,
the system integrator who planned the link with the asset register. The
scanning facilities mean we can read in pictures of buildings for valuation,
and photos of large equipment, for example, a laundry machine.'
The scanning facility has also been used to read in rights of way and other
information relating to the property held by the hospital.
The system is running on a Macintosh IIci with a 150MB drive, 8MB of RAM,
and a ProNitron 21' colour workstation, using MacPlot on a Calcomp
DesignMate, all acquired 18 months ago at a cost comparable with setting up
an AutoCAD seat. The entire contract with Datapro ABS, including software,
hardware and training, cost about Pounds 15,000.
Now that all the plans are on the system it is possible to perform 'what if'
experiments with the sizing and allocation of room space. It is also
possible to show managers exactly what space they have available - one of
the most useful business benefits, according to Mr Taylor.
'The Peter Principle tends to operate: people expand to fill the space
available. With the GIS we can show a nursing officer what rooms he or she
'owns' or pays for: they can decide 'we don't need that cupboard', for
instance. We're also collecting information about cubic capacity, to tell us
the cost of heating. Eventually the system will give a complete
representation of what people are doing - and where.'
It is a long job to enter all the details, a task which justifies the
employment of a trained surveyor who works full time entering data from CAD
and DOS files.
'It doesn't mean fewer staff; it means more effective staff. They can spend
time on new, worthwhile work, not checking old details.
'We're talking about highly trained people - surveyors and engineers -
supplied with accurate information for the first time.'
According to Mr Taylor, the GIS has been well worth the investment, and he
is full of examples. 'It saves time and filing space: the only drawing is
the up-to-date one. We don't waste time, money, and effort establishing
which drawing to use. We had to redraw an entire unit, to turn it round on
the plot of land: the architect was amazed it took us two hours to re-plot
instead of two days. And when it comes to doing the returns at the end of
the year, it's a matter of pressing a button.'
The latest effort has been a space-utilisation study in the new office
block, an exercise which showed there was plenty of extra capacity if
offices were re-organised. Other possibilities include planning and
personnel users, who are looking at multimedia applications.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (12): Finding out
where Welsh water flows - Utility application / For Dwr Cymru, Welsh Water,
the geographical information system is at the centre of its efforts to
document its assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Underground pipes and overground cables pose some of the thorniest problems
when taking stock of assets. Dwr Cymru, Welsh Water, is the water and
sewerage authority for Wales, and like many utilities, is taking a long-term
view of its assets and investments, writes Claire Gooding.
Welsh Water's Integrated Business Information System (Ibis) is part of its
Pounds 1.9bn investment programme, a set of integrated applications which
will provide a complete record of every aspect of Welsh Water's operations.
'The first thing was, that as a company, we needed a good asset base,'
explains Peter Lindsay, network asset manager. 'We had a multitude of
systems holding data of various states of quality and completeness,
scattered over the 21,000 sq km in which we operate.
'We realised we needed manageable systems, and, by the regulations which
brought about privatisation in 1989, we are required to keep accurate
records of underground assets.'
Consultants Coopers and Lybrand assisted in the search for a geographical
product, which started in 1989. It included test runs and bench marks of
products from SIA, IBM, and Intergraph. But it was Intergraph that impressed
Welsh Water most when it came to meeting the long-term objectives, and its
'co-operative attitude' secured a contract worth about Pounds 3.5m on
software, hardware and services. The negotiations for new water contracts
were the driver for early completion.
'We accelerated the seven-year programme to a two-year programme to be able
to capitalise on the benefits of sound, reliable data on our underground
assets,' says Mr Lindsay.
The Assets Information System built using the Intergraph system went live in
April. The largest of the 24 IBIS modules, it is a database which contains
all the maps and precise graphic, locational and descriptive details of all
under and above-ground assets. It is integrated with the business reporting
systems such as customer accounts, leakage reports and electricity usage.
'The next step is to get operational benefits, support services, efficient
record keeping, and to be able to access all data on surveys. On-line
real-time information could be valuable for such things as tracing burst
water mains,' says Lindsay.
He is now looking at expanding the use of the system into other departments,
such as estates, legal, and planning. The aim is to populate the database
with OPCS census data, and with geographical information for a 'land
terrier' (asset register) and estates system, showing boundaries such as
ancient monuments - 'there is company-wide enthusiasm, and groups of users
steering its development,' he says.

The London Borough of Merton started to explore geographical systems as a
result of its unusual contractual relationship with Thames Water Authority,
writes Claire Gooding.
As the authority responsible for the highways in the area, Merton became
TWA's agent in keeping track of the network of sewers beneath the roads. The
problem of creating sewer maps led to the idea in 1988 of digitising the
sewer network as a separate transparency, for overlaying on road-maps.
'We had hard copy maps and text about the sewer network,' explains Mick
Bird, GIS co-ordinator. 'The drawback is that there's only ever one copy,
and over the years its condition becomes very tatty.'
Thames paid for the original digitising effort in 1988-89, which provided a
digitised map for distribution to all users. In January 1990, the release of
digital maps 1:250 scale from the Ordnance Survey made it possible to extend
the system to the borough's own work.
'About 90 per cent of local authorities depend on locational references in
some part of their activities,' says Mr Bird.
'The need to produce an asset register by April 1994 has forced them to
change their approach to asset accounting.'
A steering group examined every area of the local authority's activities,
and looked at several options including Intergraph, Unisys, SIA, and
custom-built systems.
Flexibility, cost, and rapid development tools played a part in the eventual
choice of the dataMAP product from SIA, which had the further advantage of
allowing Merton to continue using its existing MS-DOS based PCs in a
networked environment under the OS/2 operating system.
SIA provided consultancy, implementation and training services as part of a
Pounds 130,000 contract, and also assisted with data capture.
Having started its GIS efforts well before there was a general recognition
of the problems involved, Merton initially had to struggle with many
problems. Now there is a seamless, minutely detailed map of Merton's entire
territory, covering 220 miles of road, 500 miles of footway, and 320 miles
of sewers. Each individual house and every piece of street furniture is
shown, including footpaths, litter bins and manhole covers.
The system runs on an ICL 386 file server, with 10 PCs and a selection of
laser and Postscript printers. Also linked to the 3-COM network are three
pen-plotters, an A4 flatbed scanner, and a digitising tablet.
Working with SIA, Merton has already produced several applications including
a planning applications management system and a land register. The dataMAP
product is written in the DataFlex 4GL programming language.
Merton's use of DataFlex for other administrative applications such as
purchase order control, skip licensing and asbestos monitoring, has made it
easy to dovetail geographical with ordinary reporting functions, and test
new ideas.
Over the four years of development, costs have risen to about Pounds
250,000, but the payback is in sight, and Bird cites a better service to the
public as one of the business benefits.
Future uses are likely to include housing, social services, leisure,
education, and electoral planning. Analysis of census data on the mainframe,
using the SPSS statistical package, is likely to provide further valuable
input for planning purposes.
'Having good locational information stored in one central place saves effort
in many areas' concludes Bird. 'However, the real business benefit is in the
general ability to draw together information from different sources so that
management can make effective decisions on it.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (6): Insight on
sites - User view / Property portfolio management / Large retail chains need
efficient property management. In the UK, Boots Properties uses a GIS to
analyse its portfolio. The business is already benefiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the UK retail property market, Boots Properties' retail portfolio is one
of the largest, including high street and out-of-town sites, writes Claire
Gooding. Boots believes that a key source of competitive advantage is the
strong emphasis it places on research to inform its business decisions.
'We recognise that the retail property market is inefficient,' says Mike
Dutton, business development and research manager. 'This presents a clear
opportunity for well-informed investors to enhance the performance of their
portfolio.'
Site location analysis involves many different variables and indicators.
Boots Properties needed a product that would work at postcode sector level,
with a wide range of census data. Most important was the ability to forecast
the performance of specific local property markets and properties in the
portfolio.
The chosen solution, CACI's InSite system, was PC-based, user friendly, and
provided detailed population forecasts. Boots Properties deliberately bought
a group licence to encourage widespread use of the system by other
businesses such as Boots The Chemists, Halfords, and Childrens World, for
their own market research and estates management.
Using OPCS census data, other bought-in consumer analyses, together with
in-house proprietary sales data, the GIS team looks at such factors as the
balance of supply and demand in the local retail property market, whether
the market is over-pricing or under-pricing a certain town, and determining
the prospects for rental growth.
The analysis is carried further using the SPSS analytical software,
integrating data about supply and demand from a wide range of databases and
different computers. Dutton is convinced that the GIS, in use since
September 1992, has already benefited the business. 'We're concerned to
maintain and enhance the asset value, and this system gives us the ability
to do that more effectively,' he says.
Better-informed decisions will result from the GIS, he concludes, and it
should be much easier to exploit market inefficiencies, especially with the
benefit of up-up-to-date census data.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (5): Plenty of
surprises here - Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IMAGINE a bookie who stands to lose everything if a horse called 'Storm and
Flood' wins the 3:30 at Goodwood. Now imagine the same bookie being unaware
of that fact.
It seems incredible but that is the position that Alexander Howden claims
many of their clients are in. I found it hard to believe that insurance
companies might be unaware of the geographical risks that they were taking.
If true, rapid enlightenment is in order for their managers.
The system that Mr Roberts showed me seemed an obvious application of the
MapInfo software. It was not particularly well done, having the marks of a
system put together by computer novices. In many ways it reminded me of the
early days of spreadsheets. Then, users wrote truly horrible Lotus 1-2-3
macros that did what they wanted but were a nightmare for anyone else to
change. The comparison is not altogether surprising as geographical
information systems are still in their infancy.
I believe that the system now needs revision and improvement from IT
specialists. Non-computer people have a tendency to re-invent wheels and to
be unaware of all the possibilities available. It seemed suprising to me
that the IT department had not been involved at all.
In my experience, it is rare for technical staff to turn up their noses at
working with leading-edge software. Perhaps they were stuck in the mainframe
mentality that sees PCs as an attack on their power base, rather than an
opportunity. I hope not.
Having said all this, the system is producing real benefits. It replaced a
tedious system (of colouring maps by hand) with a graphics package and can
offer far more refined risk analysis. While it may have rough edges, it is
generating revenue.
Lessons learned from this study:
Modern software tools empower users to develop their own solutions outside
IT departments.
Non-software people generally write poor software. Even
if it does what they want now, it is rarely possible to extend it later.
Earning revenue is more important than having a technically perfect solution

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (4): Hey ho, the
wind and the rain - Insurance industry user view / Claire Gooding looks at
how a geographical information system is helping a reinsurance broker
explore and assess financial risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wind and rain matters greatly to Alexander Howden Reinsurance Brokers. One
of four companies in the Alexander &amp; Alexander Group, its business as a
reinsurance broker is concerned with limiting the exposure of first-line
insurance companies by arranging reinsurance for customers such as Lloyds
and UK insurance companies.
In Britain, the main risks to property are flood and wind, such as the major
storm of 1987, known in the business as 87J. Predicting the effect on
insurance claims of such a storm is at the heart of evaluating both the
risk, and the value of the reinsurance.
Alexander Howden's role is as the expert in the middle, proffering advice to
both customers and reinsurers. The geographical information system (GIS)
plays a part in the assessment of risk, and the modelling of 'what-if'
scenarios, such as a flood on the east coat, or another hurricane-force
gale.
The GIS is doing a job nothing else could do, according David Evans, chief
executive of the management information systems division. It is pulling
together a mixture of geographic information, expert knowledge, and
modelling and analysis techniques, and presenting it so that clients can see
and interpret the picture for themselves.
'It's about putting things into a common denominator where our mutual
abstract thoughts can be communicated' says Evans. The risk represented by a
storm is made up of different and variable factors, such as windspeed,
trajectory, the geographical spread of policies held by the insurance
company, and the density and nature of the property.
'Over the years we've developed complex techniques to advise clients on risk
exposures, and what we've done is sophisticate those techniques on the
computer.'
Alexander Howden's job is as much about presentation as it is about facts.
Previously, the company spent hours creating one-off maps showing the
density of policies and other factors, to demonstrate exposure to clients.
The tools they used were PC graphics like Freelance, which were fine for
presentation, but ate up hours in creating maps.
The choice of MapInfo as a tool came about partly because of its ease of
use, because it could be used as a fancy presentation tool as well as for
in-house analysis. The ability to input different sorts of data, and index
it, was important, and other tools were thought not to offer the same depth,
nor the quality of presentation.
The use of postcodes for rating purposes has enabled insurance companies to
'zone' areas of risk, a geographical breakdown that forms the basis for most
of the analyses.
At the first level, there are 268 areas, indicated by the first three
letters of each postcode: further breakdowns are to 2,600 areas, and then
10,000.
According to Michael Watson, director in the non-marine reinsurance
division, information on what policies were held where was almost useless
when presented as pages of columns and figures.
'Quite frankly, you can't do anything with it. Several sheets of paper with
those figures on it was enough to send you number-blind. What we wanted to
do initially was show clients where their area of exposure was by mapping
it.'
The first problem was to get the quality of information from forty or so
clients, an operation that has taken about two years, according to manager
Graeme Roberts. For each customer, the system shows a breakdown of the areas
where the majority of policies are held, using colours to show high
densities and values. Reinsurance is bought by a certain amount, to cover
the entire UK, and the trick is to guage the amount needed, based on the
risk level and the location of policies. The system throws exposures into
stark relief by using different colours.
'It may be surprising, but few reinsurance clients have such facilities, and
neither do a lot of insurance companies,' says Mr Roberts. 'A lot of us had
no conception where the business actually was. We'd have clients coming to
see us whose gut feel was that they were pretty strong in the South-East,
whereas we could demonstrate that in fact their main area of exposure was in
the Midlands.'
The next step was to start modelling 'what if' scenarios and demonstrating
risks, again by postcode areas, linked to the likely damage caused by
flooding and gales in particular areas. This meant cross-referencing
postcodes to geological and topographical information: floods are more
likely to wreak havoc in low-lying areas.
'It's not just a selling tool, in terms of being clever. It's a matter of
putting something back into the insurance industry,' says Mr Watson. 'We're
trying to add value for our customers, keeping them informed of their
exposure and keeping them up to date.' Graeme Roberts adds: 'What we do find
is that it re-inforces the relationship. We're telling them something they
don't know. It points out their vulnerability, and they may not always be
aware of it.'
His calculations can take a complex number of factors into account, plotting
storm paths, the estimated damage according to windspeed, and all sorts of
other factors, painstakingly researched and fed into the system. 'There's a
lot of data out there. It's all a matter of getting it off the mainframe,
and that can mean a long wait. We also draw on historical analyses, studies,
published papers, geological information, all sorts.'
Mr Roberts is enthusiastic about the MapInfo software - 'it's the first
piece of software I've used that encourages you to try things out. It's all
about the power of the desktop. It's a poor man's GIS, no special equipment,
because people like us can't wait. It's saved us time, and taken all the
hurt out of the presentation process. Now our users push us quite hard to
deliver, to go out and explore new areas.'
The system has already been in development for 18 months, and regularly
leaves the office on a portable PC, to demonstrate to the clients the
quality of the information the company can offer. Watson also believes it
has helped the relationships with clients. 'It comes down to a more
understandable demonstration, which helps to get the business.'
David Evans agrees on both the value of the system, and its potential - 'we
can now calculate many more permutations, and do it interactively and
graphically, asking customers for their input. We want to expand the system
elsewhere in the world, because we regard it as one of the key roles of a
high-quality intermediary to provide this sort of service. We hope we're
ahead off the competition.'

<TEXT>
GEOGRAPHICAL information systems (GIS) are computer systems that use spatial
and topographical data as an element, usually in a database. Like may
acronyms, it is undergoing a change, driven by the broadening scope of GIS:
some argue that it should now stand for Geographical Information Science.
CDM - corporate data modelling (see Horsham story, page 12 in this survey).
This is modelling exercise for data which determines, in simplest terms,
what is located where, and what its relationships are with other data items
and systems.
EUROSTAT - Statistical Offices of the European Community - holds five
million series of data relating to all members of the European Community and
other countries, currently moving towards harmonisation of geographical data
for such applications as agricultural (Common Agricultural Policy)
administration.
GPS - Geographical Positioning Systems provides global or local co-ordinates
of a position from satellite readings. A vet or animal health inspector, for
example, might carry a laptop, which can read a specific co-ordinate for the
location of a herd with a disease. Also used in yachting for navigation
systems, and more recently for mobile security and anti-theft devices on
cars.
RASTER and VECTOR graphics formats are suited to different sorts of
graphical information. Raster information is easily scanned (captured) and
expressed as dots or pixels on the screen, such as colour television and
games machines. Raster deals well with solid blocks of colour, but needs
high-volume storage.
VECTOR is graphics data expressed as lines or vectors. Every piece of data
in a vector picture is a line. This is suited to maps, drawings, building
layouts, technical drawings. The conversion of raster to vector is an
extremely expensive process because of the intelligence needed to
recognising shapes - for example, a circle.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (2): Putting assets
on the map - There were good economic reasons for the Romans' regular census
of their citizens. The same reasons, finding out who owned what and where,
brought about William the Conqueror's national inventory known as the
Domesday Book

Today, graphical information systems (GIS) are putting assets on
computerised maps across the world. The current boom in GIS is driven by
economic necessity. Controversial 'handouts' and farming subsidies have
fuelled the European Community's keeness to document every field within its
vast area, in pursuit of an efficient Common Agricultural Policy.
In the UK, National Health Service patients have always had the right to be
treated at the hospital of their choice. But now that choice has a cash
significance: a hospital has to know exactly where its clientele is located,
and the act of sending a patient from one area to another has financial
implications.
Cross-charging for services, even competitive tendering, are all areas where
GIS applications have a role to play. The first pioneers of commercial
widespread GIS were utilities, and local authorities, whose main concern was
with the location of assets.
Retailers seeking to locate new stores have similar interests. The spread to
transport systems was predictable. GIS applications are now being used by
courier and security companies for location and routing, and in 'life of
death' command and control systems, such as Cleveland Constabulary's Pounds
1.2m Despatch Management System installed by Intergraph in July.
Advances in technology has brought GIS within the reach of a broader
spectrum of companies, as the research in this issue of Software At Work
shows. According to graphics research company Cambashi, GIS is a bright
spark in an otherwise gloomy computer-aided engineering market, and is still
growing at an average of 14 per cent annually in Europe, (see references on
page six of this survey).
Another projection of existing trends, from the Ordnance Survey, puts the
number of geographical systems at half a million by the year 2000. Until
very recently, GIS has been viewed as a niche application, belonging to
geographers. Among the barriers to its widespread adoption have been the
special equipment needed (such as scanners and plotters), and the enormous
investment demanded up-front before GIS projects show much return.
The figures for up-front development can be as high as 70 or 80 per cent,
according to Prof Peter Dale, chairman of the GLIM (Geographical and Land
Information Management) skills panel, and member of the Domesday 2000
steering group - 'it's also a matter of running costs. Depending on the type
of data, there can be data maintenance costs.'
But, as he points out, data collected and funded for one purpose, such as
MAFF's survey of fields for agricultural set-aside subsidies, usually proves
useful for other purposes once in place.
What distinguishes GIS from other areas of information technology (IT) is
the need for an 'infrastructure': a central source of information and
control for the basic mapping data.
The groundwork of third-party suppliers and specialists is essential,
especially in the labour-intensive area of data capture. Leslie Brown, of
Brown Projects in Dublin, is one such specialist in data capture, whose
tasks include the digitising of very old maps for clients.
'The main problem for most users is the cost of creating the graphical part
of the database. It's a costly exercise for one user to create digital maps
to suit a GIS application if they don't already exist. If they do exist,
they're more costly to buy than paper.
'Not all countries are the same. Ireland has good digital mapping for urban
areas, but rural maps might be not so up to date,' he says. Luckily for most
UK users, Ordnance Survey (OS) started digitising maps of Britain (England,
Scotland and Wales) in the early 1970s. Its remit from government is to keep
large-scale maps up to date. Originally scheduled to finish by 2010, it now
expects to have whole country finished by April 1995.
'Around 80 per cent of decisions made in most governments and many other
organisations are strongly influenced by geography in one form or another,'
says Prof. David Rhind, director general and chief executive of Ordnance
Survey of Great Britain.
'GIS underpins such decision-making and its growth is astonishing. But GIS
requires a basic geographical framework, the map skeleton on which to 'fix'
other data. In Britain, Ordnance Survey provides that framework whether
users want details of every house and street or information about a country
as a whole.'
OS concentrated on the large scale 1:1250 maps to start with, as needed by
professional users such estates agents, property developers, utilities -
'everyone concerned with land-use needs the real detail,' explains OS
spokesperson Wendy Fellingham. 'The biggest customers are still utilities,
(who funded some of the development), and local authorities, but we are
noticing a broader spectrum of users.'
Now that the data is in place, the OS is spinning off new products such as
Address-point, the new postal address gazetteer, a dataset that uniquely
defines and locates each and every residential, business, and public postal
address and Oscar, Ordnance Survey Central Alignment of Roads, a
route-planner currently used mainly by courier companies, local authorities,
and emergency services.
Alongside the large-scale maps, work is being carried out on other small
scale mapping areas, such as the New Travelmaster series, a series of eight
1:250,000 maps plus a route planner.
OS is using an Oracle database, and LAMPS, the Laser-Scan Automated Map
Production System from Cambridge-based Laser-Scan Ltd.
A comparatively small company, founded in 1969, Laser-Scan now finds itself
batting against multi-million corporations in international bids  - it
recently won a Dollars 7.8m contract from Mexico.
'Today's applications range from local government and emergency services to
the planning of radio transmitters and disaster monitoring,' comments
Laser-Scan chief executive Mike Jackson. 'The broadening user-base has
brought about a new stage in GIS evolution. We bring all the esssential
elements of the technolgoy together with database and a developers' toolkit,
and let the industry specialists build the tailored end-user applications.'
Output is an important part of GIS, and specialist equipment for
high-quality output can be expensive. Xerox Engineering Systems claims to be
the world's largest of wide format printing and plotting equipment. Its 8900
range, targeted at GIS users has user base of 9,500 in the UK alone.
Customers, include the utilities, such as South Wales Electricity, and Welsh
Water: the latter spent Pounds 210,00 on its seven plotters. However, some
of the users in the survey have managed low-cost installations, based on
Macintosh or PCs.
Others, because of the scale of the effort and the expenditure involved, are
taking a very cautious approach. Northampton County Council, for example, is
'testing' the very concept of GIS with exploratory applications such as
road-traffic accident monitoring, before going for full scale
implementation.
No-one considering the introduction of a GIS should make a move without
consulting the findings of USIS: Usable Spatial Information Systems. Based
at Loughborough University, this research project on 'design for usability'
has invaluable feedback from GIS end-users, some of it frightening. It seems
the industry is treading the same weary path beaten by other software
suppliers: less than perfect documentation, and customisation that makes
systems harder, not easier, to use.
The key is in training and the preparation of staff for a drastic change in
their jobs. Clare Davis, one of the USIS researchers, raises a point about
the grind of data capture - 'certainly, some of the UK digitising staff we
met in our observation study were treated as low-paid temporary industrial
operatives, with no employment rights and a very tedious job - sometimes in
ergonomically unsuitable conditions.'
Dozens of third party suppliers are springing up in support of GIS
developments. Although the annual GIS exhibition (see references, page six)
attracts small and enthusiastic companies, some of the larger names are also
showing an active interest.
Some suppliers have found specific niches. Bull UK, for example,
concentrates on local authorities: its users include five out of the six
largest metropolitan districts. The need to produce an asset register has
concentrated local authorities' efforts on GIS - but this only scrapes the
surface. The wider potential is not in merely recording data, but in using
GIS for efficient operations, and for future planning and strategic use of
resources.
This is the view of Paul Cunnington, Bull's market development manager in
the Land and Property Group, who stresses the need for training.
'GIS has a key role to play at the operational level. But once it has proved
its role in improving efficiency, there's a further problem in focusing
staff on newly imposed measures such as the citizen's charter and service
level contracts. That means a change in attitudes and values, and GIS can
help that change take place.'
Companies such as Logica, CMG, ICL and Sema are all developing GIS
expertise: BAeSema, a joint company with British Aerospace, has developed an
underwater GIS for environmental and tactical use: the first user is the
Swedish Navy, which will be using it to seek out likely hiding places for
submarines.
Intergraph, which claims to be largest established supplier with 34 per cent
of the UK GIS market, is doing brisk overseas business. Recent installations
include one in Prague.
There is also a flurry of acquisitions in the industry. CACI Information
Services has recently bought Pinpoint's market analysis business from MAI,
the international services group. Pinpoint's Digitising Services,
specialises in providing grid-references for specific addresses. Combined
with the demographic data available fro the OPCS, Office of Population
Censuses and Surveys, this can be a powerful marketing tool.
Pinpoint's Geomaps, a Windows-based tool, is being used for such analyses as
university catchments for the country's 187 colleges, and the flow of
students across borders.
IBM , which abandoned support of its own mainframe GFIS system, has made a
worldwide agreement with GeoVision, covering product development and
marketing. GeoVision, based in Camberley in the UK, has itself been recently
acquired by SHL Systemhouse.
GeoVision is involved in some large collaborative projects, including the
British Telecom EPR project, where it is working with Unisys (whose ARGIS
product is based on GeoVision's software) and work at North West Water, with
Andersen Consulting.
Among other large companies moving in on GIS is Autodesk. It is well placed,
as the supplier of AutoCAD, to capitalise on its computer aided design (CAD
)user-base, with the AutoCAD Data Extension.
'We've recognised the need to link information together and do a search'
says Carol Bartz, chairman and president of Autodesk. 'The ability to query
large amounts of data quickly has enormous potential, far beyond basic
mapping.'
The GIS sector is marked by an openness and willingness to share information
and experience. Perhaps it is the explorative, geographical background of
the GIS pioneers that has brought about the co-operative spirit between
users. This sector of the IT industry is surprisingly well-served by
specialist publications (see references, page six) and a very communicative
professional body, the AGI, Association of Geographical Information.
The AGI is playing a vigorous part in pursuing standards, and acts as a
communicator and a forum for discussion, as well as a central source of
information and organiser of regular conferences.
Most promising for the GIS industry is the feeling among all the users
interviewed that the main purpose of their system was only the start. Once
in place, the information would find all sorts of all uses. The recognition
that data has to be shared to make the fullest use of it bodes well for the
next stage of development.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (1): Better
guidance is needed - The quest for quality software / Quality in the
software business should be defined as customer satisfaction, suggests Alan
Cane. Software disasters and customer dissatisfaction with the products of
the industry are unacceptable

   THE more spectacular software disasters
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the failure of the London Ambulance Service despatch system; the abandonment
of Taurus in the City of London; questions over fly-by-wire systems, for
example - are only the tip of an iceberg of dissatisfaction with software
quality and reliability.
This will surprise nobody; the evidence is abundant and compelling.
Researchers studying computer-based banking systems believe that up to 40
per cent of the total investment is wasted; that more than 50 per cent of
advanced projects fail.
Geographical information systems (GIS), featured in the first section of
this issue of Software at Work, use computer power to collate geographical
and social data. They are potentially among the most useful of computer
applications, yet users are hindered by inadequate quality of design.
One study says: 'Current GIS software is often poor at providing useful,
comprehensible error messages,' going on to point out that 'infrequent' and
'novice' users need better support and guidance through consistent control
procedures.
For 'infrequent users,' read everyone. As computer systems become
ubiquitous, it will become increasingly necessary to be au fait with a
variety of systems. No matter how expert the user is in the use of one
computer system, there will always be another which will demand
concentration and effort to operate properly.
It would be comforting to think that ease of use for the infrequent user
would develop in step with the broader distribution of computing power made
possible by inexpensive personal computers and workstations. The experience
of GIS users to date does not offer a lot of hope, however. They complain of
lack of clarity in systems messages. For example: 'Press any key - but not
one of those.' Manuals are voluminous but rarely useful: 'There are so many
of them, they must be comprehensive. But the hardest thing is finding the
right manual'.
These problems with GIS are endemic to the industry. It is seeking ways of
ensuring quality in products which are intrinsically difficult to test for
flaws.
The Institution of Electrical Engineers, in discussing safety-related
systems, warns against claiming infallibility for any computer system: 'All
systems have a probability of failing to a dangerous state, even though the
probability may be extremely small'.
At the same time, software disasters and customer dissatisfaction with the
products of the industry are unacceptable. The principal approach has been
to attempt to introduce formal quality assurance for software development
coupled with ways of developing software that are more akin to engineering
than to craft work.
Mr Andrew J. Preston of T/Maker Company, quoted in a Price Waterhouse study
of software industry practices, says: 'Quality assurance is the best
investment any company can make.'
THE study shows that among US software houses, some 80 per cent with 100 or
more employees have a formal quality assurance program, confirming, it says
that 'survey respondents do indeed place a high priority on customer
satisfaction.'
This is a key point and essential to the argument that follows. Quality in
the software business should be defined as customer satisfaction.
The companies replying to the Price Waterhouse survey were less enthusiastic
about outside quality certification. Only 37 of the 929 companies questioned
said they had been certified to standards such as ISO 9000 - equivalent to
BS 5750 in the UK. These are general standards which measure a company's
quality procedures - the consistency of its systems for dealing with
customer orders, purchasing, stock control, manufacturing and delivery.
Nevertheless, certification is becoming essential to do business with
certain classes of customer, especially government departments. In the UK,
there is a special form of certification for IT companies called TickIT.
BS 5750 has its critics who complain that it is expensive to acquire and
offers little real guarantee of quality products. Mr Robert Malcolm,
formerly with GEC, CAP Group and now an independent consultant, takes the
case further and argues that far from being good for a company certificated
quality management systems may do it harm.
His argument is that existing systems do not, in general, deliver quality
where quality is defined as customer satisfaction. They do not, he says,
address fitness for purpose and are often restricted to manufacturing
methods. Customer satisfaction, on the other hand, is dependent on design,
especially where bespoke rather than packaged software is concerned.
Mr Malcolm argues that conventional product certification cannot work in
these instances. He suggests, perhaps a little tongue-in-cheek, that
certification of quality management systems should be discouraged and that
suppliers should be encouraged to show evidence that they provide customer
satisfaction. Customers for their part should be encouraged to demand that
evidence from prospective suppliers and demand satisfaction from selected
suppliers.
While it would be retrogressive to discourage companies from considering
certification, there is much in Mr Malcolm's argument. The key, as always,
is the 'intelligent customer.'
As Mr Joseph Alsop of the US company Progress Software Corporation told the
Price Waterhouse survey: 'You hear a lot of talk about service, but
customers will still buy products from companies with a lousy service record
if they feel its product is the latest and the greatest'.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Ulster peace efforts in turmoil: Government accused of lying
over IRA dialogue - PM backs Mayhew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government was last night struggling to salvage efforts to
restore peace to Northern Ireland after a damaging admission that it had
been in prolonged contact with the IRA.
Amid a storm of criticism from hard-line Unionists and accusations of
duplicity from opposition parties, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary, said he would make a full House of Commons statement later today
on the contacts.
The dialogue, stretching back to February and including an exchange as late
as November 5, marks the most intensive dealings between the British
government and the IRA for at least a decade.
But its disclosure cast a shadow over prospects for Mr Major's forthcoming
summit meeting with Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish prime minister.
The summit is still pencilled in for this Friday but there were doubts in
Whitehall last night about whether, in the wake of the disclosures, the two
leaders could make a breakthrough in their search for a political
settlement. Mr Major gave firm backing to Sir Patrick's insistence that a
series of messages passed through an intermediary to Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, had not amounted to negotiating with terrorists.
Downing Street said there was no question of the Northern Ireland secretary
being forced to resign in the wake of the meetings - at least three, in
March, August and November - between the unnamed intermediary and Sinn Fein
representatives. It would have been 'irresponsible' not to respond to such
overtures.
But ministers admitted privately that the weekend disclosures sat uneasily
with the repeated and vigorous denials in recent weeks from Mr Major and Sir
Patrick that there had been negotiations or 'talks' with the IRA. There was
also acknowledgment that the affair might have severely damaged hopes of
bringing the provinces's Unionists into talks on a new political settlement.
The Reverend William McCrea, the Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, who
made public documents confirming the contacts, said that Mr Major had been
telling direct lies at a meeting last week between the two of them and the
Reverend Ian Paisley, the DUP leader.
Reaction from the Ulster Unionists, however, was significantly more
restrained, with the party's MPs saying they would wait for Sir Patrick's
full statement before taking a definite position.
Sir Patrick said yesterday no civil servants had been involved in
'authorised' contacts with Sinn Fein through a 'chain' established several
years ago when Baroness Thatcher was prime minister. The latest process had
begun in February with an approach from the IRA suggesting it wanted advice
on ending its armed campaign, he said.
Sir Patrick told a hastily-convened press conference in Belfast that: 'I do
not believe had I made no response, had the government made no response,
that if subsequent bombs were exploded and life taken and people injured -
as indeed was the case - I would have been readily forgiven by the people of
Northern Ireland.' That version of events was flatly denied by Mr Gerry
Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, who accused Sir Patrick of 'lying'. Mr
Adams said there had been no communication from the IRA saying that the
conflict had ended.
Mr Martin McGuinness, the prominent Sinn Fein leader with whom the messages
were exchanged, said high-level contacts were continuing with the full
knowledge of the prime minister.
As the government embarked on a desperate damage limitation exercise, Sir
Patrick said it would publish in full both the documents sent to Sinn Fein
and those transmitted by the IRA to London.
In an attempt to reassure the mainstream Ulster Unionists led by Mr James
Molyneaux, Sir Patrick insisted that at no time had the government dropped
its condition that there could be no negotiations until the IRA brought its
terrorist campaign to a permanent end.
It is understood, however, that the documents include an explicit offer of a
place in negotiations for Sinn Fein if the IRA ceases its campaign  - an
offer made public by Mr Major when he met Mr Reynolds in Brussels last
month. They also carried the suggestion that a dialogue could begin even if
an end to the conflict was not publicly declared.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the government's credibility
was at stake after what had been at best 'stupidity' and at worst
'duplicity'.

MONDAY 29 NOVEMBER
Hosokawa rides high
Debate on the government's plans to reform Japan's scandal-prone electoral
system begins in the upper house of parliament, having passed the lower
house on November 18. The position of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa
(above) has been strengthened by an opinion poll last week which gave his
cabinet a 73.5 per cent approval rating.
Milk shake-up: The UK government's consultation period on plans for
liberalising the milk market ends, when minister of agriculture Gillian
Shephard must weigh up
proposals by the Milk Marketing Board to turn itself into a voluntary
farmers' co-operative called Milk Marque. The plan has been attacked by
dairy
companies which think it will restrict competition and mean higher prices
for consumers.
Today is also the start of the Smithfield agricultural show at London's
Earls Court exhibition centre.
Gatt delegations from the 116 nations engaged in the Uruguay round in Geneva
begin 'evaluation' of all market access offers for goods and services on the
table.
Loans to Iraq: Christopher Drogoul, former Atlanta branch manager for Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro, faces sentencing in Atlanta on 70 counts of
conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud in connection with the bank's illegal
loans to Iraq.
Russia's first deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar meets mineworkers' leaders
to try to negotiate a solution to a strike threat from Wednesday.
Moldova, a former republic of the Soviet Union, is slated to introduce its
own currency, the Leu.
Feruzzi Finanziaria, the holding company for Italy's second largest private
company, and Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, are due to hold
board meetings in advance of Tuesday and Wednesday's shareholders' meetings
in order to assess banks' response to the group's ambitious multibillion
lira rescue plan - one of the biggest corporate restructurings Europe has
seen.
Rousseau to go: Tonight Christie's in London auctions the most important
painting by the eccentric French post-Impressionist artist Henri Rousseau to
appear at auction in 20 years. It is a portrait of the dealer Joseph Brummer
and is estimated at Pounds 2m.
TUESDAY 30 NOVEMBER
Mr Clarke gives his Budget
In the UK Budget, attention will be focused on how Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, rises to the challenge of reducing the projected Pounds 50bn
public sector deficit. He has indicated that he intends to stimulate
industry and that tax rises will be targeted at consumers rather than
business.
CSCE meeting: Foreign ministers from the 52 states of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) meet in Rome to review
peace-keeping efforts and the monitoring of actual and potential conflicts
from Bosnia to Tajikistan. High on the agenda will be a discussion of
Moscow's attempt to gain western moral and financial backing for Russia's
controversial 'peace-keeping' operations beyond its southern borders.
Franco-German summit: The regular twice-yearly Franco-German talks take
place in Bonn (to Dec 1). French president Francois Mitterrand and Helmut
Kohl, the German chancellor (pictured below), are expected to discuss Gatt,
the next European summit and the outlook for the EU after Maastricht. Also
present will be French prime minister Edouard Balladur, various of his
ministers, and their German counterparts.
Glaxo, The largest pharmaceuticals group in Europe, and the world's biggest
spender on drugs R&amp;D, is to brief analysts on details of its drugs under
development. The company will reveal for the first time since December 1991
how it has been spending its R&amp;D budget, some Dollars 1.15bn this year.
Details of the group's products and international operations will also be
given.
Feruzzi Finanziaria holds an extraordinary general meeting to discuss the
the L2,932bn (Dollars 1.7bn) recapitalisation and creditors' debt-for-equity
conversion swap.
How low can they go? The first UK Costco store opens at Thurrock, Essex. The
US warehouse club operator is bound to intensify the price war among food
retailers.
WEDNESDAY 7 DECEMBER
UN sanctions against Libya
Further UN sanctions against Libya are due to take effect after a grace
period. They come in the face of the continued failure of Tripoli to hand
over the two agents suspected of planting the bomb that destroyed a Pan-Am
jumbo jet over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.
Libyan assets abroad will be frozen, with the exception of those which come
from the sale of oil, gas and farm produce. There will be an embargo on
Libyan imports of technology, with the exception of spare parts for the oil
and gas industry. The US and UK had called for tougher measures; their
mildness is due to the insistence of continental European countries.
United Airlines dispute:
The large US carrier is due to resume talks with unions representing its
pilots and machinists. The company's restructuring plan, intended to improve
profitability, involves staff lay-offs and a sale of assets which its unions
oppose. A fortnight ago, United rejected a union offer to acquire 60 per
cent of the company in return for staffing concessions.
Trade talks: Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, is expected to
begin critical talks in Brussels with Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner.
They are under mounting pressure to complete an agreement on cutting tariffs
on manufactured goods and farm products.
Agreement is an essential precondition for successful conclusion of the
Uruguay round by the December 15 deadline.
Russian coal miners in Vorkuta, the main coal mining area in the arctic
circle, are threatening to strike and could be supported by miners in
Siberia. The political implications of the strike could be as important as
their industrial consequences. The miners played a vital role in bringing
down the Communists in 1989. A strike against President Boris Yeltsin's
reform programme could deal it a heavy blow.
Montedison holds an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to discuss the
L5,170bn (Dollars 3bn) recapitalisation and creditors' debt-for-equity
conversion swap.
Japan: The Bonen-kai (forget the year) season of corporate cocktail parties
begins and lasts all month. Proceedings are expected to be muted this year
in view of the recession, which saw the Nikkei decline 6.8 per cent last
week.
THURSDAY 2 DECEMBER
Bundesbank council meets
The policy-making body of the German central bank gathers for the
last-but-one session this year. Following last week's fall in inflation,
many market operators are expecting another 50 basis-point cut in the
official discount and Lombard rates.
Foreign ministers' slog: Nato foreign ministers, hot-foot from the CSCE
meeting in Rome, fly to Brussels for a meeting at Nato headquarters. In the
evening, 12 of them travel across town for an all-night European Union
session on the Gatt Uruguay Round world trade talks, which has been called

The main economic event in the UK this week is the chancellor's budget
statement tomorrow. This will outline changes to taxation and spending, as
well as setting out the government's medium term financial strategy.
It comes in a quiet week for UK statistics with today's provisional narrow
money supply the only official figure of any note. The purchasing managers'
index is released on Wednesday. Although the survey has only a limited track
record, it is growing in popularity as a guide to economic activity. Many
analysts expect it to maintain last month's rebound, with both the orders
and output figures broadly the same.
The more established US version - the National Association of Purchasing
Managers Index - is also out on Wednesday. Watched closely as an early
indicator of manufacturing health, it is expected to show that orders and
output are still buoyant, while prices may fall for the third successive
month.
A Bundesbank meeting on Thursday and US jobless figures on Friday add to the
week's interest. Non-farm payrolls are expected to rise by about 175,000.
There is a steady stream of data in Germany this week, to accompany the
central bank's council meeting. Economists believe the real economy data
will show that activity remains sluggish, with no signs of recovery but no
signs of a double dip either.

FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ilva seeks buyer for steel tubes
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ilva, the Italian state-owned steel group which is being liquidated as part
of a large restructuring, is to sell its 86.4 per cent stake in Dalmine, the
world's third-biggest manufacturer of seamless steel tubes.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, has been given
the mandate to find a buyer as part of the urgent need to raise cash for
Ilva and privatise its operations.
Demonstrating that meaningful parts of the Ilva group are being privatised
will be a significant boost to the arguments being used by Italian
negotiators in their battle of wills with the European Commission in
Brussels over state aid and capacity cuts.
Dalmine, which is based near the north Italian city of Bergamo, is listed on
the stock market and profitable. Net group earnings last year amounted to
L5.6bn (Dollars 3.4m) on sales of L1,016bn.
The company, which trails Mannesmann of Germany and Sumitomo of Japan in
seamless tubes, last year delivered 748,000 tonnes of steel.
In recent months, Ilva has been buying out some of the minority partners in
Dalmine, ostensibly to prepare for the sale of a large stake. Bankers have
hesitated to put a value to the holding in view of the current crisis in the
European steel industry.
Ilva, which is formally in liquidation, is being split into two companies.
The first, specialising in flat products, will comprise the group's big
Taranto integrated steelworks and the Novi Ligure plant, while the second
will be based on the Terni special steels unit.
Ilva lost L2,309bn last year on group sales of L10,087bn. The company, which
is planning to shed about 11,600 jobs, had net debts of L7,500bn at the end
of June.

FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Lebanon stakes future on
investors - The country has turned to capital markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lebanon's struggle for self-renewal after 17 years of devastating civil war
marks a new approach to the financing of development in the Middle East.
Gone are the days when Lebanon's pressing needs to rebuild its
infrastructure could be achieved by funds from generous oil-producing states
in the Arab world and sympathetic Western countries.
The industrialised world is jittery about recession, and the big Gulf states
are pensively examining huge budget deficits as oil prices continue to fall.
Donor money is plainly in short supply. As a result, the Lebanese government
has been forced to seek alternatives to finance its reconstruction
programme, priced at Dollars 14bn in real terms over 10 years.
It is asking private investors to buy a stake in Lebanon's future. On
November 1, Solidere, a Dollars 1.8bn property company set up to rebuild the
centre of Beirut, launched a Dollars 650m Arab equity offering, one of the
biggest share issues in the region.
A few weeks later, the government announced plans to raise Dollars 300m by
issuing Eurobonds to develop the mainly Shi'ite southern suburbs of Beirut,
and a road network.
Mr Riad Salameh, Lebanon's new central bank governor, said he is confident
the Eurobonds will be well received when they are issued in 'the next few
weeks'. He expects Lebanon's low foreign debt of around Dollars 800m, or
10.6 per cent of GNP, and the government's 'credibility' to ensure the
issue's success.
Lebanon has not defaulted on any international loans since the start of the
civil war in 1975. In Mr Rafik Hariri, it has a prime minister with a proven
track record in business and one of the strongest financial teams in the
region. The country also has gold reserves worth around Dollars 3.8bn,
although Lebanese law forbids the government from either selling or pledging
the asset.
Mr Salameh explained that no manager had yet been appointed to arrange the
offering, but Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, and Banque Paribas,
the French bank, have both been approached. He said the bonds were likely to
be priced to yield between 350 and 400 basis points over US treasuries.
The governor, who joined the central bank in August from his post as
vice-president of Merrill Lynch in Paris, said that under the present
climate of international belt-tightening, Lebanon will have to rely on
capital markets and equities to finance much of its rehabilitation.
'I think that if the Eurobond issue is successful, then it will be one of
the main ways to raise capital for Lebanon. We might have some syndicated
loans but would prefer to go to capital markets,' he said.
The launch of shares in Solidere appears to have met a strong response. Mr
Abdel-Hafiz Mansour, deputy general manager of the company, expects the
offer to be oversubscribed.
Existing land and property owners of the 165 acre area in the centre of
Beirut earmarked for development will be given priority in the allocation of
shares. They will be followed in pecking order by Lebanese residents,
government institutions, Lebanese expatriates living abroad, and citizens of
Arab states who, it is expected, will include many prominent Saudis.
A maximum 10 per cent individual stake will ensure no single shareholder can
take overall control of the company, and the subscription remains open until
January 10. The cash raised will be used to finance the first phase of
redevelopment of what used to be Beirut's bustling commercial centre.
Mr Salameh explained Lebanon's reconstruction programme - named Horizon 2000
 -would be 70 per cent financed by the private sector and 20 per cent by
foreign aid and loans.
By his estimates, Lebanon will have to borrow Dollars 2.8bn in external
finance over the 10-year period 'which is reasonable considering GNP (put at
Dollars 7.5bn for 1993 by the central bank) and the economic expansion
planned for the next five years,' he said. The rest will come from
government revenues and internal borrowing.
Donor commitments to date do not exceed Dollars 1.4bn, including Dollars
175m from the World Bank. A Bank-sponsored consultative group meeting
planned for December is expected to result in more aid.
However, Lebanese officials admit that since the historic agreement signed
between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel in September,
available funds for Middle East development are likely to be pledged to the
occupied territories rather than war-torn Lebanon.
In the light of this, Mr Hariri's big gamble is that once the reconstruction
ball starts rolling, with finance raised by capital markets and donor
countries, then Lebanese expatriates holding overseas assets of between
Dollars 30bn and Dollars 40bn will keep up the momentum through investment
and remittances.
In this way, it is likely that market forces will determine the future of
Lebanon.

retirement plan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Henkel, the German chemicals, cosmetics and cleaning
products group, fell by 16 per cent to DM422m (Dollars 251.2m) in the first
nine months of the year.
Mr Hans Dietrich Winkaus, chief executive, said the decline was partly due
to extraordinary expenses to pay for the early retirement of workers in 1993
and 1994. The company plans to cut 1,300 jobs by the end of 1994, of which
1,000 will be in Germany.
Sales for the period fell 2 per cent to DM10.5bn. The decline was mostly the
result of currency fluctuations, Mr Winkaus said. Without this, sales would
have improved by 0.4 per cent for the nine months.
The chief executive said he expected sales for the whole year to show a 2
per cent decline, despite earlier statements this year predicting turnover
would remain constant.
Depressed demand caused sales for the period to drop 8 per cent in Europe.

Paribas, the prominent French banking group, plans to extend its portfolio
of industrial investments by taking control of Axime, an information
services company.
On Friday, Paribas bought a 13.2 per cent stake in Axime for FFr98.7m
(Dollars 16.7m) from a group of institutional investors, raising its holding
to 50.4 per cent. It announced plans to make an offer for the remaining
shares in the company, apart from the 26 per cent stake held by Compagnie
Generale des Eaux, the utilities group.
Generale des Eaux plans to hold on to its Axime stake. Paribas has offered
FFr280 a share for the remaining equity, which is divided between private
and institutional investors. Axime is valued at FFr748m on the offer price.
Paribas, which has interests in the information services field through the
SEMA Group, said the offer for Axime formed part of its policy of becoming
the controlling shareholder in 'companies that we consider have high growth
potential'.
Paribas has in recent years pruned its industrial portfolio by ceding some
of its peripheral minority interests.
Axime, which operates a payment system for tele-marketing and direct
marketing services as well as providing general information services, has
had a difficult time in recent years as a result of the pressures on the
French market place.
However, the company, which employs 2,400 people, is recovering after
rationalising and restructuring its interests.
It recently announced that it returned to the black with a net profit of
FFr65m, on sales of FFr1.9bn, in the 12 months to June 30, after making a
net loss of FFr82m in the previous year.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Nova Scotia has raised its quarterly dividend after posting a 6 per
cent rise in fiscal 1994 earnings.
The bank, Canada's fourth-biggest, attributed the higher earnings to a
combination of strong investment banking revenues, a 10 per cent growth in
assets, an improved developing world loan portfolio, and tight cost
controls.
Net earnings advanced to CDollars 714m (USDollars 553.5m), equal to CDollars
2.98 per common share, in the year to October 31, from CDollars 676m, or
CDollars 2.94 a share, a year earlier. A larger number of shares outstanding
pushed the return on equity down to 14.4 per cent from 15.7 per cent.
The quarterly dividend has been raised from 28 to 29 cents a share.
Loan-loss provisions rose to CDollars 465m from CDollars 449m. The latest
figure includes a CDollars 300m reversal of developing world loan
provisions, of which half was re-allocated to specific provisions for other
borrowers.

agreement to take a controlling interest in Banco San Geminiano e San
Prospero, a similar-sized rival, for about L1,040bn (Dollars 600m).
The accord, reached late on Thursday, ends Italy's first hostile bank
takeover bid and comes at a time of unprecedented ferment among regional
banks.
Last week, Deutsche Bank agreed to buy Banca Popolare di Lecco, a 100-branch
regional bank located just north of Milan, at an estimated total cost of
L840bn. Separately, the Parma savings bank, which has expanded through a
series of local mergers, is in talks to buy Credito Commerciale, another
Milan-based regional institution.
The San Geminiano deal, in which the bank called in Schroders of the UK as
its adviser, was a cliffhanger until the last minute, with two other
potential suitors waiting in the wings. However, San Geminiano's board
eventually decided to accept a greatly improved offer from the Veronese
after a tough contest.
Banca Popolare di Verona will now buy an estimated 60-65 per cent of Banco
San Geminiano, rather than the 47 per cent originally planned.
The increase stems from a commitment to buy all the stock tendered by
shareholders owning less than 1,000 shares, rather than a partial purchase.
That commitment, and an earlier decision to raise the offer price to
L200,000 a share from L180,000, effectively clinched the deal, along with
guarantees on boardroom representation for San Geminiano.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: Keeping an eye on the old tiger - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Latin American terms, Chile is considered the 'old tiger' of capital
markets. No longer as dynamic as more sprightly counterparts such as Peru,
Chile has a market sophistication unparalleled on the continent.
Such maturity is manifested in several ways. The market capitalisation of
the Santiago stock exchange, at about Dollars 36.5bn (Pounds 24.4bn), is 95
per cent of GDP - much larger in relative terms than that of, for example,
Mexico.
The exchange, or bolsa, is underpinned by a strong institutional base
lacking elsewhere on the continent. Private pension funds (AFPs) - to which
Chileans are theoretically obliged to commit 10 per cent of their wages -
have accumulated nearly Dollars 15bn in funds and are expanding by Dollars
300m a month. Local companies regularly tap the solid - if sometimes
illiquid - local market through the issue of equity as well as medium and
long-term paper. Corporate bonds, denominated in index-linked Unidades de
Fomento, carry a coupon of anything between 7 and 12 per cent.
Chile was last year the first Latin American country to obtain an investment
grade rating of BBB, and there is already talk of a further upgrade.
Likewise Endesa, the electricity company, became the continent's first
private sector company to win an investment grade.
Such features separate Chile from most of its neighbours. 'It is almost like
having an Asian economy in the heart of Latin America,' says one analyst.
After the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, investors are
likely to focus on Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Argentina, largely on
hopes of ratings upgrades in both countries. But, says Mr Alfredo Viegas,
senior analyst at Salomon Brothers, this does not mean that Chile should be
ignored, particularly later in 1994 when the prospects of Chile's accession
to Nafta should become clearer.
'We still firmly believe that Chile is the most structurally advanced
economy in Latin America. Growth is primarily financed through internal
savings, which is the sort we see in many of the Pacific Rim countries, and
the type that ultimately leads to a rising standard of living,' says Mr
Viegas.
Such fundamentals have produced jolting, though significant, gains on the
bolsa this year. The IPSA index of the 40 most traded shares, reset at 100
each year, closed on Friday at 139.65, a 27 per cent gain in dollar terms.
Volumes have remained low, averaging only Dollars 8m a day, mainly because
of the domination of the AFPs which tend to sit on their equity purchases.
Most trading is concentrated on very few companies, the three principal
sectors of activity being electricity (30 per cent), telecommunications (16
per cent) and petrochemicals (10 per cent).
Mr Viegas expects a quiet first half to 1994, with greater interest later.
With an average p/e of 16.8 on projected 1993 earnings, Santiago is Latin
America's most expensive exchange, but Salomon is nevertheless forecasting
real gains of 15-20 per cent next year.
Neither imminent presidential and parliamentary elections - on December 11 -
nor the prospect of lower economic growth in 1994, are likely to cloud
long-term horizons. 'Good corporate fundamentals mean that the larger,
well-managed companies will continue to do well even in leaner times,' says
Mr Viegas.
Chile's economy is expected to grow by 4-5 per cent next year, against
projected growth of 6 per cent in 1993 and 10.4 per cent in 1992. Next
year's relatively poor performance - measured against exceptional average
growth of 6.5 per cent over the past decade - is primarily the result of
weak international prices for Chile's three main exports, namely copper,
cellulose and fishmeal.
Slowdown is most unlikely to produce a change of economic course.
Presidential frontrunner Mr Eduardo Frei, candidate of the governing
Christian Democrat-led coalition, is committed to continuing the tight
fiscal and monetary policies of the present administration.
In the medium term, a Frei administration is likely to accelerate economic
reform. Mr Juan Villarzu, Mr Frei's economic adviser and the man widely
tipped to be the next finance minister, is keen to push through capital
market reforms, currently languishing in congress. These aim to broaden
investment options for pension and insurance funds.
Institutional investors will be allowed to purchase second-tier stock,
extending their scope to around 200 companies from the 40 blue-chips
currently permitted. They will be allowed to provide venture capital,
project funding and to expand their international investments to corporate
bonds and equity.
Mr Villarzu has also hinted that, given the country's Dollars 10bn external
reserves, now may be the time to lift remaining exchange controls which
oblige foreign investors to leave money in Chile for at least a year.
Given the steady appreciation of the peso, Mr Villarzu probably figures that
it may be no bad thing to give foreign capital an escape route. He has also
hinted at the possibility of lowering interest rates in order to further
stimulate investment - already at historic highs - and to ease pressure on
the peso by reducing the differential between domestic and international
rates.
Cheaper money might also help to stem the flow of American Depository
Receipt issues, all the rage in Santiago. The quantity of companies lining
up to raise capital on the New York stock exchange has become a source of
frustration for some local investors, according to Mr Viegas.
According to Mr Daniel Yarur, deputy chairman of the securities and exchange
commission, the old tiger may have a bit of life in it yet.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Currencies: Sterling awaits outcome of Budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Very few UK investors are looking beyond tomorrow's Budget but the rest of
the world must take a wider view of factors that will impinge on the
currency markets.
In the US, for example, monthly employment figures on Friday could provide
the dollar with the chance it needs to break out of its present narrow
trading.
The UK Budget initially had as much appeal as a washing machine on slow spin
 -most economists were convinced that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was
backed into a tight corner by current low interest rates and the tax legacy
of his predecessor. There was a growing conviction that he could do little
more than increase the tax burden a little and cut rates by a smidgen.
Tuesday's surprise half-point cut in base rates to 5.5 per cent has seen
uncertainty and drama return. Does Tuesday's coded message that the
chancellor had taken 'full account' of the budget mean there will be no more
good news on rates? Will the fiscal squeeze be so tight that it will have to
be balanced by another half-point sweetener before the end of the year? What
does it mean for sterling?
Last week, the pound defied the conventional wisdom that lower rates lead to
weaker currencies. The rate cut was heavily discounted in money market
lending rates so the pound rose against leading currencies.
The chances of sterling pulling off the same coup twice in a short period
are slim. Most economists agree that while base rates of 5 per cent might
not be detrimental to the pound they would give pause for thought.
The second focus of the week will come on Friday when the US releases its
non-farm payroll data for November. The figure is considered to be the most
important pointer to the direction the US economy is taking and economists
are looking for a rise in jobs over the month of between 150,000 and
200,000.
The dollar has been within in a tight range against the D-Mark of between
DM1.68 and DM1.72 for some time and a higher than forecast jobs figure could
send the currency into new territory.
Finally the Bundesbank council is to meet on Thursday and there are some
hopes it might reduce the Lombard and discount rates, although most
economists forecast no further cut before the next meeting on December 16.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA
Confidence is riding high after the Bombay stock exchange rose by 5 per cent
last Friday, hitting a new 14-month high. Foreign buyers are thought to have
become active buyers in recent weeks, says Maryam Mansoury of Lehman
Brothers, with some switching of funds out of south-east Asia evident.
A more stable political environment has also led to an improvement in
sentiment, with the Congress party forecast to do better than expected in
the current round of local elections.
ISRAEL
The public offering of a 10 per cent stake in Bank Leumi has been delayed.
The offer was due to have started today but has now been postponed until
January. This follows the failure of the offering in Bank Hapoalim, the
country's largest bank, last week.
THAILAND
Phatra Thanakit, one of the country's leading stockbrokers, has been fined
Bt40m (Dollars 1.6m) for breaking stock exchange rules. The fine is believed
to be the largest ever imposed by the authorities.
The broker automatically channelled a stock order from a sub-broker onto the
market instead of re-keying the order onto its own computers.
TAIWAN
Reforms have been announced which aim to ease restraints on foreign
investment in the country's financial markets. Restrictions on remittances
of capital gains and principal out of Taiwan by foreign investors will be
removed.
The government is also resuming its stalled privatisation programme by
offering a 15 per cent stake, worth TDollars 972m (Dollars 36m), in Chung
Kuo Insurance.
CHINA
China plans to free state-owned companies from government control, making
them into legal entities with clear lines of responsibility over strategy
for profit and the use of company assets.
SOUTH KOREA
The Economic Planning Board is drawing up plans for the privatisation of at
least 40 of the 134 companies in which the state owns a stake in response to
demands by President Kim Young-sam for reform of the state sector.
GREECE
Trading in the Aegek civil engineering group begins on the Athens bourse
today. Aegek's three main shareholders own 80 per cent of the share capital
after the company's initial public offering earlier this month which raised
about 150 times the Dr1.59bn (Dollars 6.5m) sought, with 532,500 new shares
entering the market.
ARGENTINA
A price of 5.30 pesos per share has been set for the government's sale of
its remaining 30 per cent stake in the Central Puerto electricity utility.
RUSSIA
Plans are in preparation to sell a big stake in the Lada car plant, and 50
per cent of the shares could be sold before the end of this year, with
foreigners being permitted to take a stake.
The sale of AvtoVAZ is likely to be a combination of a voucher auction and
an investment tender, offering some shares in exchange for privatisation
vouchers held by Russian citizens.
TURKEY
Investors are preparing for a small bang when the stock exchange begins a
switch to computerised trading on Friday. The exchange is to introduce
automated price matching on 50 less active shares as a trial.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Risk &amp; Reward: Distinction between hedges and futures
becomes blurred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the distinction between hedge funds and futures funds becomes
increasingly blurred, the most successful funds are likely to be those which
combine features of both types of investment vehicle.
'It's getting harder and harder to pigeonhole funds under distinct
categories such as hedge funds or futures funds,' says Ms Nicola Meaden,
managing director of Tass Management, which tracks futures funds.
Hedge funds, which combine cash and derivative instruments, lie somewhere in
the middle of a continuum between low-leverage, traditional bonds-and-stocks
funds and high-leverage derivatives-only futures funds.
Essentially, a hedge fund buys liquid assets - mostly equities, but also
bonds, currencies and commodities - and hedges them against adverse market
movements by selling derivatives against them. Hedge funds can use complex,
speculative trading methods to maximise returns, including using leveraged
funds - money borrowed against the value of assets - and hedging techniques,
such as short-selling.
Futures funds invest mostly in futures and options in about 60 to 70 product
markets internationally. They are mainly financial derivatives such as
interest-rate or bond futures, but can include liquid commodities contracts.
Futures funds tend to be run by pools of fund managers whose investment
decisions are often based on complex quantitative computer models.
Both types of fund can exploit different market conditions with great
flexibility. 'The beauty is it's irrelevant what happens as we can go long
or short in any market,' says Mr Gerald Bichunsky, a director at Momentum
UK, specialists in active management styles for hedge and futures fund
managers. One example of a classic hedge strategy involves buying some
Japanese stocks and selling the Nikkei stock index. This has proved to be a
successful strategy amid the Nikkei's recent slide.
Most importantly, both types of funds share what Mr Bichunsky calls active
investment styles. 'People are looking less at asset class and are
increasingly focusing on investment style.'
While a passive investor might simply seek to track a bond or stock index,
an active fund manager will aim to aggressively outperform his benchmark.
Thus, the more active the management style, the more powerful the
risk-reward profile will be.
However, an important difference remains in the range of instruments in
which either fund can invest, with hedge funds able to spread themselves
more broadly across cash and derivatives markets and use a more diverse set
of strategies and styles.
'Good futures fund managers will move increasingly into cash,' leaving less
of a distinction between the two types of fund, says a fund manager at a
large London-based hedge fund. While some futures funds put on stunning
performances this year, they have been outperformed by hedge funds over the
long run.
'Thanks to the flexibility of their instruments, the number of long-term
consistently successful hedge fund managers is higher than the number of
consistently successful futures fund managers,' says Momentum's Mr
Bichunsky.
This year's bull run in global stock and bond markets has helped lift hedge
funds' performance, and some say these funds may find it harder to make
money in cash markets when the rallies ebb.
'We've had a terrific rally in stocks and bonds, but as a hedge fund, what
do you do next year?' asks Mr Peter Swete, chairman of Sabre Fund
Management.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: Unanswered questions in energy sector - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share prices of the big energy companies could defy a falling oil price
for only so long.
However, Friday's knee-jerk stock market reaction to last week's Opec
meeting, which saw all the big US oil groups marked down, left two questions
unanswered: which companies will come through the downturn the strongest,
and has the stock market now factored in a sustained slump in the price of
oil?
The companies likely to do best are those that are least exposed to the US,
and those which have the biggest downstream (refining and marketing)
operations, says Mr Constantine Fliakos, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Profits from non-US operations tend to hold up better because in some
countries (such as Nigeria) oil companies trade on fixed margins, whatever
the price. Also, higher production taxes outside the US leave foreign
taxpayers picking up a higher proportion of any oil price fall.
Integrated oil companies, meanwhile, can recover in higher downstream
margins some of what they lose in lower upstream profits. It is difficult to
predict how much downstream operations will benefit from lower prices.
If the oil companies were unable to recover any of the oil price fall
through higher downstream margins, a Dollars 1 drop in the price of a barrel
of oil would take between 6 per cent and 7 per cent off the net income of
Exxon or Royal Dutch/Shell, compared with a 14-15 per cent hit to British
Petroleum or Texaco, estimates Mr Fliakos.
Last week's share price movements seem to reflect a belief that the oil
price will rebound again.
'If you thought this price was going to hold for the long term, you would
mark the sector down a lot more,' says Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.
Mr Fliakos at Merrill, meanwhile, does not believe oil stocks have hit
bottom yet.
'I would like to see some more damage done before I upgrade them again.'
Another 10 per cent off share prices would do, he says.
The US Christmas shopping season got off to its official start last Friday -
the day after Thanksgiving - with market expectations high for a solid, if
not a bumper, year for most retailers. The retail stocks have already
benefited from signs of stronger consumer demand during the third quarter.
Also, analysts do not want to repeat their mistakes of last year, when most
were unprepared for the sharp post-election rise in spending at Christmas.
Mr Ed Johnson, at brokers Lynch Jones &amp; Ryan, says he is conservative in
predicting a rise in sales of between 9 per cent and 10 per cent over last
year.
The market will be watching the behaviour of shoppers carefully to see if
expectations such as these are being fulfilled.
