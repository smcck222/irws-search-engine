FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Advertisers threatened by ITV changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL GRADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The potential losers from the government's decision to relax the
ownership restrictions between the ITV companies are the very people who pay
for the programmes - the advertisers ('Battle begins for future of ITV',
November 25).
Viewers' interests are safeguarded by the statutory powers of the licensing
authority, the Independent Television Commission, but the inevitable
concentration of ITV ownership which will ensue could, if unchecked, limit
the current choice available to advertisers.
The most radical aspect of the government's 1990 Broadcasting Act was not
the auction for franchises. It was the abolition of the ITV monopoly of
airtime sales, putting Channel 3 in competition with Channel 4 (and, to a
tiny extent, satellite). That freeing up of the vital, wealth-creating
television advertising market is now under threat. ITV is still the dominant
force with a share of more than 70 per cent of all advertising revenue.
Against some predictions, Channel 4 has provided real competition; but our
ability to compete effectively as the minnow in the pond hangs on the ITC's
rules that no individual ITV sales operation can offer for sale more than 25
per cent of ITV's total revenue.
The government, the ITC, the advertisers and those charged with ensuring
fair trading conditions must not allow concentration of ownership to
undermine the 25 per cent rule which is the advertisers' only guarantee of
choice in a lopsided market.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: The unmeasured threat from nuclear
power station emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G A H WATTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have lived for 32 years on the opposite bank of a river where one of
Britain's nuclear power stations is situated. I have during the last two
months developed acute myeloid leukaemia for which, at my age (72), there is
no cure. When I entered hospital the leukaemia cells made up 6 per cent of
my bone marrow.
Judge my astonishment when, on making inquiries, I found that emissions from
the station are not monitored continuously, but only once a month. During
this time radiation can be emitted from the heavily contaminated CO into the
steam and hence to the atmosphere without being picked up. So the public is
not warned.
Having read all the latest papers, I am in no doubt that the cause of my
leukaemia is radiation from the nuclear power station. It has probably
resulted in the mutilation of one of my cells and this then spread.
In my view, no further nuclear stations should be built until the cause of
leukaemia near nuclear stations has been resolved. Do we have to wait 10 or
20 years for this to be done? Further, the latest medical papers state there
is no known safe minimum dose. G A H Watts,

Sir, I refer to your critic, David Murray's, review of the English Chamber
Orchestra's concert with Sviatoslav Richter ('A high price for Richter's big
sound', November 25).
Mr Murray concludes his article with a reference to '. . .the laid-back,
low-cost but pricey Richter exhibition'. I would like to point out that,
taking into account Mr Richter's very high fee, even if we had sold out
(which we did not) we would still have sustained a substantial deficit. I do
not think therefore, that this concert could, by any stretch of the
imagination, be described as low-cost.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Man in the News: Sticky wicket at Central TV - Leslie Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an avid amateur cricketer, Leslie Hill, chairman and chief executive of
Central Independent Television, is the ideal person to bowl fierce sporting
metaphors at Mr Peter Brooke, National Heritage secretary and member of the
Marylebone Cricket Club.
On the changes to the ITV ownership rules proposed by Mr Brooke, the Central
Independent Television chairman says: 'What he has done is bowl us a
flipper, a ball that looks like a googly but goes the other way.'
You do not need to know one end of a cricket bat from another to realise
that whether it is flippers or googlies, Hill, a long-time advocate of
rationalising ITV's structure, is not happy about some aspects of the
government's decision to allow consolidation in the industry.
'It's two steps forward and one step back,' says Hill, who as far back as
1988 told the then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, on a visit to
Central's Nottingham studios that the 15 ITV companies should, in the
interests of efficiency, be reduced to no more than five or six.
Hill, the businessman who worked in the music industry and in industrial
services before coming to television in 1987, received telexes from other
ITV companies 'presuming' he would resign from the ITV Association - the
body representing all the companies - after his controversial comments found
their way into the national newspapers.
'ITV was a bit of a gentlemen's club at the time,' says Hill. 'You weren't
expected to rock the boat. I believed you should either redraw the map (of
ITV) in a sensible way to create similiar-sized regions or you should allow
the market to do it.'
The 57-year-old Hill, now ironically chairman-elect of the ITV Association
that once saw him as an uncomfortable outsider, is pleased that the
government has decided that outside London an ITV company will be able to
hold two broadcasting licences, however large. At the moment, the nine
largest companies cannot take each other over. He is, however, disappointed
at the anomalies he believes the apparently simple change will leave in its
wake.
For instance, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which recently issued a profits warning,
cannot be taken over easily because it holds two broadcasting licences. If
another ITV company pounced, it would face a messy divestment of Tyne Tees.
'It seems extraordinary that the company that in some ways most needs taking
over cannot be taken over in its present form,' says Hill of Yorkshire, a
company in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a 14 per cent
stake.
Setting the limit at two licences, instead of allowing one company to own
two large licences plus one of the remaining small five, means that nobody
will want to forfeit their chance to own another big licence by taking over
minnows such as Border or Grampian. Such companies could be acquired now as
defences to takeovers even under existing regulations, if the Independent
Television Commission, the regulator, agreed. But it is far from clear
whether shareholders would support such shenanigans.
'Under the previous ownership regulations the 15 could at least in theory
have become nine,' says Hill. 'Now it can move to eight. Moving from nine to
eight ITV companies is not a huge step forward.'
The barriers in the way of deeper consolidation will lead to uncertainty and
confusion after the expected rapid outbreak of takeovers, he believes.
The government plans to make changes to the licences which are likely to
operate after January 1 next year, and Mr Brooke, who plays one of the
straightest bats in politics has promised to keep the issue of ownership
under review. He said this week he would look at whether newspaper
publishers should be able to own ITV companies. Relaxation of the present 20
per cent limit on ownership of a single ITV company for publishers is likely
to happen eventually - it could have been this time but for fears that Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News International, owner of five national newspapers would
have swooped on an ITV company.
While the present rule change may be modest it could have profound
implications for Hill's career. He has long known that by advocating a
smaller number of large ITV companies, he could be one of the first to be
trampled in the rush.
'Three times I have been in companies that have been taken over,' he says.
'Twice I was promoted and the third time fired. The best deal financially
was the time I was fired.' Central is not only attractive as the second
largest in ITV but as a company which successfully bid only Pounds 2,000 for
its licence. This means that its annual payments to the government are far
less than most companies of its size, although it still has to hand over a
percentage of its advertising revenue.
So Hill is a potential victim as well as a potential predator. Conventional
wisdom in the industry has it that Michael Green's Carlton Communications,
which owns 20 per cent of the Midlands' company, will move against Central.
It would be an expensive morsel. In July 1991, before the news started to
leak about the company's low bid, the share price stood at about 630p. It
has now reached Pounds 21.68 giving the company a market capitalisation of
Pounds 583m - still small compared to Carlton's Pounds 1.5bn.
Despite Hill's powerful and ambitious minority shareholder, he is big enough
and determined enough to want to be a player in his own right. He could
launch a bid for London Weekend Television, although there he might find
himself on a collision course with Granada, which already owns 20 per cent
of the London weekend company.
Anglia, with a market capitalisation of about Pounds 200m, would seem to be
Hill's most obvious target if Green fails to clinch a deal quickly. HTV, the
commercial broadcaster to Wales and the west, could be a takeover target at
a pinch.
Hill declines to comment on how he plans to play such a sticky wicket. But
anybody trying to bowl him out should be warned that Hill still plays a mean
game of cricket and can bowl unfriendly inswingers - if not flippers or
googlies.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Glittering prizes if he gets it right: Short-term pain for
long-term gain could be the theme of Kenneth Clarke's first Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday all eyes will be on Mr Kenneth Clarke as the chancellor delivers
the most bally-hooed Budget in recent years.
The first modern Budget to combine spending and taxation decisions will be
vital for the survival of Mr John Major's battered government. It will give
the British public and foreign investors a first real insight into the
economic policies and philosophy of the man who became chancellor six months
ago. It could be crucial to the UK's ability to withstand increasingly
powerful competition from east Asia and survive as a leading industrial
power in the 1990s.
Above all, the Budget must be a success for Mr Clarke if he is still to be
regarded as Mr Major's natural successor. The chancellor is condemned to
take risks. Although the economy is recovering steadily from recession,
business and consumer confidence is at a low ebb.
If Mr Clarke is serious about tackling the UK's large Pounds 50bn budget
deficit with the aim of securing sustained non-inflationary growth, now is
the time to act. The electoral cycle means that he can ill afford to delay
unpleasant medicine. The trick that he must master is to serve it up in a
palatable way.
The chancellor has some advantages. Barring unforeseen developments, he will
have surprise on his side when he opens William Gladstone's scruffy red and
gold budget box in the Commons.
True, his big day has been preceded by a cacophony of speculation, fostered
in part by Mr Clarke's decision to abolish pre-Budget purdah for himself and
Treasury ministers, and fueled by intensive lobbying from all possible
interest groups. But the muffled howling of spending departments that always
accompanies their annual negotiations on public spending with the Treasury,
and the ventilation of every conceivable tax wheeze, has simply left the
nation confused.
The Treasury, Whitehall's Praetorian guard, has maintained its discipline
thoroughout the past four and a half months of Budget preparation and
allowed no clearly defined leaks. While it is possible to make reasonably
well-informed guesses about the Budget, all but a very small group of
Treasury ministers and senior officials are in the dark about the
chancellor's plans.
We do know quite a lot about Mr Clarke, his politics and his preferences. In
his first important public speech after moving into number 11 Downing
Street, the self-styled son of the industrial Midlands said he wanted to be
remembered 'as a chancellor under whom the British businessman and woman and
their workforce were able to earn a better living'.
He has since laid great stress on the need for greater saving and investment
in the UK economy. He wants to reduce the amount the government spends as a
proportion of gross domestic product from more than 45 per cent to less than
40 per cent. However, unlike some Tories, he believes government can do some
good through public spending and is not prepared to cut it below an
acceptable minimum.
Since his first lengthy interview with the Financial Times in June, the
chancellor has consistently said that the projected 1993-94 public sector
borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn, or 8 per cent of GDP, is too high. He
has been equally consistent in not ruling out higher taxes to reduce the
deficit in addition to the Pounds 6.72bn for 1994-95 and the Pounds 10.3bn
for 1995-96 decided by Mr Norman Lamont in his final March Budget.
Would the economy be able to bear additional tax increases? The good news
for Mr Clarke is that it has performed better than expected in the past six
months. Although there is a widespread belief that Britain is still in
recession, and some sectors such as construction are still very depressed,
the country has been in recovery since the second quarter of last year.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment has fallen by 137,000 from its January peak
of 2.99m. GDP in the third quarter was 1.9 per cent higher than the year
before. The economy should grow by about 1 3/4 per cent this year against
the March Budget forecast of 1 1/4 per cent.
Moreover, there are indications that economic activity is being
under-recorded. The Bank of England has suggested that the price measures
used to calculate volume growth of industrial production and exports may be
causing government statisticians to underestimate real activity. Recent
figures showing falling unemployment, slow growth in manu-facturing output
and rising productivity are inconsistent with each other.
In September, Mr Clarke told the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund that he was aiming for a recovery that would be 'sustained
over the rest of the decade and beyond', and which would be 'driven by
investment and exports not consumption, by the private sector not the
state'.
What is clear, however, is that consumer demand, rather than exports or
investment, has become the main engine of economic growth in Britain. As the
chart shows, private consumption as a percentage of UK GDP has risen to
record levels in real terms and is higher than in most advanced economies.
This is a mixed blessing. It is doubtful whether Britain can sustain such
high levels of private consumption in an increasingly competitive world. An
ominous sign has been the persistent large current account deficit
throughout the recession.
If Mr Clarke is serious about encouraging business and investment, he should
now be thinking of refocusing the economy. This would also fit with his
determination to have the economy correctly trimmed to achieve a
Conservative victory in the general election to be fought by late spring of
1997. The coming financial year is about the last in which it will be
politically prudent to inflict financial pain on voters, while hoping to be
able to compensate them by the time the nation next elects its MPs.
Cutting public spending would be one way of rebalancing the economy. But, as
we have seen, the chancellor sees political and practical limits to such an
exercise. The off-stage noises emanating from the negotiations between the
Treasury and spending departments to keep the pre-set control totals for
public spending within their respective ceilings of Pounds 253.6bn in
1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn in 1995-96 have done nothing to dispel the
impression that this year's public expenditure round has been very
difficult.
Mr Clarke will in any case have to signal politically difficult cuts in
important public services on Tuesday. Invalidity benefit, unemployment pay,
the roads programme, housing, and military expenditure are all likely to be
trimmed, if pre-Budget reports are to be believed.
So taxation offers Mr Clarke his only realistic option to wring success out
of a difficult Budget. Britain's tax system is so complex that a deft
politician can always conjure up acts of generosity to catch the public
imagination even when vigorously raising taxes.
However, the chancellor will be constrained by the high tax increases
already announced in March as well as by the government's 1992 election
manifesto. Mortgage interest relief, for example, has long been a target of
Treasury tax reformers and is due to be restricted to the 20 per cent tax
band from April. But it looks likely to survive in some form because of the
still fragile recovery in the housing market and the manifesto pledge that
it should be 'maintained'.
In recent weeks there has been much speculation that Mr Clarke would attack
the privileges of pension funds. But this has looked less likely since the
chancellor's recent CBI conference speech which disclosed that Mr Stephen
Dorrell, the financial secretary, would carry out a long-term work programme
'looking at the impact of tax and other government policies on savings and
the flow of funds through the economy'.
In his IMF speech, Mr Clarke expressed a clear preference 'wherever
possible' for indirect taxation. 'When we tax consumers,' he said, 'we
should target their spending rather than their savings or incomes.'
However, it is doubtful whether he will be able to live up to his principles
next week. Although Britain's 17.5 per cent standard rate of value-added tax
is low compared with others in Europe and covers only about 54 per cent of
consumers' expenditure, the furore over VAT on domestic fuel and power
exposed the political limitations of widening its net to zero-rated items
such as food. Furthermore, the government's inflation target of 1 to 4 per
cent for retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments militates
against radical action because VAT increases are reflected in inflation
figures.
Nevertheless, there may be some limited moves on VAT and there is an outside
chance of a new lower VAT rate to cover zero and exempt items. Excise duties
on motor fuels are already destined to rise by more than inflation and
tobacco and alcohol taxes could follow suit.
But, as has so often been the case, income tax looks the best vehicle for
increasing taxation. Most pundits expect the chancellor to restrict tax
allowances. He could, for example, raise about Pounds 4bn by the simple
expedient of abolishing the married couple's allowance, or Pounds 6bn by
restricting all personal allowances to the 20 per cent lower tax band. Such
moves could be defended as contributing to fairness and give ample scope for
widening the 20 per cent tax band well beyond the Pounds 3,000 limit due to
enter force in April.
The Tories' natural supporters in the middle- and upper-income brackets
would suffer, of course. But Mr Clarke might calculate that they would
return to the fold by the next general election, especially if they are
provided with cuts in income tax rates before going to the polls.
The final package will hinge on the chancellor's assessment of how much he
must cut the deficit. The figures for the first seven months of this
financial year have provided no encouragement that it will be less than
Pounds 50bn.
The latest City consensus is for a fiscal tightening of about Pounds 2bn in
1994-95 on top of Mr Lamont's pre-programmed tax rises. The belief, quietly
promoted by the Bank of England, that the economy is in better fettle than
it appears could encourage Mr Clarke to be even tougher.
If Mr Clarke wants to achieve his aim of making Britain more internationally
competitive in the 1990s, his best bet next Tuesday could well be to
prescribe short-term pain for the consumer in the hope that it will yield
long-term gain for the nation and his party.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Principled taxation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In March of this year, in what turned out to be his last Budget, Norman
Lamont surreptitiously introduced a significant change in the tax treatment
of pension funds. This is not how the change was presented. It was presented
as a change in the treatment of advance corporation tax that would, as luck
would have it, raise Pounds 900m in 1995-96. Without warning, the chancellor
chose to undermine long-standing assumptions about the tax treatment of
pensions. He did so because he thought a raid on pension funds would attract
minimal obloquy. Alas, he was right.
This decision may not have been the most important in the Budget. But it was
particularly revealing. Mr Lamont decided to lower the rate of advance
corporation tax, which is advance income tax on dividend income, to 20 per
cent, while lowering the rate of tax credit to the same level.
For most ordinary shareholders the change was neutral. It was not, however,
for tax-exempt shareholders, such as pension funds. The sudden increase in
the gap between the rate of corporation tax, on the one hand, and the rate
of ACT, on the other, has made them significantly worse off. To cut a long
and complex story short, the government had decided to raid pension fund
surpluses to fill part of the yawning fiscal gap.
What, apart from the technical obscurity of the measure, was so wrong with
that? One thing wrong with it is precisely the technicality of the change.
That obscurity is what made it possible to present a plan whose effect was
to raise almost Pounds 1bn from companies, via their pension funds, as a way
of providing companies with 'cash flow benefits of about Pounds 2bn over the
next two years'.
Fiscal pickle
How clever] But how deceitful] The chancellor could, instead, have admitted
that the fiscal pickle into which profligacy and an incorrectly forecast
recession had led the government meant greater taxation of pension funds. He
did not. His failure to do so, while no more than could be expected, was
unprincipled in two significant respects.
The first concerns the proper treatment of income and expenditure. In 1984,
the then-chancellor, Nigel Lawson, indicated a desire to reinforce the
system of income taxation. The notion was mistaken, but it was at least
coherent. Subsequently, however, changes were made in the direction of
taxation of expenditure. The case for expenditure taxation is strong in
itself. While the government never articulated its view of the matter, it
looked as though this was also the direc-tion in which it intended to go.
That is no longer true. The sudden change last March in the tax treatment of
the most important financial assets held, albeit indirectly, by the UK
personal sector has thrown everything into the air. This matters. It matters
partly because the tax treatment of savings is among the most important
single features of any fiscal system. It matters also because at the end of
1992 the gross value of UK pension funds was close to Pounds 400bn, and
represented 29 per cent of the gross and 43 per cent of the net financial
assets of the personal sector.
Political convenience
The second concern is still more fundamental. People have to plan their
lives on assumptions about how their savings will be allowed to accumulate.
In precisely the same way, they need to know what services and benefits the
state will provide. This is why continuity of approach and clarity of
principle are so important, points that should be obvious to Conservatives.
When the state spends 46 per cent of gross national income and raises 37 per
cent of it in taxation, it must do more than tack and trim, as the winds of
political convenience suggest. How can citizens hope to make sensible plans
of their own if the government is either unwilling or unable to clarify its
own?
When chancellor, Lord Lawson showed he understood the need. In his Budget
statement of 1985, for example, he argued there was 'a case for changing the
tax treatment of pension funds, as part of thorough-going reform of the tax
treatment of personal savings generally. Any fundamental reform of this kind
would . . . need to be preceded by the publication of a Green Paper.' The UK
is still waiting for that paper.
The fiscal treatment of savings is important in itself. But the
inconsistencies in its current treatment are also an indication of what is
wrong with British government. What is needed is a stable and transparent
fiscal system, based on clear and defensible principles. In recent years,
the UK appears to have been moving further away from that objective. The
sudden introduction of a third rate of income tax when Lord Lawson had
reduced the number to two is another egregious example.
The unified Budget has offered an opportunity to do better. Up to now
nothing suggests it is being seized. Tuesday will reveal once and for all
how far Mr Clarke, too, is addicted to clever wheezes. The omens are
inauspicious. If they prove correct, this failing may matter far more than
any, inevitably uncertain, 'Budget judgment' he may have reached.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Tees development team woos businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle was launched this week for the hearts and minds of business
people in Cleveland, one of the counties which faces abolition under the
local government review.
At the Belasis Business Centre in Billingham, the five borough councils
which will gain unitary status if the Local Government Commission's final
recommendations for Cleveland and Durham are accepted, launched plans for a
Tees Valley Development Company, a partnership with the private sector to
market the area, boost inward investment and attract European funding. More
than 130 members of the business community attended the launch. The five
boroughs, Darlington, Hartlepool, Langbaurgh on Tees, Middlesbrough and
Stockton-on-Tees, said afterwards that the principle behind their plans had
local businesses' support.
But only two days earlier a delegation including the Confederation of
British Industry, the Teesside Chamber of Commerce and the Teesside Small
Business Club - bodies representing more than 2,000 local companies - saw Mr
John Gummer, environment secretary, in London to press for a single
Teesside-wide authority.
The delegation argued that the commission's recommendation to split
Cleveland, except Hartlepool, between three unitary boroughs - Stockton,
Middlesbrough and Langbaurgh - would be costly and unnecessary. It would
also, they said, lead to division and weaken the area's voice in dealing
with government, Europe and potential inward investors. The strongest public
champion of a new Teesside authority is Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern CBI
chairman. 'I have never known an issue which has united the business
community as strongly,' he says.
The private sector would have half the 20 seats on the TVDC's board of
directors. The other 10 would be councillors.
The TVDC, which will aim to create up to 1,900 jobs in its first two years,
would be run by a chief executive with nine staff and funded by a Pounds 2m
annual budget from the five boroughs. The economic development and planning
framework in which it operates would be set by a joint committee of
councillors.
It is far from certain the government will endorse the commission's
recommendation after the consultation period expires next month. While the
Cleveland proposals meet the government's wish for unitary authorities, the
commission's Durham proposals retain the existing two-tier structure, except
in Darlington. Mr Gummer may ask the commission to look again at Durham; and
that might affect Cleveland.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Tunnel groups fined over fatality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Five UK construction com-panies building the Channel tunnel were fined
Pounds 40,000 each yesterday for failing to ensure the safety of a worker
crushed to death while acting as a train lookout.
Mr David Griffiths, aged 26, of East Street, near Dover, died when he jumped
off a train to change a set of points, Maidstone Crown Court in Kent was
told. He was crushed in a 12in gap between his train and another.
The court heard that he had not received the required training to be a train
lookout, also known as a banksman.
Mr Hugh Carlisle QC, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive, said:
'Mr Griffiths should not have even been on the train. Not only was he not
qualified as a banksman but he had also never been trained to work
underground.'
Mr Michel Kalipetris, defending, said: 'We accept Mr Griffiths should not
have been on the train, but he slipped through a system that had been
devised to stop such accidents.'
Judge Felix Waley said: 'The failure in this case is one of the worst this
court has heard about in the past years. This accident happened because the
safety procedures in place were not properly supervised and carried out.'
The Transmanche Link consortium companies, Balfour Beatty Construction,
Wimpey Major Projects, Tarmac Construction, Taylor Woodrow, and Constain
Civil Engineering admitted failing to ensure Mr Griffiths's safety.

FT  27 NOV 93 / IRA hardliners set peace deadline: A deal might bring
political gains to republicans. But, they could also face threats to their
morale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Republican sources say that hardliners in the IRA are giving the peace
initiatives less than a month before they publicly blame the British
government for their failure and declare the process dead.
IRA leaders are reported to be weighing the political gains which could
spring from a comprehensive agreement between Dublin and London against the
risks to internal discipline and morale posed by the current reduction in
activity which has, as yet, produced no political breakthrough.
Mr Mitchell McLaughlin, a Sinn Fein leader and a leading republican
political strategist, said this week: 'This situation could change tomorrow
with the IRA using another bomb to signal they are back on the offensive . .
. The war is still going on . . . and the bombing campaign could easily be
resumed. This peace initiative is not open-ended. It is finite. There's no
way it is going to develop into an indefinite ceasefire if London and Dublin
do not move forward.'
An uneasy lull in the violence after the recent atrocities has created a
crucial breathing space in which the peace process embarked on by the
British and Irish governments can develop. But there is also a growing
belief that time is running out, and that should talks fail there may be a
surge in violence which will match, and possibly exceed, the worst levels of
the past 25 years.
Nevertheless the IRA has scaled down its operations since the bomb on the
Shankill Road in Belfast and the loyalist gun attack on a pub in
Londonderry. This has been matched by a scaling down of army operations.
Army tactics also seem to have changed. 'Target acquisition', where soldiers
train loaded guns on passers-by in republican areas, and the 'bomb burst'
where soldiers burst out of armoured vehicles and rush through the streets
covering each other with their weapons, are no longer employed. In a more
subtle de-escalation soldiers have tended to wear berets rather than helmets
in less dangerous areas.
Security sources also suspect that the IRA's military capability may have
been temporarily weakened by a recent series of discoveries of arms caches
in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and that a certain war-weariness may
be behind the push for a peace settlement. But they do not doubt the IRA's
own claims this week that it is still capable of striking heavily should a
decision be made to resume action.
According to security sources any resumption of a high-intensity military
campaign by the IRA will almost certainly involve renewed attacks on
commercial targets on the mainland. They say the IRA remains convinced that
the bomb attack on the City of London in April was a major coup and that
something similar should be attempted if the government seems to put
Northern Ireland in the political background again.
Sinn Fein has not yet written off the peace initiative between Mr John Hume,
leader of the Social Democratic Labour Party, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president, in spite of its rejection by Dublin and London. Sinn Fein
believes that either the Anglo-Irish summit pencilled for next Friday or
even informal contacts might produce key concessions facilitating a
permanent ceasefire.
Mr Tom Hartley, the Sinn Fein chairman, said: 'The process is not over yet.
Politics is about looking for opportunities. I suspect the British
government has no viable alternative to the Hume-Adams proposals and is just
saying no . . . I will be looking for whatever emerges from the summit that
can create a dynamic for change.'
He added: 'It is possible that a response would not even happen at a public
level but will probably be made in a private way,' suggesting that Sinn Fein
hopes to reopen a secret channel of negotiation with the British government
which it claims was closed off last July after unionist complaints.
The dilemma for the two prime ministers, even if they were about to offer an
olive branch to the IRA, is that there are growing concerns in the security
forces about the threat posed by loyalist paramilitaries. One army source
said: 'We are in a process of reassessing the threat. It has traditionally
come from one side only but we are having to reorientate our planning to
face a possible threat from the other side as well.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Top team at Lloyd's is reinforced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday moved to reinforce its senior management team by
appointing Sir Alan Hardcastle, the former head of the government's
accountancy service, to take charge of regulation at the insurance market.
Sir Alan will become chairman of Lloyd's regulatory board and deputy
chairman of its governing council, succeeding Mr Brian Garraway, who died in
September.
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, said: 'His wealth of experience will
be invaluable in continuing to develop the new regulatory environment at
Lloyd's'
A former senior partner of Peat Marwick, Mitchell (now KPMG Peat Marwick),
Sir Alan, aged 60, became head of the government accountancy service in
1989.
Separately it emerged yesterday that Mr Rowland and Mr Peter Middleton,
chief executive, have persuaded many of Lloyd's largest agencies to make
voluntary donations to help settle out of court legal actions by 17,000
loss-making Names - individuals whose assets support the market.
The contributions vary from less than Pounds 100,000 for smaller agents to
more than Pounds 1.5m for some of the largest, with the total collected
amounting to at least Pounds 25m.
Lloyd's hopes to finance the bulk of its settlement offer to Names from two
other sources: between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m from errors and omissions
insurers, which cover Lloyd's agents against awards for negligence and a
contribution; and possibly about Pounds 400m from the Lloyd's central fund,
which meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations.
Names will be offered a 'bespoke' settlement depending on which loss-making
syndicates they belong to, with the amount of compensation offered
reflecting the chances of success of their separate legal actions and a
series of other factors.
The agents' voluntary contribution, however, has stretched the resources of
the total of more than 100 agents who have been trading at the market. Many
have seen their income shrink following recent losses.
One chairman conceded that his agency had been forced to borrow to finance
the payment and some smaller agents could be forced into insolvency.
One managing director said: 'There are agents who are being asked for sums
which will kill them. It is an extremely emotional issue.'
Donations were calculated according to a complex formula which reflects the
deductibles on agents' errors and omissions policies (the amount of each
claim paid by the policyholder) as well as the exposure of agents to legal
actions.

FT  27 NOV 93 / MPs accuse ministers over energy efficiency 'failure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has made little progress in encouraging energy efficiency,
the Commons environment committee said in a highly critical report
yesterday.
Mr Robert Jones, Conservative chairman of the committee, said: 'We are one
of the most complacent nations in the world on energy efficiency.'
The report is particularly sceptical about the likely effectiveness of the
Energy Saving Trust, an organisation set up to promote household energy
efficiency, which has been one of the central planks of the government's
strategy for combating global warming. The committee reports that it is
'concerned that the trust will not achieve the funding levels needed to meet
its target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions'.
The government wants funding for the trust's projects to come from the gas
and electricity utilities, which would pass on the costs to customers in
their bills. The report said, however, that it had found 'a huge discrepancy
between what the trust considers it needs and what it is likely to receive'.
The UK committed itself at last year's Rio Earth Summit to stabilising
emissions of carbon dioxide, largely produced by burning fossil fuels, at
1990 levels by the year 2000. Government figures suggest this would mean a
cut of about 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) on projected annual levels, or about
6 per cent.
The government has said it expects the trust's schemes to save 2.5mtC, a
quarter of the total. The controversial imposition of value added tax on
domestic heating fuel, announced in the spring Budget, will save a further
1.5mtC, it has said.
The MPs report, however, that 'a great deal of scepticism and disagreement
among witnesses as to the impact VAT will have on energy consumption
patterns'.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, estimated that the UK would have to invest Pounds 1bn for every
million tonnes of carbon emissions it averted. 'This is the ninth
parliamentary report in the past decade on this subject and they have all
said we need to pull our finger out,' he said.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said yesterday: 'I have acknowledged that
the trust's targets are extremely challenging, and it will only be able to
achieve them with considerable support from the utilities and their
regulators'.

FT  27 NOV 93 / London Tube seeks cable help abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground yesterday appealed for technical help from big UK cable
manufacturers and international subway train operators to repair its
crippled system.
Managers turned to companies such as BICC as engineers struggled to locate
faults in the 50-year old power supply cables for the Central Line.
Independent observers say commuters annoyed by this week's power failures
should blame the government rather than staff.
After three days of disruption, consultants who have worked with Underground
engineers said they were doing the best they could with available equipment.
'If you've got cables that old it's reasonable to expect some problems,'
said one consultant. 'I don't think it's fair to lay the blame on the
managers or engineers. At the end of the day it comes down to funding.'
Management systems have been tightened, and in 1988 managers were given
responsibility for a particular line. This has led to an improvement in the
quality of the service, the Underground says.
Senior management reviews are conducted after incidents such as this week's
breakdown. Procedures for dealing with passengers trapped in carriages in
tunnels have been improved following previous shutdowns and worked much
better this week, the Underground said. It has been keen to emphasise
funding shortages. Earlier this year it published the details of an Pounds
8.5bn spending programme - nearly Pounds 900m a year over the next 10 years
 -which it said would be needed to create what it called 'a decently modern
metro' after decades of neglect.
This week's problems were the result of a 1,000-to-one occurrence which the
Underground's traditional 'belt-and-braces' approach to power supply - and
other safety-related equipment - was unable to address.
The same cable that takes the power supply from the substation to the track
is also used for the back-up substation, London Underground said yesterday.
So, in the rare event of a fault in the cable, neither the main substation
nor the back-up can be used. One consultant said it was 'bad luck' that such
a fault should occur, although the age of the equipment increased the chance
of a problem. The Underground cannot afford the luxury of having hundreds of
miles of back-up cabling.
The short-term effect is that, following further power failures yesterday,
the Central Line east of Liverpool Street will remain shut this weekend.
The power failures raise the broader issue of government funding for the
Underground and whether financial cuts are making it difficult for managers
to spend adequately on 'behind-the-scenes' investment when more high-profile
spending is also needed.
One observer said: 'When money is tight it is a fact of life that it is
easier to get money for things that have a profile, such as new or
refurbished trains and stations. Preventive maintenance tends to suffer in
that situation . . . there's no kudos in replacing cables.'
London Underground said yesterday that the cabling, some of which is 70
years old, should have been replaced 15 years ago. The equipment had served
it well, and there was no reason to believe it was about to fail. But it
would not compromise on safety if it thought that using old cables was a
risk.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Student population reaches 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Student numbers in UK higher education now exceed 1m for the first time, Mr
John Patten, education secretary, announced yesterday.
The education department's target for a third of 18 to 19-year-olds to enter
higher education by the year 2000 has almost been reached.
Using early statistics on the number of students who started degree courses
in October this year, Mr Patten said 31 per cent of 18 to 19-year-olds
entered higher education.
Mr Patten said: 'During this period of recent rapid expansion, the average
A-level achievements of new entrants have increased. All the indications are
that the quality and standards in higher education have also been enhanced.'
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals welcomed the news, which it
said showed that the current level of funding was adequate. However the
government should now set a more ambitious target, and a new system of
tax-related loans might be needed, said the committee.
The Higher Education Funding Council (England) said that full-time students
rose by 11 per cent to nearly 700,000, up from 628,000 last year.
However former polytechnics, which became universities last year, fared
worse than had been expected in their first year of direct competition with
'old' universities. While the established universities took on 7 per cent
more full-time students than last year (with a 21 per cent increase in
part-time students), there was a fall of 1 per cent in numbers taken on by
new universities.
However, sharp increases in recruitment over previous years meant that total
numbers at new universities were still 11 per cent higher than last year.
General higher education colleges in England, many of them now pressing for
university status, saw numbers rise by 27 per cent overall, while numbers at
specialist colleges (such as teacher-training colleges) rose 19 per cent.
In the Commons, Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, welcomed the
fact that more young people were staying on in higher education, but said it
was a pity that graduates could not get the jobs they were qualified for.
Unemployment among recent graduates was at 14 per cent, she said.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior employment minister, said graduate unemployment
overall was 5 per cent, although it was 14 per cent for recent graduates.
'That 14 per cent is a snapshot in time; it doesn't mean that all of them
will stay unemployed,' said Miss Widdecombe.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Major attacked over party dinners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday attacked the
prime minister's use of 10 Downing Street, his official residence, as a
venue for fundraising dinners for the Conservative party.
Mr Cook said yesterday that Downing Street was a government building and not
a private home which Mr Major could use as he pleased.
'If the prime minister is using it as an exclusive club to wine and dine
Tory party paymasters, it demonstrates the arrogance of a party that has
been in power for too long,' he said.
Earlier this week the Financial Times revealed that a crisis in the
Conservative party's finances had forced the prime minister to drop a
self-imposed ban on entertaining elite groups of past and potential donors
in the building.
It is understood that the prime minister reversed that decision in
September, after a warning from two of the party treasurers - Mr Charles
Hambro and Sir Philip Harris - that such events were vital to the party's
drive to raise money to finance next year's European and local election
campaigns.
Earlier this week Mr Major hosted the third Downing Street fundraising
dinner in recent months.
The occasions have been kept a close secret because of acute sensitivity
about Conservative party finances in the wake of the controversy about
donations from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
In a letter to the prime minister, Mr Cook requested Mr Major to provide him
with a list of guests who have attended recent functions, and assurances
that none of them has been appointed to any public body.
He also asked for a list of the forthcoming dates on which Downing Street
was to be used for such events.

In contrast, some of the cabling for signalling on the Central Line is
'life-expired' - along with the trains - and thus was given a higher
priority on safety grounds. A Pounds 750m project is due to start next year
to replace the line's trains, signalling and power cabling.
New trains are the most obvious evidence of increased spending, but the
Underground said that other items were just as important.
One area of concern is the ageing system of pumps and drains, used to remove
3m gallons of rat and sewage-infested water each day. Much of it needs to be
replaced, but lack of funds has forced the Underground to concentrate on
'patching up' when things go wrong. The Railway Industry Association, the
equipment suppliers' trade body, said it was concerned that a further
reduction in government funding might be announced in Tuesday's Budget.

FT  27 NOV 93 / PM backs Lilley on welfare reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister yesterday gave strong backing to a speech earlier this
week by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, calling for
wide-ranging reform of the welfare benefits system.
Mr John Major said it was right to point out that the costs of many aspects
of welfare were outstripping economic growth across the western world.
He said: 'What we need to do to maintain the welfare state is to make sure
that we concentrate wealth where it really needs to be.'
Mr Lilley's call for the welfare state to be replaced by a 'welfare society'
was designed to sketch out the principles behind the government's long-term
review of social security spending.
But it was also seen at Westminster as an attempt to soften up public
opinion for a harsh squeeze on welfare benefits in next week's Budget.
One of the main principles for welfare policy outlined by Mr Lilley was a
belief that people should take more responsibility for providing their own
retirement provision.
He also stressed that the Pounds 80bn social security budget, Whitehall's
largest spending programme, would have to be contained in forthcoming years.
Tuesday's Budget should contain measures that provide a step in that
direction. The Budget may include a squeeze on invalidity benefit and a
reduction in the statu-tory sick pay subsidy to employers.
However, Mr Lilley said in a radio interview yesterday that the government
would continue to stand by its commitment to maintain child benefit.
'We are committed to maintaining child benefit,' he said. 'We have a clear
manifesto pledge. And I am very old-fashioned, as you know, about manifesto
pledges.'
He said that it would be 'very difficult' to tax child benefit.
Mr Lilley's approach drew vehement criticism from opposition politicians,
who regard it as a precursor to drastic benefit cuts in the Budget.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, last night attacked what he
called the 'DIY benefits society' proposed by the minister, and warned that
it would trap people in poverty and homelessness.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security minister, also criticised the
speech, saying that under Mr Lilley the welfare state was in danger of
becoming a stigma-ridden 'second-rate safety net'.
Mr Lilley's speech was the latest attempt by a minister to focus public
debate on a long-term review of the welfare state.
In recent months Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury,
has been conducting a fundamental review of welfare state spending.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Gilt sale 'clue' to tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England surprised financial markets yesterday by announcing a
gilt auction for December 8, triggering speculation that next week's Budget
would raise taxes by a large amount, Peter Marsh writes.
The Bank said an unspecified amount of bonds in the maturity range between
2002 and 2006 would go on sale, confounding expectations that the next
auction would not be held until January.
The announcement sparked a surge of buying interest in long-dated gilts,
which closed last night up more than half a point on the view that the
Budget will be positive for gilts.
Many gilt investors would like Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise
taxes on Tuesday by about Pounds 3bn to curb the Pounds 50bn fiscal deficit.
A tightening of this order would be considered good for gilts on the grounds
that it would reduce the volume of bonds to be issued over the next two
years.
The Bank will announce on Budget day the amount of gilts to be sold on
December 8 and the exact maturity.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Budget anxiety in north holds back confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many businesses view next week's Budget with trepidation, fearing that
Tuesday's half-point cut in interest rates was a 'softener' for tax
increases, the Confederation of British Industry in the north of England
said yesterday.
Mr Arthur Foord, northern region CBI director, said after yesterday's
bi-monthly meeting of the regional council that anxiety about the Budget was
holding down confidence among the CBI's 1,500 member companies in his area.
Members feared that tax increases would damage the 'patchy and fragile'
recovery.
Mr Foord said conditions for businesses in north-east England and Cumbria
had continued their slow improvement, but companies doing well tended to be
those seeking new markets, particularly outside western Europe.
Exports account for nearly 45 per cent of the north's manufactured output,
the highest regional proportion in the UK.
Mr Foord said that, in spite of the low level of interest rates, little
investment was planned. The reason was not lack of finance, but of
confidence. Yesterday's meeting was less gloomy than those held in the
summer, but optimism remained below early-1993 levels, he said.
Separately, manufacturers in Yorkshire and Humberside have confirmed 'an
unsteady and patchy emergence from recession', according to an Engineering
Employers Federation survey of its 300 members in the region.
The EEF said yesterday that, after stalling in September, the trend in
orders picked up to levels last seen in January, but this was not enough to
take up much spare capacity. Mr Ian Hughes, director of the EEF's Yorkshire
and Humberside Association, said industry was using an average of only 69
per cent of capacity.
Home orders were volatile in October and November, with 41 per cent of
companies reporting an improvement and 24 per cent a decline. Although
exports picked up for 25 per cent of companies and fell for 18 per cent, the
majority - 57 per cent - reported no change. Nearly 75 per cent reported
unchanged investment plans.
With profit margins tightening under competition, this caution was almost
inevitable, given that 31 per cent of companies suffered a decline in
profitability against 16 per cent which reported an improvement. Cashflow
deteriorated for 20 per cent, with only 16 per cent saying it was better.
Mr Hughes said the large volume of spare capacity made it unlikely that any
Budget incentives would encourage much investment.
Confidence was poor. Just over half the companies expect no improvement in
total orders in the next three months - and 20 per cent are forecasting a
decline. Nearly 55 per cent expect no change in capacity utilisation and 21
per cent expect to use less.
One bright spot is that 62 per cent say they will keep to their present
number of employees and 19 per cent forecast taking more on. However, 60 per
cent expect no improvement in the economy.

FT  27 NOV 93 / 'Not a salesman but he can do his bit for Britain': The
search for a role for the Prince of Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Prince of Wales intended this week to refocus debate on more serious
aspects of his responsibilities, he cannot have been disappointed.
His remarks, which made known his frustrations over lack of government
support during overseas royal visits, created an instant stir around
Whitehall and Westminster which seems certain to lead to a reappraisal of
the prince's potential role as an ambassador for Britain.
Ministers were this week quick to acknowledge the value of the prince in
helping promote Britain in important overseas markets. They were equally
ready to accept that more could be done to fully exploit his unique
position.
Within hours of the prince's views becoming known on Monday Mr John Major
was pledging his support for moves to improve the commercial effectiveness
of the heir to the throne's overseas visits.
But when the dust has settled, what is the real scope for ensuring that the
value of the prince, in the context of helping to promote British companies
and products, can be further enhanced?
Both the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry are anxious
to emphasise the support they already provide for overseas royal visits. But
if the programme of visits has in the past been seen by officials more as a
time-consuming nuisance than a positive opportunity, the prince's remarks
and the political fall-out will bring a renewed effort to consider such
trips in a more strategic light.
With Downing Street 'keen' to do everything possible to help, an improvement
in co-ordination between departments when visits are being planned and the
provision of ministerial back-up during tours is on the agenda.
The DTI is examining ways of better exploiting the prince's apparent
readiness to help wave the flag for Britain and Mr Richard Needham, the
trade minister, will soon discuss ideas directly with the prince.
St James' palace has stressed that it does not see the issue necessarily as
one of financial resources but of a more supportive approach to reflect a
better appreciation of the potential value of overseas royal visits to the
economy.
But some in business were this week anxious to emphasise that the prince
himself will have to demonstrate a greater flexibility and readiness to
participate in more commercially-oriented overseas exercises.
The constraints placed on him by royal protocol were exposed this week, when
it emerged that the prince will be in Australia in January at the same time
as a business mission led by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary. They are unlikely to meet, however, because royal protocol
dictates that the prince cannot be seen to participate directly in trade
promotion in countries which recognise him as heir to the throne.
As one of his aides has emphasised: 'Though he can do his bit for Britain,
he is not a salesman.'
But according to one of Britain's most senior industrialists, who has
participated in numerous overseas trade missions, some of them involving the
prime minister: 'In the past, he (the prince) has proved extremely choosy
about the sort of missions abroad in which he is prepared to participate. He
generally only wants to take part in events directly linked to the
organisations he has helped start or in which he is directly involved. If
that attitude is now a thing of the past, it is very good news.'
Several in business this week quoted the example of the Duke of Kent,
vice-chairman of British Overseas Trade Board, as an example of how a
'hands-on' member of the royal family worked actively to assist the national
exporting effort. The duke, however, will not be the next king.
Another senior industrialist said: 'I see no good reason why the prince
should not head up trade missions in the same way the prime minister does.
He could not be expected to negotiate, but then neither is the prime
minister.
'We are talking about a modern monarchy trying to find a modern role. It
cannot have it both ways, simultaneously trying to cling to past
conventions.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Management rescues Daf parts offshoots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK components operations of Daf, the failed Dutch commercial vehicle
maker, have been rescued from receivership by a management buy-in team,
which has made secure 510 jobs in Glasgow and Leyland, Lancashire.
A new company, Albion Automotive, has been formed to take over the former
Albion axle plant in Scotstoun, Glasgow which employs 330 people, as well as
the Leyland components plant which employs 180.
The company will be led by Mr Dan Wright, formerly managing director of
Fleming Thermodynamics, an engineering consultancy based in East Kilbride,
Lanarkshire, and now a subsidiary of Motherwell Bridge, the engineering
group. The management team has secured backing of about Pounds 12m.
Bank of Scotland is providing long-term finance and overdraft facilities of
about Pounds 5m, while selective regional assistance from the Scottish
Office will add up to about Pounds 1.5m. Additional funding is being
provided by the Glasgow Development Agency and Strathclyde Regional council.
Equity backing of close to Pounds 4m is being provided by the syndicate of
former Daf creditor banks led by ABN-AMRO of the Netherlands.
The bank syndicate is providing venture capital finance through the Leyland
Daf receivership, led by the joint administrative receivers, Mr Murdoch
McKillop and Mr John Talbot of accountants Arthur Andersen.
The rescue of the two operations almost completes the restructuring of the
former Leyland Daf truck and van operations in the UK after the financial
collapse of Daf in February.
About 2,700 of an original 5,500 UK jobs at Leyland Daf have survived.
The Birmingham van plant and the Leyland truck plant have been rescued by
management buy-outs. The parts operation in Chorley was bought by a
management buy-in team and the sales and marketing activity in Thame,
Oxfordshire was taken over by Daf Trucks in the Netherlands.
Mr Wright said Albion Automotive would have an initial turnover of about
Pounds 30m. The workforce has supported the rescue by agreeing to a 5 per
cent pay cut and a far-reaching package of new work practices.
The company has secured contracts of up to six years to supply truck and van
axles to Leyland Trucks and Leyland Daf Vans, as well as truck and bus
chassis components and piping to Leyland Trucks and Daf Trucks.
The company plans to develop in the fields of vehicle chassis and driveline
components through joint ventures and acquisitions.

An industrial tribunal in Leeds yesterday made a record-breaking award of
Pounds 172,912 to Mrs Nichola Cannock, a mother of three who was dismissed
from the Royal Air Force nine years ago for becoming pregnant, Robert Taylor
writes.
This is the highest amount won by a woman from the armed services in a sex
discrimination case. Mrs Cannock's counsel told the tribunal hearing that
the case was 'highly unusual' because she had impressive engineering
qualifications.
She worked 12-hour shifts helping to prepare and maintain Victor Tanker
planes flying from RAF Marsham to serve in the Falklands war.
The Ministry of Defence agreed that Mrs Cannock should receive compensation
for her dismissal, which it said had breached the sex discrimination laws.
But it proposed only just over Pounds 12,000.
Last month Mrs Deborah Miller, who used to serve in the RAF, won Pounds
33,000 at an industrial tribunal for losing her job because of pregnancy.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Smithfield gets two council seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least two meat traders from the Smithfield meat market are assured of
places on the council which controls the City of London.
The next election will take place on December 6, but the Smithfield tenants
are already guaranteed at least two seats, because in one ward which has
four seats on offer, four of the six candidates are traders.
Smithfield candidates are standing in 10 wards as part of their campaign
against the rents they are being asked to pay to fund refurbishment of the
market.
In a statement, the traders said two sitting members had withdrawn 'rather
than face defeat by the Smithfield candidates'.
This year's elections will be the most hotly contested for more than 50
years, with elections required in 13 of the 25 wards - normally only three
or four wards are contested, and some have not had a contested election for
more than 25 years.
The Corporation of London, which has tried to encourage businesses to make
use of the franchise, said the traders were quite entitled to take their
stand, but added that the traders' campaign was 'quite inappropriate for
resolving what is essentially a landlord-tenant dispute'.

Iraq last night conceded UN Security Council demands for long-term
monitoring to guard against any revival of its capability to produce weapons
of mass destruction.
The decision means that Baghdad has dropped its insistence that verification
would constitute an unwarranted intrusion and an offence against the
nation's sovereignty. In a letter to the council, Mr Mohamed Said al-Sahaf,
the foreign minister, argued that 'this positive step' and other 'positive
developments' justified the lifting of sanctions, including the embargo on
oil sales.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN commission overseeing the elimination of Iraqi
weapons, said the Iraqi move was a major breakthrough.

   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller suffered another setback to her
economic reforms yesterday when the constitutional court in Ankara cancelled
the new banking law, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul.
The court action follows a decision blocking the sale of the state telecom
monopoly PTT, the cornerstone of the government's relaunched privatisation
programme.
The bank legislation sought to bring Turkey into line with European
standards on capital adequacy and other prudential ratios, ahead of the move
to customs union with the European Union in 1995. Mrs Ciller will now have
to present the proposals to parliament for debate, causing further delays.
Mrs Ciller has used decree powers to bypass parliament and introduce
banking, insurance and privatisation reforms.
Last month, following appeal from the main opposition Motherland party, the
court declared the government's use of decree powers as unconstitutional.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Israelis kill another Hamas leader

Less than 48 hours after killing the military commander of the Hamas Islamic
fundamentalist group in Gaza, Israeli forces yesterday shot dead another
leading Hamas militant.
News of the death of Khaled Zer was suppressed yesterday by the Israeli
military censor, presumably in an effort to avoid further infuriating
Palestinians angered by Wednesday's killing of Imad Akel, commander of the
Izzedine al-Qassem military wing of Hamas, of which Zer was also a member.
Jerusalem police sent reinforcements to the Temple Mount yesterday morning,
where 20,000 Palestinians gathered for Friday prayers, and extra troops were
deployed, too, in the Gaza Strip. Although there were reports of clashes
between Palestinians and Israeli troops, the violence was tame by comparison
with Thursday's disturbances, in which one man was killed, another
critically wounded and more than 30 others hurt.
Israeli officials said Zer had been shot dead after seeking to escape his
Israeli pursuers early yesterday in the village of Surbaher outside
Jerusalem. They said a rifle was found by his body.
Military sources said he had been involved in the murders of two Israeli
soldiers and a civilian.
The Israeli army also released news last night that troops shot and killed
another Palestinian militant, Salim Sabah, several days ago. Sabah is
alleged to have killed a Jewish settler in the West Bank earlier this month.
This spate of killings of 'wanted' Palestinian militants underlines the
determination of the Israelis to track down the most extreme opponents of
the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord, in advance of its scheduled implementation
on December 13.
But the intensified Israeli military activity is causing growing hostility
to the accord among Palestinians, while Hamas leaders, far from being
deterred, are vowing to avenge the deaths by kidnapping and murdering
Israeli soldiers in the coming days.
Against the backdrop of escalating hostility, Israel's Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said in a television interview that he did not regard December
13 - the date agreed by Israel and the PLO for the start of Israel's troop
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho - as 'sacred'.
It was important to ensure that all the autonomy issues were completely
clarified before the deal was enacted, said Mr Rabin, 'even if it takes a
little longer'.
In retort, at a press conference in Oslo, the PLO leader Yasser Arafat
insisted: 'I don't think we are in need of more time, if there is a will. .
.There is no reason to delay implementation of what we've signed.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / UN envoy hopes to restart Bosnia talks

<TEXT>
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator on former Yugoslavia,
said yesterday he hoped next Monday's meeting between European Union foreign
ministers and the warring factions in Bosnia would provide the basis for
fresh talks leading to a political settlement.
He said the EU initiative, which offers a phase-out of sanctions on Serbia
and Montenegro if more land is returned to the Moslems by Bosnian Serbs, was
'of imperative importance' in seeking to restart the talks. Negotiations on
dividing Bosnia into three ethnically-based mini-states collapsed in
September over Moslem demands for 3-4 per cent more territory.
Other issues for the meeting on Monday, which Presidents Slobodan Milosevic
of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia will also attend, concern guarantees
of access for humanitarian aid convoys in Bosnia and the establishment of
what Mr Stoltenberg called a modus vivendi between Croatia and
Serb-controlled areas now under UN protection, beginning with a ceasefire.
Officials from the UN refugee agency said yesterday that after three days of
relatively trouble-free aid deliveries into central and eastern Bosnia,
convoys were again experiencing delays and blockages by Bosnian Serb forces.
The Georgian government and the breakaway region of Abkhazia are to hold
UN-sponsored peace talks in Geneva.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Gonzalez in bid to avert general strike

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, is to meet union leaders and
employers representatives next week in a bid to ease mounting industrial
tension in Spain and avert a possible general strike.
Mr Gonzalez's mediation bid came the day after hundreds of thousands
demonstrated in 50 Spanish cities to protest against the government's plans
to reduce dismissal costs and remove rigidities from domestic labour
legislation. The unions are now considering a 24-hour national stoppage
before Christmas.
Officials said the prime minister would meet both sides on Thursday but the
cabinet still planned to draft emergency labour market legislation next
week. Talks between the government and the unions yesterday and between the
government and employers the day before have failed to establish a consensus
on what Mr Gonzalez has termed a 'social pact' to restore competitiveness
and reduce unemployment.
The urgent need for initiatives to rekindle the economy was underlined by a
sharp rise in unemployment between July and September which pushed the
jobless total up to 3.5m, or 22.9 per cent of the working population.
Figures for the three monthly employment survey conducted by the national
statistics institute showed that 150,000 more Spaniards were seeking a job
at the end of the third quarter.
According to separate monthly data released by the labour ministry, which
does not include first time job seekers, 96,000 signed on for unemployment
benefits in October, raising the total number registered as jobless by the
ministry to 2.6m or 17.2 per cent of the working population. October saw the
highest monthly rise since 1982.
The government plans to reduce unemployment by introducing part-time labour
contracts and apprenticeship schemes as part of its emergency package. The
unions view such initiatives as undermining the fixed employment guidelines
of the domestic labour legislation. A government proposal to speed up
redundancy procedures is meanwhile termed as 'too weak' by the employers and
as 'a provocation' by the unions.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Mercury victims win court battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese district court yesterday ruled that government can be held liable
for industrial pollution, setting an important precedent in environmental
law.
The court, in Kyoto, awarded damages of Y193m (Pounds 1.2m) to 38 people who
suffered mercury poisoning 37 years ago in a disaster has become a symbol of
Japan's environmental conscience.
It was caused when a factory owned by Chisso, a chemicals group, pumped
polluted sludge into the sea near Minamata, a southern Japanese fishing
village in the prefecture where Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister,
later became governor.
It was not until eight years ago that the victims managed to bring their
case to court. Out of 141 plaintiffs, eight have died waiting for Japan's
tortuously slow legal system to produce an answer, and one has withdrawn.
This was despite Mr Hosokawa's efforts to obtain a quick out-of-court
settlement during his tenure as governor of Kumamoto prefecture.
The Kyoto court yesterday ruled that the prefectural and national
governments, as well as Chisso, failed to take proper action to prevent the
outbreak and spread of so-called Minamata disease, paralysis caused by
eating fish poisoned with mercury.
The main points at issue were whether government could be declared negligent
and whether the victims really were suffering from mercury poisoning.
Friday's was the fifth such court ruling concerning the mercury poisoning.
The ruling affected only 46 plaintiffs. Other separate cases are still
pending.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Hosokawa still voters' favourite
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The popularity of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet continues to defy economic
gravity, according to a poll published yesterday.
A survey of 2,149 people by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper gave the cabinet
73.5 per cent support. This is up a fraction from a month ago, during which
time Japan's recession has deepened.
The public shows no signs yet of blaming the divided seven-party coalition
for failing to respond to widespread calls for a decisive step, such as an
income tax cut, to stimulate the economy.
The prime minister's own party, the Japan New Party, saw a nearly full
percentage point increase in popularity from September to October, to 15.5
per cent, making it Japan's second most popular party.
This is likely to reflect the straight-talking Mr Hosokawa's personal
appeal, rather than his party's policies. The JNP supports liberalisation of
the rice market, controversial with a large slice of the electorate, and
otherwise pursues much the same policies as the opposition LDP.
Over the same period, the LDP's popularity has risen slightly from 23.8 per
cent to 24 per cent, the highest score by a single party. This suggests,
oddly, that the LDP has lost no support as a result of its humiliating
defeat over the government's political reform plans in the lower house of
parliament, two days before the Yomiuri poll was taken.
In an indication of just how fluid Japanese politics has become since the
LDP's fall from power last July, yesterday's poll shows that 35.2 per cent
of respondents support no party.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Brazil tries to wipe out deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil yesterday unveiled its toughest planned budget cuts in recent memory
as finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso pledged once again to
tackle the country's annual inflation rate of close to 2,000 per cent.
Mr Cardoso outlined spending cuts and revenue measures to wipe out a
projected Dollars 22.2bn deficit and balance next year's budget. The main
savings will come from the government's personnel budget, which Mr Cardoso
hoped to cut by Dollars 3.74bn, and from the transfer to local government of
spending on health and basic education. This will save the federal
government up to Dollars 8.4bn.
'There has probably never been a government attempt like this in this
country to erase a budget deficit,' Mr Cardoso said. Brazil's budget deficit
has in the past been covered by the government's inflationary practice of
issuing short-term securities. Mr Cardoso said this would no longer happen.
The budget, which will be formally presented to President Itamar Franco and
Congress next week, is expected to be the first of several measures to be
announced over the coming months designed to try to stabilise the country's
economy.
There is speculation Mr Cardoso will next week announce a new price index.
This would be seen as the first step towards linking wage and price
increases to the exchange rate which it is hoped would bring inflation down
next year.
The budget won cautious backing from the government's coalition partners.
But analysts pointed out that some of the spending cuts would be unpopular
and difficult to implement, especially with presidential and congressional
elections next year.
For example, one of Mr Cardoso's proposals would give the central government
greater influence over money which otherwise goes straight to states and
municipalities which may block the proposal, which needs a constitutional
amendment to become law.
Mr Cardoso will also rely on congressional approval for a planned increase
of 5 per centage points in all income taxes to give a new top rate of 35 per
cent.
The budget is partly designed to please the International Monetary Fund
which is holding off approving a restructuring of Brazil's commercial
foreign debt until the country can demonstrate it is tackling its economic
problems.
A balanced budget is thought to be one of several key requirements the IMF
wants before it will approve the restructuring deal.
Even though the IMF has yet to approve the deal, Mr Cardoso is due to start
signing the restructuring agreement with Brazil's private bank creditors on
Monday in Toronto. He is expected to announce the next steps in his economic
programme when he returns to Brazil next week.
Other measures to be announced included a 3 per cent tax on overseas fund
raising, such as bond issues. This was designed to stop speculative foreign
investment flows.
Also, a recent surge in foreign investment had inflationary effects because
Brazil's central bank is still obliged to buy all foreign currency coming
into the country, and issue local currency as payment.

FT  27 NOV 93 / CIS peace-keeping tops CSCE agenda: The organisation seeking
a new framework for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign ministers from the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe (CSCE) meet in Rome next week to push forward the complex task of
building a new co-operative framework for a Europe no longer divided into
blocs but still beset by ancient fears and resurgent historical rivalries.
Top of the agenda will be discussion of the latest EU-inspired peace plan
for Bosnia, Russian efforts to gain western support for Russian and CIS
'peace-keeping' missions in Trans-Caucasus and central Asia and a review of
the other fault-lines of post-cold war Europe.
The CSCE originated in the 1970s as a Soviet-inspired proposal to legalise
and formalise the post-war division of cold war Europe. It helped instead to
end that division by the west's insistence on the inclusion of human and
civil rights in the so-called 'Basket 3' of the CSCE Helsinki Final Act
signed in 1975.
The end of the cold war was celebrated in November 1990 at the CSCE heads of
government summit in Paris with signature of the Charter of Paris.
Prematurely, the charter proclaimed 'a new era of democracy, peace and
unity'. But a few months later war broke out in former Yugoslavia and the
Soviet Union disintegrated into its 15 component republics.
The former Soviet states were admitted into the CSCE at the Prague meeting
of foreign ministers in January 1992. The CSCE writ runs therefore way
beyond Europe. It extends from Vancouver to Vladivostok, taking in Siberia
and the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union as well as the
transatlantic Nato bastions, the US and Canada.
Its remit likewise has broadened. The Paris summit agreed to set up its own
secretariat, a Conflict Prevention Centre, based in Vienna, and an Office
for Democratic Institutions and Human rights based in Warsaw. But it has
only minuscule bureaucratic back-up and a revolving chairmanship.
In short it is a friendly, well-intentioned but unwieldly creature. But it
is charged, rather like the UN itself, with an impossible variety of
difficult tasks thrown up by the re-emergence of ethnic and historical
rivalries.
Many of its members, while mildly grateful for the psychological reassurance
which CSCE membership provides, would much prefer to be full members of a
security organisation like the West European Union (WEU) or Nato.
The CSCE's inability to prevent the violation of all its principles by the
warring forces in former Yugoslavia remains a perpetual source of
embarrassment. At the same time however conflict in the Balkans has spurred
the CSCE into devising ways of calling on Nato and the European Union to
provide muscle for the CSCE's peace-keeping aims.
A set of conflict prevention/crisis management measures were at the heart of
the final document, entitled 'The Challenges of Change', approved at the
Helsinki summit in July 1992. This empowered the CSCE to call on Nato, the
WEU and others to help with peacekeeping. A new Forum for Security
Co-operation was set up with a mandate covering arms control, disarmament
and security building.
Since then, however, deep divisions within the EU, and between the Europeans
and the Americans in Nato, have revealed how thin these institutional
arrangements are.
Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, created a minor
panic at the last meeting of foreign ministers in Stockholm a year ago when
he made a spoof speech purporting to signal a sea-change in Russian foreign
policy back to the confrontational 'nyet' politics of the Soviet past. The
minister has been more circumspect in the run-up to this week's Rome
meeting. But his message remains essentially the same.
Russia wants, and feels it deserves, western moral support and financial
assistance to help Moscow shoulder the burden of peace-keeping in the
Eurasian landmass, and especially along the ethnic and religious fault-lines
of the trans-Caucasus and central Asian regions.
In an October speech in London, Mr Kozyrev reinforced his argument by adding
'No substitute for our efforts here is in sight. . . Russia's withdrawal
from its peace-keeping role would threaten the former Soviet Union with a
Yugoslav scenario.'
It is an argument which cuts little ice with the Baltic states, still
battling to get Russian troops and installations out of Latvia and Estonia.
But in some west European chancelleries support is growing for carefully
monitored, case-by-case, western backing for CIS peacekeeping activities,
together with the dispatch of small teams of western observers to monitor
the modalities.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Mediterranean Eurocorps under discussion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France, Italy and Spain are discussing the creation of a southern
'Eurocorps' to maintain security in the Mediterranean region, a senior
military officer said, David Buchan writes from Paris.
The plan follows their recent 'Ardente' troop exercise in Italy, and is
designed to complement the increasing number of joint manoeuvres by the
three countries' navies and air forces.
The scheme has been forwarded to the Western European Union, defence wing of
the new European Union, as a formal initiative by Italy. 'The idea is to try
to find a formula to bring together rapid deployment units of the three
countries,' the officer said.
It was unlikely to be a copy of the Strasbourg-based Eurocorps, which is to
have some 40,000 French, German and Belgian troops at its disposal by 1995,
but 'perhaps a common command structure'.
France, Italy and Spain are already working, through the WEU, to
institutionalise their naval co-operation in the Mediterranean in the form
of 'pre-planning' for emergencies.
Behind the scheme is the realisation, particularly on the part of France,
that the Strasbourg-based Eurocorps will be ill-suited for rapid mobile
operations outside Europe. First, it is composed largely of heavy units
designed for battle on the central European front, and second, there are
still political, if not constitutional, constraints on German forces' range
of action.
Spain is considering joining the Eurocorps, and once that decision is taken,
the Strasbourg-based force will be of a satisfactory size and membership,
the officer said. There is no expectation in Paris that Britain or the
Netherlands might join the Strasbourg unit.
'One day there might be a Eurocorps 2, a Eurocorps 3, particularly if the US
continues to pull its troops out of Europe,' said the officer.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Moscow to condemn nationalism

<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian foreign minister is expected to ask the 52-nation Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe to adopt a resolution condemning
'aggressive nationalism' at the one-time cold war negotiating body's annual
meeting in Rome next week.
The Russian diplomatic initiative, unveiled in Moscow this week by Foreign
Ministry officials, is the latest move by the Kremlin to establish a more
muscular Russian presence in the 'near abroad', as Russians describe the
other former Soviet republics.
In the same vein, Russian resistance to an extension of membership of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to eastern Europe hardened yesterday when
a presidential spokesman said that Mr Yeltsin agreed with the harsh attack
on the notion of an expanded Nato delivered by Mr Yevgeny Primakov, the head
of the Russian intelligence agency, earlier in the week.
By proposing that the CSCE adopt a resolution on 'aggressive nationalism' Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, is seeking international
legitimacy for his pledge this month to take tough action to defend the
rights of ethnic Russians everywhere in the former Soviet Union.
The new, tougher Russian stance could first be put to the test by Latvia,
which yesterday passed the first reading of a restrictive law on
citizenship. The controversial legislation establishes quotas on the number
of new citizens the country will naturalise every year.
Currently only 66 per cent of Latvia's 2.7m inhabitants are citizens. To
qualify for citizenship the rest of the population, mainly Russians brought
in to the republic after the second world war and their descendants, must
demonstrate a conversational knowledge of Latvian and fulfil a 10-year
residence requirement.
Mr Guntis Ulmanis, the Latvian president, justifies this restrictive
legislation on the grounds that 'we could have a demographic explosion. The
threat of our extinction forces us to take this step.'
The new hard line in Russian foreign policy was also in evidence yesterday
when Moscow raised the stakes in its struggle with Kiev over the nuclear
weapons stationed on Ukrainian soil.
The Russian cabinet threatened to stop servicing the nuclear weapons in
Ukraine in retaliation for the Ukrainian parliament's decision this month to
surrender only a part of its nuclear arsenal. The missiles could become
unstable.

FT  27 NOV 93 / General strike paralyses Belgium: Nationwide stoppage aims
at reversing new austerity plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium yesterday was brought to a virtual standstill by a one-day general
strike - the first for 58 years - aimed at rolling back the austerity plan
announced last week by the Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition
government.
The action comes after localised strikes launched by the two main trade
unions on November 15 and 24. It is is the first general strike in Belgium
since 1936, when workers halted the country to demand a week's paid holiday
a year.
The two main targets of the unions are a BFr75bn (Pounds 1.4bn) cut in
forecast social security expenditure and a pay increase limit of 2 per cent
for the next three years, which amounts to a freeze on wages once inflation
is taken into account.
The public sector was almost totally paralysed yesterday, with the railways,
post office, and schools all mostly shut down, and skeleton staffing of
hospitals.
Most large private industry was at a halt. In Namur and Liege, even the
police came out in sympathy. Sabena, the struggling national airline,
claimed two thirds of its employees were at work and reported delays but
only two cancellations because of fog.
The port of Antwerp was at a standstill, according to the Belga news agency.
This was partly the result of effective use of flying pickets, which kept
such companies as BASF, Bayer, and General Motors closed, and early
yesterday blocked traffic using the southern approaches to Brussels.
The Belgian employers' federation put the cost of this week's strikes at
BFr12bn, which they said was equivalent to 11,000 jobs over a year.
The BFr75bn saving, achieved by making eligibility for items such as child
allowances dependent on income levels, is intended to keep the social
security budget in balance.
Had the government of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene not made it, officials and
economists expected renewed pressures on the Belgian franc, because of the
budget deficit of over 6 per cent and unsustainable public debt equivalent
to 130 per cent of national output.
The franc, which shadows the D-Mark, has been severely tested by the markets
since the August 2 European Union decision to float currencies in the
European exchange rate mechanism within wide bands.
The wage freeze was as far as the centre-left coalition could go without
risk of collapse, even though leading economists point out that pay has
increased much faster than productivity over the past three years. The
unions and, initially, the Socialist members of the government wanted to
offset the cuts and the wage freeze by increases in property tax and
withholding tax on investment income.
Mr Dehaene has offered to meet the unions but shows no signs of backing away
from the austerity package.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Pressure on US and EU grows for tariff cuts deal

Pressure mounted yesterday on the US and the European Union to agree a
detailed package of tariff cuts in manufactured goods and farm products next
week, as representatives of the 116 nations engaged in the Uruguay Round of
talks on global trade liberalisation met in Geneva.
A meeting of all trade negotiators, held just 19 days ahead of the December
15 deadline for completing the seven-year negotiations, was repeatedly told
that a top-level EU-US meeting in Brussels next Wednesday 'must reach a
substantive result'.
The Brussels meeting follows two days of talks in Washington this week
between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan,
his EU counterpart. These were described as constructive, but produced no
specific agreement.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, complained yesterday: 'Constructive meetings are no substitute
for concrete results.'
He wants a clear outcome from the US and the EU by Wednesday so Gatt can
complete by the end of the week a market access package embracing all 116
countries. 'We cannot afford further delay without jeopardising the round,'
he said.
At the Geneva meeting, successive ambassadors complained of the difficulties
being created by the US-EU delay, and by a handful of last-minute changes
called for by the US in sensitive areas like anti-dumping policy, financial
services, and internationally-even-handed tax treatment.
'The world is waiting for a market access package from the US and the EU in
Brussels next week,' said Mr Don Kenyon, Australia's Gatt ambassador.
Mr Tran van Thinh, his EU counterpart, acknowledged the need for the US and
EU to settle differences. He said that in spite of the difficulties faced by
the community in terms of decision making, it was making every effort to
reach a market access agreement by next week: 'The US and the EU do indeed
shoulder a heavy responsibility for conclusion of the Uruguay Round.'
Delegates were digesting a list of proposed US changes to a text
disciplining the use of anti-dumping laws, with most signalling strong
opposition to the changes. Mr John Schmidt, the chief US Gatt negotiator,
insisted that the US 'had approached this issue in a spirit of restraint'
but noted that it was a matter of enormous importance in the US. Mr
Sutherland called for all negotiations to be effectively completed by
December 13, allowing translators to prepare texts of a prospective Uruguay
Round agreement for approval at a meeting of all negotiators on December 15.

FT  27 NOV 93 / French drugs chief calls for new regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France requires a new industrial policy for its pharmaceuticals sector, said
Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, president of Elf-Sanofi, yesterday. The company,
France's second largest drugs group is a subsidiary of state-owned Elf
Aquitaine, the oil concern due to be privatised at the beginning of next
year, Paul Abrahams writes.
French drugs groups' profitability over the last 20 years had been
negligible compared with those of British or American companies, said Mr
Dehecq.
'The lack of success has not been due to lack of innovation. Prices in
France have been too low. There is no other reason for it. We must have a
new convention between government and industry,' he told the Financial
Times.
Mr Dehecq said the government must pay higher prices for innovative
products. To compensate for additional spending on new products, it was
imperative a way was found to lower the prices of older drugs. The
possibility of reducing the number of prescriptions should also be
addressed.
The government understood that innovation had to be rewarded and was leaning
in this direction, added Mr Dehecq. Snip, the French pharmaceuticals
manufacturers association, expects to conclude negotiations aimed at holding
back drugs spending growth.
France spends more per capita on drugs than any other European country.
During the first six months this year, it spent Dollars 108 (Pounds 72.40)
per head, compared with Dollars 46 in the UK. French doctors prescribe five
times as many items as British doctors and six times as many as their Danish
counterparts. However, French prices are among the lowest in Europe.
The French market was the world's third largest last year, worth Dollars
12.26bn. For the first three quarters this year it grew 6 per cent,
according to IMS International, the market research group.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Ministers raise hopes of Budget for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government launched a concerted ministerial drive yesterday to deliver
an upbeat message over Britain's economic prospects, raising hopes that
Tuesday's Budget will focus on boosting the recovery.
The campaign followed a favourable City response to Thursday's Commons hint
from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that tax rises will fall on
consumers rather than business.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed 18.3 points higher at 3,111.4, reflecting a
widespread judgment that Mr Clarke's comments presage a Budget aimed at
increasing industrial production.
The impression left by the chancellor was reinforced in a series of
ministerial speeches on the economy co-ordinated by Conservative central
office.
The campaign reinforced growing confidence among Tory MPs that Mr Clarke's
main aim will be to stimulate industry and speed up the fall in
unemployment.
It was led by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, backed by several
senior ministers.
Sir Norman told Conservatives in Worcester that economic recovery was 'well
under way'. He said the government would ensure it was 'sustained and
sustainable', and that it was not undermined by new costs on business or a
spiralling budget deficit.
The upbeat message was underlined by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, who
said in Dymchurch: 'Britain is bouncing back, leading Europe out of
recession, so the Budget will be building on fundamental economic strength.'
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, told Eddisbury Tories: 'The sure way to
jeopardise our recovery is to impose new regulatory burdens on business.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (16): College will seek university
status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a county, there is no substitute for having the kudos of a university,
and Gloucestershire lacks one. But, all being well, by the start of the
academic year in 1994, it will have.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education, which already has
degree-awarding status, is preparing its application. To qualify, the
college has to satisfy the Higher Education Quality Council that it meets
the criteria for awarding research degrees and has sufficient numbers of
research degree students.
It will decide before Christmas on the timing of its bid. Mr David Soutter,
assistant director, finance, says: 'We will only apply once we are confident
we are going to get it. We want to be absolutely sure in our own minds that
we meet all the criteria, and then we will put forward a firm application.
If a bid is made early in 1994, we could be a university by the start of the
academic year.'
The college is recruiting staff with research-degree supervision experience,
and providing facilities. 'We also have to demonstrate a research culture,
which means having appropriate programmes for development of our own staff,'
says Mr Soutter.
'As of today, we have some 40-plus research degree students and over 30
part-time, and that's a significant increase on this time last year. It
represents a shift in the balance of our student population to an increasing
emphasis on post-graduate research and post-graduate students.'
The college was formed in 1990, as the result of a merger between the
College of St Paul &amp; St Mary and the higher education courses of
Gloucestershire College of Arts &amp; Technology. Now, it has 5,200 full-time
students, just under 2,000 part-time and another 1,000 on leisure or
continuing education courses.
About 20 per cent of the total are mature students, and more than half are
female. Between 30 and 40 per cent of the students come from within the
county.
The college has strong links with industry, although some business people
consider it weak on the engineering and science side. But Mr Soutter says:
'There is not a strong demand for us to produce graduates in technological
and engineering subjects. The reality is that the major employers are not
recruiting large numbers of these graduates.'
The areas where the college regards itself as strong are in business
management, computing, media, arts, fashion and design, and in all aspects
of the environment and landscape. 'There is a very good fit with the
economic areas of strength in the county,' says Mr Soutter. 'We are also
strong in English and history; that fits well with the strong historical
sense in the Cotswold area.'
The college, which regards itself as a national leader in school-based
teacher training, has a vocational bias. Mr Soutter explains: 'Even in our
academic subjects, it's an important part of our modular degree structure
that we develop transferable skills for all students, so that they are able
to adapt quickly to their chosen field.'
As part of its expansion, the college is midway through a Pounds 30m
building programme in Cheltenham, funded out of asset sales and Pounds 8m of
borrowings. Two new premises were opened this year, one for hotel and
catering management, and another for work in landscape architecture. A media
centre is to be opened by Mr David Puttnam, the film producer, next
Thursday. A multi-purpose complex including 21 lecture rooms and a student
union will open next October.
The college has a Church of England ethos, reflecting the history of the
College of St Paul &amp; St Mary, which was founded in 1847 by religious leaders
to train teachers. 'We very much try to have that ethos as part of the
college's mission and strategy,' says Mr Soutter. 'It is reflected in the
range of courses and is why, for example, we are strong in teacher training
and religious education.
'It is why we attach a lot of importance in our modular degree structure to
the right of the individual to have control over his or her course. It's why
there is a strong emphasis on support mechanisms for students, such as
counselling. And we try to make ourselves accessible to the whole community,
rather than just being education for the privileged.'
The college is in the process of launching a sponsorship and development
campaign. Mr Soutter says: 'We are receiving very strong support in getting
that off the ground from businesses, although clearly what they are looking
for is being associated with a university. We expect those links to come
through as the college moves towards university status.'
One undecided matter is what it should then be called, although 'University
of Gloucestershire' or 'of the Cotswolds' are obvious possibilities. The
final decision will rest with the Privy Council.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (15): Investors in people -
Training / the Tec's programme has received huge support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gloucestershire Training and Enterprise Council has attracted countrywide
attention for its success with the Investors in People programme, which
encourages organisations to achieve a nationally agreed standard for
training and developing staff.
Mr Graham Hoyle, chief executive of the Tec, which was ranked among the top
10 of England's 75 Tecs when the government published performance tables in
September, describes IiP as 'central and critical to our mission'.
Since the IiP programme was launched two years ago, a total of 373 local
organisations - including schools, colleges and businesses ranging from
those with just a few staff to some of the county's largest - have dedicated
themselves to achieving the IiP award. They cover about 40,000 employees -
or one in five of the county's workforce.
Mr John Hazelwood, the Tec's chairman, has pointed out that the number of
committed organisations is more than the total in Scotland and Wales
combined. To date, the IiP award has been gained by 15 Gloucestershire-based
companies, including Birds Eye Wall's, of which Mr Hazelwood is general
manager, and which has the largest ice-cream factory in Europe.
The Tec expects that, by March, the number committed to IiP will have risen
to 500. Mr Hoyle has an evangelical view of the programme. Schemes for the
unemployed, he says, have a very marginal effect in improving the overall
skills base of the workforce, and what is needed is to improve the skills of
the vast majority who are in work.
'We have taken a very pragmatic approach to up-skill the county,' he says.
'We realised we had a difficult issue. We wanted to see the skills base
raised of the employed workforce, but there was no money for this from the
government. The only route was to persuade employers that it was in their
financial interest to invest in training their workforce.'
In recessionary times, when companies are more likely to shed than recruit
workers, it can be even more difficult to persuade them to spend money on
training. But Mr Hoyle says there is no inconsistency in training people who
might subsequently be made redundant.
'It is very, very simple. A company is making an absolute commitment
systematically to develop and train its workforce. That workforce will go up
and down, but IiP says that, no matter what is the company's trading
position or size, we are committing ourselves to training everyone.'
A substantial part of the Tec's resources has been channelled into the
programme. Of the Tec's total budget of Pounds 13.5m, it invested Pounds
750,000 last year in IiP with technical support, providing up to 50 per cent
of employers' costs.
This year, the funding is less, between Pounds 550,000 and Pounds 600,000.
'A deliberate decision was made that, having created a critical mass last
year, we did not need the same kind of unit cost per company to keep the
programme, and that's proving to be the case,' says Mr Hoyle. 'We are now
able to bring companies on, and start to drive them through the process, at
a much lower cost than last year.'
He adds: 'No company is going to go down this track unless they have a
pretty good feeling it will benefit them financially. It would be mad to go
down that route, and to put energy into what is a demanding programme,
unless there was a tangible benefit from it.' He describes IiP as a
statement of sound management practice - that companies need to look at
their most valuable and expensive asset, their staff.
Another evangelical supporter of IiP is Ms Sam Elliott, owner of the 23-bed
Grapevine Hotel at Stow-on-the-Wold and a board member of Investors in
People UK, launched this year by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, to
promote the programme. She describes how gaining the award has given the
staff a heightened motivation, which has shown up in the bottom line:
'In one year, we have turned our position round from feeling financially
threatened in the midst of recession to being secure in the knowledge that
we are controlling our present and future position in the marketplace.'
Another company which has gained the award is Signet Armorlite Europe, in
Gloucester, which supplies ophthalmic lenses. 'We want people to be
achievers,' says Mr Nelson Hawkes, managing director. 'If they are achievers
they are happier, more productive, more able to see the company's success as
their own success.'
A printing company committed to the programme is Cooper Clegg, of
Tewkesbury, which employs nearly 150 people. Mr Ian Cooper, its chairman,
says that, despite a lack of financial support for the costs, he strongly
supports the programme. 'I cannot exaggerate how important I think it is in
keeping people motivated.'
PMC, a Cheltenham management consultancy with 16 staff, which is seeking the
award, says the programme has created a 'disciplined and repeating cycle' of
commitment, planning, action and evaluation, which are the main principles
of the IiP standard.
A much larger company which already has the award is Renishaw, the maker of
precision measuring equipment, based at Wotton-under-Edge with 500
employees. 'Companies should naturally look to improve their assets, and
people are a highly valuable asset,' says Mr John Oldham, its personnel
officer. 'IiP is absolutely important to help us develop in all directions.
It is the basis for the future.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (14): Facing up to 'kerb appeal' /
Profile of Farmington Stone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditional rural industries, including quarrying, have suffered a sharp
decline in recent years, but one Gloucestershire company has bucked the
trend dramatically.
Farmington Stone, in the heart of the Cotswolds east of Cheltenham, has seen
demand for its products surge. It has exported paving stones to Beirut and
fireplaces to Hong Kong and Dallas, as well as supplying housebuilders and
the construction industry in the UK with its honey-coloured local stone.
The quarry, part of a 1,000-acre estate, was acquired in 1902 by the
grandfather of the present owner, Capt John Barrow, and run for years as a
profitable but minor sideline. 'It ticked along perfectly happily, with half
a dozen men, waiting for people to walk through the door and place an
order,' says Capt Barrow.
Then, in 1987 it was decided to give more attention to stone production,
when European Community regulations made farming less profitable. The timing
was ideal, because there was growing demand for stone of all kinds as the
boom in domestic and prestige public building gathered pace.
Over Pounds 500,000 was invested in new workshops, offices, quarrying and
processing equipment in order to increase output, improve quality and widen
the product range. There are now six mobile mini production lines in the
middle of the quarry.
The recent recession brought its problems, particularly in the construction
industry, where contracts dried up and there were payment difficulties
especially from the bigger contractors.
New markets had to be developed, and two were specifically targeted:
housebuilding and decorative products, such as paving stones, flooring,
fireplaces and garden statues.
Although housebuilding went through a notoriously difficult patch, demand
has soared in recent months, partly because of a general improvement in the
market and partly because of a change in perceptions towards natural stone.
Mr Martin Robins, managing director of Farmington Stone, argues that
builders, architects and housebuyers have had to be educated into accepting
that stone, traditionally regarded as expensive, need add very little to the
cost of a house. 'We estimate it adds around 1 per cent but greatly
increases what is called the kerb appeal of a house,' he says.
The market for stone facing has 'really taken off' in the last few months,
helped by the increased influence of the green lobby and the emphasis on the
use of natural products.
There has also been a big growth in sales of flagstones and fireplace
surrounds through retailers and a sales force of 30, and these decorative
products now account for around 50 per cent of turnover.
The limestone quarry, in use since Roman times, has sufficient reserves of
good stone to last a further 50 years at the present rate of extraction of
an acre every five years. But there is one big problem. 'We could take on 20
more workers and run shifts round the clock for seven days to fulfil orders,
but we can't get the people,' says Mr Robins.
The difficulty is location. Farmington is miles from anywhere, is not served
by public transport, and pays local wages for labouring work. Nevertheless,
it is ironic that in a county that faces growing employment difficulties as
rural and defence industries run down, the job offers have no takers.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (11): Farming jobs wither - The
Cotswolds face economic problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economy of the Cotswolds, one of the most picturesque parts of England,
has been hit in recent years by two factors: changes in the structure and
needs of agriculture, and a decline in defence industries.
To meet the growing problems, a Countryside Employment Programme (CEP) was
set up 18 months ago, as one of three pilot schemes to help vulnerable
farming areas cope with change in the 1990s. An assessment has now been
made, and a package of measures proposed.
It is estimated that accelerating changes in agriculture and defence could
account for at least 600 job losses in the Cotswolds over the next three
years. In an area with a relatively low rural population spread thinly
through dozens of villages and small towns, this will have a devastating
impact on the local economy if alternative employment is not found.
The assessment, conducted for the CEP by Shankland Cox and Gould
Consultants, estimates that 30 per cent of farms are likely to reduce
staffing in response to changes in the common agricultural policy and other
factors. These redundancies will occur mainly on large farms which are
marginal for cereal production.
Over the last 10 years, the numbers employed on farms have fallen by an
average of 5 per cent a year. This is likely to continue, in addition to the
impact of the EC reforms and the Gatt negotiations.
The fall-out from defence restructuring on the CEP area, which covers
Cotswold district council, in Gloucestershire, and West Oxfordshire district
council, will be felt through the rundown and closure of Ministry of Defence
establishments and reduced defence spending. In Gloucestershire, the impact
will come largely from a drop in orders to defence manufacturing companies
in Cheltenham and Gloucester.
The area has experienced a sharp rise in unemployment over the last two
years, and long-term unemployment is a particular problem, with 40 per cent
out of work for more than six months. A third of the unemployed are in their
twenties.
The aims of the CEP, a three-year programme led by the Rural Development
Commission in partnership with local councils, training and enterprise
councils and other bodies, is to stimulate job creation, training and
community development.
This means that substantial economic adjustment is inevitable, involving the
diversification of businesses, encouraging new ones, backing innovation
development and expansion, and promoting inward investment. Much of the
initiative will come from the private sector, but public sector
organisations will be expected to facilitate the process of adaptation and
growth.
Mr Len Smith, project manager of the Cotswold CEP, says that, because there
is a steady drip effect of job losses (rather than the sudden impact of a
colliery or steelworks closure), few people have appreciated the scale of
the local problem.
He sees the answer in a package of proposals now being developed, including
diversification by farmers away from agriculture, the development of
tourism, and encouragement for existing local businesses to expand.
'Emphasis is usually placed on business start-ups, but that can be an
expensive high-risk strategy,' says Mr Smith. 'I prefer to back existing
businesses that already have a track record. Job creation is quicker, and
you get stability of employment.'
A pilot scheme is being launched this month to subsidise employer-led
training groups. It is available to all rural businesses and pays up to 50
per cent of training needs assessment.
There is also a proposal to employ a business adviser, who would pick 30
local small businesses as potential winners and give them financial,
management and consultancy help. The scheme should be launched in January.
The greatest potential probably lies in the development of tourism, where
the target is to create around 1,500 jobs over the next three years. The
area is already a well known tourist attraction, and parts can get crowded
in the summer; but research shows that most visitors pass through en route
from London or Oxford to Stratford-upon-Avon, the Midlands and the north,
and that very few stay.
The intention is to encourage development of good quality accommodation, to
ensure that more visitors stay in the area and spend more. Mr Smith believes
there are good prospects for combined part-time jobs in tourism and
agriculture. 'I find that farmers can cram more cars in per acre than an NCP
attendant ever can.'
The plan is to extend the network of walks, cycle tracks and bridle paths,
and to concentrate on short breaks and activity holidays.
Plans are also in hand for the provision of better bus services, to
encourage mobility, more creches to enable women with young children to
return to work, and the development of teleworking, so that more people can
work from home or in their own village.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (12): Wool mill's well-knit
descendants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A parable for industrial change can be found at Nailsworth, in a deep wooded
valley in the south Cotswolds.
Once, there was a woollen mill, part of the local textiles industry which
faded. In 1879, when the mill closed, it became a fibreboard factory,
employing at one time 500 people. But that market declined in the 1960s and
1970s, and this, too, closed in 1981. Then, the site became an industrial
estate.
EA Chamberlain (Holdings), the property development company which owns and
manages the Nailsworth Mills Estate, as it is now called, is run by the same
family that owned the board mill. Today, there are as many people as in the
mill's heyday on the 20-acre site. The estate includes a Somerfield
supermarket, a planned garden centre, and an extraordinary range of other
enterprises.
There is Phoenix Walking Stalks, which employs five people and makes
umbrella handles and no fewer than 120,000 walking sticks a year, most of
them for the National Health Service. About four times a year, Mr John
Faulkner, its managing director, visits sweet chestnut coppices to buy the
wood. The most modern piece of technology is a microwave oven used in the
drying process.
A bigger employer, with 25 people, is QS (Enamellers &amp; Polishers), which
coats and polishes metals. It has a 90ft. powder-coating oven big enough to
walk through, if it weren't for the fact that the temperature is 200 degrees
celsius. The company handles everything from balustrading and steel-mesh
partitioning to car chassis and roof racks. Before the recession, it
employed 45 people, but it was particularly hard-hit by the loss of its
biggest customer.
Then there is Fluid Transfer, an engineering company which employs nearly
100 people making the vehicles which refuel aircraft. Another, Vaccar, makes
milking equipment, employing 12 on the estate. A recent arrival is Plastics
Engineering, set up 19 months ago by just three people. 'From the moment we
opened our doors it has gone off like a rocket,' says director Mr David
Stallon.
Another successful newcomer is Selsey Herbs, run by Gillian and Peter
Wimperis, who supply packed herbs, spices and pot-pourri to stores and have
started exporting. They say turnover doubled in 1992, compared with the
previous year. When they advertised last month for someone with the esoteric
skills of calligraphy to letter gift-boxes, they expected one or two
applications but had no fewer than 13.
EA Chamberlain is headed by Mr John Chamberlain, grandson of the board
company's founder. The vice-chairman is his son James, who is also director
of a small Gloucestershire company recently set up to sell its own
invention, the Rako Miniveyor, a portable conveyor for the building trade.
EA Chamberlain is seeking a tenant for the estate's largest industrial unit.
A 30,000 sq ft purpose-built factory, it will be alongside one reminder of
past days: a still well-patronised bowling green.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (13): Loss of aid status is a blow
 -The Forest of Dean remains industrially vulnerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Forest of Dean, although part of Gloucestershire, is significantly
detached from the rest of the county by its geography, history and economic
traditions, and it has to come to terms with very different problems in the
1990s.
Unlike other parts of the county, which have an agricultural tradition, the
forest has played a largely industrial role in an attractive rural setting
of former royal hunting forests.
Its recent history highlights the long-standing vulnerability of the local
economy, which has been heavily committed at various times to industrial
sectors that have performed badly or disappeared altogether.
Iron has been mined and smelted since pre-Roman times and the coalfield was
heavily exploited in the last century. In 1944, 55 per cent of the workforce
was in mining and 26 per cent in steel and engineering, but both industries
went into decline and the last deep pit closed at the end of 1965.
Attempts at diversification included the move by British Acoustic Films into
an old brewery site at Mitcheldean. The company was taken over by Bell &amp;
Howell, the US film camera manufacturers, which in turn was acquired by the
Rank Organisation. This turned out to be a stroke of good fortune for the
local economy.
Rank Xerox, formed in 1956, by Rank and the Xerox Corporation of the US,
started copier production at Mitcheldean in 1959. By the mid-1970s, it was
employing nearly 5,000, mostly at Mitcheldean but also at Cinderford and
Lydney. In the early 1980s, came the double blow of recession and the expiry
of the Rank Xerox patents. Competition from Japan was intense, and Rank
Xerox was forced to cut production. Employment was down to 1,200 by the
mid-1980s.
With vacant space at its 67-acre manufacturing site, Rank Xerox then created
a business park and enterprise workshops, to attract a wider variety of
employment. Among the organisations now on the Mitcheldean site are an
electronics company and a software manufacturer.
Rank Xerox remains the largest employer with a current workforce of around
1,800. Its commitment to the forest was underlined in 1990, when the
company's electronics manufacturing was relocated from Welwyn. Mitcheldean
is now the company's European manufacturing centre for electronics, wiring
assemblies and fused rolls.
Rising unemployment in the early 1980s, which reached 16.8 per cent in the
Cinderford and Ross-on-Wye travel-to-work areas, led to the forest receiving
assisted-area status in 1984. The benefits, including regional selective
assistance and access to European regional development funds, restored some
confidence, and unemployment fell below 5 per cent.
But there remains a narrow industrial base, heavily dependent on the
manufacturing sector and on a small number of medium-sized employers. These
include Smith Kline Beecham, Engelhard Industries, Lydmet (formerly British
Piston Ring), and SCA (formerly Reed Packaging). Unemployment has recently
crept back above 10 per cent.
A big blow was struck to the fragile recovery last summer, when
assisted-area status was not renewed. A particular worry has been the growth
in the number of people having to go outside the forest area for work,
particularly to defence- and aerospace-related jobs elsewhere in the county.
It is feared that these will inevitably be reduced as defence spending is
cut.
Another fear is that, with the loss of assisted-area status, the area will
again suffer from undue 'competition' provided by assistance still available
across the Welsh border in Gwent.
The best hope for support now is an extention of rural-development area
status northwards, to link up with a similar application from Hereford and
Worcester and Shropshire for the Marches.
Mr Dick Whittington, assistant director of administrative services at Forest
of Dean district council, says: 'We are confident we will retain our rural
development status, and hope we can extend the area, but there is no way
this can compensate for the loss of assisted-area status.' He sees few signs
of recovery from the recession.
The structure plan for the forest, which goes to public inquiry next spring,
argues that 4,500 new jobs are required by the year 2001, mainly
concentrating on the three centres of Cinderford, Lydney and Coleford. But a
recent study by the University of Warwick suggests that medium-term
employment prospects 'are at best limited, with only modest employment
growth projected under the most optimistic scenario.'
One area of potential growth is tourism, based on the attractive landscape,
the development of many woodland tracks and bridle paths by the Forestry
Commission, and the area's rich industrial heritage.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (8): 'Preferable to the M25' -
Relocation / employers tell Richard Evans their reasons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The smart entrance lobby to the Laurentian Life headquarters outside
Gloucester was buzzing at two o'clock, as dozens of employees returned by
coach from a shopping expedition to the city centre.
Coaches leave at noon and 1pm each working day, to enable the financial
group's staff to shop during their lunch break; and buses are also laid on
each morning and evening, to and from the city centre.
It is part of the company's package of policies to keep the workforce happy
in a purpose-built headquarters two miles from the city centre, following a
move from Guildford in 1986.
The financial sector has appreciated the benefit of relocating away from
city centres and the expensive south-east more than most, but
Gloucestershire has managed to persuade a wide range of organisations to set
up headquarters in the county. Among them are Colt Cars, Spirax-Sarco
Engineering, Nuclear Electric, Kraft General Foods, and the Countryside
Commission.
Laurentian traces its origins back to 1896 and the formation of Imperial
Life Assurance of Canada. UK offices were opened in 1931, and in 1977
Imperial merged its operations with Laurentian Group Corporation of Canada.
In 1987, the size of the UK operation was doubled when Imperial acquired
Trident Life, to form Laurentian Life. Imperial was based in Guildford and
Trident life in Gloucester, so the management had to decide where to base
the combined operation.
Three options were considered: locating everyone in either Guildford or
Gloucester, or choosing a new base such as Bristol, Southampton or
Bournemouth. 'It was quickly decided that an entirely new site would involve
too great a commercial risk, and there was only so much disruption the
company fabric should be asked to take. It became a straight choice between
Guildford add Gloucester,' says Mr lain Tweeddale, managing director of
Laurentian Life.
It was not an easy choice, however. The Guildford building could have
accommodated all the staff, but overheads were much higher. Office space in
Guildford in 1986 was Pounds 12 a square foot, compared with Pounds 5 in
Gloucester. A move to Gloucester would entail building a new headquarters,
but salary differentials and a much lower staff turnover would bring
substantial benefits.
The decision went in favour of Gloucester, to the irritation of many former
Imperial employees who thought they should have called the shots as the
senior partner in the merger. Around 150 of the 450 Guildford staff decided
to relocate to Gloucester, and a further 200 people were recruited locally
in a hectic six-month initial training period.
The original intention had been to relocate when the new headquarters was
built, but it was then decided to move immediately, because of the danger of
flagging morale in a long rundown period. Temporary offices were taken at
Mitcheldean, in the Forest of Dean, in premises made vacant by a Rank Xerox
cutback, and staff were bussed to and from Gloucester for two years.
The landscaped new headquarters in the Gloucester suburb of Barnwood now
houses not only the administrative staff but also the whole investment team,
who manage the Pounds 1.5bn investments from a purpose-built dealing room.
Among the factors that tipped the balance in favour of Gloucester were:
housing, with an average house Pounds 25,000 cheaper than in the south-east;
education, which was seen as being at least as good as in Guildford; and
availability of staff.
'We have had no difficulty in recruiting high calibre people, happy to live
in this part of the world . . . anything to get away from the M25,' says Mr
Tweeddale.
One advantage of Gloucester for financial services is that it is within easy
motorway range of both Birmingham and Bristol, with their well developed
financial sectors, and this makes specialist recruitment easier.
Another company that has found little difficulty in recruiting technical
staff in what has traditionally been regarded as a rural county is
Spirax-Sarco Engineering, specialists in the control of fluids.
The company moved to Cheltenham from central London in 1939, because of
apprehension about the outbreak of war, and now employs 1,000 at its
headquarters and 3,000 worldwide.
Mr Tim Fortune, group managing director, has found no employment problems,
partly because of skills acquired in the local aerospace and defence
industries. 'We find the workforce is particularly stable and loyal,' he
says.
The Colt Car Company, importers and distributors of Mitsubishi cars, did not
make quite such a calculated decision as Laurentian to set up head- quarters
in the county. It happened largely because a couple of the directors lived
in the area when the company was launched, and it seemed a more desirable
and cheaper base than London.
The company was founded in 1974, as a joint-venture partnership with
Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, and thefirst office was in four rented
rooms in Dollar Street House, a converted mansion in the heart of
Cirencester.
The historic market town was chosen partly for its convenience for the
directors, and partly because of its more general convenience as a natural
crossroads since Roman times. It has ready access to London and the
south-east, Wales and the south-west, the Midlands and the north.
By 1976 the company had outgrown the small offices, and moved to new
purpose-built accommodation in nearby Spitalgate Lane. A second move
followed 10 years ago, when the expanding company moved to its present
headquarters on a six-acre freehold site at Watermoor on the outskirts of
Cirencester.
Because of Cirencester's historic past, and the fact that the building is
the first the visitor sees when travelling from London and the M4, planning
restrictions were stringent. The main building, next to an old coaching inn
on the Roman Fosse Way, is restricted to two storeys and shaped like a W to
hide a big industrial warehouse. The complex houses all the company's sales,
parts, marketing, accounting and computer functions.
Colt ran its own dock and shipping compound at Newport, in south Wales, from
1974 until last August, but the operation has just been transferred to the
Royal Portbury Dock in Bristol, where larger vessels can be berthed and
unloaded.
Colt tries to make the most of its local connections, and uses local legal,
technical and support services as much as possible. It is currently
sponsoring the locally-based Badminton horse trials.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (10): Villagers recognise the
benefits but still want fewer tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
One of the prettiest villages in the Cotswolds is Bourton-on-the-Water, and
therefore it is one of the most popular.
For that reason, Cotswold district council has carried out a year-long
investigation to assess the impact of tourism and to devise a visitor
management plan.
The plan's aim will be 'to maximise the economic benefits of tourism to
Bourton and its environs, while minimising any adverse environmental
impact.'
Nearly 2,200 visitor were interviewed and a questionaire was sent to all
1,000 households, and returned by half of these.
Among the residents, the study says, 'there was a general acceptance that
tourism had brought benefits to Bourton, but that the village was not
flourising, merely surviving.
'This may be a reflection of local views in the light of the current
recession. However, when asked how they would like to see tourism change
over the next 10 years, by far the most common answer was 'less tourists'.
In a way, there is a contradiction in these two views.'
The study comments that the desire among locals to see fewer tourists 'is a
surprising statement when compared to the employment provided to local
people in Bourton. . . The economic importance of tourism to Bourton
families is undoubted and, perhaps, should be better appreciated by local
residents.'
The survey found that fewer than one in 10 visitors stayed overnight in
Bourton, 40 per cent returned home at the end of the day, and the remaining
50 per cent were touring and staying elsewhere, typically in Bath or
Stratford-upon-Avon. The visitors' most popular suggestion for improvements
to Bourton was traffic controls.
'From the visitors' point of view,' the study says, 'Bourton offers all the
features we would wish to be seen as indicative of the Cotswolds, rather
than a village that has lost some of its character through commercialisation
of tourism - yet the more crowded it becomes, the less able they are to
appreciate it.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (9): Councils unite to welcome
visitors - Tourism / One of the county's main industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is as evocative a litany as any in England: Sheepscombe, Coln St Aldwyns,
Windrush and Birdlip. The names of Cotswold villages conjure up the image of
limestone cottages, drystone walls, sparkling streams and wooded valleys, an
image which helps to bring 11m visitors a year to the county.
In consequence, tourism has become one of the four leading industries in
Gloucestershire with spending by visitors in 1992 put at Pounds 212m. Over
17,000 people are employed by the industry and, on the calculation that each
job supports one half of another elsewhere, it is reckoned that it sustains
one in 10 of all jobs in the county.
During the recession, as elsewhere in Britain, tourism has suffered, and
there have been job losses, but fewer than in other important sectors of the
local economy. In 1992, visitor numbers to attractions were down by about 2
per cent on 1991. This year has seen no real recovery, although overseas
visitors, encouraged by the devaluation of sterling, have helped to some
extent.
About one in five visitors come from abroad, but they account for over a
third of all tourist spending, partly because so many of the other visitors
 -9.5m of the 11m total - are on day trips.
Although the Cotswolds are almost synonymous with Gloucestershire - nearly
all their 800 square miles lie within its boundaries - they are only one
reason why people want to visit the county. 'The great thing with
Gloucestershire is that the county itself is a draw, rather than any one
component within it,' says Mr Colin Potts, principal tourism officer of
Gloucestershire Tourism, an innovative marketing and development partnership
set up seven years ago by the county council and six district councils.
The partnership acts a co-ordinator of these councils' individual programmes
and as a link with the Heart of England Tourist Board. For example,
Gloucestershire Tourism promotes directly in the US a guide for travel
agents with hotel prices quoted in dollars. (The US is the main country of
origin among overseas visitors, followed by the Netherlands and Germany.)
The county benefits by being able to offer what Mr Potts describes as
'quintessentially English countryside' within reach of Heathrow, Gatwick and
Birmingham airports. 'First timers to Britain will usually go to London
first,' he says. 'But for those who have been to London before, we are a
very good first stop - after a flight arriving in the early morning, one can
be in a lovely country-house hotel in perfect English countryside by early
afternoon.'
Despite the appeal of the Cotswolds, the county is keen to divert visitors
away from the obvious, and sometimes overcrowded, honeypots. In fact, the
most popular single attraction is not in the Cotswolds but Gloucester
cathedral, where visitors in 1992 were estimated at 450,000.
Gloucester, while lacking the regency splendours and quality shops of
Cheltenham (and it can boast only one restaurant in the latest Good Food
Guide, compared with Cheltenham's four) also has its historic docks. The
restoration of these has been the single most important tourist development
in the county in the past 10 years.
The docks, connecting the river Severn with the Gloucester and Sharpness
canal, no longer have any commercial shipping. But the 15 handsome Victorian
warehouses now include shops, the National Waterways and Regiments of
Gloucestershire museums and the Robert Opie collection of advertising and
packaging. An antiques centre in one warehouse had nearly 400,000 visitors
in 1992.
English Heritage is restoring another of the city's antiques, the 13th
century Blackfriars Dominican friary, which is expected to become a big
tourist attraction. The city has improved its appeal for visitors and
residents alike by pedestrianising part of its centre. Mr David Scott,
director of planning and development services, says: 'I think there is a
sense of optimism in the city that we've got tremendous assets; we're making
the best of those assets, and we're going to go on improving them.'
Elsewhere in Gloucestershire are such inspired gardens as Hidcote Manor and
Owlpen Manor. There are the Stroud valleys, the Westonbirt arboretum,
Tewkesbury Abbey, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge, the roman
town of Cirencester and Cheltenham itself, with its art gallery, Pittville
Pump Room and festivals of literature and music.
On the other side of the Severn is the Forest of Dean, which the walker John
Hillaby described as 'perhaps the most beautiful assembly of trees in
Britain.' In the south is the Cotswolds water park, flooded gravel workings
which are claimed to have a greater water area than the Norfolk Broads.
We took the Romantic Road, an ingenious route through quiet Cotswold lanes
devised by Cheltenham Tourism. Despite finding that, even in October, three
quality hotels along the way were fully booked, on the road itself we saw
more pheasants than cars. (At the Country Elephant restaurant, at Painswick,
it was hare rather than pheasant on the menu.)
Gloucestershire will want to keep it that way. Mr Potts says: 'Our greatest
asset is the natural environment, and our challenge is to encourage
sustainable tourism to maintain that environment. We want to encourage
visitors in the countryside to help sustain farms and village shops, but in
such a way that they don't harm the environment.'
He points out that the contraction of some other industries will put even
more emphasis on tourism, but that it is vital that the county does not
become over-reliant upon it, as have some seaside areas. Gloucestershire
Tourism is now devising a strategy for the next five years, and is
encouraging such activities as walking and cycling and the use of local
services.
The challenge, Mr Potts says, is to have a good tourism policy under the
threat of funding cuts, with no grants available to encourage tourist
development, and to counter what he calls the government's 'woefully
inadequate' funding of tourism in England, compared with the much more
generous funding for Wales and Scotland.
Overnight visitors themselves might themselves require generous funding. A
couple staying, for example, in a four-poster bedroom with jacuzzi bath at
the Swan Hotel at Bibury could pay Pounds 176 for one night's bed and
breakfast. But Mr Potts says this type of hotel has weathered the recession
better than some middle-ranking ones. This may prove that Gloucestershire
must continue to trade on quality rather than mere numbers.

we're big' / Profile of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society

For the first 20 years in the life of what is now Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society, founded in 1850, the directors met monthly in a Cheltenham
hotel, paying Pounds 6 a year for the room.
Today, the directors meet in C&amp;G's chief office at Barnwood, near
Gloucester, a 185,000 sq ft building completed in 1989 at a cost of Pounds
30m.
In between times, the society has grown to be Britain's sixth biggest, with
assets of Pounds 16.5bn. Mindful of its original prudent directors, it
stresses that it is the most cost-efficient of the big UK banks and building
societies.
This year, it launched a television advertising campaign with the slogan
'We're run to make you richer.' Mr Roger Burden, operations director, says:
'We thought it was time to let people know C&amp;G was big. That is the theme of
the campaign - name awareness. We were concerned that we didn't have the
awareness that some other societies have.'
C&amp;G likes to be different - this month it stopped selling mortgage endowment
policies - and the campaign's slogan tries to reinforce this. 'Many of our
accounts have quite high minimum balances if you want to invest in them,'
says Mr Burden. 'We do tend to think of ourselves as being slightly upmarket
as a building society. I think Gloucestershire helps us in that.'
Within the county, no one can be unaware of C&amp;G. Mr Burden says: 'We know
we're very strong in the county - on the investment side we have over
100,000 accounts. We have over 30,000 mortgages in the county. In terms of
investors, we're probably in every other home on average, and in borrowing
probably have 20 to 25 per cent of the market.' (Nationally, the society has
more than 330,000 borrowers.)
People in Gloucestershire, Mr Burden says, tend to borrow a lower proportion
of their house-purchase cost than elsewhere, and mortgage arrears are lower.
'The county has not escaped this recession but it has been quite stable. It
is a solid foundation for us.' To reinforce its position, C&amp;G concentrates
sponsorship locally - especially on sport - rather than nationally.
The society's half-year results to June 30 showed a 71 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 75.3m, after an improvement in provisions for bad
debts. In 1992 the provisions were Pounds 217.8m. The half-year results were
described by Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, as 'a solid performance
in a sombre market.' Mr Burden says the fact that house prices have now
stabilised 'has done marvels for people's confidence. They say maybe the
house is worth keeping.'
C&amp;G was one of the first building societies to computerise, for which Mr
Longhurst was responsible when he joined the society in 1967. 'Technology is
a very important part of controlling our costs, but it is only one part,'
says Mr Burden. 'We rely on good staff, on training, and we also have a
simple and focused approach to our business.
'We've decided not to go for the high transaction banking type-customer, so
we don't have cheque-books, we don't have cash dispensers - probably the
only building society in the top 10 that doesn't. We don't try to be
everything to everyone. We try to stick to the knitting and do what we do
best.'
The society has 235 branches, many fewer than Leeds Permanent, the fifth
largest society, which has over 400. Although the relatively small number
helps to contain costs, C&amp;G continues to increase the number.
'We think it is important to be quite large,' Mr Burden says. 'Size is
important in the way we control our costs - you cannot control the costs if
you start shrinking the business. We think it's a sign of strength to see
the business growing.'
Last month, C&amp;G merged with Heart of England, based in Warwick, the 25th
largest society; in 1992 it took over Mid Sussex; and the year before,
Portsmouth building society. Mr Burden says the mergers worked out the way
the society had expected, with the exception of Portsmouth. 'With
Portsmouth, we were disappointed with the quality of their mortgage book -
it wasn't as good as we thought it was. That accounted for a large part of
last year's loss provisions. But it will come good.'
Today, C&amp;G employs 3,000 staff, of whom 900 are in the Barnwood
headquarters, which was built on a greenfield site. C&amp;G moved to Barnwood
after failing to reach terms with Cheltenham borough council on a
council-owned site. 'We couldn't agree a sensible price. We got fed up in
the end. We were growing the business - the whole idea of the new building
was to be bigger - so we just ran out of time.'
The Barnwood staff is now double the number that were at Cheltenham. And
work has started on an extension capable of housing another 500.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (6): The head-office factor /
Tracing the financial services' rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest single influence on the Gloucestershire economy during the 1980s
was the huge rise in jobs in banking, insurance and financial services.
The increase, between 1987 and 1989 alone, was almost 12,000, taking
employment in the county to over 26,000, as indigenous companies expanded
and others relocated, driven away from the London area by high rents, labour
costs and the difficulties of recruitment.
By 1991, the recession had already cost some 2,000 of those jobs as the
industry, as elsewhere in the UK, retrenched. The question is whether the
sector, which is concentrated on Cheltenham and Gloucester, can now
stabilise as a significant, although second-tier, regional centre.
If the community was restricted to a 'back office' function, then
computerisation would mean future employment prospects were poor. In fact,
the county has a good share of head offices, some of which are long
established, and which should be able to continue to attract senior staff.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, the UK's sixth largest, has always
been based in the county, as has the much smaller society, Stroud &amp; Swindon,
which has 25 branches. Chelsea building society, with 50 branches, set up
its headquarters 20 years ago at Thirlestaine Hall, a Victorian mansion in
Cheltenham, and extended it in 1987. Endsleigh, the insurance company which
this season started sponsorship of the football league, moved to the town
from London 20 years ago.
Northern Star Insurance, the Italian-owned general insurer, moved from
Croydon to Gloucester 10 years ago and has expanded to over 350 staff
locally. Ecclesiastical Insurance is also based there. Another headquarters
is that of the Canadian-owned Laurentian Financial Group, which moved from
Guildford in 1986 to set up shop at Barnswood, on the city's outskirts.
(Also at Barnswood is one of the main computer centres of Barclays Bank.)
In Cheltenham, there is Royal Bank Leasing and Mercantile &amp; General
Reinsurance, which moved much of its operations there 20 years ago. Although
its headquarters remains in London, it has more staff based in Cheltenham,
nearly 400. There was, however, a reassessment of group staffing levels last
year, which led to about 50 local redundancies.
The most important relocation has been by Eagle Star, the BAT Industries
subsidiary. Last year it joined its life subsidiary in Cheltenham by moving
its head office and general insurance business from London to a new 170,000
sq ft building at Bishop's Cleeve, just outside the town. The group employs
3,000 people locally.
Mr John Bishop, chairman of Eagle Star, which worldwide has Pounds 12bn of
funds under management, says the relocation was initiated by the need to
expand and the difficulties of finding a large enough building in London
(the move was accelerated by IRA bomb damage to its existing City offices.)
Mr Bishop - whose office now overlooks a parkland of sheep - says of any
disadvantages of being out of London: 'There is none at all as far as Eagle
Star is concerned.' He points out that many insurance companies are now
based outside the capital. 'We are a national company that happens to be
based in Cheltenham.'
The company, he says, has been able to improve its efficiency. 'We are able
to operate as an entity, and the whole thing works much better. We have our
costs under control. We are convinced that, in the long term, this was the
right thing to do, with real economies by being here and being able to
operate in the way we do, and which will stand Eagle Star in good stead in
the future.'
Mr Bishop sees no reason why the county should not continue to attract
financial services companies. 'If I were in London looking for somewhere to
come, this region would be high on my list.'
The Eagle Star Life subsidiary moved its own headquarters in 1968 to
Cheltenham, where its 13-storey tower block, now being refurbished, is the
most prominent landmark. The head office has moved this year to a building
with a facade more in keeping with the town's architecture.
'I can think of very few disadvantages to being in Cheltenham, and the
quality of life is very good,' says Mr Ian Owen, Eagle Star Life's managing
director. 'There is good access, good employment, good schools and rents are
cheaper than in London.'
Other than Eagle Star, the last sizeable relocation was that of the Bank of
England's registrars department, which completed a move from the City of
London in 1991. It occupies a Pounds 13m building of nearly 130,000 sq ft in
Gloucester, where it employs 380 people, most of them recruited locally.
The Bank decided, in 1987, to move the department on cost grounds. It needed
a large building at a lower cost than could be found at that time in the
London region, but needed to stay within reach of the City, because of the
physical exchange of paper - its main function is the registration of
gilt-edged securities. It concluded that Gloucester fitted the bill.
One important factor in the future will be how support services develop to
give the local sector more depth and range of employment. One new company is
Marlborough Stirling, in Cheltenham, set up in 1988 to sell tailor-made
software and business solutions for the sector. It has grown rapidly to over
90 staff, and its clients include some of the leading companies within and
outside the county. Mr Huw Evans, its managing director, sees 'enormous
scope' for further growth.
As a regional centre, a limiting factor is the proximity of the larger
financial communities of Bristol and Birmingham, and the big companies tend
to retain London-based auditors, law firms and advertising agencies. KPMG
Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, closed its Cheltenham office this year,
although Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Grant Thornton keep offices in Gloucester. 'A
local presence is important, because the Gloucester office has its own
expertise,' says Mr Nicholas Houghton-Brown, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Mr Darryl Whitehead, Grant Thornton's managing partner in Gloucester, says:
'Relative to the indigenous work, the indigenous professionals can handle it
very well.' A leading Gloucestershire-based accountancy firm is Hazelwoods.
Even in the present climate, investment has not ceased in the county.
Endsleigh, which employs 350 people on seven sites around Cheltenham, has
just bought a 28-acre site on the outskirts where it plans to consolidate.
'It is a statement of our commitment to Gloucestershire as the future focal
point of the company,' says Mr Stuart Wartalski, of Endsleigh.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (4): '10,000 jobs lost' says
report / Examining the effect of defence cuts on industry
</HEADLINE>

The name Gloster evokes quite different associations from the other spelling
of the name. While most people's image of Gloucestershire has to do with
peaceful settings - Cotswolds, vales, forests, and spas - it is deeply
involved in the military sector.
Gloster was the aircraft company that made the Gladiator biplane and the
Meteor and Javelin jets. It was set up in the first world war as the
Gloucestershire Aircraft Companyon the premises of a Cheltenham firm. One of
its employees, George Dowty, branched out to found the parts company that
became Gloucestershire's biggest industrial concern. Unlike Dowty, however,
which survives as part of the TI group, Gloster Aircraft Company has
disappeared, its name swallowed up in the series of mergers that led to the
creation of British Aerospace.
And then there are the Glosters - the Gloucestershire Regiment, also known
as 'The Slashers', distinguished by the small 'back-badge' on the back of
their head-dress, commemorating the 1801 battle of Alexandria when they
fought simultaneously to their front and rear. The regiment will just be
able to celebrate its 300th anniversary next year before it, too, is
swallowed up in a merger, making way for an amalgamated Royal
Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment.
Defence cuts have hit the area hard. In the industrial sector, where,
besides Dowty and Smiths Industries, there is a range of contractors
producing everything from bearings and steering equipment to decoys and
electronic components, the cuts have coincided with recession in other
markets, making the transition away from dependence on defence much harder.
A report produced this month for Gloucestershire county council suggests
that total defence-related employment, now around 26,500, has shrunk by
almost a third in the last three years. More than 10,000 jobs are reckoned
to have been lost in the defence equipment sector, including
sub-contractors, as well as some 2,000 civil service posts. The report
forecasts more than 4,500 more job losses by the end of the decade, with
direct defence-company employment reduced to just half the 1990 level.
Gloucestershire has joined forces with neighbouring Avon and Wiltshire in
applying for a share of the European Union's Konver fund for vulnerable
defence-dependent regions. The application, to support a Pounds 4.5bn
investment programme aimed at business development, innovation, training and
rehabilitation of military sites, was submitted last month.
The three counties suffer in different ways. Wiltshire's defence dependency
lies mainly in its concentration of military bases, Avon's in its large
aerospace and defence equipment sector. 'Gloucesterhire's got the lot,' says
Mr Tony Burley, of the council's Economic Development Unit.
Besides scattered army and RAF bases and maintenance units, Gloucestershire
is famously home to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the
electronic monitoring agency which is the largest arm of Britain's
intelligence services. Closely linked to its US counterpart, cloaked in
secrecy, and undisturbed by trade union activity, which has been banned
since 1984, it has two main sites at Cheltenham, now reckoned to employ
6,500-7,000 civilians. But even this is secret.
The local economy tied to military bases has also suffered, particularly
from the rundown of US Air Force operations in Europe. The US base at
Fairford, from where B-52 bombers flew 7,500-mile missions against Iraq in
the Gulf war, is mothballed. The USAF and RAF have both abandoned Kemble, a
former maintenance depot now used to store army vehicles. A US hospital at
Little Rissington has also closed.
Industrially, defence remains prominent among otherwise disparate
activities, ranging from Birds Eye Walls' ice-cream factory, which employs
about 1,000 at Gloucester, to Rank Xerox's copier plant at Mitcheldean ,
whose workforce of 1,800 is one of the largest in the county.
Some of the main non-defence industries have also been facing particularly
depressed markets. Du Pont, which took over ICI's nylon fibre plant at
Brockworth, is reducing employment by a quarter to 750. The Lister-Petter
diesel engine plant, at Dursley, now part of the BTR group, is the sole
survivor of five main sites. It shed 180 jobs early last year, leaving 900.
It has staved off further cuts by diversifying into defence - a US military
contract for generator engines, which has boosted the business by 10-15 per
cent.
Most defence manufacturers are, meanwhile, seeking ways of diversifying in
the other direction. But this is proving especially hard for smaller
companies.
An exception is Lydney Products, a plywood and veneer producer in the Forest
of Dean which used to rely heavily on supplies for navy wardrooms and the
like. In the last six years, it has built up civilian outlets for its
products, although this has not stopped the number of employees falling from
a peak of about 200 to 90. Defence now accounts for only 15 per cent of the
business, says Mr Nigel Haig, commercial director, adding: 'It can't help
being a declining thing.'

Two companies represent Gloucestershire's high profile in the aerospace
equipment sector - Dowty and Smiths Industries, writes David White. Although
both remain world leaders in some technologies, as well as being principal
industrial employers in the Cheltenham-Gloucester area, they have both been
hit by a cruel combination of cuts in defence expenditure and depression in
the airline business.
Dowty, with unique status as a home-grown Gloucestershire company of
international standing, succumbed last year to a Pounds 497m hostile
takeover by the TI group. The old headquarters building at Arle Court,
Cheltenham, has been put on the market. The company is now based with TI at
Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Focusing on core aerospace businesses, TI has since
September sold Dowty's fuel systems subsidiary to Lucas and its electronics
interests to a new company, Ultra Electronics, in a management buy-out. This
leaves Dowty Aerospace with activities in landing gear, propellers and
hydraulics. The military share of sales has dropped from 60 per cent in 1985
to about 25 per cent, partly reflecting the large share of landing-gear work
now done for Airbus. The three sites now employ 1,700, a reduction of 15 per
cent since the takeover, and barely a fifth of the Dowty workforce in the
region in the early 1980s.
Cheltenham also has Smiths Industries' largest aerospace factory, employing
about 2,300. Its civil side supplies avionics for Boeing and other airlines,
and its military side makes displays for fighter jets, including several US
aircraft. About 1,000 are engaged at Cheltenham in each of these activities,
with a further 300 in a separate product support operation. Unlike most
companies involved in defence, Smiths says it has not tried to lessen its
dependence on the military sector, and is eager to exploit opportunities for
upgrading existing combat aircraft.
In the medium and longer term, the company is optimistic about both
prospects in both the civil and military markets. A Pounds 5m investment in
a new 60,000 sq ft repair facility, being opened today, testifies to its
confident mood.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (3): Harmony in the corridors -
Sectors in partnership / The economic strategy forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Gloucestershire, As in other parts of south-west England, there is an
awareness that an individual county, in terms of its economic development,
increasingly lacks the muscle to fight its corner.
In the past, the south-west has done well enough to be unconcerned that it
lacked agencies to promote the region and attract inward investment. But the
recession and the rundown in the defence industries, on which the region is
heavily dependent, have forced a rethink. Neighbourly and political
rivalries are being set aside in an attempt to have a louder, and more
united, voice in the corridors of Whitehall and Brussels.
This year has seen the creation of the Western Development Partnership in
Avon, and Westcountry Development Corporation for Devon and Cornwall. These
are two public and private sector partnerships designed to provide a
strategic overview. Now Gloucestershire is proceeding down a similar road.
It linked with Avon and Wiltshire this autumn to apply for the European
Union's Konver funding, intended to support projects in areas suffering from
defence-related job losses. Influential players in the county are now
setting up an economic strategy forum with representatives from the county
council, training and enterprise council, Gloucestershire chamber of
commerce, the CBI and the TUC.
Mr Tony Burley, the county council's group planning officer, says: 'The need
is to collaborate on action - and one cannot do that without a strategy
forum. It has become clear that in the future we need to co-ordinate and put
limited resources together.' Whatever the outcome of the local government
review (which proposes abolishing the county council and creating unitary
authorities), such a body would be required to provide an overview.
Mr Graham Hoyle, chief executive of the Tec, says there is unanimity that
the forum needs to be made to work and to resource the action it proposes.
'A fundamental strength of Gloucestershire is that it has tended to move
with the times. But there are now two snags. Defence and armed-force bases
have been a strength for 30 or 40 years. Insurance, particularly, and
banking have been strong in the 1970s and 1980s. But the peace dividend has
led to the actual shedding of staff, and in financial services the growth
has ceased.' In addition, inward investment had dried up.
'Gloucestershire is still seen as a very attractive and prosperous county -
and still seen that way in Whitehall - with below national average
unemployment, a mixed economy, a pleasant place to live - lucky old
Gloucestershire,' he says. 'But if Gloucestershire does nothing, it is on a
downward slope. There is a recognition that it has to do something, and it
is sensible to plan what we do.'
Public and private sector partnerships are already examining education
strategy and seeking to identify the county's future sunrise industries. In
September, the forum commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand to carry out a
three-month study to help to prepare its strategy. Presentations are being
held to make the broader community - companies, banks, utilities and
colleges - aware that Gloucestershire needs to act.
Mr Vince Taylor, consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has been analysing the
results of a questionnaire sent to public and private sector agencies. 'I
was very surprised at the high degree of consensus,' he says. 'There seems
to be broad agreement.
'They would like to see Gloucestershire re-established as a leading region
within the UK. They want to see a balanced economy of manufacturing and
commerce, rather than as in the 1980s when commerce was appearing to
dominate. Education features strongly as underpinning the employment
skills.'
Gloucestershire, he points out, is one of the leading British counties in
terms of high-technology employment, but its position has been weakening,
because of the contraction of the defence and aerospace industries.
The county is, he says, perceived to be a high-quality location, if rather
in the shadow of Bristol and Birmingham. But to attract further inward
investment, the county needed to correct an image problem, dating back to
the late 1980s, of appearing to be full - that there had been enough growth,
that the market for labour and property was very tight.
'I think the door has to be re-opened to inward investors. But
Gloucestershire cannot just say we're open for business. In order to
preserve the quality of life, it has to be very selective - to have a
rifle-shot approach.'
One strong message from the questionnaire, he says, was the need to preserve
that quality of life. 'People unanimously thought the natural environment
was very good, and the vast majority said it mattered to their organisation
in order to retain staff.'
The forum will need to take account of local initiatives. For example,
Cheltenham has already set up its own business forum and action group to
develop an economic strategy for the town, intended to sustain existing
businesses and attract new ones.
It also has to take account of the county's geography. While the Gloucester,
Cheltenham and Tewkesbury triangle is its economic heart (traditional
rivalries have often prevented it from beating as one), individual parts of
the county look outwards in different directions. The south looks more
towards Bristol, the north towards Birmingham, the east towards Swindon and
Oxford.
The forum will have to liaise with the neighbours to develop a sub-regional
approach. Mr Hoyle says: 'If Gloucestershire believes it can develop an
economic plan within its boundaries full-stop, it is unlikely to be
successful. In getting a Gloucestershire strategy together, that has to be
done with a degree of collaboration with neighbouring counties.'
Mr Chris Curtis, director of the CBI's south-western region and a forum
member, stresses the importance of the forum but also of this sub-regional
co-ordination. Brussels was increasingly looking at a Europe of regions
rather than nations, and Gloucestershire would need to look beyond its own
borders. 'Gloucestershire on its own has not the depth of resource, but
needs a wider horizon for strategic planning,' he says:
'The CBI believes that, in the very long run, the people who live in the
south-west ought to consider a regional development function covering all
seven counties of the south-west.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (1): The idyll is clouded - The
quest for new businesses is being impeded by contraction in important
regional industries and uncertainty over the future of local authorities.
The county has responded with the launch of an economic strategy forum
</HEADLINE>

Gloucestershire has always been seen as one of the more fortunate English
counties, with a rural prosperity suggested by its Cotswold villages, grand
country houses, the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester, and the
Cheltenham Gold Cup. It is assumed to be a shire where the living is good.
Today, the image is flawed. The county is indeed a pleasant place to live
and work, and leading companies have chosen to be based there: state-owned
Nuclear Electric, Gulf Oil (GB), Eagle Star insurance group and Mitsubishi's
Colt Cars are among them. They have been attracted by the skilled and stable
workforce, good access to the M4 and M5 motorways, and by being within reach
of London but able to enjoy lower property and labour costs.
The population has risen steadily, boosted by relocations, especially in
financial services. In just two years to September 1989, 21,000 net
additional jobs were created. Agriculture now accounts for only 2 per cent
of the labour force. Contrary to the popular image, the backbone of the
economy - once provided by sheep and woollen mills - is manufacturing, and
especially engineering and electronics.
But here is the catch: no fewer than 14 per cent of the companies are
estimated to be involved in the defence and aerospace industries, with
Dowty, Smiths Industries and the government's GCHQ at Cheltenham among the
biggest employers. The contraction of these industries is happening at a
time when the recession has stopped growth in financial services and in
tourism.
In just three years, unemployment has nearly trebled, rising from only 3 per
cent in 1990 to 8.8 per cent in September. This represents 22,000 people,
1,500 fewer than last February and still below the national average, but the
differential has sharply narrowed.
Industrial restructuring increases the vulnerability of regional plants. The
head office of Dowty moved out of the county after last year's takeover by
TI. Earlier this year, there were big job losses in Gloucestershire, when
Meko International, a mining equipment company, subject of a buy-out from
Dowty, merged with Dobson Park Industries and work was consolidated in
Lancashire.
'The regional economy is under very great pressure,' says John Sewell,
leader of the Liberal Democrats, the largest group on the county council.
'In economic development terms, Gloucestershire is caught between the grants
available in south Wales and the effects of the M4 motorway corridor, which
stretches as far as Swindon.' It is also midway between the heavyweight
cities of Bristol and Birmingham.
'What we have to do,' says Mr Sewell, 'is to form the seedbed for new
businesses to grow - there is simply no other way round it. We have a very
skilled workforce; we have lots of people with ideas.'
Economic planning for such a seedbed is clouded by the uncertainties that
surround the future of local authorities. In its draft proposals, the Local
Government Commission recommended replacing the county council and six
district councils with four unitary authorities. And the council has been
capped by the government for the second successive year, and has had Pounds
10m lopped off its proposed budget.
All three political parties had voted in favour of the higher budget. (The
council has been hung since the mid-1980s, but in May the Liberal Democrats
increased their share of seats to two short of an overall majority.) Mr
Sewell says education, in particular, is suffering as a consequence of the
capping. As for the proposed council reorganisation, he describes the
commission's proposals as a non-starter. All three parties had voted for the
status quo.
Michael Honey, the council's chief executive, is confident that the
commissioners are now listening. 'The public is saying it wants the existing
two-tier structure, which works very well here; and it is certainly not
worth spending Pounds 20m or more and going through all the upheaval to
unstitch it. From the business point of view, the message we have heard loud
and clear is: if you are going to change the status quo, go for a single
unitary authority, which has enough clout to look strategically at the
issues.'
The need for this clout resulted this year in the setting up of an economic
strategy forum, a partnership between the public and private sectors. 'Ways
need to be found to ensure unemployment is brought down by getting the local
economy to outperform the rest of the UK,' Mr Honey says. The forum will be
co-ordinated with similar initiatives in neighbouring counties to create a
more effective voice. 'People realise we have to be part of a larger
sub-regional force in order to be successful in getting inward investment
into this part of the country.'
He remains optimistic. 'One of the great assets is the delightful
environment which is one of the attractions to firms staying here and
relocating here. It is a thriving economy, even though it is suffering
obviously from the rundown in the defence industries. But we have an economy
rapidly retooling itself and diversifying into other areas.'
Some defence-related companies have been slow to do this, but a strength of
Gloucestershire is the variety of small businesses and often high-tech
companies. Roger Empson, managing director of Krone (UK) Technique, a
Cheltenham-based subsidiary of a German company making patented telecom and
data connections systems, says it has more than doubled its turnover in the
past six years to over Pounds 20m and is highly profitable. 'The Germans are
convinced that their investment here was absolutely the right decision for
market, technological and productivity reasons.'
Other significant companies in their own market include Racal-Redac, the
Tewkesbury-based subsidiary of Racal Electronics and the world's third
largest software company for electronic design automation. Norville Optical,
a family-owned company based in Gloucester, employs more than 800 people and
describes itself as the UK's largest optical supplier. Sapa Holdings, with
nearly 700 staff in the county, has big market shares in windows and doors.
Vince Taylor, of the accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which is advising
the strategy forum, says: 'The county has a large number of world-class
companies and in some ways has been more of a leader than follower. It has
been able to generate its own exports, which is interesting given that a lot
of people think all the growth for the future will happen in the east,
because that is nearer continental Europe.'
This may be a good portent, since the Channel tunnel, due to open next year,
otherwise threatens to emphasise the county's peripherality. Another
positive indicator is that the head-office culture, and natural environment,
should continue to attract senior staff and encourage a network of support
companies and professional services.
The strategy forum shows a recognition that, while Whitehall may adopt an
attitude of laisser faire, Gloucestershire itself has to act to stay in the
forefront of places to live and work. The expansion in the 1980s may have
been counter-productive in one respect: it gave the impression to the
outside world that Gloucestershire did not need more investment. As John
Cripps, chief executive of Gloucestershire chamber of commerce, says: 'The
message now is Gloucestershire is not closed for business, but open for
business.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drinks alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CATHERINE MILTON and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong suggestions that PepsiCo, the US soft drinks giant, was considering
buying Britvic were heard, although company sources later denied the story.
In spite of this, analysts said they expected a shake-up to Britvic's
unusual shareholdings in the near future.
PepsiCo already has a 10 per cent stake in Britvic, the other holders being
Bass (45 per cent), and Allied-Lyons and Whitbread (22.5 per cent each).
With such a diversity of owners, Britvic's development has been held back,
with some suggestions from brokers that a flotation - which would value the
group at around Pounds 300m - may be the best option. In a strong drinks
sector, Allied rose 8 to 583p, Whitbread 2 to 518p and Bass 5 to 477p.
BPB shares were among the market's best performers, climbing 21, or more
than 8 per cent, to 278p in turnover of 6.6m, after the group delivered much
better than expected interim profits and a higher dividend.
The BPB figures, coupled with reports of an 8.5 per cent year-on-year jump
in German housing starts and increasing hopes of another cut in German
interest rates, triggered a flurry of heavy buying interest throughout the
building sectors. Redland and RMC were the big beneficiaries of the German
stories, RMC climbing 26 to 878p, and the former 22 to 563p on heavy volume
of 6.9m.
There was further switching out of PowerGen and into National Power as
institutions continued to view the price differential between the two stock
prices as unsustainable. NatPower closed a shade firmer at 399 1/2 p on 5.2m
traded and the former shed 8 to 449p on 3.9m.
Respectable results but a gloomy statement sent Hazlewood Foods into retreat
and prompted a raft of downgrades and change of stance from several of the
stock's former supporters. The shares fell 7 to 141p, with analysts
predicting a dull time for the immediate future. Revisions of forecasts for
the full year came in around Pounds 52m, a fall of some 10 per cent.
A trade of 7.5m shares at 335p in United Biscuits - more than 1.5 per cent
of the equity - threw the company's brokers, financial PR and countless food
manufacturing analysts into confusion; the report should have read
'750,000'. The Stock Exchange later admitted to a mistake, but said the
error would not be posted until today. UB lost 2 at 335p in turnover of
4.3m.
Better than expected results from Direct Line, Royal Bank of Scotland's
hugely successful telephone insurance business, produced a strong rise in
Royal Bank's shares of 22 to a record closing high of 375p. Turnover was a
heavy 8.9m.
Dealers said the market was impressed with Direct Line's figures, but was
even more impressed with the decision of Mr Peter Wood, Direct Line's
founder, to take a share stake in RBOS instead of a royalty payment. 'The
institutions take the view that if Mr Wood prefers to have RBOS shares, then
so do they,' said one marketmaker.
Commercial Union moved up 6 to 605p, with buying said to have been
stimulated by a presentation in Paris hosted by Strauss Turnbull.
Glaxo was up 16 at 651p, but the City said this was part of a general
recovery in the sector, which has been lagging behind the market in recent
weeks.
Ruberoid's return to the market, after being demerged from Tarmac, saw the
shares heavily traded and they moved up from an opening 161p to touch 165p
before closing at 163p. The stock was issued at 150p a share. Turnover of
12m shares was the fourth heaviest in the market yesterday. The day's other
debut stock was Biotrace, the biotechnology company, which traded up to 145p
after 7.2m shares were placed at 130p. Volume was just under 1m shares.

FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils savaged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CATHERINE MILTON and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opec's move to hold its output ceiling at 24.5m barrels a day drew gasps of
despair from oil sector specialists and was accompanied by a steep slide in
oil shares. The oil sector was easily the worst performer in the FT-SE
Actuaries indices, posting a 0.5 per cent decline, against the FT-SE 100's
near 1 per cent rise.
Crude oil prices, already sliding before the Opec meeting in Vienna, came
under relentless pressure yesterday, retreating to around the Dollars 14 a
barrel level at one point, the lowest for around five years.
Many analysts adopted an extremely bearish view of the short and medium-term
outlook for oil prices, saying that the current situation bears a striking
resemblance to that of 1986 when Opec failed to get a grip on supply and
crude prices fell to around Dollars 8 to Dollars 9 a barrel.
Specialists said that although weak oil prices would inevitably impact on
the majors, it would be the exploration and production stocks, such as Lasmo
and Enterprise, which would suffer the most. Traders pointed out that Lasmo
was by far the most heavily traded stock in the oil sector yesterday, with
turnover reaching 13.5m - the highest single day's trade since early
October. Lasmo lost 6 to 128p.
'Lasmo's final dividend is now under extreme threat,' said one analyst, who
pointed out that the company had emphasised it would maintain the payment
'barring extenuating circumstances'.
'It is very likely that we will be looking at extenuating circumstances,'
was the view of the analyst.
Enterprise Oil shares were equally mauled, closing 15 1/2 lower at 439 1/2 p
on heavy turnover of 1.5m. BP, vulnerable to weak oil prices, performed
creditably, closing only marginally easier at 342p, while Shell slipped 3 to
684p.

FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong session for ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CATHERINE MILTON and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI was at the front of the market yesterday with an advance of 45 to 719p,
fuelled by bullish speculation on the prospects for the company's
petrochemicals business on the part of SG Warburg analyst Mr Michael Stone.
He told Warburg's sales force at the morning meeting that Europe's ethylene
producers were likely to succeed in their attempt to control supply and that
ICI could benefit to the tune of an extra Pounds 100m on its trading profits
as early as 1995.
His briefing followed a meeting of the Association of Petrochemicals
Producers in Europe (APPE), after which most petrochemicals groups said they
were optimistic about getting agreement to cut back production next month.
Other brokers, even those who are ICI buyers, were keen to knock down the
tale. One said: 'If the rise is in direct response to the APPE, it is
grossly overdone. That is, in our view, a total over-reaction to the news.'
But UK equity market specialists said that if the plan is agreed by
producers, the European Commission still has to grant it approval. Also,
overproduction in ethylene is a global problem, with European manufacturers
tending to be smaller and less efficient than those in the US and the Far
East.

Good volume in the futures market belied a somewhat featureless session
yesterday enlivened only by a very large order from one leading UK house,
writes Christopher Price.
The December FT-SE 100 contract opened in muted trading, with business being
executed in a narrow range of 2,968 to 2,978.
Anticipation of a dull day's business proved shortlived however as a large
buy order from one UK investment bank was seen in the late morning. This
sent December smartly forward and encouraged a flurry of other buyers to
come into the arena.
The contract immediately jumped to a hefty premium against the cash market
and at its best was trading 17 points ahead. Bear covering was also said
also to have added impetus to the rise, which in the absence of Wall Street
was maintained for the rest of the session.
The contract finally closed at 3,108, up 38 points on the previous session
and around 11 points over its fair value, currently standing at just over 4.
Turnover was a healthy 12,289 contracts.
Dealers said that derivatives trading was likely to remain directionless
ahead of the UK Budget, with minds concentrated on squaring up positions
prior to Tuesday. And with Wall Street expected to be muted, domestic
considerations are likely to be further reinforced.
In traded options, turnover reached just over 37,000, around one-third of
which was made up of FTSE contracts. The Euro-FTSE recorded turnover of
2,509 contrcats.
Among stock options, BT headed the list on 2,106, followed by British Steel
with 1,777 and Redland at 1,428.

FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index reaches for the 3,100
mark - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The closure of the New York markets for the Thanksgiving Day break left UK
equities free yesterday to respond to factors closer to home. A change of
view in the options and stock index futures sectors, backed up by favourable
company trading news, was enough to send the FT-SE 100 Index in search of
the 3,100 mark. At best, the index was within seven points of its target,
finally closing 25.9 up at 3,093.1. The December future on the Footsie
succeeded in breaking through 3,100 in late trading.
Traders took a cautious view of the sudden recovery in share prices,
stressing that the big institutional investors were still unwilling to deal
ahead of next Tuesday's Budget speech from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer. Marketmakers are keeping dealing books closely
trimmed and a wave of arbitraging operations from the stock index futures
market caught them by surprise yesterday morning.
However, Seaq volume increased to 696.3m shares, from 483.5m on Wednesday,
with several basket trades marching across the trading screens. Retail, or
customer, business was worth Pounds 1.36bn on Wednesday, indicating that
underlying activity remains healthy, if not as high as a few weeks ago. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 14.5 at 3,445.2.
Weakness in oil shares, following a heavy fall in crude prices after the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to cut production
levels, contrasted sharply with the rest of the stock market. Turnover in
oil stocks was very heavy as New York's holiday closure put London in the
front line.
Some analysts suggested that the oil price collapse, while not good for
sterling, would benefit the industrial economies and might bring a stronger
trend on Wall Street when it re-opens today. UK traders, who had assumed
that Wall Street would remain out of the market equation until Monday, moved
quickly into the blue chip international stocks yesterday afternoon.
The lead was taken by ICI as a leading UK investment bank switched to a
highly bullish stance on the shares. Not everyone in the City agreed with
Warburg's reasoning but, nevertheless, the jump in ICI shares was worth two
points on the Footsie at the end of the day.
Reuters moved up smartly on hopes of strength on Wall Street. Pharmaceutical
stocks were relatively cautious although Glaxo found some supporters.
The building sectors found a strong lead in excellent trading results from
BPB and, encouraged also by this week's half point reduction in domestic
interest rates, moved up sharply.
While realising that this week's rate cut has effectively ruled out the
likelihood of a cut in the Budget, UK equity strategists are convinced that
there is still room for base rates to come down to 4 per cent, or even
lower, during 1994.
But retail and store shares, still wanting to see genuine signs of an upturn
in both consumer confidence and spending patterns, made little improvement.
However, there was a good deal of activity in the brewing sector where hints
of a large inter-corporate deal have been circulating.
Traders were inclined to see the performance in the market yesterday as a
reminder that, with trading books tight and heavy defensive positions built
up in both traded options and stock index futures, share prices can turn
very sharply on any change in confidence.

note as firmness in the financial services sector helped to offset a weak
energy group.
The TSE 300 index gained 5.8 at 4,229.2 but declines led rises by 401 to 324
after volume of 46.6m shares. Financial services added 1.68 per cent and oil

FT  26 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy gets support at German
expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers, increased
Italy's weighting in the broker's pan-European portfolio yesterday by 3
percentage points to 8.2 per cent against a benchmark 5.3 per cent, writes
Our Markets Staff. This came at the expense of Germany, which is now at 13
per cent against a 15.5 per cent benchmark.
He said that the move reflected as much concern with valuation levels in
Germany, as exploiting Italian opportunities. 'The lack of sensitivity to
movements in short term rates will make the transition from an interest rate
driven market to an earnings driven market difficult for Germany next year,'
he maintained.
But in Italy, the trend of inflation had improved continuously, while a
L8,300bn trade deficit in the first seven months of 1992 had been converted
into an equivalent surplus this year. Mr Rooney saw Italian bonds and the
lira at current levels, supported by these trends, as fundamentally cheap.
Politics remained the joker although any government resulting from next
year's general elections would be better than the series of administrations
that had dragged down the Italian economy over the past two decades.
Mr Rooney had reservations about the stock market, stemming from the
inability to explain its performance in terms of fundamentals, inadequate
dividend growth, and the fact that the transformation of the political and
economic landscape has not been replicated in the corporate sector. 'The
difference is that the market has underperformed in both local and common
currency terms by around 11.5 per cent so far this year and the economic
fundamentals have improved,' he said.
PARIS was bemused by trading in Euro Disney which fluctuated wildly, being
suspended limit down twice, then gaining some 20 per cent in value from its
nadir, before being suspended once more; it finally closed FFr2.20, or 7 per
cent higher at FFr29.40 in turnover of some FFr158m.
With its small weighting in the CAC-40 the price movement had minimal effect
on the index, which raced ahead to end up 47.79 or 2.3 per cent at 2,118.40.
Turnover was estimated at FFr3.7bn. It was suggested that short-covering was
partly behind the market's climb yesterday, with domestic investors taking
advantage of the absence of US institutions to become aggressive buyers.
AMSTERDAM was pulled higher in line with other bourses, the CBS Tendency
index adding 2.4 or 1.8 per cent to 135.7. Turnover was estimated to have
been around Fl 1bn, helped by strength on the options market.
Cyclicals returned to favour, DSM and Akzo showing respective rises of Fl
4.00 and Fl 3.00 to Fl 102.20 and Fl 178.80; good buying was also noted
among financials.
Further strength was seen in KNP BT, the paper group, following Wednesday's
results which were not as bad as some analysts had been forecasting: the
shares rose Fl 1.50 to Fl 41.70. Royal Dutch went against the trend,
slipping Fl 2.10 to Fl 195.60, partly on a weaker oil price.
FRANKFURT climbed on the Volkswagen four-day week agreement, and extended
its gains after hours after Bavaria came in with a drop in its year on year
inflation rate to mid-November. The DAX rose 18.16 to 2,047.71 and the
Ibis-indicated index by another 10.09 in the afternoon to 2,057.80.
Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.5bn with VW accounting for DM980m of that,
far ahead of its average volume. The four-day week was estimated to be worth
a 20 per cent reduction in the carmaker's costs, the shares rose DM9.50 to
DM412 and, in a generally strong automotive sector, Daimler continued its
recovery with a rise of DM12.20 to DM717.
The big results of the day came from Bayer. The prospect of an 18 per cent
fall in 1993 pre-tax profits was less severe than expected, yet the shares
rose only DM1.90 to DM324.50 during the session compared with DM2.70 to
DM278.70 for Hoechst and DM5.10 to DM268.40 for BASF. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok,
head of research at James Capel in Frankfurt, observed that Bayer had been
expected to produce better results than the other big two chemical stocks,
which had underperformed the market in the first three weeks of November,
while Bayer had outperformed.
The bad results came from Metallgesellschaft, where heavy losses, no
dividend and the prospect of a rights issue supported by a defensive coterie
of big corporate shareholders left analysts shaking their heads in despair.
STOCKHOLM saw volatile trading in Volvo after major shareholders said that
they would back the proposed merger between the Swedish group and Renault of
France. The B shares, which had been trading at a high of SKr431 before the
announcement, fell back, closing off SKr3 at SKr407.
The Affarsvarlden general index added 2.0 to 1,314.0.
MILAN continued higher with sentiment helped by signs that the government
had won political consensus on the need to see the budget approved by the
end of the year. The Comit index rose 9.79 or 1.9 per cent to 536.06.
Fiat, firm on Wednesday after it announced plans for redundancies and
temporary lay-offs, bounced L235 or 6.6 per cent higher to L3,800 after
demand by domestic funds sparked short covering. Speculation that the car
group was thinking of selling Alfa Romeo was firmly denied by Fiat.
Sip, L63 higher at L3,029, Olivetti, L25 firmer at L1,805, and Pirelli, L89
ahead at L1,849, continued to pick up ground lost earlier in the week.
Benetton surged L1,140 or 5.4 per cent to L22,290 on the view that the
cheaper lira could help its exports.
MADRID was given a breathing space as the holiday closure in the US took
American sellers out of the market. The general index closed 2.27 higher at
296.78 in turnover down from Pta37.2bn to Pta20.6bn.
Electrical utilities rose in depth, led by Fenosa, up Pta14 at Ptta534, and
Iberdrola, Pta16 better Pta896. Telefonica, which said on Wednesday that it
was well set for Europe-wide competitition in telephone networks, rose Pta30
to Pta1,665.
ZURICH was firmer, but off the day's highs, with activity restrained by the
absence of US investors. The SMI index rose 9.0 to 2,726.8.
Nestle continued higher after Wednesday's 10 month figures, the shares
adding SFr6 to SFr1,185.
Swissair added another SFr9 to SFr756, only SFr4 short of its price ahead of
last weekend's announcement that the Alcazar talks had been called off.
Banks were broadly higher with CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, gaining
SFr40 to SFr3,455.
COPENHAGEN dropped 2 per cent on late selling in thin trading, the KFX index
losing 2.01 to 99.41.
ATHENS was unsettled by reports that the government planned to increase
taxes on share dividends by up to 10 per cent. The story was later denied.
The general index dropped by 13.73 to 851.98.
ISTANBUL hit a new record high on late buying, which left the composite
index up 473.5, or 2.8 per cent, at 17,195.1.
Buying interest concentrated on the iron and steel, cement and banking
sectors, with Eregli rising TL300 to TL6,500.
Turnover was estimated at TL1,400bn.

FT  26 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: French equities falter in uncertain
trading - Prospects for the Paris bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even Mr Edmond Alphandery, the ascetic economy minister, could scarcely
conceal his glee yesterday when he announced that the public part of the
FFr13bn sale of shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the second company to be sold in
France's privatisation drive, had been heavily over-subscribed.
The Economy Ministry is today expected to report that the institutional part
of the Rhone-Poulenc sale has also been comfortably over-subscribed.
The timing could scarcely be better. The successful sale of Rhone-Poulenc
not only sets an encouraging precedent for the next round of privatisations,
scheduled for next year, but comes at a propitious moment when the Paris
stock market seems to be flagging.
The CAC-40 index, which soared to record levels during the summer and early
autumn, has faltered recently on concern about the outcome of the Gatt
negotiations, the Balladur government's cautious approach to cutting
interest rates and the recent spate of industrial unrest in France.
'There is a great deal of uncertainty about the prospects for the market,'
said Mr David Harrington, of James Capel's Paris office. 'The fundamentals
are still strong, but investors are likely to remain nervous until the Gatt
issue has been resolved and there is clear evidence of further falls in
interest rates'.
Once these problems have been addressed, most analysts and economists expect
the market to return to growth. Mr Didier Cherpitel, managing director of
Morgan Stanley in Paris, predicts that the CAC-40 will rise to a new record
of 2,500 next year.
'We are rather optimistic,' he admitted. 'But the economic environment does
look encouraging. If Germany comes out of recession, interest rates could
fall steadily in France and Germany, and that would be a big boost to the
stock market'.
Other observers take a slightly less rosy view. But most are confident,
barring a Gatt impasse, that the CAC-40 Index should reach a new record of
around 2,400 in 1994.
One reason for their confidence is the corporate sector's promising outlook.
Companies have had a tough time in the early 1990s due to the impact of high
interest rates and rising unemployment on domestic demand and, since the
September 1992 currency crisis, the depressive effect of the strong franc on
exports: CAC-40 companies are now approaching the end of their fourth
successive year of earnings decline.
Next year should mark the start of the recovery. Official figures show that
consumer spending was slightly less sluggish during the summer.
The strong franc is still affecting the competitiveness of French exports,
but companies are now achieving significant productivity gains after years
of low inflation and pay restraint. JP Morgan in Paris forecasts an
inflation rate of just 2 per cent in 1994, thereby fuelling further
improvements in cost competitiveness next year.
James Capel expects to see a rebound in CAC-40 earnings of 35 per cent for
1994. But the eventual rate of growth will be heavily influenced by the
progress of interest rate reduction and its impact on the economy.
Salomon Brothers forecasts a fall in short-term interest rates from the
present level of 6.45 per cent to between 4.5 and 5 per cent next year.
The progress of the CAC-40 index will also be determined by the flow of
funds into French equities.
One of the main reasons for the recent slowdown in the Paris market is that
US investors, who invested heavily during the summer bull run, have stopped
pouring new money into France because of the appeal of high yields in the
US.
Most brokers expect to see a fresh influx of funds soon from domestic
investors, thereby compensating for the US withdrawal. But the French have
historically favoured cash over equity investments.
Savings ratios are still rising suggesting that, in spite of the
government's efforts to coax investors into equities through initiatives
such as this summer's highly successful 'Balladur bond' issue, the French
are still not ready to convert their cash into shares.
Recent reductions in interest rates have already made equities seem more
attractive against the dwindling returns on savings.
This trend should continue as interest rates fall further next year, thereby
providing a new pool of money to bolster the market.
The other main influence will be the volume of new equity arriving on the
market. Almost FFr100bn (Dollars 16bn) of new shares have already been added
this year through the combination of the first two privatisations and a
stream of private sector issues, from companies such as Schneider, Axa and
Lafarge Coppee, thereby artificially depressing the index.
'So far, there has been no shortage of takers for these new issues and most
have been healthily over-subscribed,' says Mr Harrington of James Capel.
'Unless there is a Gatt crisis there is no reason why next year's issues
should not be as successful - unless, of course, the government is too
greedy and privatises too many companies too quickly.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bank of Japan move aids
Nikkei
</HEADLINE>

The Tokyo investment community, seeking any sign that the authorities cared
about the descending market, was heartened yesterday by larger than expected
injections into the short term money market by the Bank of Japan, and the
Nikkei average rose for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 155.81 at 17,222.92 after a day's low of
17,003.30 and high of 17,410.04. The Topix index of all first section stocks
improved 5.81 to 1,471.85, but declines led rises by 577 to 467, with 123
issues unchanged.
Traders said sentiment had improved following Wednesday's comments by Mr
Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, expressing concern over
the recent declines in the stock market and saying that he was 'seriously
watching over the movements'.
Volume was 318m shares, against 310m. London continued to take no short term
action on the local Nomura strategy team's 'worst case scenario' for the
Nikkei, fearing a bottom as low as 12,000, and the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
1.66 firmer at 1,188.26.
Money market traders said the central bank had pumped Y900bn into the market
yesterday, prompting a fall in three-month certificate of deposit rates to a
new low of 2.27 per cent. 'Now that the BoJ is moving, let us hope the
government will also act to help stocks,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko
Securities.
The Nikkei fell in early trading, but later firmed on buying by tokkin, or
specified money trusts, and life assurers, who were encouraged by the BoJ's
stance on the money markets. Arbitrage selling and margin unwinding later
hurt the index, but a rise in the futures market in the afternoon prompted
arbitrage buying.
In spite of yesterday's rise, traders said that selling pressure will remain
strong ahead of the settlement of futures and options contracts on December
10.
East Japan Railway rallied Y3,000 to Y439,000, while NTT lost Y7,000 to
Y723,000.
Banks continued to lose ground on fears of mounting bad loans. Some
investors fear that the recent fall in the stock market will hurt banks,
which are trying to write off such assets, covering the losses by realising
profits on shareholdings. Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y30 to Y3,170 and
Bank of Tokyo lost Y50 to Y1,660.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 47.70 to 19,230.96 in volume of 23.5m shares.
Shimano, the bicycle parts maker, moved ahead Y70 to Y2,800.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets put in a mixed performance.
HONG KONG was buoyed by a late round of buying after a day of uncertain
trading. The Hang Seng index finished 48.25 higher at 9,286.31. The mood,
however, remained inhibited by the outlook for the 17th round of
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political reform plans this weekend.
Swire Pacific 'A' surged ahead HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 56: after the market
closed it sold one-third of its Swire Aviation unit to Citic Pacific for
HKDollars 120m. Citic retreated 30 cents to HKDollars 20.50.
AUSTRALIA drifted to a higher close on bargain hunting, with the All
Ordinaries index adding 9.6 at 2,042.0 in thin turnover of ADollars 462.5m.
News Corp gained 30 cents at ADollars 10.10, while BHP shed 6 cents to
ADollars 17.08 after having spent most of the session in positive territory.
SINGAPORE's activity was dominated by Malaysian shares traded over the
counter, and the Straits Times Industrial index moved forward 10.38 to
2,091.17.
SEOUL ended an active day sharply lower on aggressive across-the-board
profit-taking by both institutional and individual investors, and the
composite stock index slipped 9.56 to 819.42. A smaller than expected flow
of customer deposits into securities houses dampened expectations of a
liquidity-driven rally.
TAIWAN was firmer in moderate trading ahead of tomorrow's local government
elections. The weighted index climbed 8.64 to 4,198.52 in turnover of
TDollars 21.1bn.
KUALA LUMPUR was steady in thin volume, with cautious buyers picking up
selected stocks and the composite index moving within a five-point range
before ending just 0.01 higher at 970.31.
BANGKOK saw broking house Phatra Thanakit hit its 10 per cent downward limit
at the close, losing Bt68 at Bt636. This followed news that the stock
exchange authorities fined Phatra Thanakit Bt40m for an erroneous sell order
of Ayudhya Investment and Trust shares on November 17.
Both firms resumed trading, having been suspended since then: Ayudhya
Investment rose Bt12 to Bt141.
The SET index declined 12.41 to 1,309.26 in turnover of Bt11.05bn.
MANILA slipped as investors took profits after trading began in Benpress, a
media and power holding company. The issue, offered at 3.50 pesos, traded up
to 12.25 pesos before closing at 10.50 pesos.
The composite index receded 21.79 to 2,350.61 in turnover of 2.7bn pesos.
BOMBAY ended slightly higher on late buying, reflecting hopes that carry
forward costs to be fixed today would be lower than expectations. The BSE
30-share index advanced 24.59 to 3,077.94.
KARACHI eased at the close on profit-taking and the KSE index finished 2.44
down on balance at 1,702.52, having opened 9.03 points ahead on reports that
the US wants to lift sanctions on Pakistan.
NEW ZEALAND edged forward as the market awaited the formation of a new
cabinet. The NZSE-40 index finished 1.85 up at 2,060.31.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Rate cut rumour hits DM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the US markets closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, flows of money were
restricted and some currencies were vulnerable to rumour yesterday. The
D-Mark was volatile, falling sharply at one stage on misinterpretation of a
comment from the Bundesbank, writes Peter John.
The German currency had been lifted in late European trading on Wednesday
after Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, said increasing
caution was needed by the central bank in its interest rate policy to avoid
pushing up long-term rates over which it has no direct control.
Then, yesterday morning, a news agency reported that Mr Johann-Wilhelm
Gaddum, the Bundesbank vice-president, had said money market rates could
fall to around 4 per cent. The possibility of weaker rates prompted the
German currency to slide against the dollar, the pound and the French franc.
It was also weaker against the Swiss franc, but more as a result of strength
in the Swiss currency than D - Mark weakness.
Shortly afterwards, it was stated that the report on money market rates was
the result of a translation error. By that time, however, German regional
inflation figures from North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria had been
announced.
The data suggested annualised price rises for November might have fallen to
3.7 per cent from October's 3.9 per cent.
They encouraged hopes of a further cut in interest rates that could
regenerate the economy and possibly prompt a re-evaluation of the currency.
However, some economists said the Bundesbank had been obliged to inject
emergency liquidity into the money markets yesterday, suggesting it would be
difficult to bring the repo rate down from its current 6.25 per cent.
Against sterling, the D-Mark fell a pfennig to DM2.5425, while against the
dollar it slipped to DM1.7085 from DM1.7025. It has traded within a narrow
range with the dollar for some weeks, holding between DM1.68 and DM1.72, but
analysts see it continuing to weaken towards the higher end of the scale,
and a shift through DM1.7050 yesterday was significant for chart
specialists.
The Swiss franc edged back after economic data from Basle suggested a sharp
fall in inflation. The currency closed at SFr0.878 to the D - Mark, against
SFr0.877 previously.
The French franc was helped by an announcement from the Bank of France that
it had repaid 80 per cent of the debt it incurred at the end of July through
borrowings from the European Monetary Co-operation Fund.
The money had been borrowed to fight off heavy selling of the French franc
ahead of the widening of the European exchange rate mechanism divergence
bands at the beginning of August.
Economists said the debt repayment was signalled in details provided by the
Bundesbank's weekly balance sheet a few days beforehand, but it was still
good for sentiment.
The franc improved to FFr3.4650 to the D-Mark from FFr3.4680 previously.
Analysts who examine currency movements on the basis of chart trends see the
franc attaining FFr3.44 soon.
Among Mediterranean currencies, the Spanish peseta lost ground against the
D-Mark as one investment house was said to be recommending a switch from
Spanish government bonds to Italian paper.
There is concern over strikes in Spain at the weekend in reaction to the
proposed social pact on wages and jobs. Italy has its own political
problems, but economists were saying that they were now discounted following
sharp falls in Italian shares, government bonds and the currency on Tuesday.
The falls followed extremist victories in local elections which led to fears
of general political uncertainty ahead of next year's national elections and
an uncertain passage for the 1994 budget.
The Italian lira, which hit a record low earlier this week, was little
changed at L989.40 to the D - Mark. The peseta dropped to Pta81.90 against
the D-Mark at one stage but finished at PTa81.51, compared to Pta81.36
previously.
Sterling consolidated gains achieved after the most recent cut in base
rates, which had long been discounted by money market rates. Further helped
by the worries emanating from Germany, it reached DM2.5430 at one stage, a
level which chart specialists see as a significant breakthrough point.
The pound rose marginally against the dollar to Dollars 1.4885 and the
sterling exchange rate index, which measures the pound against a basket of
leading currencies, moved up to 81.7 from 81.6 previously.
In the UK money markets, easy conditions ahead of the Budget next week saw
overnight lending rates trade down to around 4 per cent. The Bank of England
forecast a liquid-ity shortage of Pounds 1.35bn, which was later revised
down to Pounds 1bn and dealt with at the earliest opportunity.
The central bank bought Pounds 730m of short-dated band one bank bills at
the established 5 3/8 per cent rate and Pounds 270m of bills for resale to
the market in equal amounts on December 13 and 14 at 5 13/32 per cent.
The short sterling contract which expires on December 15 was discounting
interest rates of 5.4 per cent, little changed since the base rate cut at
the beginning of the week. However, some dealers pointed out that the
three-month interbank rate of 5 3/8 per cent was, unusually, below short
sterling.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans relieved at capping
of Mexican sugar exports to US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Caribbean sugar producers, who had feared the loss of their United States
market to Mexico when the North American Free Trade Agreement is
implemented, are breathing more easily following the capping of Mexico's
exports to the US for the first six years of the agreement.
The Caribbean exporters, whose production costs have consistently
outstripped world market prices, have managed to preserve their industries
with preferential prices paid for shipments under quota to the European
Union and the US.
Pressure from US legislators representing sugar producing states has led to
a cap of 7,258 tonnes a year on Mexican sugar exports to the US for the
first six years of Nafta.
Caribbean producers, excluding Cuba, have a total US quota of 225,508 tonnes
for the 1993-1994 crop year, following a 16 per cent reduction of last
year's quota by the US Department of Agriculture. The holders of US quotas
are Barbados, Belize, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad
and Tobago.
'There is some doubt as to whether the Mexican industry can reach the degree
of efficiency which will allow it to produce significantly more than its
quota in the short term,' said Mr Frank Downie, chief executive of the Sugar
Industry Authority of Jamaica. 'Current quota holders are unlikely to be
affected by the Mexican industry for many years.'
The Caribbean sugar industry had feared that the implementation of Nafta
would have allowed Mexico's sugar industry unlimited access to the US,
depriving the Caribbean producers of a valuable market.
Under the new arrangements, Mexico will be allowed to ship 25,000 tonnes per
year to the US market if its industry produces a surplus. After the first
six years, the limit will be raised to 150,000 tonnes and the market will
take everything produced if there is a surplus for two consecutive years
then.
The US and Mexico are to phase out barriers to sugar trade over a 15-year
transitional period, starting next year. During that period, Mexico will be
able to export more than its current quota of 7,258 tonnes to the US only if
it becomes a net exporter of sugar.
The US and Mexico agreed to consider Mexico's consumption of high fructose
corn syrup production in determining whether the country was a net sugar
exporter. That was a response to concern in the US industry that Mexico
would have a sugar surplus if it substituted high fructose corn syrup for
sugar.
The Caribbean industry is not unduly worried about the Nafta provisions that
allow Mexico to export up to 250,000 tonnes a year to the US if the country
becomes a net exporter. 'The US quota holders feel relatively safe from
these arrangements,' said Mr Downie. 'Not many in the sugar industry expect
Mexico to become a net producer of sugar for many years to come.'
Mexico is expected to import about 440,000 tonnes of sugar next year.
Consumption is expected to rise steadily, increasing demand for imports and
putting the country further away from being a net producer.
Caribbean industry officials say that even if the Mexican industry can ship
250,000 tonnes to the US each year, the reduction will be shared by all
current quota holders.
The combination of a tight supply/demand balance and 'an ever widening
circle of uncertainty' are continuing to support world sugar prices,
according to London trader ED F. Man, our commodities staff writes.
But this bullish scenario is 'dented' by the possibility of an escalating
surplus of white (refined) sugar, the trader says in the latest issue of its
monthly Sugar Situation report.
'A tight raw sugar situation may emerge particularly in the first half of
next year,' the report says. But 'the apparently ever tightening white sugar
supply picture was not justified by offtake, in the short term at least, in
the short term at least.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New management pulls South
African gold mine back from brink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new management team claims it is breathing new life into East Rand
Proprietary Mines, one of South Africa's oldest and deepest, which has been
at death's door for many years, was about to default on its loans next month
and faced closure.
The South African government has in the past rescued ERPM from
near-bankruptcy, conscious of the fact that it produced about 40m troy
ounces of gold in its 100 years of operation and that there was probably
much more to come out.
Mr Glen Laing, recruited five months ago as managing director, said in
London yesterday that a new mine plan would boost output from 257,000 ounces
this year to nearly 385,000 ounces in 1997. A combination of higher ore
grades and increased productivity would cut mining costs from Dollars 330 an
ounce to Dollars 275 during those four years.
The new team had already won agreement from the unions to move to seven-day
working instead of the five days traditional in South African mines. This
allowed 30 shifts to be worked instead of 24.
Also a bonus scheme was making a substantial impact on productivity. The
scheme was based on one used at the Harmony gold mine where productivity -
measured in square metres of ore mined per man - improved by 46 per cent in
the two years since it was introduced 'and saved that mine', said Mr Laing.
Mr Deon Le Roux, previously mine manager at Harmony, is now mine manager at
ERPM,
The scheme encouraged more effective mining by linking bonuses to the rate
of advance into the mine face and the grade of the ore produced. There was
also a profit-sharing bonus for all employees.
ERPM, located 25km south east of Johannesburg in the town of Boksburg, once
employed 20,000. Now the workforce totals about 6,000. The underground
mining lease is the largest of its kind in the world, covering 13km by 8km,
of which only half has been mined so far.
The gold comes from ore buried 3km to 3.5km deep. The problems of mining at
these depths - rock instability, high temperatures and high humidity - make
ERPM a high-risk mining operation.
Mr Laing said ERPM had built up huge debts but the money had gone to
complete the so-called Far East vertical shaft system that gave access to
higher-grade ore as well as leaving the mine well-equipped in many areas.
Now the company is raising R553m via a rights offer which will leave it debt
free with about R100 surplus cash in the bank. ERPM is certain of collecting
the money because the issue is fully underwritten by Paribas Capital Markets
(about 60 per cent of the shares are owned by private French investors) and
First-Corp Merchant Bank. Mr Laing was with a 'road show' making
presentations to investors in the US, London and Paris.

Last Week saw the Australian market begin to ease after several weeks of
rising prices, which took the market indicator up by 100 cents from the
season's low point of 411c/kg in August. This week the decline accerlerated
and clearances at auction deteriorated at the same time. The market
indicator yesterday reached 469c/kg, and at Melbourne and Fremantle around
30pc of the offering was passed in. The setback was not unexpected but is
proving rather sharper than many traders thought probable.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean copper giant faces
'reform or die' challenge - Chuquicamata is struggling with falling ore
grades, high costs and low prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first, there seems to be little logical explanation for the existence of
Calama. A thriving town of more than 100,000 inhabitants, it is hemmed in on
all sides by the Atacama desert, the driest place on earth.
It is only on careful inspection that one notices, far in the distance, the
belching chimney stacks of Chuquicamata, the world's largest copper mine, on
which Calama depends.
Without Chuquicamata - the 80-year-old, state-run mine that accounts for 6
per cent of global copper production - the town would sink back into the
desert sands. Although the mine employs slightly fewer than 10,000 workers,
more than half Calama's population is economically dependent on it.
It is against this background that falling ore grades and high production
costs at the mine, coupled with slumping copper prices, become of great
concern. Worrying too is the assessment of Mr Raul Melendez, head of
Chuquicamata's finance department, that: 'We have to change the way we
operate within five years or we're going to die a natural death'.
Part of that change, provoked by growing competition from Chile's private
sector mines, involves the break-up of Chuquicamata from next year into
seven autonomous business units. The scheme, described as 'highly sensitive'
by managers, is under discussion with the mine's powerful unions.
The idea is to create an 'internal market' by splitting the operation into
separate profit centres that will 'sell' services to one another, according
to Mr Gilberto Ortega, a member of Chuquicamata's finance team. The scheme
aims to spotlight inefficiency, judge management performance and introduce
market incentives.
'The important thing is that each unit should have its own management and
make its own profits. Poorly performing units will have to change or
disappear,' Mr Ortega says. After a two-year experimental phase, units will
be permitted to sell services outside the mine.
It is not yet clear how the theory will work out in practice, given that
Chuquicamata operates as an organic process. Rather than expose each unit to
the profit-or-die laws of the marketplace, it seems likely that the new
structure will be used to pinpoint areas where savings can be made.
Unions are likely to oppose such reforms, which may be regarded as a
potential assault on jobs and pay. Worse still, the planned reorganisation
smacks of privatisation by stealth.
Managers speak, however, of a 'cultural shift' among Chuquicamata's workers,
who they say are increasingly open to change. Evidence of this came earlier
this year when workers signed a three-year wage agreement. Unlike 1991, when
there was a two-week strike in pursuit of better pay and conditions, workers
this year settled for a deal that merely kept pay in line with inflation.
There is growing recognition that Chuquicamata must become more efficient if
it is to survive, managers say. Such sentiments have been sharpened by the
association last month of Codelco, the state-owned copper concern, with a
US/Canadian consortium for the development of the huge El Abra mine.
As Codelco's first joint venture, the Dollars 1bn project is being trumpeted
as a great leap forward. Chile will receive Dollars 404m in return a 51 per
cent stake. Without investing so much as a peso, the country will collect 49
per cent of profits. Moreover, El Abra copper will be produced at 40-45
cents a pound, compared with an average of 69 cents over Codelco's four
divisions.
Chuquicamata, with production costs of about 58 cents a pound, remains
Codelco's most cost-effective mine. However, that figure is partly disguised
by extremely low-cost metal derived from Mina Sur, the mine's rich oxide
deposit.
Copper from Chuquicamata's main sulphide mine, a terraced pit measuring 2km
by 4km, is increasingly expensive to produce as the mine deepens and ore
grades decline. Standing beside the gouged and dynamited hole - at the base
of which towering trucks appear the size of ants - it is easy to appreciate
the difficulty of keeping costs in check.
In addition to the mine reorganisation, managers intend to cut staff. They
hope that through early and disability retirement, plus a hiring freeze, the
workforce can be reduced by nearly 1,500 to 8,575 by 1995. There is also
likely to be a crack down on what managers regard as lost time during shift
changeovers.
Chuquicamata's non-core infrastructure, which includes housing, schools and
sports facilities, is also to be scrutinised. The site hospital alone, which
guarantees free medical treatment to staff and their families, costs Dollars
15m a year. 'We're looking into ways of reducing these costs,' says Mr
Melendez.
Chile's government, which controls Codelco's investment budget, has made it
clear that it expects cost-cutting. Mr Eduardo Frei, almost certain to be
president after elections in December, recently told an election rally:
'Those copper companies that are incapable of producing at less than 60
cents a pound are going to collapse'.
Politicians are also using El Abra as a rod with which to beat Chuquicamata,
the management of which is desperate to develop the replacement ore bodies
of Radomiro Tomic and Mansa Mina. Currently the law prohibits these
deposits, regarded as belonging to Chuquicamata, from being developed in
association with foreign partners. But no one doubts the desire of many
politicians to scrap that stipulation.
'If Codelco wants to develop new mines on its own it will have to transform
itself radically in terms of productivity and efficiency,' said Mr Alejandro
Foxley, finance minister. As the government diverts money to social
programmes, the budget left over for Codelco is barely sufficient to
implement environmental clean-ups and to keep mines ticking over.
In the meantime, it is not merely the inhabitants of Calama who are relying
on the continued profitability of Chuquicamata, the backbone of the Chilean
economy. Although low copper prices have severely dented profits,
Chuquicamata still accounts for around 7 per cent of Chile's GDP.
Whether the government opts to keep the mine entirely in state hands or to
broaden its scope for attracting foreign capital is still up for debate.
What is certain, however, is that the next administration will do all it can
to prevent its most important asset from suffering a slow and painful death.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa prices surge on Ivory
Coast worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cocoa market surged yesterday in busy trading in spite of the New York
market being closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. The March futures contract
at the London Commodity Exchange gained Pounds 29 a tonne to close at the
day's high of Pounds 1,048 a tonne as traders continued to express concerns
about the political situation in the Ivory Coast - the world's largest
producer.
Fears for the health of Ivorian President Houphouet-Boigny have been fueled
by a total blackout on news concerning him following rumours earlier this
week that he was dead. On Monday, near March coffee prices reached a high of
Pounds 1,056 a tonne, as the market feared political unrest in the Ivory
Coast, which has been one of Africa's more stable economies.
Cocoa prices have been buoyed for several months on reports of a deficit in
this year's crop. The low estimates for the cocoa harvest have since been
upgraded, but the market still believes that the past two years of
production deficits could augur a longer term trend.
There are still problems associated with this year's Ivory Coast crop, with
reports of poor quality, some late harvesting and a shortage of bags. At the
same time, consumption is increasing and processors are eager to stock up on
supplies.
'What you're seeing is that the people who need cocoa are doubling up on
their cover so that if they don't receive the physical delivery, they could
at least take the futures instead', said Mr Tony Chadwick, cocoa trader at
Prudential Bache, the London securities house.
But he sounded a note of caution about the bull run. 'The higher the price
goes, the more likely that countries introduce cocoa butter substitutes,' he
warned.
Members of the Cocoa Producers' Alliance have agreed to restrict output in
an attempt to build on the recent rise in prices. But Indonesia, a large
producer but not a CPA member, is refusing to co-operate and is increasing
its own production, which could jeopardise the success of the scheme.
The CPA agreement has no future and will not work, Brazilian cocoa traders
insisted yesterday, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro.
Alliance members, including Brazil, agreed on Wednesday in Guayaquil,
Ecuador, that each would limit its annual production to its average over the
past three years.
But Brazil's traders dismissed the plan. 'I suppose they're going to tell
the trees to stop growing cocoa,' said one. 'It's a completely stupid plan
and when I say that, I'm being diplomatic,' he added.
The agreement still has to be approved by the CPA's council of ministers in
January before it can come into effect, but Brazil's exporters said that
even if that happened, it would not be a guarantee that the plan would work.
'Maybe the agreement will be signed but even so, I can't see any way it will
actually function,' said one dealer. 'It will probably take a few years just
for everyone to agree on what is their average for the last three years. How
are you going to control what each members' level is?'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Firmer tone in European prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid thin volume with US markets closed for Thanksgiving, European bonds
firmed on fresh easing hopes after reports that the Bundesbank's
vice-president said conditions in Germany may offer room for further
declines in interest rates.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum was reported to have made the comments after
delivering a prepared speech in Paris. Early news reports of that speech
caused market confusion after a news agency incorrectly reported Mr Gaddum
as saying that German money market rates would fall to 4 per cent. It later
corrected the story, stating the error stemmed from incorrect simultaneous
translation of the speech.
The December bund contract blipped higher after the erroneous report and
shed few of the gains when it was rectified. It finished at 99.78, up 0.21
point from Wednesday's close.
Meanwhile, more regional German inflation data indicated that German
inflation is continuing its steady decline. According to Mr Armin Kayser,
economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Frankfurt, the November data indicate a
seasonally adjusted month-on-month rise of 0.2 per cent and a year-on-year
rate of 3.7 per cent.
'This is the fourth consecutive month of declining inflation, and the data
indicate we won't have to revise our optimistic inflation outlook,' he said.
French bonds outperformed their German counterparts after the Bank of
France's weekly statement indicated that net currency reserves had risen by
FFr31.6bn in the week to November 18. That put reserves FFr8.3bn in the
black, the first positive balance since the summer currency crisis which
depleted the country's foreign currency reserves.
In recent months the central bank has resisted cutting interest rates to
protect the franc while rebuilding its reserves. But 'now that they are long
reserves, I feel the chances of a small near-term repo rate cut have
increased,' said a French bond trader. The French central bank's next
open-market operation is on Monday.
The French 10-year yield gap over German bunds narrowed to 14 basis points
from around 20 basis points on Wednesday, and traders see it shrinking back
to near-parity if France does ease rates independently of Germany.
UK gilts were buoyed by firmer German and French bonds, with the long gilt
contract ending some  3/8 point higher at 115 21/32 .
Prices were further supported by the drop in oil prices caused by
Wednesday's Opec decision not to cut production, which was seen to improve
the already positive inflation outlook and prompted buying of longer
maturities, traders reported.
Spanish bonds rose only slightly and the currency was dogged by nervousness
ahead of today's third-quarter jobless data and the spectre of a general
strike. The long bond contract on MEFF ended 0.15 point higher at 102.44.
Italian bonds fared slightly better, lifted by strong markets elsewhere and
hopes that the 1994 budget will be passed. The BTP future on LIFFE ended at
112.76, up 0.24 point.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Ontario returns with DM1.5bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Province of Ontario lost no time in returning to the Eurobond market
yesterday, now that the uncertainty surrounding its rating had been lifted.
On Wednesday, Standard &amp; Poor's cut the long-term debt ratings of the
province of Ontario and Ontario Hydro to double-A minus from double-A.
Ontario, which had been absent from the Eurobond market since early
September, raised DM1.5bn through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds, its first
offering in the D-Mark sector for nine years.
Canadian issuers can tap the D-Mark sector now that international sanctions
against South Africa have been lifted. They had shunned the sector while the
sanctions were in force because of the German banks' links with South
Africa.
The timing of the issue sent a strong signal to the market that Ontario had
put the downgrading behind it and would now proceed with its heavy borrowing
programme.
'The downgrading has unfortunately happened and we will now drive on,' said
Mr Ronald Otsuki, Ontario's director of capital markets. He added that he
was encouraged by Moody's decision to hold Ontario's rating at Aa2.
Prior to yesterday's deal, Ontario said it expected to borrow an additional
CDollars 2.6bn through public issues in the current fiscal year, ending
March 31 1994. This would bring total fiscal 1994 borrowings to CDollars
11.7bn.
Yesterday's offering, the proceeds of which are likely to be swapped back
into Canadian dollars, reduces the additional borrowing to CDollars 1.4bn.
Mr Otsuki said that if the opportunity arose, Ontario would seek to pre-fund
next year's borrowing programme, of CDollars 9bn-CDollars 10bn.
He added that he had chosen the D-Mark sector because it offered the
lowest-cost funds of all global markets and that the opportunity and demand
was there.
The bonds will be priced today to yield 47-49 basis points over underlying
German government bonds. Syndicate managers said the pricing was fair but
added that had Ontario not been downgraded, the yield spread on the bonds
would have been seven basis points tighter.
Elsewhere, activity was slow due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the US.
Honda Motor, a well-known name in the Euroyen sector, raised Y50bn through
an issue of Eurobonds due 2001, via Nikko.
Today, Sumitomo Realty and Development plans to raise a total of Y80bn
through three Eurobond offerings.

steps up Eurobond issues / Finding increasing international acceptance of

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Brazilian private-sector companies are increasingly looking to the Eurobond
market to raise money for capital investment, taking advantage of the
growing international acceptance of Brazilian paper.
Eurobond issues are also becoming more diverse. For example, Minas Gerais,
part of the country's industrialised south-east region, is preparing
Brazil's first Eurobond issue by a state, which will be sold with an equity
warrant allowing investors to buy shares in its electricity company.
The corporate sector will issue around Dollars 1bn in the second half of
1993, more than double the first-half figure and total Eurobond issues are
expected to be more than Dollars 5.5bn this year. Private companies will
account for about 30 per cent of the market volume in the second half of
this year, twice the share for last year.
Private companies are finding it easier because investors are becoming
increasingly used to Brazilian paper through bonds issued by the banks and
large government-controlled companies. This followed a virtual stagnation in
the second half of 1992, caused by corruption allegations against former
President Fernando Collor.
A higher proportion of the money is being spent on capital investment,
although companies are still putting part of the funds into the
high-yielding local money markets. 'We're seeing more corporate issues,
rather than issues by banks, and a lot of the money is going on plant and
equipment,' says Mr Charles Spragins, corporate affairs director at Citibank
Brasil.
Despite inflation of nearly 2,000 per cent a year and an economy lacking the
structural reforms carried out in Mexico, Chile and Argentina, many
Brazilian companies are planning investments after restructuring and
reducing costs, particularly in the capital intensive steel and pulp
industries.
Investors are willing to take on the 'Brazil risk', thanks to the country's
Dollars 27bn international reserves which make central bank restrictions on
repayments highly unlikely.
Ironically, Brazil's economic problems have been the key to attracting
investors because companies have to pay some of the world's highest interest
rate spreads. Although spreads have fallen some 200 basis points this year,
as Brazilian paper has become more acceptable, they are still about 100
points above Argentina and 200 points above Mexico.
Yet even at these rates it is still attractive for companies to issue
Eurobonds. For a five-year bond, issuers are paying 400-500 basis points
above US Treasury notes, of about 5 per cent, compared to inflation plus
16-18 percentage points in the domestic bond market.
Issuers have raised more than Dollars 5bn this year and there are still
several hundred million dollars of Brazilian issues planned by Christmas.
But with an uncertain world bond market, mainly due to higher US interest
rates, some companies will have to pay higher spreads, says Mr Vincent
Parkin, Brazilian representative for CS First Boston. He adds, however, that
after a hiatus there could be a large number of issues in the new year.
Bankers expect more equity-linked issues from companies and institutions
like the National Development Bank, which has stock in more than a hundred
Brazilian companies.
The Minas Gerais bond with warrant issue, to be lead managed by French-owned
Banque Indosuez, is expected by the end of this year or early next year and
will be for up to Dollars 200m. To pay a lower spread, the state will offer
investors the option to buy shares in its electricity company Cemig at a
predetermined price.
This follows Brazil's first equity warrant issue in August when Bombril, a
household cleaning products manufacturer, placed Dollars 150m of paper.
Among private-sector companies going to the Euromarkets for investment funds
is Metalurgica Gerdau, a family-owned steel company, which raised Dollars
100m in early November. The eight-year bond, with two put options at three
and five years, paid a spread above the relevant US Treasury note, of
450-500 basis points. It was lead managed by Citibank.
Suzano de Papel e Celulose, a pulp company with interests in the
petrochemical sector, raised Dollars 80m in October, paying a spread of 522
basis points.
Bankers say the bond market may be influenced by next year's presidential
elections. They also stress the importance of progress on the Brady Plan
foreign debt agreement.
'The Brady Plan could be the stepping stone needed for institutions to enter
the corporate market in a big way, like they did with Mexico a couple of
years ago,' says Mr Parkin.

Portugal yesterday signed agreements with the European Investment Bank for
eight loans totalling Ecu516m for transport, telecommunication and energy
projects.
The new loans raise EIB lending to Portugal this year to a total of
Ecu1.5bn, up 20 per cent on lending in 1992.
The loans represent 2.5 per cent of Portugal's gross domestic product.
Portugal thus displaces Denmark as the biggest per capita beneficiary of EIB
loans, receiving 9.5 per cent of the total EIB loan budget. The EIB plans to
issue up to a further Es35bn in escudo-denominated Navigator Bonds this year
to add to a previous three issues also totalling Es35bn.

bank licences

<TEXT>
Mexico is set to open up its financial system to foreign competition early
next year. The finance ministry plans to give licences to as many as 25 US
and Canadian banks, a government official said.
The opening is prescribed by the North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta), and the necessary legal changes were presented to congress
yesterday. The new law will gradually eliminate restrictions on US and
Canadian investment in Mexico's banking, brokerage and insurance sector.
Excluding Citibank, which manages a branch under a special agreement, the
banks will be the first foreign financial houses to operate subsidiaries in
Mexico.
JP Morgan, Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and
American Express from the US, and Bank of Montreal, the Royal Bank of
Canada, the Bank of Nova Scotia from Canada, have shown interest in a
licence to open a subsidiary, the official said. Several US and Canadian
subsidiaries of non-American banks are also seeking licences.
The free trade agreement allows US- and Canadian-incorporated banks
initially to take up to 8 per cent of the banking market as measured by
capital, or about Dollars 830m. The limit is increased until all significant
restrictions are scrapped by the year 2000. Each individual foreign bank
would be initially restricted to 1.5 per cent of the market, or about
Dollars 150m of capital.
Mr Alvaro Vazquez, managing director of corporate finance at JP Morgan, said
his bank would make 'a significant commitment in terms of capital and
people' to Mexico if granted a licence. JP Morgan, like scores of other
banks, has a representative office in Mexico.
Mr Stefano Natello, an analyst with CS First Boston, doubts the new banks
will enter the retail market, because of the high costs of setting up a
branch network. Instead, they will concentrate on the corporate sector.

<TEXT>
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, is to invest more than
Dollars 1bn in Argentina in the next four years. It wants to upgrade and
expand its retail and refinery businesses and increase oil exploration and
production.
The investments, to begin in 1994, will modernise its ageing refineries,
raising capacity and improving environmental controls to meet more stringent
regulations. The company's retail network will also be expanded and
upgraded.
Royal Dutch made the announcement in the Netherlands this week during a
state visit by Argentina's President Carlos Menem.
It said: 'The idea is to have an integrated company in five years.' Royal
Dutch has traditionally concentrated on the refining and retail sectors of
the oil industry in Argentina, rather than production.
It said that political stability, pro-business government policies and
economic growth had substantially increased Argentina's attractiveness.
The new investment programme comes at a time of increasing competition in
the once tightly-controlled oil industry.
In 1991, the government deregulated the industry. In June it partially
privatised YPF, the national oil company. YPF, now 45 per cent-controlled by
private investors, is Argentina's only fully-integrated company and controls
half the domestic oil industry.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hollywood stars in race for
small-screen exposure - Plans by Paramount and Warner Brothers to establish
television networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Hollywood's largest film studios - Paramount Pictures and Warner
Brothers - are racing to establish new US television broadcasting networks.
And about the only thing they agree on is that there is only room for one of
them to succeed.
Both companies have recently announced plans to launch a fifth broadcasting
network. It would compete against the three long-established networks - CBS,
NBC, and ABC - and the upstart Fox Broadcasting, launched in 1986 by Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
Paramount, which is in a joint venture with Chris-Craft industries, owner of
six independent television stations, intends to launch its service in
January 1995. Warner, which has teamed up with Tribune Broadcasting, owner
of seven stations, aims to have its service running by next autumn.
While details of the Paramount and Warner plans differ considerably, both
are essentially trying to emulate Fox.
Fox has built up its network by winning over local independent broadcasting
stations around the country, and by gradually increasing the amount of
original programmes it broadcasts.
Its original output still falls well short of the Big Three, and is
concentrated substantially in the 8pm-10pm prime time slot and in children's
programming. However, its 140 affiliated stations reach around 95 per cent
of American television households.
To attract the national advertising necessary to make a new network
financially viable, Paramount and Warner have to sign up affiliates who can
put their programmes into at least 80 per cent of homes.
Both companies agree the 280 broadcast stations which remain independent -
and which they are targeting - are sufficient only for one more network, and
even that will require some cable partners, or tie-ups with affiliates of
existing networks.
'There's no room for two more networks,' says Mr Robert Daly, chairman of
Warner Brothers. He has appointed Mr Jamie Kellner, who played a key role in
the birth of the Fox network, to do the same for his company.
'The battle will be won or lost in terms of who signs the bulk of the
non-affiliated independents, and that's where all the arm-twisting, and
salesmanship and persuasion is going on,' says Mr Kerry McCluggage, chairman
of Paramount's television group.
But is there even room for a fifth network? After all, the Big Three, which
used to account for over 90 per cent of US television viewing, have seen
their share drop to around 60 per cent with the expansion of cable
television.
Do viewers want yet more general broadcasting, rather than the
narrowly-focused programmes offered by cable? Paramount and Warner Brothers
note that the networks actually gained viewers at the expense of cable this
autumn for the first time in years, suggesting that market share may be
stabilising.
They also point out that some 40 per cent of US population is not wired for
cable, nor likely to be in the near future; and that part of the Big Three's
loss of market share has been to Fox and other independent broadcasting
stations as they improved the quality of their programmes.
The independents have been bolstering their traditional fare of local
sports, news and old movies with so-called first-run syndication shows -
series produced by Hollywood specially for this market.
The trend was pioneered by Paramount, which launched an offshoot of its
long-running, but still extremely popular, Star Trek science fiction series
into first-run syndication in the late 1980s. The move to a fifth network is
logical progression from first-run syndication, but it has also been spurred
by a big change in the structure of the television production industry.
For the past two decades, anti-trust regulations have restricted the Big
Three networks' ability to own and produce the prime-time entertainment they
broadcast, and to benefit from later syndication of these shows, most of
which are are made by Hollywood.
However, a court ruling this month sounded the death knell for this
restriction, and the Big Three are preparing to increase their output of
shows, forcing Hollywood to look for additional outlets.
Paramount and Warner plan to start their networks with just two hours of
original programming two nights a week. Paramount will feature a new Star
Trek series.
Warner has not given any programme details, but strengths include its
expertise in children's cartoons and the talents of producers like Steven
Spielberg.
Although Warner initially announced plans for a much fuller, faster roll-out
of its network than Paramount, it has had to slow down. Potential affiliates
baulked at having to share advertising revenues from the lucrative 5pm-6pm
and noon-2pm time periods with the national network.
Warner has also faced resistance over the financing of its network. The
company, which owns no broadcasting stations, has had to reduce the size of
the up-front 'guarantee' it wants affiliates to pay it to help fund the
roll-out. It also wants a share of any increase in affiliates' profits.
Paramount, which owns four independent stations, is not asking affiliates
for cash, and maintains it can make its network viable with money from
national advertising and from its local stations, whose value should be
increased by network affiliation.
Warner initially planned to establish quickly a related cable television
network to carry its channel into so-called 'white areas' of the nation,
where there is no unaffiliated independent station.
However because of the reduction in its up-front payments and its more
modest programming goals, it has deferred that plan. Instead, it aims to
reach these areas initially through ad hoc syndication deals with affiliates
of the four existing broadcast networks - roughly the same approach being
pursued by Paramount.
Warner claims to have signed up affiliates representing some 42 per cent of
US households, while Paramount is on 33 per cent.
The battle has a long way to go, and could be complicated by the outcome of
the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for the Paramount studio's parent,
Paramount Communications, whose new owners might have different priorities.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Write-offs stemming from the acquisition of a trust company and a discount
brokerage firm helped push Toronto-Dominion Bank's fiscal 1993 earnings down
by almost a third.
Earnings at Canada's fifth-biggest bank dropped to CDollars 275m (USDollars
206.9m), or 82 cents a share, in the year to October 31, from CDollars 408m,
or CDollars 1.25, a year earlier. The return on equity slipped to 5.4 per
cent from 8.4 per cent.
The latest year's earnings would have been CDollars 393m, or CDollars 1.21,
without restructuring costs stemming from the purchase of Central Guaranty
Trust and a fourth-quarter write-off of the purchase price for the Marathon
brokerage business.
Loan-loss provisions rose to CDollars 600m from CDollars 543m.
Non-performing loans fell to CDollars 1.22bn on October 31, from CDollars
1.59bn a year earlier.
The bank predicted that loan losses would decline and earnings improve in
1994, provided the economic recovery in North America was sustained.
Fourth-quarter earnings fell to CDollars 82m from CDollars 113m, due to the
Marathon write-off. Net interest income in the quarter rose, however, to
CDollars 601m from CDollars 529m. Fee income, mainly from securities, credit
cards, safekeeping and trust services, grew by 18 per cent.
Assets stood at CDollars 85bn on October 31, up from CDollars 74.1bn.
National Bank of Canada's 1993 earnings rose to CDollars 175m, or CDollars
1.01 a share, from CDollars 1m, or a loss of 29 cents per common share, last
year.

<TEXT>
Lawson Mardon, the Toronto-based packaging group which is the object of a
takeover bid by Switzerland's Alusuisse-Lonza Holdings, has blamed deepening
recession in Europe and unfavourable exchange rates for a 5.8 per cent drop
in nine-month operating earnings.
Net earnings increased to CDollars 14.3m (USDollars 10.8m) or 36 cents a
share, from CDollars 4.9m, or 17 cents a year earlier. But last year's
figure included a restructuring charge of CDollars 15m.
Sales were fractionally lower at CDollars 951.4m.
Alusuisse said earlier this month that it plans to offer CDollars 555m, or
CDollars 14 a share, for all Lawson's outstanding shares. Cragnotti and
Partners, the Italian investment group, has agreed to tender its 32.7 per
cent stake, which is equal to a 52.6 per cent voting interest.
Alusuisse's bid, which would be a substantial premium on the earlier market
price, is subject to a due diligence examination. This is presently underway
and is expected to be completed by the end of December.
Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 4.3m, up from CDollars 3.8m a year
earlier. Primary per-share earnings amounted to 11 cents, against 13 cents
previously. Sales were CDollars 330.2m, against CDollars 327.9m a year
earlier.
Slack economic activity in Germany, France and Spain has encouraged
customers to run down inventories and cut back on purchases. About
four-fifths of Lawson's sales are in Europe. The UK is its biggest market.
Mr Andrea Mattiussi, chief executive, said the company is responding to the
tough climate by cutting costs and tightening its focus on its three core
businesses of flexible packaging, folding cartons and labels.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: State Bank of NSW to be sold off
next month
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The State Bank of New South Wales, Australia's largest regional bank, is to
be put up for sale next month.
The state government announced yesterday that it would invite tenders for
the bank in December and introduce legislation into parliament shortly
enabling the sale to go ahead.
Forecasts for the sale proceeds vary widely. A NSW treasury estimate puts
the figure at between ADollars 400m and ADollars 700m (USDollars
266m-USDollars 465m), but at the upper end some analysts suggest that a
figure of ADollars 900m to ADollars 1bn would not be unrealistic.
The NSW government said it was aiming for a trade sale, but specifically
excluded the four big Australian banks from the bidding. 'The sale will be
limited to regional Australian banks, Australian non-bank financial
institutions with the financial strength to make the acquisition, and
foreign banks with an identified strategic interest in Australia,' said Mr
John Fahey, state premier.
The 'preferred' terms of sale include provisions that the existing staffing
and branch structure is retained; that the bank's headquarters remain in
Sydney; and that the bank remains 'a viable independent entity'.
News of the auction comes less than a week after SBNSW announced a ADollars
74.6m net loss for the 12 months to the end of September, down from a profit
of ADollars 25.4m in the previous year.
The 1992-93 figure, however, came after a ADollars 96m abnormal charge, and
the bank was keen to stress that a pre-tax operating loss in the first half
turned into a profit in the second six months. Charges for bad and doubtful
debts fell to ADollars 140.4m from ADollars 152.4m, and Mr John O'Neill,
managing director, claimed that 'the worst is behind us in terms of problem
loans'.
Like most state governments, New South Wales has been seeking to reduce its
budget deficit and contain debt, but maintain expenditure on health and
community services. Capital spending has been reined back, and the
privatisation proceeds should ease financial pressures.
'The people of New South Wales do not benefit from owning a bank, as much as
they would by re-investing the same money in core services of government,'
argued Mr Peter Collins, state treasurer.
However, Mr Bob Carr, the NSW opposition leader, accused the government of
holding a firesale and said that the bank - which he claimed could be worth
as much as ADollars 1.5bn - was being sold at 'precisely the wrong time'.
A number of potential bidders, including Advance Bank, St George Bank and
GIO Australia, have made clear that they will at least review the sale
terms.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bad loans cloud banks'
contrition / Examining another set of miserable figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When Japanese banks announced another set of miserable profits yesterday and
took the unusual step of writing-off loan losses, the general intention was
to convey the image of an industry that has admitted its weaknesses and is
on the road to recovery.
That impression was given by Sakura Bank, whose core banking profits slipped
37.9 per cent during the first half. Sakura, aware that banks are blamed by
the public for pumping up the financial bubble of the late 1980s, made clear
its contrition.
'In the wake of the economic bubble, financial institutions have
reconsidered their role in society and have reaffirmed their commitment to
fulfilling higher expectations in regard to their social responsibilities
and public duties,' the bank humbly explained.
But the difficulty in regarding this as a sign that the banks have weathered
the worst of the bubble's consequences is that the depth of their bad loans
remains unclear. Officially, problem loans rose by 9.6 per cent during the
half to September, but the official measure hardly tells the full story of
the banks' exposure to a still-weak property market.
The failure earlier this month of Muramoto Construction, which had
outstanding debts of as much as Y590bn (Dollars 5.51bn), indicated that the
nasty surprises are not over. An executive at one Japanese financial company
warned yesterday that the commercial property market is in distress, and
that the country could face collapses of companies and confidence next year.
There is still no accurate guide to the exposure of bank affiliates, which
were aggressive lenders during the bubble days. In addition, as the Muramoto
case shows, banks are unsure of the exposure of some leading corporate
clients, which may have guaranteed loans themselves or used the same piece
of property collateral many times over.
Apart from coping with the ills of the property market, Japan's banks face a
harsher trading environment over the next year. The favourable spreads
created by the fall in interest rates over the past two years have shrunk,
as was shown by the general 10.6 per cent decline in core business profits
announced yesterday.
Sumitomo Bank, whose business profits fell by the industry average,
explained that its overall spread slipped from 0.39 per cent to 0.31 per
cent during the six months from March. With the official discount rate at a
record low of 1.75 per cent, there is little room for another interest rate
cut over the next year.
Another problem for the banks is their old foe, the Tokyo stock market,
which has faltered since the end of the first half in September, eroding the
banks' unrealised gains on their vast equity holdings. To cover loan losses,
the banks have been selling stocks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the largest Japanese
commercial bank, for example, took profits of Y52.2bn during the period.
But the fall in stock prices means that the banks may face losses on some of
their equity portfolios, which would need to be written off at the end of
the year. Bank stocks have been weak recently, which is another bad sign, as
the selling of bank stocks heralded a sharp fall in the market last year.
Bond markets have been more sympathetic to the banks. The expectation of
lower interest rates pushed bond prices higher, enabling the banks to report
large dealing profits. Sumitomo reported profits of Y9.6bn from bond
dealing, and Fuji Bank Y7.3bn.
The difficult conditions have prompted the industry generally to reduce its
exposure to international markets. Revenue from international business fell
by an average 14.4 per cent, which was partly explained by the yen's
appreciation, but there were falls of 42 per cent at Sakura and 27 per cent
at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank.
Doubts also remain over the banks' willingness to lend to companies other
than their core corporate clients. The Bank of Japan, which has encouraged
the write-offs of bad loans, has warned against the banks becoming too
risk-averse, slowing the flow of loans needed to fuel economic recovery.
But the banks remain committed to the domestic property market. Loans to the
property industry at many of the leading 11 banks were steady or rose during
the period. Mitsubishi Bank said there are still 'opportunities in the
property market' which are not risky and a part of normal banking business.
The banks have also been unable to cut their general and administration
expenses deeply enough to lift their profits. These expenses rose at some
banks, even though the same institutions claimed to be in the middle of a
cost-cutting drive. This suggests that branch closures and staff reductions
will be needed over the next couple of years.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Citic buys 30% stake in Swire
Aviation

China's involvement in Hong Kong's aviation industry deepened yesterday with
Citic Pacific's HKDollars 120m (USDollars 15m) acquisition of a 30 per cent
stake in Swire Aviation.
Swire Aviation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Swire Pacific and its main
asset is a 30 per cent interest in Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals (HACTL) -
Hong Kong's air cargo monopoly based at Kai Tak airport.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman of Swire Pacific, said the deal would strengthen
the relationship between Swire and Citic Pacific.
Citic Pacific, which also owns 12.5 per cent of Cathay Pacific, is
controlled by China International Trust and Investment Corporation - an arm
of the Chinese central government. It has also partnered Swire Pacific in
property development in Hong Kong.
The Chinese government has used Citic to build up substantial interests in
the 'commanding heights' of Hong Kong's economy. In addition to its
shareholding in Cathay it owns 20 per cent of Hongkong Telecom.
It is the likely mainland Chinese candidate to invest in Hongkong Electric
or China Light &amp; Power, the colony's two electricity utilities  - a move
which is expected before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.

DDI, one of Japan's new long-distance telecommunications companies which are
competing for market share against Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, saw a
sharp rise in interim sales due to an jump in subscribers during the first
six months to September.
Non-consolidated sales rose 19.5 per cent to Y132.6bn (Dollars 1.22bn) while
operating profits increased 7 per cent to Y18.7bn. However, the company,
which went public in September, posted a marginal rise of 1.6 per cent in
pre-tax profits to Y13.4bn due to listing costs.
Revenues from telephone calls rose 13.7 per cent to Y100.2bn, while revenue
from specialised services rose 15.4 per cent to Y2.4bn. Income from other
related businesses rose 44.4 per cent to Y29.9bn.
New subscription contracts totalled 2.2m during the first half, pushing
outstanding contracts up 25 per cent to 11m. Costs in issuing new shares
ahead of its listing totalled Y1.9bn.
For the full year to March, DDI expects the price war against NTT to take
its toll on earnings. The company cut its rates earlier this month following
a similar move by NTT in October.
DDI forecasts its first fall in annual pre-tax profits since the company was
established in 1984, due to an 18 per cent fall in revenue from telephone
calls.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Israeli bank offering postponed
until January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel yesterday said it would delay a public offering of 10 per cent of the
shares in Bank Leumi, the country's second largest bank, after the flop
earlier this week of a 10 per cent offering in Bank Hapoalim.
The finance ministry said the offering, which was scheduled for next Monday,
would be postponed until January but that the government was determined to
press ahead with the sale of leading banks.
The move followed the failure of this week's sale of a 10 per cent tranche
of Bank Hapoalim, which was massively undersubscribed after investors
criticised the government for abolishing the maximum price on share issues,
leaving out underwriters and not attaching options or warrants.
The government also said that only 53 per cent of the Hapoalim shares had
been sold, not 69 per cent as originally reported. The correction was made
after it was revealed that a Shk900,000 (Dollars 306,000) order for shares
by General Bank had mistakenly been written down at Shk90m. The issue raised
Shk314m, not Shk403m as originally announced.
The government's decision to postpone the offer was also taken after Bank
Leumi shares, which were sold earlier this year, fell on the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange to one point lower than the minimum price of the government's
offer.
Mr Aharon Foegel, director-general of the finance ministry, said the
government was determined to learn the lessons and press ahead with its bank
privatisations. He said the market had shown that it wanted shares to be
sold in a different manner with prior sale to institutional investors and
attaching options or warrants.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge creates
forest unit shares
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fletcher Challenge share-holders yesterday approved a proposal to create a
separate class of forestry division shares for investors who may wish to
focus their investments on the company's solid wood plantation activities in
New Zealand and Chile.
The approval means that the existing holdings of ordinary shares in Fletcher
Challenge will be split. For each four ordinary shares held on December 10,
shareholders will receive four new Fletcher Challenge ordinary division
shares and one forestry division share. In effect, the forestry share is
being regarded as a bonus.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, told an extraordinary general meeting in
Auckland that the the new forestry shares would provide flexibility for
those interested in a pure forestry investment, and had the potential to
attract new investors who might not have the same interest in a Fletcher
Challenge ordinary share.
Under the new structure the ordinary shares will encompass the operations of
the group's pulp and paper, energy and building divisions.
In a separate development, Fletcher Challenge yesterday issued a prospectus
for the sale of its New Zealand based shopping centres, to be known as the
St Luke's Group. These centres are being sold as part of the company's drive
to retire debt.
The St Luke's flotation will be the second biggest ever, in New Zealand
after the Telecom issue in 1990.
The offer is for NZDollars 345.6m (USDollars 190m) in ordinary shares and
notes, of which 12 per cent, or NZDollars 42m, will be made available to New
Zealand investors.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bayer sees 20% reduction in
profits to DM2.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bayer, the leading German chemicals group, expects profits to fall by about
20 per cent this year to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.3m) and remain unchanged in
1994, according to Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman.
However, the company appears likely to hold its dividend, unlike its main
domestic competitors, Hoechst and BASF, Mr Schneider hinted yesterday.
Cost-cutting measures and strong growth in north America and Asia Pacific
were slowing the profits decline as the year had advanced, Mr Schneider said
in a review of the first nine months of the current year. The trend had
continued into October, he added.
Restructuring and workforce cuts had generated savings of about DM750m so
far this year.
European sales had slumped 11 per cent, but similar proportional increases
in Asia Pacific and the US had limited the decline in turnover to just 2.3
per cent. Pre-tax earnings in the review period were 19 per cent lower at
DM1.8bn.
Mr Schneider attributed Bayer's relatively good figures - Hoechst and BASF
recently reported nine-month falls of 40 and 44 per cent respectively, and
hinted at dividend cuts - to the group's successful healthcare business.
These operations lifted sales 5 per cent in the review period to DM7bn in
spite of a DM100m fall in domestic turnover attributed to health service
reforms. Sales of Ciprobay and Adalat, the top-selling drugs, are expected
to total about DM4bn this year.
Signalling further expansion in healthcare, Mr Schneider said the group was
close to a deal which would give it an entry into the US market for generic
pharmaceuticals - drugs on which patents have expired, and which are
increasingly favoured because of their lower cost. Bayer had looked at five
or six US companies, including Copley, the subject of an offer from Hoechst.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation issue of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and
pharmaceuticals group, attracted almost 3m individual investors and was
about three times oversubscribed, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, announced yesterday.
Mr Alphandery said orders for the issue, the second in the government's
privatisation campaign, demonstrated support for its plans to sell public
sector companies and expand popular shareholding.
The strong demand from individual investors means that the French government
will exercise a clawback option to reduce the tranche allocated to
institutional investors. As a result, the number of shares for individuals
will be raised to 52.3m from 47.5m.
Individual investors will see their allocations reduced below the 60 shares
which was set as the maximum subscription. The government will announce
today how many shares will be granted to individuals.
The price for individual investors was set at FFr146 per share, compared
with the public offer price of FFr135. Yesterday, Rhone-Poulenc shares
closed at FFr153.9.
Mr Alphandery said the sale of the government's 43 per cent stake had seen
strong demand from French and international institutional investors. Of the
26.9m shares to go to institutional investors, 36.25 per cent are for French
companies, 19 per cent to US companies, and 8.5 per cent to Japan.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks drop sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's leading banks reported sharply lower profits yesterday as the
industry cut back on problem loans which it admitted would be a burden for
at least three more years.
The 11 leading commercial banks reported an average fall of 22.2 per cent in
pre-tax profits for the six months ended September, while non-performing
loans rose by an average of 9.6 per cent.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the country's largest bank, suffered a 44.3 per cent
fall in net profit, blaming the decline on loan write-offs of Y164.2bn
(Dollars 1.5bn). The Bank of Tokyo was the only bank to report an increase
in net profit, partly a result of unusually low earnings last year.
The banks lifted provisions for losses, which have mostly arisen from
property-related lending during the 1980s, and they sold bad loans to the
Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established to speed up the
write-offs.
The level of non-performing loans ranges from 1.9 per cent of loans at
Mitsubishi Bank to 5.39 per cent at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. But the
institutions use a narrow definition and do not count the loans of
affiliates. It is estimated that the non-performing loans figure is about
double the Y9,248.4bn announced for the 11 banks yesterday. The fresh
provisions and write-offs, which totalled Y996.8bn, are a departure from
Japanese banking traditions and follow pressure from the Bank of Japan. It
fears bad loans are restricting the banks' ability to lend and slowing
economic recovery.
The banks have covered their loan losses through sales of equities, but the
weakness of Tokyo stock prices means they might book losses on securities
holdings over the second half to the end of March.

Bayer, the leading German chemicals group, expects profits to fall by about
20 per cent this year to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.3m) and remain unchanged in
1994, according to Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman.
However, the company appears likely to hold its dividend, unlike its main

pharmaceuticals - drugs on which patents have expired, and which are
increasingly favoured because of their lower cost.
Bayer had looked at five or six US companies, including Copley, subject to
an offer from Hoechst.
The Frankfurt-based group is offering Dollars 550m for 51 per cent of a
company which last year earned Dollars 12.3m on sales of Dollars 52m.
Mr Schneider ruled out Bayer's building its own generics business from
scratch because the company had no experience relevant to the market, which
was entirely different from that for its traditional pharmaceuticals
business, he said.
Meanwhile, consolidation of existing operations and the search for economies
was continuing. All fibres divisions, including the troubled Dralon
business, are to be merged under one management team. However, this did not
indicate preparations for disposal, Mr Schneider stressed.
Inorganic chemicals, pigments and ceramics are to be rolled into one
operation, following the announcement of a similar plan for consumer
products and self-medication.
A small US consumer products business is to be sold off.
Personnel costs in the Bayer AG parent company had been reduced by 8 per
cent this year, Mr Schneider said. The group workforce had been reduced by
4,500 people in the period to the end of September.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Further turbulence for shares in
Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday had another turbulent
session on the stock market when its shares fell sharply by 13 per cent
during the morning only to bounce back in the afternoon to close 8 per cent
higher at the end of the day.
The shares, which on Wednesday plunged by 18.6 per cent to a record low of
FFr27.2, were suspended several times in Paris when they breached their
trading barrier to fall to a new low of FFr23.7 by lunchtime.
However, the shares then rebounded to FFr31 before finally closing at
FFr29.4.
Analysts said investors started to buy Euro Disney shares to cover their
short positions on the stock. The volume of trading was even heavier than on
Wednesday with 5.3m Euro Disney shares, or 3.16 per cent of its total
equity, changing hands.
Until the afternoon rally Euro Disney's shares had fallen fairly steadily in
the fortnight since the group disclosed an unexpectedly heavy net loss of
FFr5.3bn (Dollars 898m) for the year ended September.
The stock market had been expecting a smaller net loss of about FFr2bn.
The impact of the loss announcement has been aggravated by concern about the
prospects for Euro Disney's emergency financial restructuring.
Euro Disney has been forced to ask Walt Disney, the US entertainment group
that owns 49 per cent of its shares, for financial support until it has
completed the refinancing.
The Disney camp last week opened negotiations with the 60 international
banks that own Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn net debt.
The recent pressure on Euro Disney's shares threatened to trap the company
in a vicious cycle given that a lower share price would limit its capacity
to raise capital in a rights issue.

It took almost two tense months, but a dogged battle by Volvo to fend off
what at times appeared to be an unstoppable tide of opinion against the
proposed merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault
finally began to pay off yesterday.
The decision by two of its largest Swedish institutional shareholders to
vote for the deal at a special shareholder's meeting on December 7 followed
a period of non-stop behind-the-scenes lobbying. It included two long
statements of further information for shareholders, intense negotiations
with the French government and, finally, a trip by private jet to Paris on
Wednesday for shareholder representatives to meet Renault chiefs and Mr
Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister.
Even after a press conference on Monday, when Volvo played its trump card of
new French promises on Renault's privatisation and a virtual exemption from
a subsequent state golden share, the outlook remained at best uncertain.
On Wednesday, the Fifth Fund state pension fund said it would still vote
against the deal. Directors of institutions continued privately to criticise
the lack of detail they had been given on the valuation of the Renault and
Volvo assets in the agreement. Yesterday, Svenska Dagbladet, the respected
conservative daily newspaper which has been a leading critic of the merger,
called again for it to be voted down.
Although the prospects for Volvo now look better, the company is well aware
how close to the wind it has sailed - illustrated by the eight-six split in
the benchmark decision to support the deal by the board of the Fourth Fund
state pension fund, Volvo's biggest Swedish shareholder.
Mr Per Lojdquist, the head of investor relations at Volvo, acknowledged the
narrow margin of opinion.
He said what was decisive was the assurances received from Mr Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister, on his intention to privatise Renault
by the end of 1994 and the promise not to use a golden share to dilute
Volvo's 35 per cent holding in the merged company.
'When we talked to the various stakeholders, privatisation and the golden
share were the two dominating concerns - and we have answered them,' he
said.
However, even if Volvo now achieves the solid majority in favour of the
merger that looked in grave jeopardy, the shareholder revolt will continue
to have repercussions for the company.
Privately, institutional shareholders are determined to play a less passive
role than in the past, when they have traditionally stood back while Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, for 22 years the chief executive or chairman of Volvo,
dominated the company, diversifying it beyond cars and trucks and ultimately
building the controversial alliance with Renault.
He intends to remain as non-executive chairman in the Volvo parent company
from January 1, while taking on the job of chairman of the so-called
supervisory board of the new Renault-Volvo.
Many shareholders would like to see him hand over full control at Volvo to
Mr Soren Gyll, the widely-respected chief executive. The Fourth Fund
yesterday indicated that it wanted a bigger role for shareholders in
nominating the Volvo board.
'I think it would be much better for Volvo if Soren Gyll took over. I don't
like the idea of Gyllenhammar being chairman of both Volvo and the new
company,' said one senior shareholder yesterday.
Volvo officials acknowledged that the merger issue had caused much disquiet
within the company, with the white collar unions and the civil engineers
coming out strongly against the move under Renault's wing.
'If the shareholders vote yes, we can't just sit back. It will cause damage
if we don't have the employees with us as well,' Volvo said.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank advances 52% in 10
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Commerzbank, the smallest of Germany's big three banks, yesterday reported
operating profits up by 52 per cent to DM909m (Dollars 535m) in the 10
months ended October.
The sharp increase, driven largely by a near trebling in profits from
securities trading, is likely to be followed by profits increases from other
German banks as they report their figures over the next two weeks.
It is likely that 1993 will be another record year for the German banking
sector, showing the extent to which Germany's banking sector has remained
immune to the country's recession, in spite of mounting credit risks.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's chief executive, gave a strong hint that
the profits performance would be reflected in a dividend increase going
beyond what would be necessary to give shareholders the benefit of this
year's lowering of corporate tax rates to 30 per cent from 36 per cent.
'We are fairly confident that this will be possible,' Mr Kohlhaussen said.
But he added that no final decision had been taken. His remarks raise the
possibility of a payout of DM12 per share, up from DM10 last year. A DM1
increase in the dividend would compensate for the tax change.
He said the bank would soon be holding a capital raising issue. He did not
clarify when, how or how much would be raised. He said the money was
necessary to bring core capital, the basis for future lending growth, from
4.6 per cent to 5 per cent of total assets. Earlier this year, the bank held
a DM500m equity rights issue and a DM800m issue of profits-sharing
certificates with warrants attached.
The increase in profits was in part due to a cut in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts by 21 per cent to DM1.37bn, reflecting lower provisions
against sovereign debt risks. The operating result benefited from DM229m of
other income - income from the sale of real estate and income from leased
equipment.
Profits from securities trading rose to DM475m from DM163m, and buoyant
fixed income, equity and derivatives markets helped commission income rise
by 26 per cent to DM1.55bn. Profits on interest income, from mainstream
lending business, rose by 9.2 per cent to DM3.89bn in spite of a modest 2.1
per cent increase in total lending.
Commerzbank shares, which have outperformed the steeply rising German market
by 15 per cent this year, rose marginally yesterday against the market
trend, closing 50 pfennigs higher at DM363.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks drop sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's leading banks reported sharply lower profits yesterday as the
industry cut back on problem loans which it admitted would be a burden for
at least three more years.
The 11 leading commercial banks reported an average fall of 22.2 per cent in
pre-tax profits for the six months ended September, while non-performing
loans rose by an average of 9.6 per cent.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the country's largest bank, suffered a 44.3 per cent
fall in net profit, blaming the decline on loan write-offs of Y164.2bn
(Dollars 1.5bn). The Bank of Tokyo was the only bank to report an increase
in net profit, partly a result of unusually low earnings last year.
The banks lifted their provisions for losses, which have mostly arisen from
reckless property-related lending during the late 1980s, and they sold bad
loans to the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established to speed up
the write-offs.
The level of non-performing loans ranges from 1.9 per cent of loans at
Mitsubishi Bank to 5.39 per cent at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. But the
institutions use a narrow definition and generally do not count the loans of
affiliates.
It is estimated that the non-performing loans figure is about double the
Y9,248.4bn announced for the 11 banks yesterday. The fresh provisions and
write-offs, which totalled Y996.8bn, are a departure from Japanese banking
traditions and follow pressure from the Bank of Japan. It fears that bad
loans are restricting the banks' ability to lend and slowing economic
recovery.
The banks have covered their loan losses through sales of equities, but the
weakness of Tokyo stock prices over the past month means they might book
losses on securities holdings over the second half to the end of March.
Banks were confident yesterday that the worst of their bad loan troubles was
over, but many of the institutions reported an increase in the share of
property industry loans to total loans during the period, though commercial
property prices are still falling in large Japanese cities.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, financial specialist at Salomon Brothers, said the banks'
ability and willingness to lend was still in doubt, as their business
profits were under pressure and they will find difficulty in tackling
problem loans over the next year.
'The finance ministry is giving the impression that nothing is wrong, and
the banks are giving that impression, but their non-performing loans are
still rising. It is time for a new approach by the authorities,' Ms Ogawa
said.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: SB in drug swap with Recordati of Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham has revealed its first-ever product swap.
The Anglo-American healthcare group is exchanging co-marketing rights for
two of its medicines for development and marketing rights for a drug from
Recordati, Italy's eighth-largest drugs group.
SB is licensing in a series of alpha-receptor antagonists being developed by
Recordati, including REC 15-2739 which is in early stage development of
benign prostatic hypertrophy, a common condition in men over 50. The group
will have exclusive worldwide marketing rights except in Italy, Spain,
Japan, and either France or Italy.
In exchange, Recordati will co-market two compounds in Italy and Spain.
These are epristeride, another compound for BPH, and ropinirole, a treatment
for Parkinson's disease. Both are in late stage development. In addition,
Recordati will receive milestone payments during REC 15-2739's development
and will manufacture the drug.
The market for treatments for BPH is emerging rapidly. Last month, Abbott
Laboratories received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for
its drug Hytrin. It will compete directly will Merck's Proscar. Other
companies with BPH compounds marketed or in development include Pfizer of
the US, Synthelabo of France, and Yamanouchi and Ono of Japan.
Abbott believes that of the 30m men aged over 50 in the US, 10m suffer
urinary problems due to BPH. Some analysts believe the potential worldwide
market for BPH drugs could reach Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) a year.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tay Homes calls for Pounds 10.2m via rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tay Homes, the Leeds-based housebuilder, is seeking to raise Pounds 10.2m
net via a 1-for-3 rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet and provide
finance for continued expansion.
Up to 7.3m new ordinary shares are to be issued at 145p apiece. The shares
slipped 4p to 170p yesterday.
Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, together with Mr Norman Stubbs, deputy chairman
and chief executive, are subscribing in aggregate for 1.48m new shares, 20.2
per cent of the issue.
The balance is underwritten by Kleinwort Benson Securities, who are also
brokers to the issue.
Tay's last cash call was in 1987. Since then the number of units sold per
year has risen from 540 to 1,107. The landbank has grown from plots
available for 2,000 units to plots for some 4,950 units.
Following an autumn period, which was not significantly different from the
previous year, unit sales together with sales reservations by mid-November
had increased by more than 10 per cent.
The directors said the 1993-94 results 'should be positively affected by a
continuation of the current reduction in selling and promotional costs per
unit, a lower proportion of sales from slower-selling and low margin sites
and the fact that the group will be selling from a larger number of sites.'
Profits for 1992-93 fell from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 3.1m pre-tax on sales of
Pounds 69.6m (Pounds 72.4m).

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: European Leisure in the black - Financial
restructuring will enable company to continue trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Leisure, the debt- laden discotheque and snooker hall operator, has
agreed a financial restructuring with its banking syndicate.
Mr Clive Bastin, chairman, warned yesterday that failure to obtain
shareholder approval for the proposals would seriously jeopardise the
ability of the company to continue trading.
The group also announced a return to the black for the year to the end of
June. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 221,000 were struck on turnover of Pounds
68.4m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds 54.9m on turnover of Pounds
75.1m.
Existing bank facilities of Pounds 79m are almost fully utilised. Under the
restructuring the banks, led by Barclays, would convert Pounds 20m of the
debt into new ordinary and preference shares. The remaining Pounds 59m would
be put on a four-year term, with Pounds 3m of interest rolled up into a
convertible loan note over three years.
At the same time convertible unsecured loan stock worth Pounds 1.6m would be
converted into new ordinary shares, along with 26m convertible preference
shares.
In addition an open offer of 175m new ordinary shares would be made to all
existing shareholders at 1p. Yesterday the shares closed at 2 1/4 p.
After the completion of the plan in four years there would be 1.6bn ordinary
shares in issue. The banks would own between 64 and 71 per cent of the
company, depending on the take up of the open offer.
If the open offer were not taken up, existing shareholders would have 9.9
per cent of the share capital, preference shareholders 9.5 per cent and
convertible unsecured loan stock holders 4.8 per cent. Management share
option schemes account for the remaining 4.8 per cent.
Under the plan, gearing at the year end would have been 101 per cent,
compared with an actual level of 218 per cent.
The proposals will be put to shareholders on December 21 in Dublin. About 30
per cent of the company is now held by Irish institutions.
European Leisure, which runs the Hippodrome in Leicester Square and the
Camden Palace, ran into trouble in the late 1980s following rapid expansion
through acquisitions.
Mr Michael Ward, former chairman and chief executive, and two former
directors, Mr Jeremy Howarth and Mr George Hendry, were charged in October
with conspiracy to defraud, conspiring to create a false market in the
company's shares, and theft.
Mr Ian Rock, chief executive since 1991, said yesterday that the group had
virtually completed its withdrawal from continental Europe and sold its
non-performing UK units.
Mr Bastin said the group now had a good core business - 'but clearly we are
in the survival business still'.
The group operates discotheques and pubs aimed at the youth market, owns the
Riley snooker clubs, and designs and manufactures Maygay amusement arcade
machines.
Operating profits were Pounds 8.43m, up from a previous Pounds 7.66m. Losses
per share were 1.21p (34.57p).

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Healthcare side behind rise to Pounds 19.1m
at AAH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AAH, the diversified distribution company, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds
19.1m for the six months to September 30, against Pounds 17.5m, in spite of
lower trading profits in two small divisions.
Turnover improved to Pounds 773.1m (Pounds 679.7m).
The board declared an interim dividend of 6p (5.8p) and blamed difficulties
in the divisions for a drop in earnings per share from 15.4p to 14.7p.
'The reduction in the performances of our environmental and distribution
services divisions, and the absorption of reorganisation costs, have
inevitably dampened earnings performance in the first half,' said Mr John
Padovan, chairman.
He added: 'I see a continued solid performance and growth through expansion
and otherwise in our health division. The two divisions which have not
performed so well this year are likely to return to substantial
profitability in the future.'
The company's healthcare business, its largest division, lifted trading
profits to Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 13.9m) on sales up at Pounds 642.7m (Pounds
564.2).
Retail sales were Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 22m). Over the period AAH acquired 24
new retail pharmacies at a cost of Pounds 5.6m, bringing the total to 235. A
further 11 had been acquired since the year end.
Environmental services contributed Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 3m) to trading
profits on sales of Pounds 38.4m (Pounds 34.7m) as wet weather and a
reorganisation compounded the deleterious effect of a weak market.
Distribution services, into which the consumer products division is now
being integrated, contributed Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 1.3m) to trading
profits on sales of Pounds 46.2m (Pounds 37.6m).
The replacement for a contract had been delayed and another incurred a
significant loss.
Average net debt was Pounds 59.8m (Pounds 42m) and gearing rose to 37 per
cent. Interest payments were Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.2m). Net cash flow from
operating activities was negative at Pounds 4.7m compared with an inflow of
Pounds 16m last time.
The company said the difference was partly related to timing but that the
working capital in the pharmaceuticals division had increased.

pre-tax profits from Pounds 370,000 to Pounds 429,000 in the six months to

policies purchased on 'arms length' terms by certain directors and their
families.
Expenses more than doubled to Pounds 431,000 (Pounds 213,000) as a result of
employing more staff - particularly in the sourcing department - and higher
marketing costs, to pave the way for future expansion.
Earnings per share fell from 4.5p to 4.3p. An interim dividend of 1.5p is
declared.

Continuing its improving trend, Tomkinsons, the yarn and carpet group,
reported a 7.8 per cent improvement from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 1.13m in

The advance was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 20.5m,
with exports growing by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.7m.
Mr Lowry Maclean, chairman, said the advance had been achieved in the face
of increasingly tough competition. The increase in exports and in the

added.
Earnings per share improved to 12.2p (10.3p) and a same again final of 8p is

John Foster &amp; Son, the worsted and mohair cloth manufacturer, cut pre-tax
losses from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 921,000 for the half year to August 31.
Turnover on continuing operations was lower at Pounds 8.38m, against Pounds
10m.
During the period management continued to slim down the business and further
asset sales, including properties, were planned in the second half.
The number of employees now totalled 300 compared with 580 at this time last
year and by the year end this should have stabilised at about 230.
The company warned, however, that demand from traditional merchant
customers, particularly in Europe and Japan, was not good, while there were
a lot of cheap sellers about, particularly from Italy.
Losses per share were 8.4p (16.9p).

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: GEI's fall to Pounds 131,000 hits share
price

<TEXT>
Sharply lower profits from its processing machinery side left GEI
International, the steel and machinery manufacturer, with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 131,000 for the six months to September 30, against Pounds 1.03m.
The interim dividend is passed. There was a 2.47p payment last time. The
shares lost 15p to 70p.
Mr Michael Blackburn, chairman, blamed the processing decline on a lack of
orders from the pharmaceutical industry and the fact that it had a
particularly good result last time.
Packaging machinery profits were slightly down and losses at special steels
were cut.
Mr Blackburn said severe pressure remained on margins but orders were now at
the same level as last year.
Turnover was Pounds 37.6m (Pounds 38.2m). Earnings per share came out at
0.21p (1.31p).

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cater Allen buoyed by discount house side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance by its discount house business helped Cater Allen
Holdings, the financial services group, report a 36 per cent increase in
interim profits.
The pre-tax line for the six months to October 31 increased to Pounds 9.85m
(Pounds 7.25m), while an abnormally low tax charge, reflecting a Pounds 1m
exceptional tax credit, resulted in a 45 per cent rise in attributable
profits to Pounds 7.48m (Pounds 5.16m).
Earnings per share jumped from 21p to 31p and an increased interim dividend
of 8p (7p) is declared.
The profits advance was led by the discount house, the second biggest in the
City, which reported an 88 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.87m
(Pounds 2.59m). The performance mainly reflected better trading
opportunities in gilt edged securities. Money market operations made a
'satisfactory contribution' during a period when there were no base rate
movements.
The stock lending and financial futures businesses also thrived. Low
interest rates inevitably reduced the return on capital, although this was
more than offset by higher volumes. As a result profits from stock lending
expanded to Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 3.09m) while financial futures broking
generated Pounds 440,000 (Pounds 302,000).
In Jersey, lower profits from banking operations were almost offset by
growth in the trust and investment management businesses and by 'a sparkling
result' from the stockbroking subsidiary in its first period of ownership.
Overall Jersey profits slipped to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 2.11m).
The loss in the group's Lloyd's agencies widened from Pounds 838,000 to
Pounds 1.12m, but included a number of special items.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Thirst for Old Speckled Hen lifts Morland
to Pounds 9.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer, trebled sales through wholesalers
of Old Speckled Hen, its leading beer brand, in recording a near-20 per cent
increase in full year pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.62m to Pounds 9.12m.
'The results were achieved in the face of a particularly hostile environment
both economically and climatically,' said Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chairman.
'Technically, we are told, the recession has ended. There is little
indication of that in our market place.'
Earnings per share improved 16 per cent to 30.3p (26.1p) and a final
dividend of 6.96p increases the total in line with earnings growth to 9.74p
(8.4p).
Mr Clutterbuck said the figures, quoted on a pre-FRS 3 basis, gave 'a far
better measure of the true performance of the company'. Under the new
accounting standard, pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 rose 60
per cent, from Pounds 5.55m to Pounds 8.87m; earnings per share were 76 per
cent higher at 29.1p (16.5p).
Operating profit, before exceptionals, rose from Pounds 8.52m to Pounds
11.5m on turnover ahead 24 per cent at Pounds 50.9m.
Old Speckled Hen's growth came mainly from trading agreements with national
and regional brewers and increasing distribution in the take-home trade, but
direct sales to independent pubs were also 14 per cent higher. 'It can now
claim to be a national brand,' said Mr Clutterbuck.
Overall, Morland's ale volumes rose 29 per cent and, with contract brewing
for Courage, boosted production at the company's Abingdon brewery by 50 per
cent.
Two new ales, after successful test marketing, are to be launched in the new
year.
The retail division, comprising 75 managed outlets in the estate of 365
pubs, maintained margins and raised profits 15 per cent. Food now accounts
for 26 per cent of turnover. Meals sold through the 11 Artist's Fares
catering pubs increased 47 per cent to 450,000.
Morland's tenanted pubs, which contribute 47 per cent of group profits,
'traded respectably during a particularly difficult time,' said Mr
Clutterbuck. The 72 pubs bought from Inntrepreneur Estates last year have
been integrated into the estate and are cash positive.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 7.7m with Pounds 6.3m invested in the pubs
and core business.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank shares rise on Direct Line
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland's private insurance subsidiary,
became the largest private motor insurer in the UK in the year to September
30, while more than trebling pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.2m, against Pounds
15.1m.
Gross premium income was almost doubled at Pounds 409.5m (Pounds 213.2m). It
doubled the number of active private motor policies to 1.25m (670,000) and
said it had set a target of writing 1m new motor policies in the coming
year.
Total assets grew to Pounds 567.9m (Pounds 304.3m) while shareholders' funds
rose by Pounds 86.3m to Pounds 168m.
The capital increase included an additional Pounds 53m injected by Royal
Bank in addition to the Pounds 120m injected since Direct Line was founded.
The company achieved more modest growth in household insurance, increasing
policies to 273,000 (206,000). It has developed new risk profiles and is now
selling household policies as fast as motor policies two years ago.
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said it could undercut competitors because
it had had a 10.2 per cent ratio of expenses to premium income for motor
policies, compared with an estimated industry average of 27 per cent.
Mr Wood said that Direct Line had experienced 'truly an outstanding and
satisfying year'. He said the results showed that critics were incorrect to
assert that lower pricing of insurance policies would lead to poorer
service.
The number of staff rose to 1,873 at the year end from 1,086. The company
opened a new office in Birmingham, and expanded in Glasgow. A fifth regional
office is due to be opened in Leeds by the end of this year.
A Direct Line Financial Services arm was launched in the first half of the
year, offering personal loans and mortgages among other products. Its
results are to be consolidated in Royal Bank's figures which will be
released next week.
Mr Wood said there was no conflict between the financial services operation
and other Royal Bank operations because there was only a 5 per cent overlap
between the two sets of customers, and this figure was 'getting less'.
Royal Bank shares closed 22p up at 375p.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Power tops Pounds 115m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Power, the vertically integrated electricity company, increased
pre-tax profits from Pounds 95.2m to Pounds 115.7m in the half year to
September 30; the underlying increase, however, adjusted for an exceptional
charge last time, was 6.6 per cent.
The interim dividend is raised to 4.13p (3.72p) on earnings per share up 27
per cent to 10.78p (8.49p).
Mr Ian Preston, chief executive, said that as part of the strategy of
increasing efficiency the company had reduced the workforce to 7,610,
against 9,500 at privatisation two and a half years ago. There were further
staffing reductions to come, he added.
Gearing at the period-end was 2.3 per cent, with net borrowings at Pounds
20m, but the company expects that by the year end borrowings will rise to
equal last year's Pounds 98m, when gearing amounted to 11 per cent.
Mr Preston said improved profitability in the first half reflected higher
prices in the English wholesale mar-ket.
The upgraded transmission link to England and Wales, completed ahead of
schedule and within budget, would increase the company's ability to sell
power outside Scot-land by 75 per cent from 1994-95.
The retail operation was ahead of this stage in 1992. The company has opened
its 100th store and is increasing market share.
The company yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Ian Russell, director
of financial control at Tomkins, as finance director.
COMMENT
Scottish Power has effected a significant recovery since its disappointing
stock market introduction two and a half years ago and these results
demonstrate why. It appears to be one of the few power companies to be
making a success of retailing and its contracting arm made profits, if only
minimal, this half. The company was yesterday making the most of the
reinforced interconnector with England which will enable it to export the
equivalent of a third of its Scottish sales. But what most pleases the City
is the stick-to-basics approach through which, for example, it has eschewed
foreign ventures of the type being pursued by National Power and PowerGen.
The company is expected to make Pounds 335m to Pounds 350m pre-tax for the
full year and pay out about 12.4p in dividends. At that level the
prospective yield on the shares, down 2 1/2 p to 406 1/2 p, is 3.8 per cent.
That is below the sector average signifying City approval. However, the
shares may suffer if the regulator lifts the cloud over the English
generators by deciding against refering them to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan hit by setback in waste
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Shanks &amp; McEwan fell 22 per cent yesterday as the waste management
group revealed significantly lower than expected pre-tax profits for the
first half.
The shares dropped 22p to 98p following a 42 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 9.35m. Turnover fell by 19 per cent to Pounds 63.2m.
Analysts had been looking for profits of about Pounds 13m.
Shanks also warned of a Pounds 5m charge to restructure the waste,
environmental, and energy divisions. The company said it planned to cut
between 90 and 100 jobs from the senior and middle management levels as a
result of integrating the three divisions.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said the rationalisation would result in cost
savings of about Pounds 5m next year.
He said first half profits had been hit by a sharp decline in the higher
margin waste services business and the increased costs of meeting regulation
requirements.
Many customers were reducing the amount of waste produced for various
reasons, said Mr Waddell, including the effects of recession on trading and
a general move to avoid producing unwanted materials.
The worst performer was environmental services, which includes the Rechem
company purchased in 1990. Operating profits fell by 29 per cent to Pounds
4.58m, on sales 3 per cent lower at Pounds 19.8m. Waste services operating
profits were Pounds 6.58m (Pounds 8.19m), on sales of Pounds 34.1m. Energy
services moved up from near-breakeven to contribute Pounds 746,000, with
sales of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 2.18m).
The profits line was also affected by losses in the construction business,
for which Shanks took a Pounds 19.3m restructuring and bad debt charge last
year. This division incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2m. The company said
it had recovered Pounds 1.7m of the Pounds 17m in bad debts for which it had
provided. None of this had been written back.
The interim dividend is held at 2.24p, payable from earnings per share down
from 6.5p to 3.5p.
COMMENT
While bad news was widely expected on the construction side, few thought to
see such a sharp downturn in volume and margins in the core waste services
division. Although the decline appears to have stabilised in the second
half, questions remain over the extent to which some business has
disappeared for good. Many sizeable customers, such as chemical companies,
have been reducing or disposing of waste themselves. On the brighter side,
Shanks still boasts good margins and should benefit from cost cutting. As
one of the largest waste disposal companies, it is also well placed to
benefit from licensing regulations set to begin next year. For those holding
the shares at the moment, the yield of 7 per cent may look attractive.
Otherwise, the play is on recovery, which still looks to be some way away.
Forecasts were pulled back from Pounds 26m to Pounds 16m for a prospective
p/e of about 8.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts boost National Grid -
Developments at three electricity industry companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Grid, the operator of the England and Wales electricity
transmission system, benefited from cost cutting to increase pre-tax profits
by 9 per cent to Pounds 285.3m in the half year to September 30, against
Pounds 261.6m.
The company also revealed yesterday that Nuclear Electric, the state-owned
generator, had increased its market share from 21.4 to 24.9 per cent, a more
significant improvement than had been expected.
Nuclear Electric will use its share gain, made mainly at the expense of
National Power, to argue for privatisation in the forthcoming nuclear
review.
Mr David Jefferies, National Grid chairman, said the rapid changes in the
generation market emphasised the need for his company to have flexible
control systems.
This was being helped through the opening this year of a new national
control centre which employed Pounds 32m of software. The system could be
operated more remotely and the six satellite centres had already been
reduced to four.
National Grid's profits improvement was achieved on turnover ahead 3 per
cent from Pounds 666m to Pounds 687m.
The company declared an interim dividend of Pounds 46m, or Pounds 920 per
ordinary share - a 9.5 per cent increase - for the 12 regional electricity
companies which own it.
Mr John Uttley, finance director, said National Grid aimed to pay about a
third of dividends at the half year stage.
He said the profits improvement was achieved in spite of tighter regulatory
controls on prices and reflected cost reductions more than anything else.
The workforce was now 5,100, an 11 per cent reduction on last year.
Mr Jefferies said the aim was to reduce manpower to 4,750 by the year-end
and 4,250 by the end of March 1995.
Transmission operating profits rose from Pounds 248.1m to Pounds 291.6m but
the generations/interconnection business suffered a fall from Pounds 32.7m
to Pounds 18.6m.
The fall was partly the result of a less favourable contract from April with
Electricite de France. Mr Uttley said generation/interconnection would
probably be down at the full year but less so than the half year results
suggested.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin 20% lower at Pounds 2.16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Macdonald Martin Distilleries, the maker of Glenmorangie malt whisky,
reported a 20 per cent decline in first half pre-tax profits, from Pounds
2.69m to Pounds 2.16m.
Excluding the extra costs of reducing production at the company's two
distilleries, profits would have been 2 per cent ahead - 'a satisfactory
result in the current economic and whisky industry climate,' said Mr Neil
McKerrow, managing director.
'While it is difficult to forecast with certainty, we expect a slightly
stronger second half performance,' he added.
Earnings per A share fell from 13.08p to 10.46p but the dividend is lifted
from 2.2p to 2.266p.
Turnover in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds
13.1m. In the UK volume sales of single malt were marginally lower and an
increase in own label business was offset by reduced sales of other blends.
UK profits fell under the impact of competitive pricing in blends and
increased marketing expenditure for Glenmorangie.
Overseas profits improved, however. Sales of Glenmorangie and Glen Moray
malts were 20 per cent higher, helped by the resumption of shipments to the
US after over-stocking in that market last year. Sales of bulk blends also
increased.
Trading contracts within the industry remained highly competitive and
profits from the business declined slightly in spite of increased turn-over.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: National Power moves into Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium led by National Power, the electricity generator, yesterday
completed the purchase of the 600MW Pego coal-fired power station in
Portugal from Electricidade de Portugal.
The completion represents National Power's second foray overseas and follows
a Dollars 160m (Pounds 107m) acquisition in the US.
The company has said it expects to invest Pounds 1bn abroad by the end of
the century as market opportunities in the UK diminish.
In Portugal the company is investing about Pounds 40m initially. It will own
45 per cent of the Tejo Energia consortium which will own the Pounds 710m
station.
The other shareholders are Endesa of Spain (35 per cent) and Electricite de
France (10 per cent). EDP retains 10 per cent of the station which is about
100 miles north-east of Lisbon on the Tagus River.
Following completion of the deal Tejo Energia entered into a 28-year power
purchase agreement. The first 15 years cover an exclusive supply from Pego
to EDP.
For the remaining 13 years there is an option to sell the output to third
parties 'at no increased risk to the consortium'.
National Power said performance tests had been completed on the plant's
first 300MW generating unit. It is now operational and providing revenue.
The second unit will continue to be constructed by EDP and will be completed
by 1995.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Slimmer Unigroup Pounds 4.41m in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigroup, the building materials group, yesterday reported a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 4.41m for the 15-month period to September 30.
The outcome included interest payable of Pounds 1.38m, offset by interest
receivable and similar income of Pounds 918,000. A further Pounds 361,000
was written off.
The profits were wholly attributable to discontinued activities, which
contributed Pounds 6.47m. However, these were diminished by losses of Pounds
1.25m from continuing activities.
The net proceeds from the disposal amounted to about Pounds 14m, giving a
significant boost to the balance sheet - net tangible asset value per share
rose to 33p, against 7.2p in 1992.
Turnover totalled Pounds 38.5m. Earnings per share were 8.5p.
In the 12 months to end-June 1992 Unigroup incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
794,000 on turnover of Pounds 17.8m.
Losses per share were reported as 3.3p.
Following the disposal of the timber products arm, the group consists of two
divisional activities: building products and air movement operations.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Faced with a very tricky balancing ACT -
Some problems facing the chancellor in his Budget next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Kenneth Clarke stands up next Tuesday to deliver his first budget,
companies will be straining to hear what he plans to do about surplus
advance corporation tax and the foreign income dividend scheme proposed by
his predecessor in March.
The FID scheme was initially enthusiastically received, and welcomed
publicly by the 100 Group of Finance Directors, but has found some critics.
Says one finance director, 'I would like it to go ahead and I think we would
like to implement it. It's not perfect, but half a loaf . . .'
A corporate tax expert agrees, although he thinks the FID scheme hangs in
the balance. 'I sincerely hope it does go ahead. But in a manner that is
practical and effective.'
However, the depth of feeling is illustrated by one finance director of a
Footsie company who not only refuses to be named speaking on the subject,
but insists that no comment he makes should be traceable to him or his
company.
'It is a very divisive subject,' he explains, saying that it has pitted
company against company, and shareholder against shareholder. Some even
hope, he says, that the scheme will be dropped altogether.
Further, the debate is inextricably entwined with the question of whether
pension funds will be taxed, itself a fraught topic. Under the proposed FID
scheme, pension funds would lose their tax credit on dividends, cutting
their income.
That could have serious knock-on effects. Lower income would cut pension
funds' values. All companies, not just those with a surplus ACT problem,
could find that rather than a surplus on their pension fund they have a
deficit. That would mean the end of contributions holidays, depressing
profits, in turn lowering the tax take and possibly squeezing dividends.
Companies may be pressured by tax-exempt shareholders to make up the loss of
their tax credits through higher dividends, so gains made by avoiding ACT
would be lost through increased pay-outs. Any which did not make up the
dividend shortfall could see their share prices fall, further reducing
pension fund valuations.
The anonymous finance director admits to the unpopular view: 'I wouldn't
mind if pension funds were taxed. Our scheme is generously funded.'
Under the existing tax regime, companies pay ACT on dividends and can then
offset that against their mainstream corporation tax bill. Tax-exempt
investors, such as pension funds, can reclaim the tax on the dividend, while
tax-paying shareholders are treated as having already paid basic rate tax on
the dividend.
Companies suffer if they have too small a UK mainstream tax liability
against which the ACT can be offset, in which case they end up paying
surplus ACT, raising their tax charge. There are two main reasons why this
happens.
A company which derives most or all of its profits from the UK, but pays
higher dividends than it can afford, will be hit. This is usually considered
a cyclical problem, for instance where a company does not cut its dividend
when profits fall, and is expected to lessen when profits recover after the
recession.
More serious is the case of companies with a structural problem - those
which earn a high proportion of their profits overseas. They cannot offset
ACT against their overseas tax bills, and pay insufficient UK tax to use up
their ACT.
The March budget did two things. First, Mr Norman Lamont cut the ACT rate
from 25 per cent to 20 per cent over two years, in an attempt to reduce the
amount of surplus ACT. While this appeared helpful, and gave a cashflow
benefit to companies, it soon became apparent that it would actually
increase the government's tax take.
The second was Mr Lamont's proposal of the FID scheme. Essentially this
would allow companies to pay dividends free of ACT out of their foreign
income. The scheme was detailed in an Inland Revenue consultative document.
It is this scheme which Mr Clarke is expected to elaborate on in the budget,
and perhaps put into effect in the new year.
The Inland Revenue is understood to have received numerous negative comments
about the scheme. It is a complicated system, and has many restrictions
which companies feel will constrain its use. Cynics even suggest that since
the FID scheme will cut the government's tax take, the Treasury would
actually prefer companies not to use it.
The FID scheme involves a company paying ACT as normal, but identifying
which dividends it regards as being paid out of foreign income and
reclaiming any surplus ACT on those after proving the dividend was paid from
foreign profits. It cannot use foreign income from earlier or later years.
As well as the many technical concerns about the scheme, the main bone of
contention is the question of tax credits. Any dividend paid as a FID would
not entitle a tax-exempt shareholder to reclaim tax. It would make no
difference to a tax-paying shareholder.
Thus one class of shareholders would benefit from a company paying FIDs  -
because the company would save surplus tax - but another class would lose.
Under the scheme, companies cannot 'stream' dividends, directing FIDs
towards tax payers and tax-credit bearing dividends to pension funds. One
leading accounting firm described this rule as 'unduly harsh' in its
submission on the scheme to the Inland Revenue.
Companies are in danger of upsetting one or other class of shareholder
whatever they do. 'It drives a wedge between the two types of shareholder,'
says a finance director, 'and puts the directors in a very nasty position.
FIDs take away one problem but they leave another which is almost worse.'
The Revenue is unlikely to heed calls from some finance directors and tax
experts to abolish ACT altogether. One suggestion is that ACT be removed but
corporation tax payments brought forward from the current due date of nine
months after the year end. That would give the government a substantial
one-off cashflow benefit in a year when it needs every penny it can raise.
The same problem of lost tax credits would arise for tax-exempt investors
and hence for companies' pension funding costs. But, proponents argue, the
government could in return lessen the tax burden for all companies, which
would be fairer than the current system which penalises some through surplus
ACT.
Whatever Mr Clarke does on Tuesday, it looks certain that he will offend
some companies and some shareholders. Companies, fearing they will have to
alienate some shareholders, may have little sympathy for him.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Mixed response for market newcomers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shares of three newcomers to the stock market met with a mixed response
in first day dealings yesterday.
Shares of Lilliput Group, the Cumbria-based manufacturer of hand-painted
miniature china cottages, closed 10p down on the 135p offer price.
The company placed a total of 12.04m ordinary shares with institutional and
other investors, of which 4.2m were subject to a clawback to meet retail
demand. In the event retail investors and employees took up only 24.7 per
cent, or just over 1m shares.
The flotation raised Pounds 16.3m for existing shareholders, and Pounds
2.43m net of expenses for the company, of which Pounds 1.47m will be used to
redeem preference and deferred shares.
In contrast, shares of Ruberoid, the roofing subsidiary spun off by Tarmac,
closed at 163p, a premium of 13p. At the 150p flotation price, the company
was valued at about Pounds 72m.
More than 30m shares - 65 per cent of the issue - were placed firm with
institutions. The balance of 16.5m shares was 2.1 times subscribed. The
issue raised Pounds 68.8m for existing shareholders, principally
subsidiaries of Tarmac, and Pounds 2m for the company.
Shares of the the third newcomer, Biotrace International, ended the day at
145p, valuing the the South Wales-based biotechnology group at about Pounds
44.7m. Last week Allied Provincial Securities placed 7.15m shares,
representing 23.2 per cent of the enlarged share capital, at 130p.
Biotrace was founded five years ago by Mr Ian Johnson, a former Welsh Water
microbiologist, and Mr Colin Griffiths, an accountant. It manufactures a
range of rapid testing instruments and chemical reagents to monitor hygiene
levels and detect microbiological contaminants in the food and drink and
other sectors.
The placing included some 4.6m shares on behalf of the company which will
mainly be used to increase marketing resources overseas.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hazlewood lower after exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 2.3m exceptional write-off from the sale of a Dutch subsidiary
caused pre-tax profits at Hazlewood Foods to dip 5.7 per cent to Pounds
23.3m in the six months to October 2. The shares fell 7p to 141p.
Stripping out the effects of June's Pounds 14.2 sale of Luijckx, profits
grew to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 24.7m). Turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds
403.9m (Pounds 364.8m) and gross profits advanced 6 per cent to Pounds 88.1m
(Pounds 83m).
Mr Peter Barr, chairman, said that the refocusing of the group was largely
complete. With the past few years' heavy investment now in place, the
board's next challenges were to promote 'volume-led' organic growth, and
increase productivity levels, using the now under-utilised capacity in many
of its upgraded plants.
He said that the drive for organic growth meant having 'a coherent
strategy', stating that the short-term situation could not affect the
long-term view.
The slippage in group margins, from 8.3 to 7.8 per cent, was in part due to
commissioning and general restructuring costs of about Pounds 1m in the
half, especially in convenience foods and ready meals.
Restrictions by supermarket chains, which were rejecting higher prices while
demanding no loss of quality, also contributed.
Another aim was to exploit the immaturity of the European market in added
value foods, principally in the ready meals and convenience foods sectors.
This type of food product accounted for more than half group sales for the
first time and the proportion is set to increase.
By division, grocery and non-food lifted operating profits to Pounds 8.1m
(Pounds 7.4m) on lower turnover of Pounds 78m (Pounds 80.2m).
Frozen foods profits at Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 11m) were held back by flatfish
which was down at Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.5m) and ready meals which were flat at
Pounds 5m. Shellfish were up at Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 4.5m).
Reduced profits of Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 6m) in convenience foods meant that
profits at fresh foods slipped to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 11.1m), though
produce rose to Pounds 2.5m from Pounds 1.6m.
Earnings per share fell to 6.94p (7.62p). The interim dividend is lifted to
2.4p (2.3p).
COMMENT
Since September the food industry has come under the retailers' cosh and it
is unfortunate that Hazlewood's refit has come on stream in a period of
pricing uncertainty. Some might say that the management could have started
the investment earlier, in a stable price environment. And there is a
feeling that in its drive for higher volumes, the group might be a little
too amenable to the retailers' as yet unknowable price demands. That said,
there is plenty of scope for productivity gains and, using the Dutch
manufacturing and distribution operations, continental Europe seems ripe for
the taking. With between Pounds 52.5m and Pounds 55m pencilled in for the
current year, against last year's Pounds 55m, the p/e hovers round the
mid-8s. The shares look cheap, though the wary market will want to see the
group deliver.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti spells out alternative -
Shareholders urged to be 'realistic' and accept 1p a share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eugene Anderson, chair-man of Ferranti International, stepped up pressure
on the defence electronic group's 48,000 shareholders yesterday, urging them
to be 'realistic' and to accept GEC's 1p a share rescue bid.
In a lengthy letter to shareholders Mr Anderson said Ferranti's directors
'understand the unhappiness' over the terms of the GEC offers to ordinary,
special and preference shareholders.
However, he reiterated that the Ferranti board believes that if the Pounds
11.4m GEC bid is rejected 'the only practical alternative is receivership,
and we believe that no class of shareholder will receive any value from
receivership.'
The letter rejects many of the claims of disgruntled individual shareholders
and attempts to deal with the issues raised by the Ferranti Shareholders
Support Association led by Mr John Katz.
In particular it confirms that administration, suggested by some as an
alternative to receivership if the GEC bid fails, is not an option because
Ferranti's banks have held a fixed and floating charge over the assets of
the company for the past four years.
As a result Ferranti's 15 banks, which are owed about Pounds 100m, can block
the court appointment of an administrator and insist on receivership -
something Mr Anderson said they have indicated they would do.
The other issues covered in the letter include:
Order book and installed base. The letter says orders arising from the
group's Pounds 1bn installed base are reflected in the order book which fell
from Pounds 200m at the end of March to Pounds 165m by the end of September
 -a period when Ferranti lost Pounds 19.4m before tax.
The current order book is 'not sufficient to sustain the Ferranti business
and the group will have to be restructured, its cost reduced and substantial
new business must be won for it to return to profitability.'
Pension Fund Surplus. Although Ferranti's annual report shows that the
actuarial value of the Ferranti pension scheme is over-funded by about
Pounds 106m, under Inland Revenue rules, which impose more stringent
actuarial assumptions, the letter says the surplus is not large enough to
allow for any repayment.
Tax Losses. The letter claims that Ferranti's UK tax losses of Pounds 110m
can only be used to offset future profits from the Ferranti businesses. They
cannot be directly transfered to GEC, or be offset against GEC's existing
businesses.
Goodwill. Ferranti insists the potential value of the group lies in the
experience and expertise of its remaining employees rather than in patents
and trademarks. The letter also emphasises that, 'Ferranti is worth only
what someone will pay for it in its present circumstances.'
GEC has said it will not proceed with the bid unless it receives the support
of shareholders controlling at least 90 per cent of the group's 1bn shares.

loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aviva Petroleum, the Texas-based oil and gas company quoted in London,
reported a deficit for the third quarter to the end of September of Dollars
632,000 (Pounds 424,000), or losses of 2 cents per share.
That compared with a deficit of Dollars 515,000 - losses of 9 cents per
share - in the comparable period and brings the deficit at the nine months
stage to Dollars 975,000 (Dollars 8.76m) for losses of 4 cents (Dollars
1.65) per share.
Aviva also announced it was offering to purchase for cancellation, at 71p
apiece, some 170,000 shares of the company's common stock held by owners of
less than 100 shares.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: McLeod Russel rises to Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of McLeod Russel, which acquired the lossmaking Wheway group earlier
this year, expanded from Pounds 4.94m to Pounds 5.16m pre-tax for the year
to end-September.
The shares rose 12p to 113p.
Turnover of Pounds 88.4m (Pounds 43.4m) included a six months' contribution
from Wheway - the group's operations cover surface coatings, air filtration
products and environmental engineering.
On an annualised basis the enlarged group's turnover for the year was in
excess of Pounds 125m.
Operating profits improved by 52 per cent to Pounds 5.17m although interest
of Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 1m received) reduced the pre-tax rise to 4.4 per
cent.
The total dividend is lifted to 6.1p via a final of 3.35p (3.25p). Earnings
emerged at 7.54p (7.46p) per share.
Mr Nigel Openshaw, chairman, said: 'We have made a good start in rebuilding
the former Wheway businesses to restore profitability and to make them cash
generative.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Celltech to float with Pounds 176m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Celltech, the emerging bio-technology company, yesterday raised Pounds 50m
in a placing of shares at 250p in the largest flotation this new UK sector
has yet seen.
The size of the float was lower than the company had originally hoped for as
market conditions had proved 'quite challenging' and the new issue market
had gone off the boil, according to Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive.
The company will have a market capitalisation at this price of Pounds
176.5m.
While the entire 20m share placing was underwritten by Barings, 7m of the
shares were placed subject to clawback by the public. The closing date for
applications is December 2.
Celltech will retain Pounds 27.3m after expenses while the British &amp;
Commonwealth administrator's stake after share sales falls from 36.4 per
cent to 19.9 per cent.
B&amp;C and the Prudential and Montagu Equity, which also sold shares, have
agreed not to sell any more for a year.
Mr Fellner said he was pleased with level of interest and the fact that
Celltech had raised what it was seeking for its R&amp;D programme.
The management is not selling any shares and directors have said they will
be applying for 29,000 in the public offer.
Just over a quarter of the issue was distributed in Switzerland by Swiss
Bank Corporation, and the rest by Cazenove in the UK.
COMMENT
While the Pounds 50m float is less than the company had hoped for, Celltech
has nevertheless successfully raised what it needs for its R&amp;D programme. A
bigger float would, however, have led to a smaller overhang in the market
from the stake retained by British &amp; Commonwealth. The importance of this is
diminished, however, when one considers that no investor should be looking
to invest in Celltech - or any of the high risk new bio-technology drug
companies - with anything but a long-term view. If the US experience is any
guide, one of the newly floated bio-tech companies is likely to succeed with
super returns. And Celltech may have gone further than most in reducing the
risks by securing a strong source of internally generated cash to slow the
rate R&amp;D consumes cash. But it is questionable whether investors really have
a big enough choice of companies in the UK from which to construct a truly
risk-reducing portfolio. Sophisticated investors might well buy Celltech,
but they would be well advised to consider constructing a portfolio that
included some US bio-technology stocks as well.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fife chairman asks for support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman of dissent-riven Fife Indmar, yesterday appealed
to investors to support current management against attempts by minority
shareholders to change the board and announced the appointment of a new
managing director.
In a letter to shareholders this week, Mr Hepburn said efforts by Mr Guido
Crolla, a Scottish businessman, and Mr Charles McDonald, a Fife director, to
nominate two board members amounted to an attempt to 'secure control of the
company . . . without making a general offer to all shareholders.
Mr Crolla and Mr McDonald, who control 10.4 per cent of the company, have
requisitioned an extraordinary meeting on December 17 to unseat Mr Hepburn
and fellow director Mr Michael Munro.
They propose to replace them with Mr Crolla and Mr David Chassels, of BDO
Binder Hamlyn. If successful, Mr McDonald would replace Mr Hepburn as
chairman.
Mr Hepburn said it was 'ironic that the board should face a challenge at
this time, just when its strategies are bearing fruit.' Fife had returned to
profit at the interim stage.
The appointment of Mr Tim Gutteridge, former chief executive of Courtney
Pope, would further strengthen the business, Mr Hepburn said.
The chairman said he was also puzzled at Mr McDonald's decision to support
Mr Crolla, since he had been 'at one with the board in developing those
strategies and rejecting earlier approaches by Mr Crolla'.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Waterglade cuts loss amid restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Waterglade International Holdings, the property developer, reported pre-tax
losses of Pounds 11.7m for the 14 months to May 31, against Pounds 18.5m for
the previous 12 months.
The main factor was the lower exceptional charge of Pounds 7.06m (Pounds
13.3m) of which Pounds 4.83m (Pounds 12.8m) was a provision against the cost
of development properties.
During the period the company came to an agreement with its largest bank
creditor, Bank of America, which took over Waterglade's largest asset in
return for extinguishing all but Pounds 1.75m of the Pounds 18m debt.
As an interim funding measure the company is issuing Pounds 500,000 of
convertible unsecured loan stock 1994 of which Pounds 250,000 has been
issued with an expected further Pounds 25,000 in the near future.
It is intended to make a rights issue before the end of February next year.
Waterglade has also raised a total of Pounds 1.15m through property and
other sales. In addition there was a refund of corporation tax of Pounds
1.75m which helped cash flow.
Of its holding in Seafield, the Dublin-based transport and property group,
the company said it would be retained as a long term investment, although
Seafield was selling its property interests. Waterglade tried to replace the
Seafield board but it later withdrew.
Turnover for the 14 months was Pounds 9.59m (Pounds 24.6m). Losses per share
were 56.7p (84.5p).

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Larger customer base lifts SW Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in the number of new customers helped South West Water, the
privatised utility, to announce a 3 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 50.3m.
The outcome, largely in line with expectation, was struck on sales up 30 per
cent to Pounds 125.7m for the six months to September 30.
The increase in profits was due to a strong performance in the core
regulated water and sewage business, which benefited from the addition of
2,500 new customers, cost savings and price increases.
Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said the group had returned 'good sound
results' in the first half.
Operating profits were 32 per cent higher at Pounds 54.9m, helped by a
Pounds 1m contribution from the non-core businesses.
The pre-tax return increased at a slower rate due to interest charges of
Pounds 4.8m, against gains last year of Pounds 7.6m.
South West, which received a Pounds 266m dowry from the government at
flotation to help pay for its substantial capital expenditure programme, is
expected to have gearing of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent by the year
end.
The non-core business moved ahead on the back of three acquisitions.
These accounted for about half of the increase in group sales. Two of the
three businesses were profitable after interest costs.
The third, Haul Waste, incurred losses of less than Pounds 1m after
interest.
The interim dividend is raised by 7.7 per cent to 8.4p.
Earnings per share were 3.5 per cent higher at 38.4p.
COMMENT
South West is about one third the way through its disproportionately large
capital expenditure programme and has another Pounds 1.3bn which it must
spend. Although so far it has been allowed substantially higher price
increases than its colleagues to fund the expenditure, this status may well
come under pressure in next year's review. Furthermore, even though South
West has been pretty acute in spotting cost cutting opportunities, these may
be increasingly more difficult to achieve in future. Forecasts for full year
profits of Pounds 95m give a prospective p/e of 8. The company's main
attraction seems to be its yield which stands out in an otherwise dull
sector.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Quadramatic ahead of forecast with Pounds
1.57m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quadramatic, the specialist engineering group which came to the market in
July, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.57m in the six months to September
30, slightly above the flotation forecast of Pounds 1.46m. The shares,
floated at 123p, yesterday closed 2p higher at 161p.
Mr Tony Gartland, chairman, is a deal maker who in the eighties expanded
FKI, the electrical engineering group, along with Mr Jeff Whalley. Mr
Gartland said the order book was 12 per cent higher than last year's levels,
and prospects remained favourable.
Turnover was Pounds 13.2m to September 30, which will become the recently
formed group's year-end. Earnings per share were 5.1p and the final dividend
is 1p. Quadramatic comprised a coin-handling and optical business when it
came to the market, but last month placed more shares in order to pay Pounds
11.3m for two high-technology instruments businesses.
Mr Gartland, who has promised to expand the group by acquisition, said he
now had the three core areas on which he could build - coin-handling,
optical and industrial instruments. His immediate priorities were
acquisitions to fill excess factory capacity at the group's Oldham base,
which makes coin-handling equipment, and to expand the optical and
instruments businesses.
Coin Controls International accounted for 78 per cent of group sales in the
six-month period and made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 1.9m
(Pounds 1.2m). In the last year, Coin's sales improved by 26 per cent as it
strengthened its position in UK leisure machines and US pinball machines.
Combined Optical Industries, which moulds plastic optical products,
accounted for 22 per cent of group sales and made profits before interest
and tax of Pounds 260,000 (Pounds 160,000).
Mr Gartland said: 'The group will continue to seek appropriate strategic
acquisitions which will be earnings-enhancing and we have identified a
number of promising opportunities, which will support the group's growth
plans.'
The chairman said the recently acquired instruments businesses had
considerable potential for further growth. Datapaq supplies thermal
monitoring systems, while Automatic System Laboratories makes calibrating
equipment for laboratories.

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Chloride recovers to Pounds 1.32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chloride Group, the battery manufacturer which is transforming itself into
an electronics group, returned to the black in the six months to
end-September.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.32m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds
2.73m. Earnings per share were 0.1p (losses 1.6p), insufficient to resume
the dividend, the company said.
Mr Keith Hodgkinson, chief executive, yesterday described the result as 'a
major step forward' for the group, which is going into the second half with
a stronger order book than last year. The strategy would continue to be
disposal of the batteries businesses in order to invest in the core
electronics businesses.
Total turnover rose by 14 per cent, from Pounds 45.4m to Pounds 51.8m.
Discontinued operations accounted for Pounds 2.7m in both halves.
The electronics division moved into the black with operating profits of
Pounds 508,000 compared with a loss of Pounds 2.27m previously. Turnover
climbed from Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 38.3m.
The electronics products fall into three areas - uninterruptible power
supplies for com-puters, emergency lighting, and power conversion. Mr
Hodgkinson said sales of uninterruptible power supplies were 7 per cent
ahead in the half. A new sales office in Thailand had doubled the order rate
in south-east Asia.
The power conversion operation in Rochester in the US had returned to
profits, while losses had been reduced at the El Paso operation in Texas.
The group sold two battery businesses in Kenya and one in Botswana during
the first half. The sales of further businesses in central Africa and Egypt
are being negotiated.
Operating profits from the battery businesses were Pounds 1.16m (Pounds
604,000) on turnover of Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 8.6m).

FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn flat at Pounds 10.3m after
exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Powell Duffryn rose by 15p to 614p after the distribution, storage
and engineering group reported a strong increase in underlying
profitability.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 were flat at Pounds 10.3m
(Pounds 10.4m). There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 3.9m, a loss of
Pounds 5.7m on the disposal of the Hamworthy hydraulics and transmissions
business was partly offset by a property disposal gain.
However operating profits rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 12m)
on sales of Pounds 355m (Pounds 330.8m), including Pounds 16.3m (Pounds
21.6p) from discontinued activities.
Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said the strong trading start to the year was in
part due to the recent restructuring and it belied continuing weaknesses in
some of its main markets.
However, improved trading conditions seen in some parts of the group's oil
distribution activities this summer should, given reasonable winter weather
conditions, augur well for the remainder of the year in fuel distribution.
Mr Hubbard said growth in the company's shares of the automotive and
industrial oil markets was underpinned both by improved terms of trade and
by reduced failures among road haulage customers.
However, the weak summer coal market was exacerbated by technical start-up
problems in a coal contract, which held back overall progress.
Steady trading performances in the port activities against a background of
patchy demand were boosted by the contribution from the minority interest in
Stephenson Clarke Shipping.
Storage interests made further progress. Although results from the UK dry
goods warehouses and US packaging plants were affected by lower demand, this
was more than offset by improved results from the liquid storage operations
in the UK and overseas, particularly Australia.
Earnings per share were 8p (9.8p). The interim dividend is maintained at
6.6p.
COMMENT
The positive reception given to these impressive figures confirms the
re-rating enjoyed by Powell Duffryn, which has seen its shares more than
double in the last 19 months. After apparently slumbering in the eighties,
the group revitalised itself through buying shrewdly into the ports business
and shedding less profitable activities. Gearing of about 20 per cent gives
plenty of muscle to buy another large UK port and the group will continue to
invest in its quality Hamworthy engineering businesses. Forecast full-year
profits of Pounds 37m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 17. That
is a 13 per cent premium to the market, which seems modest for a well-run
group which has yet to see strong recovery in its main markets. Even a
maintained dividend would still offer a premium yield and more bullish
analysts think a cold winter would enable the group to lift the final
payment.

FT  26 NOV 93 / One man's direct line to Pounds 42m: Peter Wood's bonus and
his new idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Wood, the highest paid British company director, is to be given
Pounds 24m to abandon a pay bonus scheme, which brought him Pounds 18.2m
this year and has proved an embarrassment to his employer Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Mr Wood gained the payments, totalling Pounds 42.2m, as chief executive of
Direct Line, the insurance subsidiary that he founded. It has become the
largest UK private motor insurer.
Mr Wood agreed with Royal Bank a Pounds 13m payment for giving up his bonus
scheme, an additional Pounds 4m for accrued bonus until January, and a
further Pounds 7m pension contribution. In future, he will receive only a
Pounds 350,000 index-linked annual salary.
Royal Bank also disclosed yesterday that it was setting up a new company
with Mr Wood to provide 'non-standard' insurance for people in higher risk
categories, such as drivers of fast cars or householders in crime-affected
areas.
Mr Wood will invest Pounds 1m to buy 40 per cent of the equity in the new
company, while Royal Bank will invest Pounds 1.5m in equity and a further
Pounds 22.5m in preference shares. Mr Wood will be non-executive chairman
and hold majority voting rights.
Mr Wood's bonus scheme was devised in 1990 when Royal Bank bought his 25 per
cent stake in Direct Line. It has brought him big rewards from the growth of
the business, which announced trebled pre-tax profits of Pounds 50.2m.
He earned Pounds 1.6m in bonus pay in 1991 and Pounds 6m last year,
attracting increasing public attention. However, some analysts believe that
his original stake could be worth Pounds 250m if Royal Bank decided to float
Direct Line.
Royal Bank's shares rose sharply as the disclosure dampened speculation over
a flotation. Mr George Mathewson, the bank's chief executive, said the bank
wanted to keep Direct Line's earnings and had 'no intention' of floating it.
Mr Wood will invest Pounds 10m in Royal Bank shares, which he will hold for
at least five years. This makes him the second largest individual
shareholder behind the Moffat family, former owners of the AT Mays travel
agency which Royal Bank took over.
He said he had worked just as hard since receiving a Pounds 6m bonus last
year. 'I enjoy it. You are either a workaholic or you are not.'
Lord Younger, Royal Bank's chairman, said the bank was forming the new joint
venture 'to exploit Peter's talent and expertise'. The pay arrangement would
be put to shareholders at its annual meeting in January.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Prospects of Volvo merger boosted by large shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The proposal to merge Volvo's car and truck operations with Renault of
France was boosted yesterday when two large shareholders in the Swedish
group announced their backing for the deal.
The prospects for approval of the merger at a special shareholders meeting
on December 7 were transformed by the decision by the Fourth Fund state
pension fund, which with 7.5 per cent of Volvo's voting capital is the
biggest shareholder after Renault, and the Folksam Insurance group, which
holds 3.6 per cent of votes.
The Fourth Fund's board said it would support the merger unless significant
new information emerged to cause it to change its mind. 'I hope that this is
a turning point,' said Mr Per Lo jdquist, head of investor relations at
Volvo.
Volvo hopes the decision will set a trend for other large shareholders. With
secured support from Renault - which holds 10 per cent of Volvo - the Fourth
Fund and Folksam, and further backing assured, Volvo can now depend on about
31 per cent of the votes.
The 'no' camp, led by Aktiespararna, the small shareholders' association,
and the Fifth Fund state pension fund, is certain of only about 10 per cent.
Folksam, which three weeks ago was against the merger, said it was swayed by
French government assurances that Renault would be privatised, if market
conditions allow, by the end of next year and that a state golden share
would not be used to dilute Volvo's 35 per cent share in the merged company.
Both issues have been at the heart of Swedish criticism of the agreement.
A key factor in both decisions yesterday was the acceptance that Volvo could
not continue in the motor industry alone and had to deepen its alliance with
Renault to survive.
Volvo share price fluctuated wildly yesterday. The most-traded B share rose
from SKr410 to SKr431 on early expections that the merger would be rejected,
then closed at SKr407 on news of the Fourth Fund and Folksam decisions.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Next target: high-risk homes and drivers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Bank of Scotland, the owners of Direct Line, the UK's fastest
growing insurer, yesterday issued a fresh challenge to the UK's traditional
insurance market by announcing the launch of a new telephone-based insurance
company for so-called 'non-standard risks'.
The company will sell policies to motorists and householders who currently
find it difficult or expensive to obtain cover, following steep increases in
premiums. From next year, it will aim to offer cheaper insurance to an
estimated 6m motorists who are classified as higher risk because of their
age, or because they drive fast cars or have poor claims records.
'We are not encouraging 17-year-olds to drive Ferraris,' explained Mr Peter
Wood, who will be non-executive chairman of the joint venture. 'But at the
moment many drivers are poorly served and find it impossible to get
affordable insurance. When they do find an insurer they are subject to
arbitrary rate increases and poor service.'
Formed in 1985, Direct Line now insures more than 1.25m of the estimated 12m
motorists regarded as 'standard risk'. It aims to attract an additional 1m
motor policyholders in the next 12 months and is also stepping up its sales
effort in the household insurance market.
Direct Line already offers household insurance to 273,000 home-owners and is
keen to eat into the market share of the large composite companies, which
sell most of their policies through building societies. Mr Wood's company is
critical of household policy commission rates of up to 30 per cent and
recently presented a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading.
Analysts believe the new motor insurance company will add to the pressures
faced by some UK insurance companies, who mainly rely on sales through
retail brokers. They have lost market share to Direct Line, Churchill and
other 'direct writers', which use a combination of mass media marketing and
telephone sales to sell direct to the public.
Lloyd's syndicates and some smaller companies, which specialise in the
'non-standard' market, could also be vulnerable.
Mr Steven Bird, an analyst with Smith New Court, said: 'In the past the
composites would have retreated to the non-standard market. They will now
find Mr Wood lurking there. They have nowhere to hide.'
Another analyst commented: 'They have already been knocked sideways by the
growth of direct writers in the motor market and had hoped to concentrate on
the higher risk end of the market.' A profitable non-standard market, served
by specialist underwriters, has emerged in the US.
Before setting up its new venture, Direct line visited specialist companies
such as Progressive of Cleveland, Ohio. One of the UK's composite insurers,
Guardian Royal Exchange, owns two specialist US subsidiaries - Globe
Insurance and American Ambassador - which are expanding in some US regional
markets.
The new venture would 'incorporate the hallmarks of Direct Line', said Mr
Wood - direct telephone sales and slick back room operations. This
combination has allowed the company to reduce expenses to less than 50 per
cent of those of its competitors and to offer premium rates between 5 and 15
per cent cheaper.
The new non-standard company will bring down rates, although its policies
will generally offer less cover than in the standard market. 'The idea is to
bring affordable insurance to people who are priced out of the market at the
moment,' explained Ms Jane Dickson, company secretary of Direct Line.
The marketing campaign is likely to place more emphasis on specialist motor
and other publications than on television adverts. And the new venture's
telesales operators - who underwrite policies with the help of sophisticated
computer software - may need greater experience of the insurance industry.
The new company will hope to achieve the same high 'retention rates' as
Direct Line, with more than four out of five policyholders choosing to renew
their policies with the company each year.
'We will stimulate the market and make it more competitive. A better way of
doing business is needed,' says Mr Wood.

FT  26 NOV 93 / BPB up 60% in wake of price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard
manufacturer, rose sharply yesterday after the company announced a 60 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 44m for the six months to the end
of September.
The rise follows the end of a debilitating European price war between BPB,
Lafarge-Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany.
BPB's share price rose 4 per cent yesterday to 278p following the
announcement of higher profits and a new round of price increases in the UK,
France and Germany from the beginning of next year.
Mr Alan Turner, BPB's chairman and acting chief executive, said prices in
its three main markets had risen on average by 25 per cent since the first
quarter of last year.
Plasterboard prices were planned to increase by a further 5 to 10 per cent
from next year. This would leave them below levels of the late 1980s. The
price war had cost the industry up to Pounds 200m a year in lost revenue.
Mr Turner resumed control of the company after the previous chief executive,
Mr John Maxwell, was ousted in September. Mr Pierre Cuny, who runs the
group's gypsum interests from Paris, is expected to become the new chief
executive. Mr Cuny was on Wednesday appointed group deputy chief executive.
The rise in first-half pre-tax profits was achieved after a Pounds 8.3m
redundancy charge. The interim dividend has been increased from 2.7p to 2.8p
 -leaving it more than twice covered by earnings which rose from 3.7p to 6p.
Turnover rose 5.4 per cent to Pounds 574.3m. Three-quarters of this increase
was because of higher selling prices, said Mr Turner. Volume sales of
plasterboard had also risen by 3 per cent. This was due mainly to a strong
performance in Germany offsetting lower activity in Britain and France.
Return on sales before redundancy charges increased three percentage points
to 10 per cent. A net cash inflow of Pounds 38.5m enabled the group to
reduce net borrowings to Pounds 198.3m - gearing of 28.8 per cent, against
38.4 per cent.
BPB has signed a technical exchange agreement with Yoshino, Japan's biggest
plasterboard manufacturer.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Mining investment trust beats UK record for fund launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Julian Baring, manager of one of the best performing gold funds, has hit
the jackpot with his latest brainchild, the Mercury World Mining Trust.
This investment company, covering a range of international mining and metals
shares, has attracted Pounds 380m before expenses - making it the UK's
biggest ever investment trust launch.
It easily outpaces the Pounds 280m raised this month by Limit (the London
Insurance Market Trust), a Lloyd's corporate capital fund, and the Pounds
246m launch of the M&amp;G Income in 1991.
Mr Baring said yesterday that in the pre-placing by merchant bank SG Warburg
and broker Cazenove some 173 institutions decided to buy shares in MWMT,
which set out to raise a minimum of Pounds 50m.
While some big investors bid for Pounds 20m blocks, 'a lot of people have
given me a little'. He suggested that many institutions missed having two
substantial UK mining groups to invest in.
They were left with only RTZ Corporation after the Hanson conglomerate
gobbled up Consolidated Gold Fields in 1989.
According to Mr Baring, base metals prices are today in a similar position
to the gold price a year ago - down in the dumps but ready to bounce back.
Consequently, he says it is reasonable to assume that the new trust can make
an 80 to 100 per cent return over the next five years.
A year ago Mr Baring toured many of the same institutions seeking money for
his gold funds. 'I failed miserably,' he said. Subsequently, as he
predicted, the gold price perked up and his Pounds 150m Mercury Gold and
General Fund now shows a rise of 267 per cent since the launch five years
ago.
'We certainly won't throw our money about in the mining markets to everybody
else's advantage,' he promised.
Base metal prices may take time to recover and he intends that MWMT will
initially be biased more towards gold than other commodities.
'Gold shares are likely to behave better earlier and base metals shares
should behave better later,' he says.
Another Pounds 120m ordinary shares with warrants in MWMT are being offered
to private investors at 100p each. There will be one warrant for every five
shares.
The minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000 and the annual management charge
1.25 per cent. The offer closes on December 8.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Clarke likely to ease pain of cuts on industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE offered a clear hint yesterday that the burden of tax
increases in next Tuesday's Budget would fall on consumers rather than
industry.
The chancellor's comments came amid Whitehall speculation that he will seek
to soften the impact of government spending cuts on the construction
industry by setting targets for privately-financed infrastructure projects.
The officials said that to avoid the embarrassment of a tight squeeze on
government capital spending they expected Mr Clarke to outline in greater
detail the contribution he expected private finance to make to roads, prison
building and housing.
Speaking in his last Commons appearance before the Budget, Mr Clarke denied
that he was offering a foretaste of next Tuesday's speech.
But, in a generally upbeat assessment of economic prospects, his emphasis on
the need to expand Britain's manufacturing base left Conservative MPs in
little doubt that industry would escape relatively lightly.
The chancellor told MPs it was true that 'we have to get industrial
production up higher', adding: 'We all meet businessmen and those working in
industry who know at the moment conditions are very difficult indeed.' He
stressed the need for faster falls in unemployment, saying it remained at
'an unacceptably high level'.
While the government faced a sharp attack from Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, over its 'broken promises' on taxation since the general
election, Mr Clarke reinforced expectations of further increases by saying
the Conservative party had not committed itself never to put up taxes. But
he appeared to rule out any increase in the standard 17.5 per cent rate of
value added tax.
This left Conservative MPs predicting that the brunt of tax increases was
most likely to fall on income tax allowances and on a possible extension of
the VAT base. There are also expectations that Mr Clarke will again postpone
the abolition of stamp duty on share transactions.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, meanwhile set the stage for
a progressive squeeze on welfare spending by stressing in a speech last
night that without cuts the system would 'collapse under its own weight'.
Delivering a memorial lecture in London dedicated to the late Sir Ian Gow,
Mr Lilley said there was a limit to what the state could provide without
undermining the economy.
Foreshadowing cuts in invalidity benefit and the transfer to employers of
much of the cost of industrial benefits, Mr Lilley said: 'In the future
welfare society we are building, as the economy grows, an increasing share
of provision will be made by individuals, families and companies.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Loyalist Tory MPs fail to win control of 1922 committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Loyalist Conservative MPs last night failed in a campaign to break rightwing
control of the 1922 committee of backbench MPs and bolster Mr John Major's
leadership.
In elections for the 12-strong executive committee, the rightwing 92 Group
held on to its nine places, in spite of strong lobbying by the loyalist
Mainstream group.
No Mainstream members were elected, although the group made vigorous
attempts to present the vote as an opportunity for MPs to rally round the
prime minister.
The election will strengthen pressure on Mr Major to placate the right on
issues such as Europe, public spending and reform of the welfare system.
However, some MPs warned that any attempt by the right to exploit the result
could provoke a rebellion by the centre-left, particularly over European
policy.
The only consolation for Mr Major was the defeat of Sir George Gardiner, the
Thatcherite chairman of the 92 Group, and one of the most vocal critics of
the Maastricht treaty.
Sir George appeared to have paid the price for his outspoken criticism of
the government over Maastricht, regarded by some MPs as bordering on
disloyalty.
He was replaced by Mr David Evans, the MP for Welwyn and Hatfield, who is
seen as a member of the hard right on most issues but also professes loyalty
to the prime minister.
Mainstream failed to dislodge four other key targets - Sir Ivan Lawrence, Mr
James Pawsey, Mr John Townend, and Sir Rhodes Boyson - who are all viewed as
hard line rightwingers.
Voting figures were not released by the 1922 committee, which plays a
crucial role in representing backbench opinion and liaising with Downing
Street.
Mainstream's failure to weaken the right's hold underlines the
organisational ability of the ideologically focused 92 Group. Mainstream was
forced to include several rightwingers on its election slate after some
members failed to agree on a centre-left list.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Kohl's candidate drops out of race for German presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Steffen Heitmann, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chosen candidate for the
German presidency, yesterday withdrew from the race amid mounting criticism
over his controversial views on women, nationalism and Germany's past.
His resignation represents a personal blow for Mr Kohl who had stubbornly
defended Mr Heitmann as recently as last Wednesday in a speech to the
Bundestag.
Yesterday, the chancellor said the justice minister from the eastern state
of Saxony had been the victim of a shameful campaign: 'The intolerable
campaign of personal attacks and defamation against Steffen Heitmann in the
last few months shames all those who took part in it.'
Mr Heitmann, 49, created a furore when, in reference to the Holocaust, he
said Germany need not be permanently shamed by its past. He also suggested
that women should return to their traditional role as mothers, and that more
attention should be paid to those Germans who felt they were being swamped
by foreigners and refugees.
His resignation will come as a relief to many east Germans, who believed Mr
Kohl had chosen a relatively unknown easterner to rein in the presidency. Mr
Richard von Weizsacker, the incumbent, spoke out on several controversial
issues, including the social and political responsibilities of unification.
Several eastern German officials also argued that the west German media
coverage was condescending and biased in the way it equated easterners with
Mr Heitmann's views.
In his resignation statement, Mr Heitmann appealed - some German officials
believe at the behest of Mr Kohl - 'to all parties in the interests of the
internal unity of our country to agree on a joint candidate' (for
president).
He proposed Mr Richard Schroder, an opposition Social Democrat and a
philosophy professor and theologian at the Humboldt University in Berlin,
even though the Social Democrats (SPD) have overwhelmingly endorsed the
popular Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine Westphalia. The
question is whether the coalition government and the SPD will seek a
consensus candidate. The president will be elected by a special convention
representing all the parliamentary parties next May.
Any horsetrading would suit Mr Kohl. It may deflect criticism over his
miscalculated support for Mr Heitmann. It would also give the chancellor
time to repair the damage before next year's federal and state elections.

FT  26 NOV 93 / State pension age for women may rise to 65
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior figures in the pensions industry believe the government has decided
to equalise state pensions ages at 65 for men and women.
Top executives in the industry are expecting Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, to make the unpopular announcement immediately after
next week's Budget.
They believe Mr Lilley will unveil a consultation paper recommending that
the retirement age for women is raised from 60 to 65 when he makes his
speech outlining the upratings in social security benefit for the 1994/95
fiscal year.
Last night, both the Treasury and the Department of Social Security would
neither confirm nor deny the possibility.
Pension industry executives, however, say they have been advised by senior
Whitehall officials to stand by for an important policy announcement during
Mr Lilley's speech.
He is also expected to announce a review of government contracting out
provisions for the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and a review of the
guaranteed minimum pension.
The decision, likely to be unpopular with women, who are currently entitled
to a full state pension at the age of 60, fits in with the government's long
term plans to reduce the burden of the state pensions system on the
exchequer.
The industry also hopes that such an announcement will mean that the
government will not attempt to raise revenues by removing the tax advantages
currently available for private pension schemes.
The government has said it would like equalisation to be part of its overall
pensions legislation for the 1994/95 parliamentary year.
The equalisation of pension ages will not save much in the short term. But
once phased in, this change could save the Treasury an estimated Pounds 3bn
a year.

FT  26 NOV 93 / DTI case against four Polly Peck directors dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A high court judge has dismissed on lack of evidence attempts to bring
disqualification proceedings against four directors of Polly Peck
International, the collapsed fruit-to-electronics conglomerate.
In transcripts of a hearing earlier this month Mr Justice Lindsay calls the
case made against the directors 'at best speculative and very weak'.
His ruling covers Mr David Fawcus, Polly Peck's finance director, Mr Mark
Ellis, joint managing director in 1983-87, and Mr Lawrence Tindale and Mr
Ulf Siebel, two non-executive directors.
The judgment will prove an embarrassment to the Department of Trade and
Industry, which was last month criticised in a National Audit Office report
on the whole process of directors' disqualifications, including their
administration.
It appears to focus responsibility for alleged misconduct among directors
solely on fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck
facing charges totalling Pounds 34m for theft and false accounting.
The DTI was requesting more time to bring disqualification proceedings
beyond the normal statutory limit of two years following the insolvency of
the company.
But the judge said there had been delays in preparing the case that were
'unreasonable', and there was 'no good reason' for the extensions. He added
that further delays would prejudice the directors under scrutiny.
The DTI's case was based on statutory reports submitted on each of the
directors made by Mr Christopher Morris, a partner with accountants Touche
Ross and one of the joint administrators of Polly Peck. Most of the reports
are believed to have been in general terms without specific evidence to
justify disqualification. One referring to Mr Nadir was highly critical.
The transcript shows the case was based on four charges related to
inadequate financial controls, and failure to monitor or question spending
in Polly Peck's Near East subsidiaries.

FT  26 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just as well that Volvo has finally drummed up some significant
shareholder support for its proposed merger with Renault. Independence is
simply not an option for an automotive company with such a limited product
range. Management's apparent victory, though, is largely tactical. The
French clarification of the golden share issue and privatisation programme
pulled the rug from under the feet of opponents. Their visceral dislike of
ceding a national champion to foreign control will remain.
Volvo, therefore, still needs to work hard at its investor relations, which
have taken a knock from Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar's strong-willed style. Besides,
a close alliance between the company and its owners will help defend Volvo's
interests in the Renault deal. In the short run the French company's
deteriorating profits will dilute Volvo's earnings. In the longer term Volvo
must adapt to the awkward position of having no direct control over its
largest asset.
Admittedly, Volvo will be the largest single shareholder in Renault-Volvo
after privatisation and theoretically be able to exercise considerable
influence. But the French side will dominate the executive, and the car
industry is littered with examples of failed mergers. The best are those,
like Peugeot-Citroen, which involve the maintenance of distinctive brands as
well as just cost savings. Volvo must ensure that its brand is not devalued
if the merger is to make sense. If not, it could be left with an indifferent
investment of no strategic value.

FT  26 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BPB Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ripple of excitement in building materials stocks caused by BPB's
profits resurgence will provide comfort for those who have bid up the sector
by more than 90 per cent since sterling's devaluation. Throw in the latest
base rate cut and encouraging building figures and it is even tempting to
see scope for further outperformance. Yet in believing this, the market is
overlooking some immediate worries. The threat of the chancellor putting the
hobnailed hush puppy into social housing and local government spending
should at least occasion some pause for thought.
There is also a danger of generalising from the particular. Several special
factors have aided BPB. The plasterboard war, which devastated prices, has
abated and margins are rebounding faster than they will in other sectors.
Moreover, BPB has had greater opportunity to cut costs, given its history as
a flabby monopoly producer. The 15 per cent rise in German plasterboard
volumes confirms the strength of that market. Then again, the shares of RMC
and Redland should have already discounted as much.
The big question for BPB will be whether it seeks to diversify in order to
smooth its volatile earnings stream. The group's strong cash generation,
which is rapidly eroding gearing, is creating the opportunity. But any such
plans seem to have perished with the abrupt departure of the chief executive
in September.

FT  26 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Direct Line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to begrudge Mr Peter Wood his millions, since he has built the
UK's largest motor insurer from scratch. Unlike notorious growth stocks of
the 1980s, Direct Line's success is based soundly on its position as the
lowest cost producer in an otherwise sleepy market. Plans to expand in home
insurance and the risky end of motor insurance make sense. Buyers are paying
unnecessary expenses - such as building societies' commissions on house
structure policies. Low costs should prove a big advantage.
Insuring risky drivers is not a commodity business, so the decision to set
up a new venture in this area also looks wise. Yet with decent computer
systems it should be possible to keep close tabs on claims. The US
experience suggests good profits can be made in this area. With around 6m
riskier motorists to aim at, and 15m insurance-buying households, the Direct
Line formula has plenty of mileage left.
Royal Bank of Scotland has little incentive to demerge its progeny. Direct
Line should be self-financing within 18 months. A high level of reinsurance
cover reduces the risk of a hurricane blowing a hole in the bank's profits.
With an expense ratio well below the competition - and falling as it pushes
more business through existing systems - Direct Line could follow prices
lower through the underwriting cycle and still remain profitable. Applying a
growth-stock multiple to this year's likely earnings results in a market
valuation comfortably above Pounds 1bn. Even after yesterday's rally, Royal
Bank shareholders should continue to feel the benefit.

FT  26 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Oil in troubled waters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bind which ties Opec members is clearly beginning to hurt badly. On the
one hand a shortage of revenue argues for a price increase, on the other
Opec does not wish to be railroaded into ceding market share, only to risk
prices remaining weak. That scent of blood in the water is all the excuse
speculators need to push the crude price lower.
Yet the lack of response of the oil majors' share prices may tell the more
accurate story. The imbalance between supply and demand is not very great
and Opec may be right to suppose the market will tighten over the next few
weeks. If a cut is genuinely needed it is probably no more than the 2 per
cent proposed at the meeting, and which could be agreed at an emergency
session. In the slightly longer term the central expectation is that crude
oil will move back into the Dollars 16-Dollars 18 a barrel range.
Temporary weakness in crude prices is in any case partly offset by a
consequent gain in refining and marketing margins for companies with
significant downstream interests. Perhaps more importantly, the market is
concentrating on cost-cutting and the prospects for cyclical recovery.
Retrenchment means Shell may well generate more cash this year with oil at
Dollars 16 than it did two years ago when crude was Dollars 21 a barrel.
BP's third-quarter figures show that much of the benefit of cost reductions
is being retained by the company. The risk to the rosy view of increasingly
efficient companies approaching the turn in the world economy is that oil
prices go down and stay down. If that happens the oil majors will be
suffering alongside Opec and the explorers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sounds like the government might be having a spot of trouble finding a
heavyweight political figure to fill the chair of the Housing Corporation,
the quango that distributes government grants to housing associations.
John Maples, highly regarded as economic secretary until he lost his seat in
Lewisham at the 1992 general election, isn't interested. 'When I started
this enforced sabbatical I decided to get a full-time job rather than lots
of little ones. I am sticking to that,' says Maples, now running one of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's government lobbying outfits.
Sir David Trippier, also evicted from Parliament last year, might seem a
better bet. He has done two stints at the Department of the Environment, the
Housing Corporation's paymaster, so knows the business well. He would be
'flattered to be asked', but even if he were he says he would say No. He's
enjoying himself too much as chairman of Tepnel Diagnostics, a
bio-technology company.
Given that this month's Budget is likely to cut the grant of one of
Britain's biggest quangos, the former MPs' disinclination is perhaps
understandable. Looks like the government may have to make do with another
property developer after all.

Kenneth Clarke's verbal thuggery spreads abroad, notably in two recent bouts
with Jacques Delors in which the Frenchman was treated to manners usually
reserved for Britain's police and medics. Brussels folk are beginning to ask
how Clarke got a reputation as one of the most pro-European ministers.
An obscure Euro-law on urban waste water supposedly costing the British
taxpayer Pounds 10bn caught the rough edge of Clarke's tongue - the only
problem being that the British government had itself supported the directive
in a unanimous vote. The chancellor was also pretty rude about the benefits
of work-sharing, neglecting to acknowledge that Delors had distanced himself
from that very principle.
A pained EC president wondered aloud why Clarke was obsessed with winning
and losing. He even offered to build a cricket pitch next door so his
English friend could wield his brick-bats elsewhere.
Why not exploit both men's sporting loves in a more constructive fashion by
arranging a tryst at the Anderlecht football ground during the chancellor's
next visit?

Cable &amp; Wireless seems to have a knack of acquiring the services of
ministers formerly responsible for its well-being. First, Lord Young becomes
chairman of the privatised telecommunications group, hot-foot from the
Department of Trade and Industry. Now Michael Manley, prime minister of
Jamaica until last March, appears on its payroll as C&amp;W's chief lobbyist
with Cuba's Fidel Castro.
Once upon a time Jamaica's phone system was as decrepit as Cuba's and C&amp;W
mended it. So presumably Manley has been hired to tell Fidel what a good job
it did. If the ploy works, it could turn out to provide a nice little number
for other out-of-work politicians. Who knows, there could be a job for an
ex-governor of Hong Kong, helping C&amp;W's Hong Kong Telecom crack the Chinese

FT  26 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Mr Kohl loses his gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Under the wise post-war German constitution, the country's federal
presidency is a post devoid of real political power. Mr Richard von
Weizsacker, the incumbent, has, however, shown that the German head of state
can wield weighty influence within and beyond his country's borders.
Germany's complex struggle to come to terms with unification has increased
both the potential authority of the office and the pitfalls into which it
can stumble. After chancellor Helmut Kohl's mishandling of the issue of Mr
von Weizsacker's successor, the damage runs deep. The stature of the
presidency will probably recover. Mr Kohl's may not.
Yesterday's decision by Mr Steffen Heitmann, the chancellor's choice as Mr
von Weizsacker's successor, to step down from the presidential race was an
inevitable reaction to the hostility caused by his candidacy within and
beyond the governing Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The tactlessness of Mr Heitmann's remarks during the summer on the holocaust
or Germany's European role has sometimes been exaggerated. Yet he never
looked likely to live up to Mr von Weizsacker's standards. Mr Kohl's initial
decision to back an untried east German was always risky. It has now been
exposed as an ill-thought out gamble, laying the chancellor open to charges
that, after 11 years in power, he is falling prey to hubris.
After his 1989-90 reunification triumph, Mr Kohl has during the last few
years started to look out of touch with the realities of his country's
economic challenges. In contrast to his predecessor, Mr Helmut Schmidt, the
chancellor's strength has been his pre-eminence in dealing with adversarial
elements in his own party. His loss of sure-footedness as revealed in the
Heitmann affair will further weaken an already unpopular CDU. Mr Kohl has
earned his place in the history books. But, as he ponders next year's
mammoth run of regional and national elections, he runs the risk of looking
like a lame duck.
No party can benefit from the last few months' spectacle of horse-trading of
Germany's highest political office. But the chances must have increased that
the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) will take the presidency for only the
second occasion in the history of the post-1949 republic. The party has now
two respected candidates, Mr Johannes Rau and Mr Richard Schroder, the east
German professor yesterday endorsed by Mr Heitmann.
Mr Kohl's rationale in putting forward the Heitmann candidacy was to avoid
formally endorsing a Social Democrat candidate. This would have undermined
Mr Kohl's position by appearing to open up a path next year to a formal
CDU-SPD grand coalition, under another leader. After the presidential
debacle, Mr Kohl's strategy has misfired. If a grand coalition starts to
look the most likely outcome of next year's elections, Mr Kohl's position as
party leader and chancellor could become increasingly untenable.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Rush for Balladur's winter bargains / Examining the initial
success of France's privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So far, so good. The smooth sale of the French government's stake in the
chemicals group Rhone Poulenc means that the first brace of companies on its
21-strong privatisation list has been successfully dispatched from the
public sector.
As with Banque Nationale de Paris, which launched the government's FFr250bn
(Pounds 28.47bn) privatisation programme last month, Rhone Poulenc was much
in demand. The public share issue was three times over-subscribed, prompting
the government to exercise a claw-back option from institutional investors,
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, announced yesterday.
'We are off to a strong start,' says an official at the economy ministry. He
adds that the FFr13bn to be raised from the sale of Rhone Poulenc and
FFr28bn from Banque Nationale de Paris will enable the government to reach
its target of FFr40bn from privatisations this year. Over the next few
weeks, the private sale of Banque Hervet, the small retail bank, should be
completed, adding about one billion francs to privatisation proceeds.
But this year's receipts pale alongside the whole programme, the largest
sell-off in a wave of privatisations in Europe. The big question facing the
government and investors is whether the successes of Rhone Poulenc and BNP
can be repeated as bigger, more complex or less attractive issues are led to
the auction block.
Most observers are confident, at least for the next few issues. 'I don't see
the process becoming more difficult,' says Mr Didier Cherpitel, managing
director in Paris of J P Morgan, the US investment bank. 'The companies to
come are well known and in appealing sectors.' The government has also shown
its willingness to sell its assets at attractive prices - shares in both BNP
and Rhone Poulenc were offered at a discount of about 13 per cent to their
market price.
Next on the auction block will be Elf-Aquitaine, the oil company and
France's largest industrial group. It is the final name on the list of four
companies selected to launch the privatisation programme and will be sold
early next year. The next phase in the sell-off has yet to be announced. But
Union des Assurances de Paris, the country's largest insurer, is expected to
be near the top that list.
Preparations for the sale of Elf and UAP are under way. Mr Edouard Balladur,
the prime minister, has installed his own men to head the two groups - Mr
Philippe Jaffre at Elf and Mr Jacques Friedmann at UAP. Like BNP and Rhone
Poulenc, Elf is suffering from falling profits - a result of depressed
European markets and the weak oil price. Mr Jaffre predicts 'mediocre'
results of just over FFr1bn this year, against FFr6.2bn in 1992. But
industry observers expect an adequate demand for shares in Elf, as profits
are set to recover over the next two years.
At UAP, recovery is under way. After a sharp fall in profits last year, the
insurance group announced a 15 per cent rise in net profits to FFr1.09bn in
the first half. More importantly, Mr Friedmann's predecessor, Mr Jean
Peyrelevade, resolved a long-standing dispute with Suez, the financial and
industrial holding company. The agreement gives UAP control of Colonia, the
German insurance group, and enables Mr Friedmann to strengthen his company's
European presence.
The further down the list of privatisation candidates the government moves,
however, the more complex the sell-off process becomes. In some cases this
is because of restructuring plans, in others because the candidates are
loss-making, indebted enterprises.
The biggest restructuring is at Renault, which is attempting to merge with
Volvo of Sweden. The government's decision to complete the merger before
privatisation is logical. 'You can't ask investors to buy shares before a
big change in the shape of the group,' says Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's
chairman. But the merger is proving problematic. Swedish shareholders,
concerned about the terms of the agreement, could sink the deal at a vote on
December 7.
Renault, which has remained in profit throughout the downturn in the world
car industry, could be sold with or without a successful merger with Volvo.
Elsewhere, however, restructuring is likely to be a condition of
privatisation. One example is Pechiney, the loss-making aluminium producer.
To increase its attraction, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, is
considering a classic case of what the French describe as 'industrial
meccano'. This would involve an alliance between Pechiney and Compagnie
Nationale du Rhone, a low-cost supplier of hydro-electricity.
Such strategic restructuring illustrates a paradox likely to appear in
several privatisation issues - the need for the state to intervene in some
companies to prepare the ground for a loosening of state control. In the
case of Pechiney it has prompted resistance from Electricite de France, the
state-owned utility, which is understandably reluctant to lose one of its
most profitable operations. But the interests of EDF's political masters are
likely to overcome such protests.
Stronger opposition to the privatisation plans comes from union protests
against rationalisation. Without job cuts, loss-making companies on the
privatisation list - such as Bull, the computer manufacturer, Air France and
Aerospatiale, the aerospace group - will find it difficult to return to
profit.
With unemployment at 11.8 per cent and rising, the government is unwilling
to risk social unrest by fuelling the ranks of the jobless. Last month's
strike at Air France, which prompted the government to shelve an austerity
plan at the airline, sent a powerful signal that public sector industry
should avoid involuntary redundancies.
As the more attractive members of public sector industry line up for sale,
such a constraint is limited. But the postponement of rationalisation
measures at Air France and other loss-makers may make it difficult to
privatise them within the government's five-year timetable.
If the supply of companies to be privatised may become more problematic
after next year, what are the prospects for demand? The potential remains
strong. 'There is a lot of domestic liquidity,' says Mr Cherpitel of J P
Morgan, referring to the FFr1,200bn of savings held in Sicav money market
funds.
These funds have been rendered less attractive as interest rates have
fallen. Interest rates on three-month loans are now less than 7 per cent
against more than 9 per cent late last year. In addition, there are savings
committed to the government's Balladur bond, which raised FFr110bn when it
was issued last summer and which can be converted into privatisation shares.
International prospects are also encouraging. 'The French programme should
be quite successful in attracting US investors,' says Mr David Boyle,
managing director of Citibank in New York. He argues that France represents
only 3 per cent of the European equities held by US investors and is, thus,
underweight in most US portfolios. Both the BNP and Rhone Poulenc issues
were oversubscribed by international institutional investors.
Whether potential demand is transformed into purchases will, however, depend
on French economic prospects and the stock market's performance. 'The major
risk is that a longer, deeper than expected economic recession could renew
equity market weakness in late 1993 and 1994,' says Mr Jean-Francois
Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros in London.
The government has struck an upbeat tone in this respect. 'The economy seems
to be on the right footing,' said Mr Balladur last Sunday, promising further
stimulatory measures if necessary. But private sector economists are more
cautious. They describe official forecasts of a 1.4 per cent increase in
Gross National Product next year as optimistic, arguing recovery requires a
fall in interest rates and a revival in consumer confidence.
Without lower borrowing costs the prospects for economic recovery will
remain fragile. So too will the performance of the stock market. In that
case, France's grand public sector sell-off would find the going much
harder.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Welsh wizardry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government policies for economic regeneration in Wales are often hailed as a
model which could be copied in England. Inward investment is one symbol of
success: with just 5 per cent of the population, Wales has won around 20 per
cent of jobs from investment into the UK in recent years. The unemployment
rate in Wales - in the past higher than the UK average - is now slightly
below the average.
Yet doubts persist about the substance behind the rhetoric of achievement. A
study published this week by the Government Statistical Service questions
the success of the Programme for the Valleys. This initiative, launched in
1988, pumped Pounds 770m of public funds into the the south Wales valleys
during its first five years. Yet manufacturing employment in the area fell
by 11 per cent over the period, compared with a drop of 7 per cent across
Wales. While there has been a small improvement in the unemployment rate, it
is only marginally greater than for Wales as a whole.
It may be that it is too soon to reach a judgment on what is inevitably a
long-term process. The initiative has achieved a good record in land
reclamation, with most derelict land now cleared. Considerable improvements
have been made in infrastructure such as roads and industrial buildings.
Without the additional 5,000 jobs in overseas-owned manufacturing plants
created in the first five years of the initiative, the area would have fared
much worse. Yet for all the flow of public money, the economy of the valleys
has done little better than the rest of Wales.
Wednesday's is the third official report in three years to raise doubts
about government regeneration policies in Wales. In 1991, the National Audit
Office criticised the government's failure to calculate accurately the
returns on public investment in job-creation. In 347 projects approved in
1984-85, 16,745 jobs had been created, compared with a forecast of 25,715.
While the aim was to use government funds to lever in between three and
eight times as much in private investment, the NAO found that the figure was
closer to 1.7 times.
More recently, there has been embarrassing criticism of the Welsh
Development Agency, the government's economic regeneration arm in Wales. A
Commons committee accused it of wasting public money on redundancy payments
and an unsuccessful project to consider possible privatisation.
Economic regeneration undoubtedly needs public funds if the private sector
is to be attracted back into areas such as the Welsh valleys. But costs and
benefits must be analysed openly and accurately to ensure that limited
resources are deployed effectively. Lord Walker, the Welsh secretary between
1987 and 1990 who launched the Programme for the Valleys, would do well to
remember this in his new job as as chairman of English Partnerships, the
government's urban regeneration agency for England.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Personal View: Balkan crisis comes between friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND S CALAMARO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As European Union officials prepare for Bill Clinton's first trip to Europe
as president, in January, there is a growing awareness that something is
seriously wrong in Europe-US relations. Trouble was in the air even before
President Clinton, strengthened by his recent North American Free Trade
Agreement victory, signalled to Europe that the US would favour its Asian
trading partners if the EU does not move far enough to make possible a deal
on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Is there a Europe-US crisis in the making? Is trade the problem? The answer
to the first question is maybe and to the second no. The real problem is the
tragedy in the former Yugoslavia and the questions it raises about who
should do what in world peacekeeping. There are trade disputes, but for now
each side is doing what it could be expected to do - bargain. The Balkan
crisis is deeper and harder to talk about.
Some in Europe have difficulty understanding why this should keep coming up
in transatlantic relations. Americans are seen in Europe as naive,
self-righteous and hectoring, or at least unrealistic when they seemingly
preach to Europe about a problem that has no easy solution, no single
villain and apparently nothing but political downside. At least in trade the
EU can understand the US interest, but in the Balkans Americans seem like
boy scouts. In fact, the US does have an essential interest in knowing its
closest allies share a sense of peacekeeping responsibilities.
The fall of the Soviet Union and end of a world dominated by two superpowers
has ignited a debate within the US about its role in world peacekeeping.
There is little consensus on when it is necessary to use force and who
should do it. But many key US policymakers, especially in Congress, continue
to believe the primary responsibility for the Balkans lies with Europe.
However well-intentioned and skilful Lord Owen's efforts have been,
including the most recent round to try to exchange sanctions for territory,
they appear to lack two essential ingredients of world peacekeeping: muscle
and moral basis.
As to muscle, there is intense resentment both on Capitol Hill and among
some administration officials towards the perception that Europe will not or
cannot use force where it must. Americans do not want to be the bouncers or
bodyguards for other wealthy nations that sit comfortably indoors. Europeans
have not forgotten the stinging comments of Senator Joseph Biden, the
ranking Democrat on the foreign relations committee, a few months ago, to
the effect that Americans were tired of Europe 'holding our coats' while
urging the US to do the fighting.
On the lack of moral basis, the Now York Times columnist, Anthony Lewis,
wrote in March that the EU was a 'dead. . .soul-less creature' because of
its failure to act meaningfully to stop the carnage in Bosnia. It is not
just Americans who have been critical. The Czech Republic's president,
Vaclav Havel, said in his October 9 address to the general assembly of the
Council of Europe: 'The former Yugoslavia is the first great testing ground
for Europe in the era that was initiated by the end of the cold war.' Havel
added that Europe's response is a failure on a scale with its failure to
deal with Nazism and Soviet tyranny.
The moral vacuum of Europe's actions - or non-actions - is underscored by
the plan for a partial lifting of sanctions in exchange for more land for
Bosnian Moslems. In itself, this is probably a good stop, and the US does
seem so far to favour it. However, the problem is that it lacks any
condemnation, let alone deterrence, for the unspeakable acts of inhumanity
that have transpired and will almost certainly continue. What if such trades
succeed in calming the hostilities and even providing relief from the
winter? Of course, that would be a blessing, but what lesson would it give?
Kill, rape, torture, maim innocent people, including the old and young,
until it gets you no more - then sit down and do business.
By accepting its responsibility to stop the atrocities, punish the guilty
and restore what Havel referred to as 'the values of a civic society based
on the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and cultures', Europe
would prove itself a trusted and trustable ally with which the US can join
to preserve world peace. This is not to say that Europe and North America
must always agree on peacekeeping, the role of force and who must do what
and where. But they must at least both be in the same game, willing to take
similar risks to preserve common values.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese authorities have long enjoyed an enviable reputation for astute
management of the world's most dynamic economy. They are losing their
reputation, as the economy has lost its dynamism. Worse, they seem
unwilling, or unable, to do anything effective about it.
Earlier this week Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, admitted
that he could see no sign of recovery, though he doubted whether the
recession would develop into a 'worsening spiral'. This is slight comfort.
In any case, he insisted, the central bank had 'taken all necessary steps in
terms of monetary policy,' after cutting its discount rate seven times since
July 1991. This is an unpersuasive excuse.
Even as he spoke, the ministry of international trade and industry disclosed
that industrial production had dropped by 3.8 per cent year-on-year in the
third quarter. Prospects for industrial output also remain poor, with
inventories 1.1 per cent higher at the end of September than three months
earlier and the monthly index of leading indicators in decline. Meanwhile,
real household spending was down 1.7 per cent in the year to September.
With companies suffering declining demand at home and the burden of an
appreciated yen, profits are inevitably depressed, as is the stock market,
down 19 per cent since September. Economists share the gloom, disagreeing
only over whether gross national product will stagnate or grow slightly next
year, after stagnating or falling this year.
Unlike Germany, Japan seems to be in the grips of a true deflation:
wholesale prices have been falling at an annual rate of around 3-4 per cent
a year, while consumer prices are rising at about 1 per cent. In the
Japanese case, there is no excuse for monetary stringency. Yet broad money
has grown little since 1991. No wonder nominal gross domestic product
expanded by a mere 0.2 per cent in the year to the second quarter of 1993.
Since the combination of expansionary fiscal packages with slow monetary
growth tends to push up the exchange rate, monetary policy must be loosened
as well. If low interest rates have little effect, the Bank of Japan could
inject money via aggressive open market operations. The authorities could
also increase the responsiveness of bank lending to interest rate cuts, by
helping accelerate the removal of bad debts from bank balance sheets.
Meanwhile, radical deregulation - including liberalisation of agricultural
imports - should be sold as a way of dampening any incipient inflation and
creating new opportunities for growth.
Why should an economy with no inflation, huge productive potential and an
exceptionally strong fiscal position suffer persistent stagnation? If the
Japanese authorities cannot think of a really good answer to this question,
they should try harder to stop it being asked.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp market tested and offers jobs
in high unemployment area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord INGLEWOOD MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You have just published a series of long and detailed letters about
Thorp (November 23).
If this proposal proceeds it will create in the order of 5,000 jobs in West
Cumbria, which is an area of high unemployment.
Not one word was devoted to the economic and employment consequences of this
proposal for my constituents. I do think that any debate about Thorp must
include a recognition of the economic importance of this project for those
in the locality.
Clearly, human and environmental safety is the paramount consideration, but
simply to overlook and ignore the economic and employment implications on
the west coast of Cumbria is to omit a very important and legitimate aspect
of the debate. Those who do so debase their own arguments.

Sir, With 3,000 jobs on the line at the Thorp plant at Sellafield and many
more at stake in contracting companies such as mine, the debate about
whether the plant should open is absurd, as Paul Leventhal suggests
(Letters, November 23).
However, he misses the point. Thorp is built. It has full order books and
the customers put up their money in advance. The German and Japanese
utilities have said again and again that they stand by their commitments to
the plant. What greater market test can there be than that?
It is time that British industry was left alone to do the job it knows best:
to lead the world in high technology; to make profits and be proud of it.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your comment ('Flat-owner plan fails to attract funds', November 3)
that without freely available advice take-up of the right of collective
enfranchisement will be low is not supported by the facts.
Housing minister Sir George Young's hope to have an advisory group financed
and set up to help both landlords and tenants in this area to understand the
terms of the act may have foundered, but there are many bodies and firms
that have already published excellent guides apart from that published by
his own department (some of which are free, some not) to enlighten those
entitled to participate.
This federation has been giving free counselling to its members since 1971
in this field, from forming tenants associations to running a block of flats
after purchase of the freehold. It will continue to do so long after any

FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Cooling off would avert tax problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms KAY INGRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Jack highlights the possibility that the chancellor will reduce
or remove tax relief on pension contributions in the forthcoming Budget
('Planning to counter the budget crunch', November 20). He indicates that
higher rate taxpayers should consider making contributions before Budget day
to safeguard higher rate relief currently available.
However, his warning that any immediate action could result in the potential
loss of higher levels of tax relief, assuming income tax rates go up and
pension tax relief is untouched, is spurious. The cooling off requirements
of the Financial Services Act mean anyone in this position can safely make a
contribution.
Should this prove not to have been the best course of action, they will be
able to cool off and receive a full refund of their contributions within 14
days. Those likely to be affected by these possible changes should consult
an independent financial adviser.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Motorways need more service stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Miss PIP PIRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, After so many tragedies recently on the roads, I feel I must voice my
opinion about the severe lack of service stations on the motorways. There
are none on the M40. I am a student in Birmingham and living permanently in
Sussex I often drive home. The 180-mile journey is entirely devoid of
services. The Department of Transport has brought it to our attention that
'tiredness can kill' and that we should 'take a break'.
The question as far as the M40 is concerned is: 'Where?' Recently, a mother
travelling with her children in the back of the car was fined for stopping
on the hard shoulder for fear of falling asleep at the wheel. Her crime was
that she had not broken down and was therefore illegally parked. Ironically,
the idiot who changed his wheel in the outside lane was let off with a
caution. Surely it has got to a stage where the government must react
positively to these frequent incidents.
Many a time have I driven past a lorry that is weaving between the hard
shoulder and the inside lane, the driver obviously dropping off. These HGV
drivers are under a great deal of pressure to deliver on time, but there is
only so much one can do to stay awake. Service stations could and should be
included at the road planning stage. There is so much that needs to be done
to lift the safety standard of roads but providing more service stations
would be a step in the right direction.
I know my mother is not the only parent who worries more and more about the
safety of her children on the roads.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R HOEGH-JOHANSEN and Mr M RUBERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is widely accepted that the credit boom of the 1980s was due to
financial deregulation and over-optimism about growth. It resulted in the
private sector incurring a high level of debt and this led to the current
recession.
We believe the private sector's priority is still to reduce this debt burden
because of less optimistic economic outlook and borrowing constraints by a
more cautious banking sector. Consequently, cutting interest rates in the
budget will not result in an immediate increase in investment or consumption
but rather will at most bring closer the date when a desirable ratio of debt
to income has been restored. Only then will we enjoy sustained
non-inflationary growth.
Therefore, we ought not be expecting a 'quick fix' solution but instead look
to maintain a consistent long-term monetary policy.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Not so slick as the market: Robert Corzine detects a steep
decline in Opec's influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After storming onto the world's economic stage about 25 years ago, the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries this week bowed out, at least
temporarily, of its increasingly taxing role as an influence on the
short-term price of oil.
The decision on Wednesday night by the 12 delegations meeting in Vienna to
brush aside market demands for an immediate cut in Opec's 24.52m
barrel-a-day production ceiling may not herald the demise of the
organisation. But it does move it into a new era in which the emphasis is
likely to be on market share rather than on price. This is despite the fact
that all Opec states, including Saudi Arabia, the dominant producer, are
reeling from falling revenues.
The decision was a clear signal that Opec would not sacrifice volume for
higher prices. It was also tantamount to an admission that in a period of
plentiful supplies and weak demand in the main industrialised western
countries, Opec could no longer fine-tune the price in a way which would be
politically acceptable to its member governments.
'A small cut might not be enough to move the price,' said one delegate,
adding that such an outcome would be difficult for oil ministers to justify
on their return home.
This means that market forces alone will dictate the short-term price, which
they did with a vengeance yesterday, when the benchmark Brent blend fell to
Dollars 14.57 a barrel in late London trading.
Opec officials said they had fully expected 'the price to fall for a day or
two', as the market digested their view that the longer-term outlook for
balance between supply and demand were 'not that bad'. But Mr Mehdi Varzi,
research director of Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, yesterday
wondered 'where the rot would stop'. He saw many similarities between
current market conditions and those which led to the oil price collapse in
1986, when prices fell below Dollars 10 a barrel.
Not all industry observers shared such an apocalyptic view, but most agreed
that Opec's 12 member states have put at risk billions of dollars in
potential revenues in order to ensure that they maintain market share.
The alternative under discussion in Vienna - a modest cut of 2 per cent
shared between all members - carried with it an even higher political risk,
that of 'cutting back and ceding market share to non-Opec competitors and
not having the price recover', according to Mr Joseph Stanislaw, managing
director of the independent Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris.
The 'free ride' which non-Opec producers might be enjoying at the expense of
the organisation has been a recurrent theme in official statements this
week. The end of the conference communique noted that Opec alone should not
'have to bear the burden of balancing supply and demand'.
But appeals for restraint on the part of independent producers are unlikely
to be heeded. Opec is particularly vexed by a surge in North Sea production
by the UK and Norway, whose combined output could rise by as much as 1m
barrels a day in 1994, the equivalent of a medium-sized Opec producer.
Some analysts say, however, that Opec's focus on independent producers
merely serves to camouflage the deep distrust within the organisation
itself. 'When they say that others might simply move in to take over their
market share, they mean their own members,' said one US-based oil industry
expert.
An Opec delegate confirmed that uncertainty over whether a cut would have
resulted in full compliance was a factor in Wednesday's decision. 'Some
countries might not have abided by it,' he said. 'So a 500,000 barrel-a-day
cut might have been only 200,000 or so in reality' - a level unlikely to
have any lasting impact on bearish market psychology.
Opec's chronic weakness of large-scale cheating on quotas by some members
such as Iran and Nigeria meant that a 1m barrel-a-day cut was not put
forward. One delegate conceded, however, that it would have had a positive
effect on the markets. 'No one was in favour of it,' he said.
That left Opec with no other recourse than to stick to its September output
agreement, which set quotas close to most members' capacity in order to
minimise cheating. That agreement appears to be holding, and the conference
communique said it 'should be given necessary time to achieve its goals'.
It is a prospect which some experts say may be achievable. Dr Leonidas
Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Centre for Global Energy
Studies set up by Sheikh Yamani, former Saudi oil minister, believes an
estimated quarterly demand for Opec oil of 24.6m barrels a day in both the
present period and in the first three months of 1994 is likely to match Opec
output.
He predicts that a shortfall could emerge as early as the second quarter of
1994, when excess stocks built up earlier this year because of Opec
over-production should be eliminated. And that, he says, would imply a
Dollars 16.60 price for Opec's basket of six crude oils, well below its
Dollars 21 target price but well above the Dollars 14.70 level recorded on
Monday.
But many wonder whether Opec can wait that long or have full confidence in
demand forecasts which have been consistently trimmed in recent months.
Although all countries are suffering from what Mr Stanislaw describes as
'revenue deprivation', not all are hurting to the same degree.
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, for example, differ markedly from
heavily populated countries such as Nigeria and Iran, both of whose
poorly-performing domestic economies are propped up by hard currency oil
revenues.
Mr Varzi says the political implications of low oil prices could come to
dominate government thinking in such vulnerable countries in the months
ahead, especially if lower revenues threaten to trigger off widespread
social unrest. The scale of Opec's possible problem is highlighted by the
fact that for every Dollars 1 fall in the annualised oil price, member
states lose a combined Dollars 5bn in revenue.
Perhaps the only optimistic note which greeted oil ministers as they trooped
into their limousines yesterday en route to the airport and home was the
unseasonally early blanket of snow which covered Vienna and showed no signs
of melting. No doubt thoughts from their mainly desert and tropical capitals
will increasingly turn to hopes for a white and exceedingly cold Christmas
in the northern hemisphere.

<TEXT>
The Budget on Tuesday will have little to do with the economy. It will be
about political survival. So do not search this space for money-making or
money-saving tips about what will be in the chancellor's package, let alone
the likely market reaction to this tax or that spending cut. If I could
divine these things I would not be here; I would be George Soros. Economic
forecasting is impressive when its author makes billions out of it. The rest
is guesswork.
Politics is another matter. We can safely assume that what Mr Kenneth Clarke
has to say on Tuesday will, if he gets it badly wrong, break the government.
Getting it right may not save the present administration, but it would at
least make political recovery possible. In short, the chancellor has direct
responsibility for carrying out part 'B' of Mr John Major's plan to regain
his authority and stay prime minister. Part 'A', has been to survive, by
whatever means necessary, until the Budget. This has succeeded, albeit at
the cost of some unpleasant tacking towards the hard-faced Right.
The second part of the strategy will be revealed next week. Our Cheeky
Chappie chancellor will try to look the part as he reads out familiar
polysyllabic phrases whose real meaning will not be lost on anyone. He will
talk about reducing the public sector borrowing requirement, and possibly
even about rebalancing fiscal and monetary strategies. You can ignore all
that. Concentrate on the overall performance. 'We are not fools,' his jargon
will be saying. 'The government is not incompetent,' his elaborate analyses
will imply. Many audiences - his own backbenches, economic analysts, the
markets - will be expected to concur. The purpose will be to recover the
Conservatives' lost reputation for superior economic management. Mr Clarke
knew when he took the job at the beginning of the summer that this would
take some doing.
Yet if the trick can be managed, both the chancellor and Mr Major will be on
firmer ground. We are assured by a clutch of indicators that we can look
forward to at least a year or so of steady growth and low inflation. If so,
the Conservatives might begin to recover popular approval. It would be wrong
to take Tory optimism too far, but perhaps the party might even unite in
support of the government. Well, most of the party anyway. Its performance
in next year's local and European parliamentary elections could in
consequence be less awful than is currently anticipated. Mr Major, written
off so often since Britain's ejection from the exchange rate mechanism,
would be safer.
It is against this background that the pre-Budget arithmetic should be
rehearsed. Mr Clarke has consistently intimated, in both public and private,
that a deficit of Pounds 50bn is unacceptably high. Not everyone, least of
all the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, goes along with
this, but let us stick with the chancellor's known opinion. He has also
maintained, without wavering, that the public spending ceilings agreed
before he took the job are low enough - that there is little if any room for
a squeeze on expenditure greater than was envisaged by his predecessor. If
these two Clarke propositions remain constant until next week, and if no
sudden improvement in the PSBR is detected by a compliant Treasury computer,
taxes must be increased.
At this point the government's nerve will be tested. If it fails to raise
taxes by a convincing amount the economic competence argument will be lost,
at least to those for whom 'sound money' is an article of faith. If it does
increase taxation the new imposts will be piled on top of the mountain of
tax imposed by Mr Norman Lamont in the March Budget. The Conservative
election campaign of April 1992, already exposed as bogus, would come to be
fixed in the public mind as the shamelessly misleading undertaking it was.
In March, within a year of promising low taxes, Mr Major's government
imposed the biggest single wallop of extra taxation anybody can recall. Pile
on more agony next week and people may begin to ask a fatal question - if
Tories, like Labour, devalue the currency and balloon up taxes, why not
elect Labour in the first place?
The question would have less force if the Budget had been preceded by proper
public debate. The necessity for this or that measure might then be more
widely understood. The move to a 'unified' tax and spending statement is
merely a piece of camouflage. This year's spending negotiations were, as
ever, Treasury-led. The new procedure introduced last year has not produced
serious debate among colleagues about priorities. It was designed to ensure
collective responsibility for cuts forced on departmental ministers.
Taxation is not directly related to spending plans, but to the Treasury's
perception of what is needed to steer the economy, as amended by what is
required to keep the government in office. The real decisions are made in
secret by a handful of ministers and officials.
Supposed moves towards open government are not to be taken seriously.
Treasury ministers do now appear in public ('ending pre-Budget purdah'). The
governor of the Bank of England can decide when to announce the chancellor's
decisions. A committee of outside economists is 'consulted' by Mr Clarke.
These are gestures. They do not affect the substance of decision-making.
They do not allow for the additional wisdom that might accrue if the Budget
was issued as a green paper in advance of the real thing. The chancellor is
merely flashing an ankle, revealing nothing. The same principle,
incidentally, is being applied to Britain's spies, whose existence,
headquarters, and directors have recently been named - without making us
much the wiser.
In a rational world we would have seen the back of the Tories by now. In
reality they have nothing to fear but a Labour party led by Mr John Smith.
Voters know that Labour stands for spending. That is its attraction. Mr
Smith says that closing tax 'loopholes' would bring in Pounds 10bn to the
Treasury. This, he would have us believe, is not like the Conservatives'
additional taxation. The government can punch aside such complicated and
disingenuous notions without visible effort. When assessing the Tories'
chances of staying in office, and winning again, ask yourself this: which
party is the better liar?

Sir, I was most interested to read that Armenia had joined the Hebrides in
adopting the dram as its unit of currency ('Armenia introduces own

Does this move herald a pan-European alliance to rival the Ecu, or will it
be backed by commodities to form the Whisky Standard?

Sir, There is little doubt that more directors of failed companies deserve
to be disqualified for misconduct ('Insolvency service fails to speed up',
November 17), and it is gratifying to learn that more resources are being
devoted to achieving this objective.
In the meantime, while this backlog of outstanding cases is being cleared
up, the business community's interests would best be served if the
Insolvency Service actually published the names of directors receiving an
adverse report from company liquidators.
Moreover, since misconduct by directors is such an important contributory
cause of corporate insolvency, greater resources also need to be devoted to
enforcing company law more generally. Sample vetting of accounts submitted
to Companies House could play a key role in deterring much of the
malpractice that persists.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Coriolanus' from Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Coriolanus has always seemed to me one of the most English of
Shakespeare's plays - about a public school boy with a dominating mother -
it has a quite different tradition abroad. According to the Arden edition of
the play, 15 versions of a piece called Coriolan were written in France
between 1625 and 1821. There are at least 13 operas with the same name,
though none is based on Shakespeare. The Germans stuck more closely to the
original and have produced about a dozen adaptations, including an
unfinished piece by Bertolt Brecht.
Some productions have ended in tears. In Paris in the mid-1930s a
performance at the Comedie Francaise led to such riots in the streets that
the prime minister, Daladier, dismissed the director and replaced him with
the chief of security. In West Germany after the war Coriolanus was banned
altogether. The first postwar production did not take place until 1953.
So it comes as an anti-climax to report that there have been no riots in
Nottingham where the Quebec version of Coriolan is appearing as part of the
30th anniversary of the Playhouse. It has been carefully chosen, for it was
with a Tyrone Guthrie production of Coriolanus that the present Playhouse
opened in December 1963. In the cast then were Michael Crawford, Leo McKern,
John Neville and Ian McKellen.
Robert Lepage's production for his Theatre Repere company is a distinctive
successor and a considerable coup for Nottingham. This is the only place
where Coriolan is being staged in Britain and it runs only this week.
Lepage is the director who gave us A Midsummer Night's Dream bogged down in
a swamp at the Royal National Theatre. There are no such excesses here, but
there are innovations. Although there is very little direct use of film, the
play is produced as a movie, using cinematic techniques throughout.
The stage is dominated by a large rectangular frame. The characters appear
behind it, as if it were a transparent screen. Quite often their heads are
cut off from sight; at other times there are close-ups. Television is used
as well. News of the wars is reported live. Jacques Languirand's outstanding
Menenius appears as a genial old uniformed general giving his views on a
television talks programme. The tribunes face up to Coriolan on an
equivalent of Question Time. There are copious surtitles and the production
is quite close to the original Shakespeare text.
As a spectacle, I enjoyed it enormously, largely because it is so well done.
The last thing one would like to see would be British companies going off in
the Lepage direction and doing the same thing badly. Lepage is a master of
his techniques.
A final point is that Coriolanus really does seem a different play to
non-British. Lepage's production is much more about political instability
than a relationship between mother and son. Coleridge said that Coriolanus
demonstrates the 'wonderful philosophic impartiality of Shakespeare's
politics'. But perhaps you have to live in a quiet country to see the play
in that way.
Meanwhile, for those in London, there is another production of Coriolanus by
the Aquila company at the Place Theatre, Bloomsbury, ending on Saturday.
This version catches all the excitement, but still seems to me more about
people than politics. Whereas in Coriolan Anne-Marie Cadieux's Volumnia has
a touch of expensive continental chic, here Katharine Barker in the same
role seems much more a matron. This is the Coriolanus we know.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: Drawn to the Old Masters / Review of the Chatsworth
and Getty collections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Duke of Devonshire were to offer me one wish, the response would be
unhesitating. 'Give me Annibale Carracci's drawing of 'The Hunchback Boy'.
Out of so many lovely things in the exhibition Old Master Drawings From
Chatsworth at the British Museum, the poignancy of that drawing tugs at the
heart.
Made in Bologna circa 1610, the younger Carracci's study is an example of
the power drawings which witness particular moments in an artist's studio.
The lad sat without his shirt. With short, sparing strokes of red chalk
Annibale drew the deformed torso, the scrofulous skull showing through the
thin hair. Yet it is the combination of the draughtsman's scientific
detachment with humanity which is so wonderful. The boy turns towards us
shadowed eyes which are eloquent of misery. The enigmatic words added by
Annibale, 'I do not know if God helps me', are surely his response to
suffering.
One visit to the Print Gallery may well seem inadequate for an exhibition of
this size and quality, with 220 drawings by artists such as Ghirlandaio,
Leonardo, Raphael, Rosso Fiorentino, Pontormo, Durer, Van Dyck, Rembrandt
and Corot. So make several.
This collection is the finest of its kind in private hands, apart from the
royal collection at Windsor. Kept at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, most of
it was bought between 1690 and 1729 by the 2nd Duke. Its notoriety has come
from sales in recent years, although the collection still has some 2,000
works. The BM selection is the largest showing of Chatsworth drawings. There
is a fully illustrated catalogue, based on the complete catalogue by Michael
Jaffe now under way; volume one should be out next spring from Phaidon
Press.
Leonardo's 'Leda and the Swan' shows not the mating but the morning after.
The swan peacably nibbles his lady's ear. Squirming unpleasantly on the
ground, Leda's children hatch out of eggs: Castor, Pollux, Helen and
Clytemnestra. A sheet of small grotesque heads by Leonardo makes a happy
pair with Durer's caricature of a rubber-faced old man.
The Raphael drawings are marvellous: three studies for the 'The
Transfiguration' and a ravishing sketch of a mother reading to a child. A
sheet of chilling studies in red chalk by Andrea del Sarto reminds us that
in Renaissance Italy, artists were enlisted to make the link between crime
and punishment. After the siege of Florence in 1530, he was commissioned to
paint six executed traitors on a wall in the marketplace. These sketches
shows the contorted body of a villain suspended by his foot.
A gem of a sketch is Rembrandt's 'Actor in his Dressing-Room'. It passes
understanding that 30 years ago this could have been exhibited as St
Augustine in his study. Here to the life is a flabby old actor, his
jug-shaped body wrapped in a fur mantel, scanning his lines before he goes
on stage. Rarities are the only drawing which survives from Bruegel's stay
in Rome and Altdorfer's only design for a stained glass window: a
magnificent drawing by Veronese commemorates the forging in 1571 of the Holy
League against Suleiman the Magnificent.
For sheer inventive brilliance, nothing in the show surpasses Guercino's
'Rest on the Flight', exhibited for the first time. Guercino has used ink
wash so cleverly that the areas of white paper give the impression of
blinding sunshine. A crenellated wall runs slap across the picture. Joseph
leans on it, facing us, gazing pensively at a view we cannot see. Mary, a
vigorous young woman, distracts the attention of her baby who is perched,
rather carelessly, on the wall.
Anyone with an weakness for horses will appreciate a fine, quizzical beast
by the young Van Dyck, a study for his 'St Martin Dividing His Cloak'.
Rather harder to explain at first is the horse in Petro da Cortona's
grandiose 'Pope Urban VIII Being Carried Down the Nave of St Peter's'.
Surely they did not allow horses into St Peter's? In fact, it seems they
did, once a year when the king of Naples presented the pope with a chinea,
hacanea in Spanish, from where we derive 'hackney'.
The Royal Academy's Drawings from the J. Paul Getty Museum is the junior
exhibition but is still well worth seeing, put together in the last 10 years
and including 14 ex-Chatsworth works. With 100 drawings from the 15th to
20th centuries, it is a question of breadth rather than depth.
Cuyp's smooth drawing of a milkmaid, framed by the cow's belly, is a
particular delight. So is an unforgettable portrait by Rubens of a Korean
gentleman swathed in silk as light as air. Spare a moment, too, for a puzzle
picture, 'Two Male Nudes' by the late-16th century Haarlem Mannerist,
Cornelis van Cornelisz. If you can decipher what precisely, apart from the
prelude to sodomy, he intended to convey, you will have gone one better than
the Getty.

Drawings from the J. Paul Getty Museum, Royal Academy (071-439-7438) until

FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Polska' strikes gold - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radio 3's 'Polska' season, an intensive celebration of Polish music,
continues apace, and on Wednesday it struck gold. In the BBC's Maida Vale
studios Matthias Bamert conducted the BBC Symphony in Szymanowski,
Lutoslawski and young Hanna Kulenty. Inevitably, Szymanowski's gorgeous
First Violin Concerto made the deepest impression; but Bamert ensured that
Kulenty's raw-but-shapely Trigon and Lutoslawski's Second Symphony  -
middle-period, experimental, rather dependent upon effects that were novel
in 1967 - left their own vivid stamps.
Kulenty fixes a sharp division of labour in the small orchestra of her
Trigon. While the strings groan up and down in perpetual glissandi, as in
early Penderecki, machine-gun bursts of rapid, mechanical even-notes pass
intermittently from brass to solo piano to percussion and back again. There
is a sense of barely suppressed fury and frustration; and yet the tense
silhouette of the piece is elegant and cogent, collecting its 13 minutes
into a single clean blow.
When Lutoslawski wrote his Second Symphony, he was sure that tonality was a
dead letter. Though his latest works have made their own kind of peace with
the tonal tradition (he is 80 now), that symphony represents his most
defiant earlier distancing. Its two movements, respectively hesitant and
direct, are almost entirely 'aleatoric'. The role of the conductor is just
to signal the starts and finishes of successive sections, in which players
execute their overlapping parts in their own uncoordinated time.
Hesitant is a long string of pungent episodes, each for a handful of
instruments, separated by abrupt pauses; in 'Direct' the orchestra pulls
itself together, over a weird density of string-sound, to hammer out a
distinctly baleful purpose. Back then, Lutoslawski was so intent upon
keeping the 'symphonic tradition' at arm's-lengths that the music now seems
riskily stretched for the time it takes, Yet the broad structure is tough
enough to hold the ear.
Szymanowski's first violin concerto, composed after he escaped Bolshevik
internment during the first world war, is a kind of one-off miracle. Someone
wrote about the young Szymanowski that he 'carries the death-dream of
romanticism to the border of awakening'. Not a Pseuds' Corner quote, but
dead right: the trappings of late, ultra-decadent romanticism are raised
here to a level of crazy, intricate, nakedly rapturous fantasy, without ever
tipping over into 'post-romantic' irony. Szymanowski's score is iridescently
evocative and original, the solo role - most of it written for the top
two-and-a-half inches of the E-string - searingly heartfelt.
It is strange that this work is not yet part of every major violinist's kit.
The drawbacks are that it needs a very good, very large orchestra and a lot
of costly rehearsal time. Bamert and his admirable soloist Krzysztof
Smietana must have enjoyed that bonus, since all the multiple facets of the
soundscape were radiantly clear and balanced. Smietana played as if
two-and-a-half inches of E-string were all he had ever wanted for
full-blooded expression, beautifully secure. For hours after you hear this
siren-music singing in your head; there is really nothing much like it.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: Anthony Burgess - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If ever a writer stayed in harness until the end it was Anthony Burgess
whose death from cancer at the age of 76 was announced yesterday. His
erudite reviews were appearing right up to his demise. In April His most
recent novel, A Dead Man in Deptford, timed to coincide with the 400th
anniversary of the death of Christopher Marlowe. It was one of half-a-dozen
or so novels resurrecting a historical figure - Keats, Shakespeare, Mozart,
Joyce, Moses - that formed but a part of Burgess's vast output. He had the
knack of identifying completely with a creative genius of another age,
bringing the individual convincingly back to life. The climax was invariably
a scene of horrendous violence. The spectacle of Kit Marlowe, a homosexual,
a spy and a poet, stabbed to death in a tavern brawl, simply played into
Burgess's hands.
It was not only the past that inspired Burgess to depict violent outcomes
but also the present and the future. In his most famous work A Clockwork
Orange (1962) he showed how the new youth culture could throw up a juvenile
monster of such gratuitous cruelty as to make Graham Greene's Pinky seem
like a benign cherub. The subsequent film of 1971 offered a role-model of
glamour and winsome charm for would-be thugs; it has been banned for public
performance in many countries.
Twenty years on from the Orange Burgess gave us a novel Earthly Powers,
colossal in conception, embracing in its literary framework the supreme
moments of mass barbarism and bloodletting of 20th century history, from
Hitler's holocaust to the Reverend Jones's Guyana. The central figure
encountering all this was an 80-year-old popular novelist, a lapsed
Catholic, who had a tireless facility, a gift for parody and word-play, and
a well-tuned musical sense - all of which he shared with his creator.
Music was Burgess's great love and first ambition when he graduated from
Manchester University, after a working-class Catholic up-bringing. It was
his ability to strum away on the piano in the mess that ensured his
popularity when he joined the army during the second world war. He had
operas performed and other compositions to his credit. The relationship
between music and literature was the theme of his TS Eliot lectures
delivered at the University of Kent. James Joyce, another musician novelist
and lapsed Catholic was his particular hero.
Burgess often told the story of how he became a writer by accident. He was
recovering from what he was told was a mortal illness while working in
Malaya as part of an educational unit of the British army. He started
writing a novel as a therapy, found it terribly easy to do after composing
and from then on he never stopped producing fiction. Some critics regard his
early and more light-hearted novels, his Malayan trilogy and his Enderby
novels as among his finest, most accessible work.

What is it about beach huts that is so profoundly English? The fact,
perhaps, that you need a hut to shelter from the weather, brew the tea, and
change your clothes. Mediterranean people simply abandon the beach in bad
weather, don't drink tea, and never need to change: they put their clothes
on over their swimsuits which dry in the sun. C4's documentary series Short
Stories (8.00) looks at beach huts of Southwold, built in the 1930s by
Herbert Ladd.
The guests on Have I Got News For You (BBC2, 10.00) are Jimmy Tarbuck and
Vitali Vitaliev. But who cares about the guests? Volunteering for this show
is a bit like sticking your nose between someone's teeth and refusing to let
go. In the past few weeks Roy Hattersley, Edwina Curry and Frank Bough have
all been reduced to bemusement by the near-libellous wisecracking of the
regulars. This programme is more likely to make you laugh than any other now
on television.
Radio 3 continues with its huge 'Polska]' season. Kathryn Stott, who is
playing all the Chopin Nocturnes, can be heard at 10.25, and at 10.45
Christopher Hope considers Conrad: A Polish Writer.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: Ballet Rambert - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rambert Dance Company is embarked on a regional tour with two works new
to the repertory. I caught up with the company at the Apollo Theatre, Oxford
 -is there an auditorium with less leg-room for anyone who is not a pygmy?
On the night after I had seen London Contemporary Dance on grandest form, it
was instructive to watch the other troupe involved in the convulsion in
dance policy that currently concerns us.
It would be idle to pretend that Rambert proposes the gleaming technical
prowess which is so handsomely part of LCDT's identity. The company manner
is able, honest, but in the two works I saw, the dance was fuzzy-edged and
self-indulgent. The choreography - a new work by Mark Baldwin; a revival of
Christopher Bruce's Land - came burdened with more 'meaning' than means. The
dancing was soggy with good intentions.
Mark Baldwin's earlier choreographies told of an alert and off-beat sense of
movement. Spirit is set to the Poulenc oboe and clarinet sonatas
(excellently played), and it is sponsored by Glaxo Laboratories in the hope
of raising public awareness of the torments of migraine. Beyond the
suspicion of a nagging headache brought on by watching nine of Rambert's
dancers scamper about the stage to no clear purpose, the migraine connection
escaped me. The dance is somehow old-fashioned - it has that
heavy-with-good-intentions air I associate with apprentice chorographies in
the 1960s. The clothes are black and white and not wildly flattering.
Intermittent red and yellow curtains are the set. The Poulenc sonatas go
their lyrical or witty way, untouched by the dance. It is all ferociously
inconclusive.
Land is a fair example of Bruce's Week's Good Cause choreography. It was
made for Festival Ballet in 1985. Its score is Arne Nordheim's electronic
agonisings about Warsaw under the Nazis. Peasant outfits - no-colour
Mittel-Europa dresses; waistcoats and puttees for the chaps - and
folk-attitudes abound. Everyone has a hell of a time. Sgt. Death is on the
rampage. The cast suffer from advanced Kylianism - no day without a good
bout of dance anguish - and fall all too easily into martyred poses. It
looks like a parody of itself, and of a European cult of politically correct
movement. Impossible to care if pieces like this are well-danced: what
matters is that they are tremendously well-meant. I would swap the lot for
ten seconds from Twyla Tharp or Mark Morris.
Siobhan Davies' broad-spanning, spacious Embarque completes the programme. I
did not findthe company at the level of lean and uncompromising attainment
which it showed under Richard Alston's guidance. If the Alston-shaped
repertory was not always popular, it was as rigorous as the dancing. Yet the
plan is that the troupe is to be expanded under Christopher Bruce and also
developed along 'neo-classic' lines, while retrenchment radically alters
LCDT's function. We may draw what odd conclusions we can.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: Twilight hour - There are conflicting signals
over the future of solar energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the widespread use of solar energy has long been a dream of
ecologists and politicians, the private sector is sending out mixed signals
on the industry's future. On the positive side, Southern California Edison,
the electric utility, has just unveiled a pilot programme to offer solar
energy to rural customers. Sounding a negative note, Mobil Oil announced
this month that it was putting its solar arm up for sale.
Solar energy has always struggled with a dilemma. To bring down costs, many
more people must buy the technology. But to attract more buyers, the
industry must bring down costs. Economies of scale are the elusive key to
success.
Sceptics say the failure to resolve this dilemma has turned solar energy
into little more than a pipe dream. 'The sector is tiny and we don't expect
it to become a major player in the energy industry for the next 20 years, at
least,' says John Lord, a spokesman for Mobil Oil.
Solar energy proponents are pinning their hopes on rural customers. They
believe heightened demand for solar power in remote areas will add enough
economy-of-scale benefits to usher the sector into a new phase of high
growth. For off-grid users - homes not already served by a utility - solar
energy is already highly competitive. 'For off-grid customers, solar energy
fills an important niche,' says Alan Panton, solar sales manager for Kyocera
of Japan, the semiconductor ceramic package maker. 'It's just a matter of
getting the awareness level up.'
There are few cost-effective alternatives for rural homes. Running an
electric line through miles of wilderness to service a single user is
prohibitively expensive. In the past, rural residents relied on personal
generators for their energy needs. Recently, however, many have turned to
solar power.
Increased demand by off-grid customers has helped to build the industry into
a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year worldwide operation, according to
Strategies Unlimited, the consultancy group. Growth has been robust -
averaging an annual 20 per cent over the last few years.
Siemens, the German electronics group, British Petroleum and Kyocera all
have solar divisions and a number of start-up groups are being drawn into
the industry. 'With the large oil companies walking away from this, it
creates more space for small entrepreneurial companies like mine to step
in,' says Vijay Kapur, president of International Solar Electric Technology.
Utilities are hoping to capitalise on the surge in demand for solar energy
by acting as the middleman. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, for instance, is
considering a programme which would finance the initial cost of fitting a
home with solar energy. The utility would then charge a monthly fee for the
installation. 'By mid-1995, we should offer solar energy to off-grid users
on this basis,' says Howard Wenger, senior project manage for Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric.
Solar energy advocates believe the main increase in demand, however, will
come not from industrialised countries but from developing ones. Governments
in South America and India have expressed keen interest in using solar
energy to 'electrify' remote communities. This interest is being fuelled by
World Bank funds earmarked to promote solar power.
Proponents hope that demand from developing countries will infuse solar
energy with enormous economies-of-scale benefits. 'Can you imagine the
demand it would create if countries like China caught on to this?' says
Kenneth Zweibel, a manager at the National Renewable Energy Lab, a research
facility funded by the US Department of Energy.
Just how quickly a critical mass can be achieved is uncertain. The sector's
inability to compete effectively in the 'on-grid' market is a big drag on
growth. For homeowners hooked up to an electric utility, solar power is not
cost-effective. Solar energy per kilowatt hour, for instance, is estimated
at 2.5 to five times more expensive than electricity. 'Right now, there's no
way solar energy can compete with electricity, oil and natural gas for
on-grid customers,' says Michael Merlo, head of research, development and
demonstration at Southern California Edison.
According to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, however, there may be exceptions to
this rule. 'If demand stays stagnant, it's probably not cost-effective,'
says Wenger. 'But if demand increases to the point that you'd be looking at
a new nuclear power plant, or if you had to upgrade the lines to a certain
neighbourhood, all of a sudden it looks feasible.' Wenger says the company
is considering mixed-use areas, which would switch to solar energy at
peak-use times.
Solar energy may also get a boost from improved technology. The US
government has been providing tax subsidies for research in solar power
since the oil crisis of the 1970s. As a result, technology has improved
tremendously. Photovoltaics - the solar industry's equivalent of the
computer chip - are far more efficient in translating the sun's rays into
usable energy.
Photovoltaics are also cheaper to manufacture and install than they were a
decade ago. The solar panel manufacturer International Solar Electric
Technology, for instance, has managed to slice the silicon wafers used in
solar energy in half, thereby cutting the cost of production. The solar
energy division of Texas Instruments has reduced the cost of installation by
using lighter weight, flexible panels.
Because of these advances, solar panels are now just 5 per cent of their
1978 cost, according to John Schaeffer, president of the solar energy group
Real Goods Trading.
Despite the advances, the US government feels technological improvements
will not be sufficient to make solar energy competitive. 'Technology can
play a role in bringing down costs, but what we really need is an increase
in demand,' says James Rennalds, director of the photovoltaics division of
the US Department of Energy.
Because of imponderables such as the level of government subsidies, it is
difficult to assess whether solar energy is headed for boom or bust. It will
probably continue to stumble along for the next few years at least, in
search of the elusive critical mass that would make it a significant player
in the worldwide energy sector.

FT  26 NOV 93 / People: Shell's Pink for Enterprise Oil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil, Britain's biggest independent oil company, has underlined
its ambition to be regarded as a fully fledged oil company by recruiting
Mike Pink, 55, director of production and development at the Shell group, as
its first chief operating officer.
Pink, who has spent 30 years working mostly overseas for Shell, will join
Enterprise next May after he retires from Shell. A geologist and petroleum
engineer, Pink brings substantial technical and managerial experience to the
company at a time when it is just about to become a big North Sea production
operator.
Enterprise's early success was based on being a financial partner in oil
projects and the company is keen to be regarded in the City for its
operational skills as well. Next year it will take on the operation of the
Pounds 1.1bn Nelson field development, one of the biggest in the North Sea.
Pink knows the field well; Shell has a stake in it and was responsible for
the design and installation of the facilities.
The arrival of Pink, who will be responsible for exploration, development
and production activities and will be number two to chairman Graham Hearne,
plugs an obvious gap in Enterprise's boardroom. Peter Kingston, a former
Shell man who had been Enterprise's technical managing director, resigned in
July 1992, and finance director John Walmsley, responsible for many of
Enterprise's major deals, is leaving at the end of the year.

Ian Russell, director - financial control, at Tomkins, the conglomerate, is
to become finance director of Scottish Power. He will thus fill a vacancy
which has existed since January at the Glasgow-based company when Duncan
Whyte moved up to become chief operating officer (electricity supply) under
ceo Ian Preston.
Russell, 40, was born and educated in Scotland, and was previously with
Hongkong Bank Group in London and Hong Kong. He trained with accountants
Thomson McLintock and later worked for Pentos and Mars. He will join the
board of Scottish Power and take up his post in January.
Though Scottish Power is said to have had difficulty attracting someone of
sufficient stature for a company in the FT-SE 100 who was willing to move to
Scotland, (Tomkins is based in London) the absence of a finance director has
not been a problem. A consultant has been brought in to occupy that seat and
Whyte has been near at hand.
Changes are also taking place a few hundred yards away at the Scottish
Power's regulator, the Office of Electricity Regulation in Scotland (OFFER).
Here the youthful Graeme Sims, 30, is taking over as deputy
director-general, reporting to Stephen Littlechild, the director general of
electricity supply who is based in Birmingham.
In January, Sims will replace Peter Carter, who only took the job in January
1993, having moved from the Glasgow-based Offshore Supplies Office of the
DTI, which supports the North Sea oil industry. Carter has become
Littlechild's deputy dg in Birmingham.
Sims is currently economic adviser at OFFER in Glasgow, which he joined soon
after it was set up in 1991. Before that he worked in a small business
development agency in Glasgow and for the Boston Consulting Group in London.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: Adult titles on CD-Rom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the recent Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas, Michael Spindler,
Apple Computer's chief executive, displayed a CD-Rom-based shopping
catalogue which allows customers to change the colour of clothes on a model.
At the same time, a new breed of companies was showing off CD-Rom titles
that allow users to remove a model's clothes altogether.
These companies attracted crowds as they demonstrated adult-orientated
multimedia titles. Until now, most CD-Rom titles have been aimed at
educational markets.
'There is a lot of activity in adult-theme titles,' says Doug Millison,
editor-in-chief of Morph's Outpost, a leading publication for multimedia
developers. 'Some people are saying that they could be the 'killer
application' that drives the CD-Rom market.'
One company, New Machine Publishing, demonstrated a pre-release version of
its 'Dream Machine' title at Comdex. The Dream Machine is an interactive
adventure in which the user navigates his way through a building. Behind
various doors there are opportunities to interact with video images of
actresses and experience different fantasies.
'CD-Rom sales have taken off in the past year, and most of the buyers are
men. We predict big demand for our titles and they will drive the market
just like adult movies did for the VCR,' says Larry Miller, marketing
executive at New Machine Publishing.
However, publishers of adult CD-Rom titles are finding it difficult to find
distributors or to advertise their products. 'I'm fed up with the censorship
in this industry. We have first amendment rights in (the US) yet I
constantly have to deal with editors who pull out my ads after they've
accepted them,' says Bill Kelly, president of PC CompoNet which publishes
adult CD-Rom titles.
Kelly adds that he cannot find companies in the US to manufacture his
CD-Roms and that he has had to go to Denmark. Adult CD-Rom publishers say
they will also develop titles for women. They argue that their products
provide a safe sexual outlet, a safe 'virtual sex' experience during a time
of concern over Aids.

FT  26 NOV 93 / People: Stoddart to join BSG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The search by motor and aviation parts and distribution group BSG
International for a permanent non-executive chairman appears to be over.
Michael Stoddart, chairman of Electra Investment Trust, the development
capital group, is joining BSG as a non-executive director with a view to
taking over the chairmanship from Astley Whitall, who retired as chairman of
Ransomes earlier this year, some time before next October.
By the time Stoddart comes on board as chairman, chief executive Richard
Marton, who himself only took over his current job in May, should be
implementing the recommendations of a strategic review he set in train two
months ago.
The brief is to examine the entire structure of the group and the markets in
which it operates, and to come up with a corporate plan to be implemented
from the start of 1994.
Most of those markets have been badly hit by recession, not least the
Continental car market into which BSG supplies components, and where output
is well down.
The divisional structure has already been reorganised with the three
operating arms re-arranged along regional lines.
Marton, while reluctant to criticise directly his own long-serving
predecessor Tom Cannon, considers the review to be well overdue and the
group itself to have lacked the leadership which would have allowed it to
restructure itself to adapt to changing markets.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: Less heat in the kitchen - Worth Watching

<TEXT>
Few top-class restaurant kitchens would be complete without heat and bustle.
But the demands of the environment, as well as rising fuel bills, could mean
the heat will soon be decreased.
David Burnett Associates, of London, has devised a gadget to cut the gas
without reducing a chef's creativity. Many chefs leave the gas ring burning
after removing the saucepan. The AFR (automatic flame regulator) is a valve
which complements the manual gas control. A rod attached to the valve opens
and closes it; when the pan is removed the lever rises and the valve closes,
when the pan is replaced the valve opens and the gas flames burn again.

<TEXT>
Everyone knows if you are struck by lightning you have a better chance of
survival if you are standing on a stone floor, as it prevents electricity
passing through the body. In computer rooms or operating theatres the
problem is the opposite: how to conduct the electric force away from
expensive components.
Frankfurt-based Degussa has developed a floor coating from methacrylate
resin which is conductive - the first time such a combination has been
achieved. Because the flooring is resin-based it hardens extremely quickly
and is resistant to chemicals. The Degadur VP 070/071 system incorporates
special fillers in the resin to establish a high level of conductivity.

FT  26 NOV 93 / People: Calverley quits Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House, the troubled conglomerate which is in the midst of a
wide-ranging review of its businesses, is replacing the head of its
loss-making property business. David Calverley, 52, chairman of the group's
property division, will leave the group at the end of the year.
Calverley, who joined Trafalgar House in 1968, is the latest member of the
old guard to leave the company which was founded by Sir Nigel Broackes in
1956. A well known and popular figure in the property business, Calverley
played an important part in expanding Trafalgar's property interests under
Sir Eric Parker who stepped down as chief executive last year.
However, the company has been hard hit by the recession and will shortly
announce details of its third cash-raising exercise in two years to repair a
balance sheet which has been damaged by large property writedowns.
Hongkong Land, which has built up a stake of just under 26 per cent in the
business over the past year, has been overhauling the Trafalgar House
management team - which helps explain Calverley's departure.
Calverley was on a three-year contract but Trafalgar House says compensation
for terminating his contract would be substantially less than he would have
been paid over the next three years. His replacement is expected to come
from outside the group.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Management: Fiat's boss in waiting - Gabriele Galateri di
Genola is tipped to head Italy's biggest private-sector group / Euromanagers
to watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A publicity-shy scion of aristocrats who made their name fighting for the
former kings of Italy may not be the most obvious future boss of Fiat, one
of Europe's biggest industrial companies. The choice seems even less
appropriate for someone whose entire career has been in finance and whose
sharp looks are more those of the international investment banker than the
hard-nosed industrial manager typical of the Turin-based cars' group.
Yet in spite of his reluctance to be interviewed, let alone quoted, Gabriele
Galateri di Genola, managing director of the Fiat-dominated Ifil investment
company, is tipped to head Italy's biggest private-sector company before
long.
Any change at the top of Fiat will be part of the gradual change already
under way within the group, which has seen the controlling Agnelli family
progressively withdraw from everyday involvement and a new cadre of top-line
managers increasingly take over the reins.
'I'd take him on tomorrow if I thought he'd move,' is how one of Fiat's
leading rivals sums up his view of Galateri.
However, the chances are remote that the man who was promoted this month to
managing director of Ifi, the quoted investment company which controls Ifil,
will break ranks with the quasi-regal Agnellis who control the Fiat empire.
His loyalties are pegged to the family, notably Umberto Agnelli, Ifil's
chairman and the younger of the two Agnelli brothers who dominate its
far-flung business interests.
Together, Galateri and Umberto Agnelli have built up Ifil from a captive
Fiat company, whose main asset was Fiat shares, into an internationally
diversified holding group with activities ranging from retailing to resorts,
food to fancy goods. The strategy has worked: consolidated net profits
soared 260 per cent from L54bn (Pounds 21.8m) in 1987, just after Galateri
joined, to L193bn last year.
Galateri's loyalty to his employers may be in the blood. His Piedmontese
antecedents were among the closest supporters of the House of Savoy -
Italy's former royal family - and its Turin court.
Yet Galateri abhors the Italian tendency of identifying companies with their
controlling shareholders or managing directors. 'The star system in Italy is
something I don't personally like very much,' he says.
His management style is exactly the opposite. Press shy to the extreme, his
face hardly ever appears in the papers. Interviews are rare, while he
refuses, unlike many prominent colleagues, to be quoted on popular issues of
the day.
Discretion may be the better part of valour. Still only 46, Galateri has
swiftly and successfully climbed the Agnelli corporate ladder. After
studying law at Rome, he took an MBA at Columbia and entered the
international division of Banco di Roma. He then moved to St Gobain, where
he became finance director of the Italian subsidiary at 27 and assistant to
the group finance chief in Paris soon after.
In 1977 came the decisive move to Fiat, first as an executive in the finance
department responsible for the Americas. Six years later, he was promoted to
finance director. In 1986, he transferred to Ifil with the mandate to
rejuvenate what was largely a shell used for internal group transactions,
such as the complex mid-1980s' assets swap when cash-rich Ifil bought a
large block of Fiat shares formerly held by the Libyan government. His goals
were to diversify and internationalise. Investments had to be made in
non-cyclical businesses to complement the volatile cars side. And the heavy
dependence on Italy had to be reduced to smooth Ifil's earnings stream.
Foods, tourism and, most recently, retailing were identified as ideal
investment candidates, promising reliable, if undramatic, profits growth and
the potential for capital gains.
Product diversification went hand in hand with strategic partnerships with
foreign specialists in Ifil's chosen sectors, notably in France, to broaden
its geographic scope. Those partnerships have been underscored by equity
stakes, funded invariably through Ifil's cash flow or rights issues rather
than debt.
Saint-Louis, the French industrial group with substantial food industry
interests, has become one key partner. Ifil now holds more than 15 per cent
and has an agreement to rise to more than 30 per cent, putting it on a par
with the controlling Worms family.
Galateri's choice in tourism has also taken Ifil across the Alps. Ifil has
an agreement with France's big Accor hotels group to create a new hotel
chain in Italy.
But the most lucrative partnership so far involves BSN, the big French foods
group, in which Ifil has almost 6 per cent. Ifil has made big capital gains
by selling its domestic food operations to its bigger French partner, eager
to break into the tightly controlled Italian market, while the two companies
also have an ambitious joint venture in Asia. The strategies have worked
well. Ifil's dependence on Italy has fallen from 100 per cent in January
1987 to 51 per cent now. Over the same period, its exposure to Fiat has
fallen to 34 per cent from 67 per cent.
This month brought two further advances for Galateri: his appointment
alongside Umberto Agnelli as joint managing directorship of Ifi, confirming
his place as one of the Agnellis' most trusted lieutenants; and the
conclusion of Ifil's controversial bid to take control of La Rinascente, the
Fiat-controlled retailer.
He denies criticism that Rinascente was foisted on Ifil by Fiat's bankers to
bolster Fiat finances during a heavy investment phase. With Italian
retailing going through a belated revolution as small city-centre shops give
way to hypermarkets, Rinascente is well placed to benefit, he believes. And
considerable scope exists for synergies between Ifil's interests in
producing food and Rinascente's expertise in selling it.
For a manager in a country where business has largely steered clear of big
international alliances, it is a considerable record. But the close
association with the Agnellis also means a commitment to Turin, the home of
Fiat. 'I feel just as comfortable here as in London, Paris or New York,' he
says. 'The style of work doesn't differ in any way.'
'A manager's lifestyle here can be different. I have a very quiet working
environment and there's much less stress. Bigger cities may be more
exciting, but which is better on balance?'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Management: Why Michael Heseltine is absolutely right / A
look at Britain's myopic managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of a seminar on corporate 'performance improvement', the
manufacturing director of a well-known British engineering company took
aside the consultant who had led the proceedings. 'I'm disappointed,' he
said. 'I haven't learned much - we're doing everything you talked about.'
'Oh really?' replied the consultant. 'Yes,' said the director. 'For
instance, I bet you don't know our warranty defect rate' (the proportion of
products that fail within the first year). 'Thirty per cent?' asked the
consultant. 'How did you know?' beamed the director.
'Because that's your industry's average in this country,' the consultant
replied. 'Aren't you ashamed when the mean time between failure for TV sets
is now 12 years?' he continued. Retorting that 'TVs are simple compared with
what we make', the director stalked off.
Three years later, his company is losing market share rapidly to a
competitor which has raised its quality far above the industry average. It
is run by a team of newcomers who moved in from continental European
companies and are busy applying the skills they learned there.
The consultant in question, Mark Smalley, recounts what he calls 'this
appalling story' to reinforce this week's attack by Michael Heseltine, the
UK trade and industry secretary, on British managerial complacency.
Smalley, who directs the Midlands office of PA Consulting, and also heads
its strategy unit, has plenty of other horror stories about British
managerial self-delusion, insularity and unwillingness to learn.
For the past decade he has led groups of executives on short, fact-finding
trips to Japan. 'In spite of Japan's success, many of them start out
thinking the Japanese do things differently and therefore wrongly,' he says.
'It takes two days to turn them round.'
It is not that British managers have a monopoly on complacency: a Cranfield
Business School study of companies with less than 500 employees, which was
cited by Heseltine - but only for its UK results - suggested that the
problem was almost as bad in Spain and even worse in Italy.
But, with respect to those countries, that is no great reassurance to the
British. Their arch-rivals, Germany and France, came out of the survey far
more respectably. Though German managers and companies were seen by others
as the best in Europe, they underrated their own strengths and assessed
their weaknesses realistically - precisely the opposite characteristics from
the British. The French, though a bit over-confident, were pretty realistic
about their pluses and minuses.
On the face of it, the Cranfield findings look odd: most detached observers
 -Swedes, say, or Japanese - would rate the Germans as more arrogant than
the British and the French even more so.
Nor, one might think, would managers in large companies with considerable
international experience suffer from anything like the degree of
self-delusion as those from a bunch of smaller enterprises such as those in
the Cranfield survey.
Smalley begs to differ. His recalcitrant director worked for a large
company, as do some of the most blinkered executives on his Japanese tours.
He attributes the problem not to arrogance in the usual sense, but to a
reluctance - or inability - to learn from the discomforting experience of
others.
Both Smalley's points would seem to be borne out from a surprising quarter:
an informal club of 16 big multinationals which have spent the past decade
trying to do precisely that, through benchmarking and a range of other
practices.
Called the Inter-Company Productivity Group, the club covers a much broader
range of issues than its name suggests: quality, organisation structure,
product innovation, information technology, skills training, management
development and motivation and re-engineering. Its membership list is
impressive, including the likes of British Airways, Courtaulds and Unilever,
plus the UK operations of Nissan and top US companies such as Heinz and 3M.
Their managers are far from blind.
Yet according to John Russell, consultant to the group, incipient
complacency was evident from an opinion survey and benchmarking exercise
carried out just before the group's 10th anniversary meeting a month ago.
Most senior managers surveyed showed little knowledge of their competitors'
performance in 17 areas which the group has identified as key to success.
To the frustration of Russell and other speakers, the three-day meeting of
teams from each company was permeated by a sense of premature satisfaction
with companies' existing improvements.
If complacency, however understandable, can grip a group of such relatively
advanced companies, it is not surprising that it swamps so many lesser fry.
The most powerful antidote to managerial complacency is closeness to a
demanding set of customers - witness the impact which US electronics
companies, British food retailers and the Japanese motor assemblers have had
on their UK suppliers.
The next most forceful antidote is benchmarking. But neither remedy will
work if a company's executives are ill-trained, myopic and therefore poor
learners. Far too many British managers, young and older, still fit that
description.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Property: Foreign forays in bargain Britain - The impact of
direct overseas investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The time to sell is when a foreigner starts to buy,' is an old investment
adage that held true in the UK in the late 1980s: between 1988 and 1990, an
unprecedented wave of overseas money - some Pounds 7.5bn - poured into
Britain's commercial property.
In contrast, while capital value growth reached a peak in 1988, rising by
some 20 per cent in that year alone, by 1990 values were falling sharply as
the market reacted to rising interest rates, a deteriorating economy,
weakening demand and oversupply.
In hindsight the burst of foreign investment activity was both poorly timed
and too focused on central London offices. If overseas investment in UK
property had ceased at the end of 1990, observers would have rightly
described the foray as a passing fad that rose and fell with the boom and
bust of the late 1980s. However, the recent renewal of foreign activity is a
positive dev-elopment, suggesting interest in UK property is likely to be
sustained.
In the last property cycle in the late 1980s, overseas investors followed
the market up to its peak and beyond; since last year they have been setting
the pace in exploiting opportunities in the low point of the cycle - with
property prices at historically high yields and the economy recovering.
As a result, the old investment adage now has a hollow ring; no doubt many
UK investors wish they too had spotted the opportunities at the low point in
1992 and begun buying as quickly as, for example, the Germans.
Although some way off the peak levels of 1988-90, foreign direct investment
in UK property this year looks set to total Pounds 2bn-Pounds 2.25bn. This
activity has been spurred by several factors, notably sterling's exit from
the exchange rate mechanism last September which has made UK assets
relatively cheap; lower interest rates; and an improving economy.
Collectively, these factors justify industry expectations of continuing
strong inflows of foreign investment at least until the end of 1994.
Another underlying attraction has been the UK's landlord and tenant system
with its long leases, rent reviews and tenant responsibilities for repair
and insurance.
At a broader level institutional investors look to cross-border
diversification as a means of achieving a more balanced portfolio and a
spread of risk. The continuing process of deregulation of cross-border
capital transfers in Europe makes a globally-spread portfolio more
attainable. However, the inability of most European property markets to
provide objective performance measures is a constraint on potential foreign
investors. The UK's established market and reputation for high-quality
measures of performance help ensure it receives at least its fair share of
international flows of investment.
The greater overseas investment in the UK in the past year has been
generated from a large number of countries. Between 1988 and 1990, overseas
investment was dominated by Japanese and Swedish investors; in 1992 the
Germans were dominant, accounting for about 60 per cent of the total. This
year German investors have been responsible for about a third of the Pounds
1.6bn total invested in the UK with other European sources accounting for 25
per cent, the Middle East 17 per cent and the Far East 15 per cent.
The broadening of the overseas investor base is an important change. It
potentially heralds a future pattern of activity less volatile than has been
the case with one or two countries dominating the target country.
Cross-border investment is inevitably mercurial as it reflects a mix of
forces at work in the source market as well as in the target market. As a
result, there is a greater prospect that the more diverse mix of overseas
investors will reduce the likelihood of sharp rises and falls in investment.
In addition to the enlarged investor base there has been a marked expansion
in locations identified for investments. A narrow focus on central London
still predominates but over the past couple of years a quarter of purchases
by overseas investors has been in the regional property markets.
This reflects several influences: reduced availability of suitable property
in London; an increasing understanding of the UK provincial markets; and a
belief that performance will be strong in certain sectors or regions. This
broader approach to location is likely to continue.
Investment from overseas can now be considered a permanent and important
part of the UK commercial property market. Over the past five years foreign
investors have accounted for at least 15 per cent of all annual
transactions. Yet their impact has been much greater than the figure
suggests, given the particular concentration of foreign money in central
London.
In the immediate future, although flows of overseas money for direct
property purchases should continue to exceed Pounds 2bn a year, the greater
geographical spread of investments across the UK will diffuse the impact.
Where the effect may continue to be strongly felt will be in the market for
properties in excess of Pounds 50m. In this category, the capacity of
certain overseas investors to compete for the most valuable lots should
continue to bring an additional element of competition to an, at times,
illiquid part of the market.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Property: Index hits record high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The total return on the Investment Property Databank all-property index in
October was 1.7 per cent, taking the index as a whole to 181.76, a record.
(The previous peak of 179.70 was reached in January 1990, at the end of the
1980s boom.) The total return for the first 10 months of the year is now 9.2
per cent.
Rental value growth was negative in October, but capital growth has been
positive in each of the past five months, reaching 0.9 per cent last month.
The all-property aggregate equivalent yield fell 0.1 percentage points to
9.5 per cent, its lowest level since February 1991.
Office and industrial sectors were the performance leaders, each posting a
total return of 1.7 per cent; retail reported a total return of 1.6 per
cent. For the year to October, total return on retail property reached 10.4
per cent, with industrial property at 9.8 per cent and office property at
7.3 per cent.
IPD says: 'Market circumstances are unprecedented. With the downward trend
in rental values now stretching to within a month of three years and yields
half a point below their peak, the index of total returns manages to reach a
record high off its biggest monthly movement in five years: a boom and
recession at the same time?'

FT  26 NOV 93 / PFO lays to rest theory of attack on Pearl Harbour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The documents available at the Public Records Office today appear to lay to
rest the notion that Winston Churchill knew in advance about the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbour, which brought the US into the second world war.
The Public Records Office said: 'None of the intercepts obviously indicate
the British sources were aware in advance of the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbour, although it was clear that Japan was about to enter the war.'
A recently published book, Betrayal at Pearl Harbour, by James Rusbridger
and Eric Nave, says British codebreakers intercepted Japanese signals
alerting them to an imminent attack on the main US naval base in Hawaii. The
authors intimate Churchill did not want to inform the US of this because he
wanted to ensure it joined the war.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Patten backs more sixth forms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday signalled a significant
shift in funding for post-16 education in England and Wales by announcing
plans to allow more schools to open sixth forms.
Over the past few decades the trend has been to create separate sixth form
colleges, and these now account for more than half of all full-time students
in England between the ages of 16 and 18.
He told the Girls' Schools Association, which represents independent
schools, that more than 100 schools for pupils from the ages of 11 to 16 had
applied to open sixth forms.
He said there would always be students who prefered to continue sixth form
studies in a school setting, with which they were familiar and which might
be much closer to home.
'A school with a thriving sixth form, underpinned by specialist staffing,
may be more able to offer attractive sub-specialisms to the younger pupils,
for example in technology or modern languages.'
A framework for deciding whether schools could open a sixth form would be
published soon.
Mr Patten received a hostile reception from headmistresses on the issue of
league tables of school performance. He said their publication was 'one of
the most important post-war innovations in levering up standards'.
But Miss Joan Jefferson, the association's president, said the way the
league tables were compiled was 'nonsense'. She said that if candidates took
exams a year early and then moved school, the new school was credited with
their results.
Delegates also attacked Mr Patten's decision to introduce an A-starred grade
at A-level.
One headmistress told Mr Patten to loud and prolonged applause that the new
grade would be 'totally counter-productive' and would deter girls from
broadening the range of subjects they took at A-Level.

FT  26 NOV 93 / MPs urge tougher NHS controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stronger systems of management control and accountability in the National
Health Service were demanded by the Commons public accounts committee
yesterday to avoid any recurrence of 'grave shortcomings' uncovered in the
West Midlands region.
The committee says in a report that at least Pounds 10m was wasted in the
management of the West Midlands health authority's regionally-managed
services organisation.
The report says the essence of this mismanagement was that 'the responsible
official, new to the NHS, was able to follow his own path, making a bonfire
of the rules in the process, uncontrolled either by the regional health
authority or regional senior management'.
It says failings occurred at all levels of management. There was a serious
failure by members of the health authority, and in particular by Sir James
Ackers, then chairman, in their duty to secure the accountability of their
regional management.
The committee says the NHS management executive should have been aware of
problems in the West Midlands region much earlier. Although the executive
has taken subsequent action to tighten procedures, the committee says the
present division of responsibilities between the executive and health
authorities leaves 'too much scope for negotiation and argument'. It calls
for clearer lines of control and accountability.
The report says it is essential that non-executive authority members should
be of sufficient calibre and experience to bring independent judgment to
important decisions, while standards of 'honesty, openness and fair dealing'
should play a large part in the selection, training and assessment of staff.
West Midlands' regionally- managed services organisation was set up to
handle a range of activities including supplies, computing, blood
transfusion and ambulance services.
The committee says the engagement of United Research Group, a consultancy,
to advise on supplies activities 'fell well short of the standards expected
from public officials' in several respects. It says it was 'astonished' that
Mr Chris Watney, director of regionally-managed services, had been left to
pursue an objective of privatising the supplies branch without the knowledge
of the authority - which had no policy for such privatisation - or the NHS
management executive.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, welcomed the report and said an
enormous amount had already been done to address the issues it raised. Mr
David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said it presented an 'astounding
catalogue of corruption and incompetence'.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Outlook better for machine tool sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's machine-tool industry faces another nine to 12 months of difficult
trading conditions, but its long-term prospects are encouraging because the
increased competitiveness of UK manufacturing.
This is the conclusion of the annual industry forecast by Oxford Economic
Forecasting for the Machine Tool Technologies Association.
Machine tools have been one of the worst-hit industrial sectors in the
recession - production dropped from Pounds 941m in 1990 to Pounds 624m last
year and is predicted to rise only marginally this year to Pounds 632m.
Mr John Walker, the forecasting organisation's managing director, said the
recovery in sales which he had predicted would start this autumn was now
likely to be delayed, mainly because of the weakness of continental European
markets.
Over the next nine to 12 months the Continental recession would limit export
demand, he said. And the UK market would be weak because the growing
industries - chemicals, electrical engineering and metals - did not buy many
machine tools.
In contrast, recovery was weak in the main machine-tool purchasing sectors -
aerospace, automotive and general mechanical engineering - and investment
increases were likely to be delayed 'for a little while at least'.
Mr Walker predicted, however, that machine tool production would rise to
Pounds 758m in 1995 and Pounds 852m in 1996.
Industry's increased competitiveness, based on relatively low wage costs and
high productivity growth, would also be reflected in better predicted growth
rates for UK machine-tool output than for imports.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Economists decline to join chorus on prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jury is still out on whether excessively high margins are becoming
firmly established or posing a threat to the UK economy.
Export price inflation peaked in March at about 13 per cent and prices have
since fallen slightly. Similar trends are visible in the UK retail sector.
Many economists view the jump in margins as a normal and necessary part of
the post-recession business cycle and say industry is now right to rebuild
its profitability.
Mr Walter Eltis, the chief economic adviser to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, recently said that British industry still had to
increase its profitability to the level of its most successful rivals
abroad. While profitability in the UK chemical industry stands comparison
with international competitors, this is not the case in textiles or parts of
engineering.
Mr Peter Warburton, chief UK economist with Robert Fleming Securities, has
calculated that about a third of UK companies recorded a pre-tax loss last
year. Only a small minority of UK companies have strong profits and these
are generally large. 'We can expect to see profitability going through the
roof for a year or so. But that will be fully justified,' he said.
Mr Leo Doyle, a UK economist with Kleinwort Benson Securities, believes
Britain could follow the experience in the US, where companies raised
margins significantly in the early phase of the recovery before increasing
employment and investment.
The Confederation of British Industry and other business lobbies cite
statistics of their own to prove that industry's prices are not fuelling
inflationary pressures. In the autumn the CBI's monthly industrial trends
surveys showed a small majority of manufacturers expecting to reduce prices
in the months ahead.
Yesterday's CBI poll, however, showed that on balance 5 per cent more
companies expect to raise prices rather than cut them in the next four
months. But the picture was mixed, with plans to raise prices concentrated
among big companies.
The capital goods industry in general and the electrical and instrument
engineering sector in particular expect prices to fall.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's head of forecasting, said that output prices
had been rising by about 3 per cent a year rather than the 4 per cent shown
in official statistics, which did not take discounting into effect.
Nor is the CBI perturbed by a recent steady rise in 'underlying' output
prices. These, according to Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI director of economics,
tend to lag the full output price figures by two or three months.
Both the Bank governor and the chancellor appear to have been firing shots
across the bows of businesses to ensure that they do not become addicted to
high margins. Significantly, however, Mr George coupled his misgivings with
a veiled threat that the Bank would raise interest rates if companies
boosted prices and margins over a period of time.

Manufacturers in the West Midlands fear growing pressure for higher wages
will damage export competitiveness and the chance of a quick recovery by the
economy.
At a meeting in Birmingham of the regional council of the Confederation of
British Industry, exporting companies reported increasing difficulties in
retaining customers in depressed European markets, particularly Germany.
Mr Bryan Townsend, the chairman of the regional CBI and chairman of Midlands
Electricity, said there were no reports of industrial disruption but 'there
is pressure on wages we have not seen in recent times'.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Savings on trade marks forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals to reform trade-mark law should save British industry
Pounds 60m in the first year of implementation and Pounds 30m a year
subsequently, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and industry minister, said
yesterday, Robert Rice writes.
He said the trade marks bill, published yesterday, would make it simpler and
cheaper for businesses to protect their trade marks overseas and bring UK
law into line with the rest of Europe.
Half the savings in the first year would come from the UK's ratification of
the Madrid Protocol on the international registration of marks.
The remainder of the savings would come from the streamlining and
de-regulation of procedures, and from making it easier for businesses to
protect marks without having to bring expensive passing-off actions.
There are also measures to tighten up the law on counterfeiting by closing a
loophole exposed in a recent ruling in which the Law Lords said there could
be no breach of intellectual property rights when a trader admitted that the
goods were fakes.

FT  26 NOV 93 / DTI man 'forgot' Iraq reminder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior civil servant forgot to inform a minister that engineering company
Matrix Churchill had supplied Iraq with machine tools that were used in the
manufacture of missiles, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Eric Beston, the Department of Trade and Industry official formerly
responsible for export licensing, said he had been told about the project
through a secret Whitehall committee investigating Iraqi arms procurement
but had forgotten about it over the summer holidays.
This intelligence indicated that Matrix Churchill's lathes had been turned
to military use at an Iraqi factory.
Mr Beston did not mention this in a letter in September 1989 to Lord
Trefgarne, the trade minister, before the minister's meeting with Mr Paul
Henderson, the company's managing director, to decide whether four export
licences worth Pounds 6m should be granted.
In his letter to Lord Trefgarne Mr Beston said that the Foreign Office's
case for refusing the licences was neither as 'strong nor as clear cut' as
it suggested. He said the licences were for 'general purpose industrial
equipment' of a type UK companies had previously supplied to Iraq.
He bases his case on the fact that the guidelines covering exports to Iraq
had been relaxed - although not openly - after the Iran-Iraq ceasefire in
the summer of 1988. Mr Beston agreed with Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, Lord
Justice Scott's counsel, that the main purpose of the relaxation was to
allow through dual-use goods.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Exporters resent calls to pass on devaluation: Eddie George
and Kenneth Clarke think margins in manufacturing are too high. But, as some
industrialists find their remarks a bad joke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past month, first Mr Eddie George and then Mr Kenneth Clarke have
voiced concerns that British industry may be boosting prices and profit
margins instead of sales volumes and employment.
Mr George, governor of the Bank of England, was alarmed that more than half
of recent increases in manufacturers' output prices in the UK came from
higher margins while Mr Clarke, the chancellor, focused more on the sharp
rise in export prices following last year's devaluation of sterling.
However, for some of Britain's more beleaguered manufacturers, the patriotic
exhortations of the chancellor and the governor to cut prices and increase
exports are simply irritating.
The governor's remarks, says Mr Robert Napier, chief executive of the
building materials group Redland, were 'extremely unsympathetic to the
plight of the construction industry'.
In some sectors the pleas of the chancellor and governor must seem like a
bad joke.
Pilkington, one of Europe's biggest glass manufacturers, took a decision at
the time of devaluation last September to hold its European prices in local
currency terms.
But, says Pilkington's finance director Mr Andrew Robb, the combination of
European recession and ferocious competition means that prices in those
markets have kept on falling. As a result, he says, 'the sterling price
we're getting now is lower than we got before devaluation'.
For building materials companies such as Redland, the irritation is doubly
justified. In the late 1980s government ministers exhorted the sector to
invest in new capacity, since the building boom was sucking in imports of
bricks and other materials. And indeed, the industry invested - by one
estimate - some Pounds 200m from 1985. The ensuing decline in the building
industry guaranteed that the money was largely wasted.
Even for companies willing in principle to cut their export prices, there
may be practical difficulties. An extreme case is Rover, which was working
hard on building up its European exports long before devaluation.
Nevertheless, according to Mr Graham Morris, managing director of Rover
Europe, the price of standard Rover models in continental Europe has stayed
broadly unchanged in spite of devaluation.
First, Mr Morris said, Rover had taken out long-range foreign exchange
contracts to hedge it against currency turbulence. 'We have significant
foreign exchange cover in most markets to the end of 1994, and in some cases
into 1995. Thereafter, we have a significant opportunity for higher profits
or market share, but not until then.'
Second, he pointed out, the EU was imposing a system of price harmonisation
for cars across the community. 'This means we are under increasing pressure
to defy the laws of supply and demand and keep prices across Europe within a
12 per cent band,' he said.
Third, Rover was a small niche player in European markets, and had
positioned itself as an up-market and relatively expensive brand. 'We cannot
rush for volume on the back of short-term price cuts,' Mr Morris said.
'Apart from anything else, that would harm existing Rover owners through a
fall in residual values.'
Nevertheless, he said, devaluation had offered some opportunities. In one or
two areas, such as down-market diesel models of existing lines, there had
not been a market in Europe. But devaluation meant Rover could enter the
market on a cut-price basis for the first time. Since this was new business,
not previously budgeted for, it was not covered by foreign exchange
contracts.
In other markets, too, Rover has been less hesitant. In February of this
year it launched a marketing campaign in Japan, based on the slogan of 'fair
play'. This explained to Japanese consumers that, because Britain had
devalued, it was in a position to pass part of the benefits on to its
customers. 'This will help our volumes and help you,' the advertisements
said.
On average, the price of Rover cars in Japan was cut by 13 per cent. As a
result unit sales - admittedly from a low base - are up 24 per cent in the
year to date compared with a total rise for imported cars of just 8 per
cent.
The chancellor and governor can take further comfort from one of Britain's
best-known companies, Imperial Chemical Industries. According to Mr Alan
Spall, ICI's general manager for finance, ICI took a decision at the time of
devaluation to split the benefits between higher margins and higher exports
'Following devaluation, we did a significant amount of work on how to
increase our market share. The decision we arrived at was that we should use
the benefits of devaluation to minimise the free fall in volume that was
going on in the European market.'
Mr Spall declined to specify just how much of the gains of devaluation were
handed out in this way. But the amount, he said, was 'significant'. As a
result, he said, ICI's volume sales of bulk chemicals into continental
Europe in the first nine months of the year were up while the market as a
whole was substantially down.
On the whole, though, companies such as ICI seem to be in a minority. Mr
Richard Kersley, strategy analyst at the London brokers BZW, has calculated
that export prices for British manufacturers were up 10 per cent in this
year's third quarter compared to the year before. Of that, he reckoned, 8.8
percentage points could be attributed to higher margins.
Mr Kersley added: 'Taken all round, UK companies have protected their
profitability far more successfully in this recession than they managed to
in the last.' Appeals to patriotism, it seems, are falling on deaf ears.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Hitler believed invasion would be unnecessary: Second world
war files released
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adolf Hitler believed late in 1941 that Britain suffered such severe
internal divisions that it could be defeated without an invasion, according
to previously unpublished documents from the Public Record Office.
The material, released as part of the open government initiative led by Mr
William Waldegrave, the public service minister, involves 1,273 files which
additionally appear to confirm that as early as 1942 the British government
knew about deaths in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
The documents itemise a report from the Japanese ambassador in Berlin on
German war plans as told to him by Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler's foreign
minister, and give insights into novel code-breaking initiatives in Britain
which reveal that the Fuhrer believed that conditions in Britain were bad
and thought that as a result of Germany's future operations Britain might be
beaten without an invasion.
He cited the split in the Conservative party, the lack of confidence in
Winston Churchill, and the revolutionary ideas of the Labour party as making
internal conditions quite difficult.
Hitler's ambitious plans for world domination in 1941 are set out in the
files with details of an intended German attack on Crete in March 1941. The
report also says Churchill received disturbing reports on deaths in German
prison camps in August 1942, which revealed that 6,829 men and 1,525 women
had died at Auschwitz. One report said: 'It appears that although typhus is
still rife at Auschwitz, new arrivals continue to come in.'
The class of records published contains actual intelligence documents, with
their cover notes, passed to Churchill, or in his absence to the Lord Privy
Seal or deputy prime minister, complete with annotations and minuting.
Information was passed to the prime minister by the Government Code and
Cypher School, established in 1919 to study the methods of cypher
communications used by foreign powers.
The documents are available at the Public Record Office in Kew, London, from
today.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Unions 'will use the law'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will face legal challenges from unions next year if it tries
to exclude British workers from the benefits of European Union social
affairs directives, says Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB
general union.
He argues in a prediction of the future of organised labour published in The
Economist's World in 1994 that unions 'are learning to use a tool that has
long been used against them: the law'. Mr Edmonds says the government will
next year have to negotiate with the unions over 'its policy of cutting the
pay and conditions of public-sector workers through the contracting-out of
services or be sued for millions in compensation claims'.
Unions will 'build on the best European practice to increase prosperity and
raise standards at work', Mr Edmonds says. He predicts 'a new central role
in formulating European Union law through the social protocol with its
backing for negotiated European-wide framework agreements between employers
and unions.' This is an opportunity for unions and employers 'to improve
life at work'.
He points in particular to the proposed EU directive on European works
councils for large transnational companies.
He says UK unions will be 'fully involved in the process, and once European
works councils are set up, trade unionists across Europe will insist that
British employees are represented'.

FT  26 NOV 93 / DVLA censured for licence 'errors'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of professional drivers lost their licences or had applications
refused because of 'serious errors' by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency, says a report yesterday from Mr William Reid, the parliamentary
ombudsman.
One lorry driver lost a job he had held for 20 years because his licence was
unjustly revoked. The driver - who had his licence returned, but could not
get his job back or find a new one - is to be compensated. The DVLA has
agreed that a further 230 drivers can submit compensation claims.
The report said the DVLA had made serious errors in preparing and
interpreting eyesight regulations.

FT  26 NOV 93 / West Midlands wage rise fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers in the West Midlands fear growing pressure for higher wages
will damage export competitiveness and the chance of a quick recovery by the
economy.
At a meeting in Birmingham of the regional council of the Confederation of
British Industry, exporting companies reported increasing difficulties in
retaining customers in depressed European markets, particularly Germany.
Mr Bryan Townsend, the chairman of the regional CBI and chairman of Midlands
Electricity, said there were no reports of industrial disruption but 'there
is pressure on wages we have not seen in recent times'.
Concern about European export markets has heightened in view of the slow UK
economic recovery. West Midlands executives dismissed the latest interest
rate cut of 0.5 of a percentage point as not enough to offset any tax
pressures in next week's Budget, said Mr Townsend.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Savings on trade marks forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals to reform trade mark law should save British industry
Pounds 60m in the first year of implementation and Pounds 30m a year
subsequently, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and industry minister, said
yesterday, Robert Rice writes.
He said the Trade Marks Bill, published yesterday, would make it simpler and
cheaper for businesses to protect their trade marks overseas and bring UK
law into line with the rest of Europe.
Half the savings in the first year would come from the UK's ratification of
the Madrid Protocol on the international registration of marks.
This would enable businesses to use a single application to register their
trade marks in all the countries which are party to the Madrid agreement.
The remainder of the savings would come from the streamlining and
de-regulation of procedures, and from making it easier for businesses to
protect marks without having to bring passing-off actions.
The bill would replace the outdated tests for distinctiveness. In future
registration would depend on whether a trade mark was distinctive in the
market place. It would be possible to register three-dimensional shapes and
geographic words as long as they were distinctive.
There are also measures to tighten up the law on counterfeiting by closing a
loophole exposed in a recent ruling in which the Law Lords said there could
be no breach of intellectual property rights when a trader admitted that the
goods were fakes.
The bill creates an offence of fraudulent use of a trade mark, punishable by
an unlimited fine or up to 10 years in prison, or both.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Case against Polly directors dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge has dismissed on lack of evidence attempts to bring
disqualification proceedings against four directors of Polly Peck
International, the collapsed conglomerate.
In transcripts of a hearing earlier this month Mr Justice Lindsay calls the
case made against the directors 'at best speculative and very weak'.
His ruling covers Mr David Fawcus, Polly Peck's finance director; Mr Mark
Ellis, joint managing director in 1983-87; and Mr Lawrence Tindale and Mr
Ulf Siebel, two non-executive directors.
The judgment will prove an embarrassment to the Department of Trade and
Industry, which was last month criticised in a National Audit Office report
on the whole process of directors' disqualifications, including their
administration.
It appears to focus responsibility for alleged misconduct among directors
solely on fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir, the former chair-man of Polly
Peck, who faces charges totalling Pounds 34m for theft and false accounting.
The DTI was requesting more time to bring disqualification proceedings
beyond the normal statutory limit of two years after the insolvency of the
company.
But the judge said there had been delays in preparing the case that were
'unreasonable', and there was 'no good reason' for the extensions. He added
that further delays would prejudice the directors under scrutiny.
The DTI's case was based on statutory reports submitted on each of the
directors made by Mr Christopher Morris, a partner with accountants Touche
Ross and one of the joint administrators of Polly Peck. Most of the reports
are believed to have been in general terms without specific evidence to
justify disqualification. One referring to Mr Nadir was highly critical.
The transcript shows the case was based on four charges related to
inadequate financial controls, and failure to monitor or question spending
in Polly Peck's Near East subsidiaries.
The DTI's case - based on the 'D forms' or statutory returns on all the
directors from the administrators to Polly Peck - was based on four general
grounds:
Failure to institute adequate controls over the expenditure and transfer of
monies from PPI.
Failure to ensure that adequate financial controls and reporting procedures
were implemented and adhered to in respect of the Near East subsidiaries.
Failure to obtain appropriate responses to the question of the need of the
Near East subsidiaries for such substantial funding from PPI.
Failure to monitor, or to set up proper procedures for monitoring, the
actual expenditure incurred by the Near East subsidiaries; the funds which
had been provided to the Near East subsidiaries; and the ability of the Near
East subsidiaries to repay their indebtedness to PPI as and when required or
at all.
The DTI argued that the directors failed to threaten to resign if omissions
and lack of knowledge and control were not rectified.
But Mr Justice Lindsay called the charges 'misconceived' and said the
resignations of the directors might have done little to remedy the problems
of the company.
He was also critical of some unreasonable delays and the 'leisurely pace'
between the commencement of the Polly Peck administration on October 25 1990
and the presentation by the DTI of its disqualification case to the courts
in June last year.
The DTI has only a few days left for an appeal. 'We are actively seeking
legal advice on whether to appeal,' it said.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Central Line users face more delays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commuters who use London Underground's Central Line are being warned that
full services will not be resumed until this afternoon at the earliest - and
part of the line may remain closed all weekend.
After a power fault stranded thousands of people in Wednesday's rush-hours,
London Underground suspended the service east of Liverpool Street Station.
The line stayed closed yesterday.
A fleet of 80 buses will continue to serve eight routes this morning, taking
commuters from the eastern ends of the Central Line to the Victoria Line at
Walthamstow, the District Line at Barking, or to British Rail at Stratford.
London Underground said the Central Line east of Liverpool Street might not
be working again until Monday.
The misery began at 7am on Wednesday when a power failure brought the
Underground to a virtual standstill. For up to three hours 20,000 passengers
were trapped on trains, and hundreds had to be led through tunnels to
safety.
London Underground said last night that engineers were inspecting 26 miles
of cabling in an attempt to locate the fault. Once found and repaired, empty
trains would be run along the track to prove the power supply was back.
One of the problems was the intermittent nature of the fault, said an
official, who added: 'We must be sure we have rectified this problem once
and for all.'
Mr Jim Stevenson, chairman of the TUC's south-east region transport
committee, blamed the power failure on government investment cuts.
Mr Alan Norman, the TUC official responsible for London Underground workers,
said: 'The future of London's public transport can clearly no longer be left
to mandarins or ministers who travel around London in chauffeur-driven cars.
Investment must be reinstated at once if we are to prevent a major
disaster.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Energy minister attacks Nuclear Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday expressed deep doubts about the
prospect of an early privatisation for the nuclear industry and strongly
rebuked Nuclear Electric, the generator, for pushing hard for a move to the
private sector.
He said the industry needed to prove it could survive without the support of
the nuclear levy, not due to expire until 1998.
He added it was for ministers to decide whether the industry should be
privatised, and not for the companies, and this decision would be taken by
the government 'when it is appropriate to do so and not before'.
He warned the industry it had to be realistic both about the desire of
government to offer financial support and about the 'difficult issues' it
would be raising in the forthcoming nuclear review.
His comments, in a speech to trade unionists, represent one of the strongest
public attacks by a minister on a state-owned company. They follow Nuclear
Electric's decision earlier in the year to stage a campaign for
privatisation ahead of the nuclear review that the government has promised
to launch this year.
Nuclear Electric, which runs 12 power stations, also angered the Department
of Trade and Industry in October by applying for planning permission to
build its proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk before the outcome of
the review.
But Mr Eggar provided some comfort for Nuclear Electric by saying the
long-term future of the industry must be in the private sector. 'I do not
think the question is whether, but how and when it gets there.'
He said government had not yet reached a firm view on the way forward and it
would be inappropriate to announce yesterday the terms of reference for the
nuclear review.
Mr Eggar said the nuclear industry in England and Wales was often described
by critics as overpriced and uncompetitive. The best way to deal with this
was to become profitable without the nuclear levy.
He said: 'The industry needs to be able to prove to the world that nuclear
energy needs no such support in the future. It cannot be assumed that the
government will provide the finance for new capacity in the future. In the
context of an extremely tough spending round, why should the taxpayer be
willing to fund new nuclear stations costing several billions, when this
money could fund hospitals, schools or policemen on the beat?'
Mr Eggar added: 'I can understand the desire of management to be part of a
privatised business. But it is not good enough just to have aspirations.
Management have a duty to staff and the industry to consider thoroughly what
the issues really are. The industry needs to be realistic about the
difficult issues which it will be raising for public debate. It needs to be
realistic about the ability or desire of the government to offer financial
support.'
Also yesterday, Mr James Hann, chairman of the other UK nuclear generator,
Scottish Nuclear, which is much less enthusiastic about going private, said
the review should not just focus on the commercial viability of
privatisation.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Sunday Times admits error on travel promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sunday Times has withdrawn a letter to tour operators that appeared to
suggest that they could buy editorial space in the paper.
The letter was sent to operators earlier this month by The Travel Bureau, a
Lancashire-based travel agent, under the Sunday Times letterhead.
The Travel Bureau operates the Sunday Times Travel Card scheme - which
allows members 10 per cent discounts on holidays - for the Sunday Times.
The letter promised tour operators 'editorial in Style &amp; Travel' - a section
of the paper - if they paid a marketing charge of Pounds 20,000, or Pounds
25,000 for colour.
Last night Mr Andrew Neil, the Sunday Times editor, said the letter had been
sent by Mr John Wall, a director of The Travel Bureau, without checking with
him or with Mr Paul Woolfenden, the Sunday Times director of promotions.
Mr Neil said: 'You cannot buy editorial in The Sunday Times. You never have
and you never will be able to while I am editor.'
Mr Woolfenden confirmed last night that the letter had not been cleared with
him. He said it was a mistake and a new letter was being sent out.
Mr Woolfenden said the writer of the letter had been reprimanded. He
conceded that the wording could have been misconstrued.
He said the 'editorial' referred to was in fact paid advertising associated
with the Travel Card promotion.
Mr Wall confirmed last night that the mistake had been his and was a result
of his lack of experience of newspaper terminology. The Travel Bureau is a
member of the Association of British Travel Agents and will only offer
holidays from Abta operators.
The Sunday Times letter attracted protests from the Association of
Independent Tour Operators, which represents 140 small companies.
In a letter to Mr Neil last week the association said: 'It seems to us that
if the proposed promotional plan was made public, it would cause
considerable embarrassment to the Sunday Times since it is quite clear that
substantial financial contributions are linked directly with editorial
coverage.'
The association added that the promotion would damage the business of its
members, many of which advertise in the Sunday Times. It said many could not
afford fees of Pounds 20,000 or Pounds 25,000 to participate in the
promotion.
Their letter to Mr Neil said: 'Unless you can offer our members some action
to redress the balance and recompense them for the losses your newspaper
will doubtless cause them, we will have no option but to urge our members to
withdraw their advertising from the Sunday Times forthwith.'
Mr Neil said he would look into the complaint that The Sunday Times was
'actively working against its advertisers', but said he had no intention of
allowing his promotions policy to be dictated by advertisers.
He said: 'If it really is unfair competition, I will consider the issue.
'If it is a trade association bleating because they face extra competition,
then to hell with it.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Portuguese airline sues BAe for Dollars 70m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace was yesterday sued for more than Dollars 70m (Pounds 47m)
by a Portuguese regional airline for alleged breach of contract and
recurrent defects in three BAe advanced turboprop aircraft it operated
between 1988 and 1992.
EuroAir, formerly a regional subsidiary of the Portuguese state-owned
airline TAP, issued the writ in the Commercial Court saying that it had been
persuaded to acquire the aircraft by the 'negligent misrepresentations of
BAe'.
It says that from the time it started operating the aircraft on the Oporto
to Lisbon route it experienced 'recurrent technical breakdown due to faults
in the aircraft designed and manufactured by BAe'.
It says that the three aircraft 'were not of merchantable quality or fit for
use by a commercial operator on short-haul Portuguese domestic routes'.
EuroAir is claiming 'in excess of Dollars 70m' damages from BAe and CIBC
Finance Plc, the lease financiers of the aircraft, for being in breach of
the implied terms of the leases.
The airline is now in administration but is still operating two German built
Dornier aircraft.
It says that due to the defects it was frequently forced to cancel flights.
The court documents show that CIBC Finance, part of the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, repossessed the three aircraft at the beginning of this
year and claims EuroAir owes it Dollars 37.9m.
But the airline disputes this indebtedness and claims credit for the value
of the three aircraft upon repossession of about Dollars 39.3m.
EuroAir says it lost Dollars 11.1m in the period it operated the aircraft,
and is claiming an additional Dollars 66m for the effect on future trading
profits of early termination of the leases.
BAe declined to comment on the writ except to say that 50 advanced
turboprops were in service with airlines in the UK and overseas and were
'operating successfully'.
BAe is seeking an international joint venture partnership for its Jetstream
and advanced turboprop activities at Prestwick as part of its commercial
aircraft recovery strategy.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Budgen first in member's bill draw
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas Budgen, the rightwing Conservative Euro-sceptic, yesterday
topped the ballot for private member's bills.
This means that Mr Budgen, the MP for Wolverhampton South-West, has prime
parliamentary time to introduce legislation of his choice during this
session.
The second name in the ballot was Mr Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) the
Liberal Democrat treasury spokes-man.
Neither said what subjects their bills would cover.
Third came Mr Kevin Barron (Rother Valley), a Labour employment spokesman.
The ballot was drawn in a crowded Commons committee room by Mr Michael
Morris, the deputy speaker.
Fourth was Mr David Lidington (Con, Aylesbury), who was elected to the
commons for the first time last year, followed by former Conservative
cabinet minister Mr Michael Jopling (Westmorland and Lonsdale) and Mr Peter
Atkinson (Con, Hexham), who also entered the House last year.
The top six in the ballot are always thought to have the best chance of
getting their own legislation through, particularly if it is not
controversial.
The House of Commons is to rise for the Christmas recess on December 17, the
same date as the Lords, and return on Tuesday January 11, a day later than
peers, Mr Tony Newton, the Leader of the House, announced yesterday.
Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, protested that parliament will
have sat for no more than seven months this year.
Mr Newton said: 'For the great majority of MPs, a very large part of their
work is conducted in their constituencies and needs to be combined with
their duties here.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Energy minister rebukes Nuclear Electric

Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity generator, yesterday received
a highly unusual government rebuke when Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said
it was for ministers to decide whether the industry should be privatised,
and not for the companies.
He warned the industry that it had to be realistic both about the desire of

be taken when it is appropriate to do so, not before.'
Separately Mr James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, the other UK nuclear
generator, said the review should not just focus on commercial viability and
privatisation.
Scottish Nuclear is much less enthusiastic about privatisation than Nuclear
Electric.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Competition attack on councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, said yesterday that legal action
would be taken against councils if they were found to have taken part in
anti-competitive behaviour. He was speaking on the publication of the
environment department's first quarterly bulletin of action taken against
councils for anti-competitive behaviour or financial failure.
Many contractors are complaining that local authorities are using the
Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations of 1981 to behave
anti-competitively when allocating contracts under compulsory competitive
tendering, Mr Baldry said.
Five councils - Adur, Leeds, Oswestry, Bradford and Langbaurgh - have been
served notices relating to anti-competitive behaviour.

accept its closure.
Production at the pit, where 740 people work, will end today. Miners voted
by 301 to 27 not to fight the closure. Production will also cease today at
Rufford colliery, near Mansfield, Notts, which employs 300.
Miners at Hatfield, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, will meet at the

FT  26 NOV 93 / DoE opts for new HQ in Victoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of the Environment, which has been striving for years to
relocate from its dilapidated Marsham Street headquarters, will announce its
new home today: Eland House in Victoria, London, David Lascelles writes.
The department's attempt to relocate to London Docklands 18 months ago was
thwarted when its 2,000 staff threatened to strike rather than move to the
fringes of east London.
Eland House, in Stag Place, is close to Victoria Station, one of London's
busiest commuter stations, and less than a mile from Marsham Street. Staff
unions indicated last night that Eland House's central location would make
it acceptable to their members.
The building, an undistinguished 1960s office block, has been empty for two
years, but its owner, Land Securities, has been preparing plans to refurbish
it along with a recently acquired neighbouring school site.
The department is understood to be insisting that the redesign incorporate a
number of 'green' features appropriate to its governmental mission.
Marsham Street, a vast post-war office development which has been described
as the ugliest building in London, would cost more than Pounds 50m to
repair, and the department decided several years ago that it would rather
move out and demolish the property. The building's other occupant, the
Department of Transport, is making separate relocation plans.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Gould urges increased public borrowing to help recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bryan Gould, the Labour MP who chairs the Full Employment Forum,
yesterday called for a Pounds 10bn increase in government borrowing and a
cut of 2 percentage points in short-term interest rates in next week's
Budget.
He said the government's focus on reducing the Pounds 50bn public sector
borrowing requirement demonstrated that ministers 'have no idea how to help
the economy recover from recession'.
He urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise the level of demand by
increasing public investment, reducing interest rates and allowing the pound
to fall.
'It is not zero inflation but recovery and full employment which should now
be the top priority,' he said. 'You do not recover from recession by making
people poorer.'
Mr Gould, a former shadow trade and industry secretary who stood against Mr
John Smith in the Labour leadership contest last year, set up the forum six
months ago to put pressure on the Labour leadership for a return to
explicitly Keynesian economic policies.
More than 35 Labour MPs have joined, giving the forum more support than the
leftwing Campaign Group, formerly the main vehicle for backbench opposition
to the leader-ship.
The forum hopes to attract members of the 'soft' traditionally left Tribune
Group, which now includes leading moderates such as Mr Tony Blair, shadow
home secretary.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Dublin orders police chief to join leak inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of the Irish Republic has underlined how seriously it takes
last week's leaking of draft proposals for a political settlement on
Northern Ireland by bringing Mr Patrick Culligan, the Irish police
commissioner, into its efforts to track down the culprits.
Downing Street has acknowledged that the leak has damaged attempts by prime
minister John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, to secure
a comprehensive constitutional settlement, casting a pall over next month's
planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, this week urged Mr John
Major to stop looking for such a settlement, claiming the Dublin proposals
offered 'structure that would bring about the unification of the Irish
territory'.
Dublin's move came as the IRA said it was committed to securing 'a just and
lasting' peace, while accusing London and Dublin of 'playing politics' with
the Irish issue.
Using an article in its Republican News mouthpiece, the IRA sought to
undermine recent suggestions it might be tiring of the armed struggle. The
two governments should 'harbour no doubts about the determination with which
we, our activists and supporters will apply ourselves to realising our
objectives,' it warned.
In London, Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Catholic SDLP,
sought to inject momentum into the quest for a settlement by calling on the
main protaganists to reject their entrenched positions and compromise.
'Peace is going to have to make all of us make concessions and bite our
lips,' he said.
Yesterday Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, offered fresh
assurances to unionists about Dublin's intentions in efforts to reach a
settlement.
'There should be no fears or suspicions among unionists. We are trying to
end a very complex problem and bring about a situation where there is peace
on this island and the people can live and work together as friendly
neighbours. I just wish that people could see that and have talks on the
basis of tolerance and respect.'
He hit out at the perpetrators of last week's leak, branding them 'the real
betrayers of both communities in Northern Ireland.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / CBI steps up warning to Clarke on taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday issued a last-ditch plea to
Mr Kenneth Clarke to refrain from a tax increase in next week's Budget,
arguing that it would jeopardise the recovery.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's head of economic trends, said any tax increase
on Tuesday - coming on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of higher taxes already
announced for next April - would put the UK into 'uncharted waters'.
In its latest quarterly economic forecast, published today, the employers'
body is drastically reducing its estimate of likely UK growth next year
because of the effects of the fiscal tightening and weak demand prospects in
many overseas markets.
It is particularly worried by the outlook for companies whose profits are
expected to grow only sluggishly next year after a big jump this year.
Underlining the fragile state of the recovery, the CBI said manufacturers'
order books for exports are at their weakest since February, even though
companies are slightly more optimistic than a month ago about likely levels
of overall output.
The comments from the CBI illustrate the uncertainties facing the chancellor
as he prepares a Budget aimed at reducing the Pounds 50bn fiscal deficit
without harming prospects for an upturn. Mr Andrew Sentance, the
confederation's head of economics, said many people had not woken up to the
extent of the tax increases due at the beginning of the next financial year.
The CBI reckons gross domestic product will expand 2.4 per cent next year.
It had projected 3 per cent in August. Growth this year is estimated at 1.9
per cent.
Manufacturing output is now thought likely to rise 2.8 per cent next year,
less than the 3.5 per cent forecast in August. Company profits are expected
to increase in real, inflation-adjusted terms by 2.4 per cent next year
after a 10.5 per cent rise this year and a 3.9 per cent decline last year.
The forecast assumes Mr Clarke will not announce higher taxes in the Budget,
but will reduce public spending by Pounds 2bn a year.
Underlying inflation is expected by the CBI to stay below the Treasury's 4
per cent ceiling in the next two years. Unit labour costs in manufacturing
are projected to show falls of 1 per cent and 0.6 per cent this year and
next year respectively, with a modest rise of 1.4 per cent expected in 1995.
In the CBI's latest monthly survey of manufacturing trends 28 per cent of
companies thought output volumes would rise in the next four months with 16
per cent expecting a fall. The positive balance of 12 percentage points
compares with a balance of 8 points last month, but is lower than the
results in September and August. The survey of 1,460 manufacturers was
conducted between October 26 and November 17.
A balance of 23 percentage points of companies said overall order books were
below normal, an improvement on the position in October when the balance was
31 points. Only 20 per cent of companies expect to put up prices in the next
four months, while 15 per cent expect price cuts.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Lib Dems say high earners should be taxed to boost jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People earning more than Pounds 25,200 a year would pay an extra 3p in the
Pounds 1 on income tax to fund a jobs and education expansion programme in a
Liberal Democrat alternative Budget launched yesterday.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal treasury spokesman, said the only way to deal with
the Pounds 50bn budget deficit was to generate higher growth through a big
investment package. He said: 'Any other measures to deal with the deficit
are just tokenism.'
He reiterated his party's commitment to put one penny in the pound on the
basic and higher rate of tax to improve education.
But he said people would not start paying the higher tax until their
earnings reached Pounds 25,200 - Pounds 1,500 more than the present higher
rate level.
The party said its Pounds 8.3bn package would be paid for by increased
revenues from income tax, tobacco sales, a 400,000 fall in unemployment as
well as crackdowns on wasteful expenditure. But government plans to put
value added tax on domestic fuel bills would be abandoned.
The basic state pension would rise by Pounds 2 a week and childcare
facilities would be improved.
There would be more investment in public transport, the health service and
housing, while mortgage interest tax relief on new home loans from January
1995 would stop.
Mr Beith dismissed calls from businessmen for spending cuts, however.
'Society as a whole would not accept us turning our back on the most
vulnerable,' he said.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Model plan for a Northern Ireland assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chances of a new Northern Ireland assembly appeared to improve this week
after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, approved
ministerial efforts to broker a compromise on a form of devolved government
for the province.
As leader of the province's largest political party, with nine MPs available
to bolster Mr John Major's slim Commons majority, in effect Mr Molyneaux has
a veto over the government's proposals.
At last year's abortive talks, a working party including all four
constitutional parties agreed a blueprint for an 85-seat assembly with some
legislative powers.
It is this provisional model which provides the best pointer to how the new
body might be structured. It is far from certain, however, that all party
leaders would find it acceptable.
The 85 assembly members would be elected under a system of proportional
representation from the 17 Northern Ireland constituencies.
Unionists would probably push for most legislative powers to be retained
initially in London.
But Mr Molyneaux accepts that even if the assembly began in effect as a
regional council, its role would later be expanded if it functioned
effectively.
'I have always said I am in favour of devolved government at as high a level
as can be obtained without paying the price of unworkability.'
The Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party has proposed that
the assembly has a right to submit to parliament any proposal securing the
support of 60 per cent of assembly members.
There would continue to be a Northern Ireland secretary, but each of the
Northern Ireland Office's departments would be answerable to an elected
assembly member. There are now six departments, but they could be divided
into smaller units.
It is understood that agreement was reached for these departmental heads to
double up as chairmen of the assembly's committees. A formula would be
applied to try to ensure that the number of these positions held by each
party was proportionate to its numerical strength in the assembly.
The working party is also said to have agreed that a three-member 'panel' be
set up, with its members elected in a similar way to the province's three
MEPs.
This panel could be given powers of adjudication over controversial matters.
Under one possible mechanism, it would be brought into play if 30 per cent
of assembly members so requested. Its role may include approving public
appointments.
In Mr Molyneaux's view, there is a 'fair chance' that Mr Michael Ancram,
Northern Ireland minister, will be able to identify common ground enabling
the parties to start the process of restoring accountable democracy for the
province 'within a week or two'.
He says he would back Mr Ancram if he secured agreement to the proposals
outlined in the abortive talks. 'But if they find they cannot identify
common ground at that level, they should move down the scale to the point
where there is.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Parkinson seeks rise in rented housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Parkinson, the former Conservative cabinet minister, is leading a
campaign to increase the supply of private rented accommodation by the
creation of a new class of investment trust.
He hopes that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will include the necessary
legislative reforms in next Tuesday's Budget.
The proposal, which has support from Sir George Young, the housing minister,
would allow Authorised Housing Investment Trusts to pay corporation tax of
25 per cent and be exempt from capital gains tax.
This would allow the trusts to generate a rate of return high enough to
persuade institutional investors to buy shares in them. The absence of
institutional investment is one of the main reasons for the shortage of
private rental accommodation.
Lord Parkinson said chief executives of leading investment institutions had
appeared very supportive of the proposals.
Treasury concerns that the new trusts would provide tax shelters to property
developers could be allayed, he said. The Department of Environment would
review each trust every year to ensure that it was fully invested in private
rented accommodation and would withdraw authorisation from any company that
traded too actively in properties or owned commercial properties.
The trusts would not provide social housing. They would provide
accommodation for people setting up home for the first time or those in
occupations requiring mobility.
New capital has been attracted to the sector over the past few years by the
Business Expansion Schemes, but these will be abolished at the end of the
year.
It is believed much of the property owned by the BES schemes will be sold
with vacant possession in the next couple of years. This could be avoided if
the new trusts areallowed to exchange their shares for those held by BES
investors. The chancellor should extend value added tax to zero-rated or
exempt items as part of his Budget strategy for cutting the fiscal deficit,
the Society of Business Economists said yesterday.
The chancellor was urged to reduce mortgage interest tax relief as part of a
fiscal tightening of at least Pounds 2bn.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Straw warns of freeze on council house receipts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, warned yesterday that local
authorities' council house receipts would almost certainly be frozen in the
Budget, reducing housing investment by about Pounds 1bn, James Blitz writes.
'It would be economic lunacy to cut investment in housing just when it is
needed to lift Britain out of recession,' said Mr Straw. 'This country will
be forced to pay the price for Mr Clarke's broken promises in unbuilt homes
and unemployed building workers.'
He said spending on housing had been slashed by 53 per cent between 1978-79
and 1991-92, creating a sharp fall in housing starts and contributing to
depression in the building industry. Further cuts in capital spending could
cost 100,000 building jobs, he added.
The government has frozen receipts from the sale of council houses in the
past to contain public spending. But Mr Straw said yesterday: 'It is only
this government which says that there is no difference between having the
money in the bank and borrowing it. Everybody else knows that there is a
difference.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Top Thai broker is fined over Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) yesterday fined Phatra Thanakit, a
leading stockbroker which co-operates with SG Warburg on company research, a
total of Baht 40m (Pounds 1.07m) for breaking exchange rules.
SET officials said they thought that the fine was the largest imposed since
the exchange was founded in 1975.
Phatra Thanakit was guilty of automatically channelling a stock order from a
sub-broker on to the market instead of re-keying the order on its own
computers, the exchange said.
The practice is believed to be common in Thailand, and the misdemeanour came
to light only because the sub-broker, Peregrine Finance and Securities,
mistakenly issued a sell order worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) for 200m
shares in Ayudhya Investment and Trust (Aitco) instead of the 2,000 actually
being sold by a client.
Aitco only has 25m shares in issue, and 18m were sold before Phatra and the
exchange were able to correct the mistake.
The transactions were subsequently annulled by the exchange, saving Phatra
from substantial losses.
Phatra shares were suspended, and after the suspension was lifted yesterday
the shares dropped almost to their 10 per cent limit, falling Baht 68 to
Baht 636.
Some rival stockbrokers said the fine was reasonably severe, amounting to
more than 4 per cent of Phatra's Bt912m net profit in 1992. They noted it
did not preclude further action by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Others, however, criticised the exchange for cancelling the Aitco
transactions.
With trading volume sometimes exceeding Dollars 1bn a day, the Thai
authorities have been attempting to improve regulation of the exchange.

Nigeria's new military ruler named an all-civilian cabinet yesterday,
confusing detractors by choosing politicians from across the political
spectrum including several known for their opposition to military rule, AP
reports from Lagos.
Among those named to a federal ministerial council to administer the nation
under a provisional military council were former oil minister, Mr Donald
Etiebet, and finance minister Mr Aminu Saleh, both in the interim government
that General Sani Abacha ousted last week. No portfolios were announced for
the cabinet. Other prominent members included three presidential aspirants
in the run-up to annulled June 12 elections and people who have been
outspoken supporters of Mr Moshood Abiola, the billionaire who claims to
have won the poll.
On Wednesday, Gen Abacha stunned the nation by appointing three military
critics to the cabinet, including Mr Abiola's running mate, Baba Gana
Kingibe, to take his case to the world as foreign minister. Yesterday's
announcement appeared a further effort to counter international condemnation
of the military takeover.

Mr Atef Sidki, Egypt's prime minister, yesterday escaped an assassination
attempt by Islamic militants after a powerful bomb exploded beside his
motorcade near his home in northern Cairo, killing a schoolgirl and injuring
at least 18 others.
Mr Sidki, 63, was unscathed. Jihad, an extremist Islamic group, immediately
claimed responsibility. The bombing was to 'avenge the blood of the
martyrs', a reference to Jihad members killed by security forces or
sentenced to death in recent trials.
The attack is the third failed assassination attempt on an Egyptian minister
in eight months. Mr Safwat al-Sherif, information minister, survived a
shooting near his home in April, while Mr Hassan al-Alfi, interior minister,
was injured when a bomb exploded near his motorcade in central Cairo in
mid-August, an attack also claimed by Jihad.
Mr Sidki, on TV a few hours after the attack, warned the government would
toughen its clampdown on Islamic extremists.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Israeli troops wound 37 in Gaza violence: Protest at killing
of Islamic fundamentalist military commander

Violence flared in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday as Israeli troops shot
and wounded at least 37 Palestinians protesting at the Israeli killing of an
Islamic fundamentalist military commander.
Militants of Hamas, the Islamic movement opposed to peace with Israel,
blocked roads with burning tyres, clashed with Israeli troops and ordered a
three-day general strike to mourn the killing on Wednesday night of Mr Imad
Aqel, northern Gaza commander of Hamas' military wing. In a military
communique, Hamas, recalling the words of Mr Aqel, said: 'Killing Israeli
soldiers is a worship by which we get close to God'.
The eruption, the worst since the peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation was signed in September, came as Mr Yassir
Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO was defeated in student elections at Beir
Zeit University in the occupied West Bank by a coalition of Hamas and
left-wing PLO factions opposed to the peace accord.
The Beir Zeit poll was the first electoral test of young Palestinians since
the peace agreement was signed. It marked Palestinian discontent with the
lack of results from the peace process and continued Israeli closure of the
territories.
However, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday he and Mr
Arafat were optimistic about the peace process and confident agreement would
be reached on implementing the peace accord and beginning Israeli military
withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank area of Jericho by December 13.
Israel and the PLO said talks on implementing the agreement, to be enshrined
in the December 13 protocol, had, over the past two days, reached broad
agreement on the transfer of authority from the Israeli-run civil
administration in Gaza and Jericho to Palestinian hands. Mr Hassan Asfour, a
member of the PLO delegation meeting the Israeli side in the Egyptian resort
town of El-Arish, said most matters had been resolved, including fisheries,
religious affairs and identity cards.
In Cairo, separate Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams were trying to
reach agreement on issues including the size of the Jericho area, the
release of 10,000 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners and control over border
crossings between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho and Jordan.
In talks in Paris, an Israeli official said Palestinian agricultural
produce, previously barred from entering Israel, would be allowed in if both
sides agreed on a customs union and free movement of goods and services.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Wary response to China plan

Asian contractors and western equipment suppliers were yesterday pondering
the opportunities offered by Chinese plans to spend as much as 700bn yuan
(Pounds 81bn) over the rest of the decade in upgrading the country's
transport and service infrastructure.
But a degree of wariness greeted the plans announced on Wednesday by the
official Xinhua news agency, which said foreign participants would be
encouraged to invest in joint ventures or as sole operators for the railway,
highway, waterway, pipeline and civil aviation schemes Beijing envisages.
Some operators in the Chinese market noted that, while the authorities are
clearly concerned that inadequate transport is holding back growth potential
in the economy, large-scale national programmes announced in the past had
amounted more to wish-lists than realistic shopping lists.
Others, pointing to the difficulties inherent in doing business in China,
added that infrastructural projects rarely offered the best returns.
Companies in Hong Kong are arguably best placed to benefit from China's need
for foreign participation in infrastructure development. They already
dominate foreign investment in road, rail, and electric power and are
important players in the mainland's emerging market for telecommunications
services.
In spite of peerless guanxi (connections) many have encountered difficulties
at the working level. Hopewell Holdings is currently building a six-lane
toll-way between Shenzhen and Guangzhou in Guangdong. The road was due to be
open in June this year. By the end of the year, at best, two phases of the
four-phase project may be ready.
South Korean construction companies, which have been shifting their focus
from the Middle East to Asia during the last decade, view China as a new
lucrative market. Several proposed ventures have collapsed, however,
including the construction of Dollars 10bn motorway between Hong Kong and
Beijing that involved Dong-Ah Construction and Pohang Iron and Steel.
Japanese banks may be thought of as a source of funding - the railway lines
of northern China were constructed under Japanese authority early this
century, and Industrial Bank of Japan helped to raise the necessary finance
by underwriting Manchurian Railway Bonds in 1907. But one banker in Tokyo
yesterday suggested that infrastructure projects such as railways and ports
appear to be among the least attractive in China, as ensuring a flow of hard
currency for repayment would be difficult to arrange.
Most of the Japanese institutional lending has been aimed at hotel projects
and joint venture companies. A China department manager at another Japanese
bank, saying that 'China is an awkward place to do business and you have to
be aware of the risks,' believed that infrastructural projects 'would have
to be very attractive if we were to be involved.'
All the same, contractors in the region are pursuing what deals they can.
Korea's Dong-Ah, in spite of its other setback, signed a letter of intent
with the Beijing municipality in July to build motorways, a subway and
cement plant in the city with a total value of Dollars 3bn. Hyundai
Engineering and Construction is bidding for a Dollars 3bn dam project on the
Yellow River, which should be tendered within the next year or two.
Of leading Hong Kong companies, Hutchison Whampoa owns 70 per cent of a
500bn yuan container port development at Yantian in Shenzhen, New World
Development is involved in road and power station construction in Guangzhou,
while Cheung Kong - which also controls Hutchison - has interests in
electric power generation.
Consolidated Electric Power Asia (Cepa), a unit of Hopewell which it plans
soon to float, is building its second thermal power station in Guangdong.
Among western suppliers which will be paying particular attention to China's
spending plans are those providing railway equipment: the country aims to
boost its railway network from 53,000km to 70,000km by the year 2000 and
increase rolling stock capacity by 20 per cent.
According to Siemens of Germany, because of China's 1.2bn population and car
ownership likely to remain at relatively low levels, the country needs an
extensive public transport infrastructure.
China has a well developed railway equipment industry, with 33 locomotive
companies and rolling-stock factories. Steam engine production at the main
Datong works ceased in 1988. The main emphasis has been on diesel and
electrical units.
The majority of China's diesel and electric loco-motives are locally built,
but imports also rose sharply in the 1980s, with foreign suppliers including
General Electric of the US, Alsthom of France (now GEC Alsthom) and
Electroputere of Romania. Rolling stock has been supplied from the former
East Germany.
Because of the strong local industry, Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish
group, believes opportunities are more likely in supplying sophisticated
components rather than complete foreign-built vehicles.
Technology transfer for modern locomotive propulsion is one option. ABB has
signed a letter of intent for a joint venture to produce signalling
equipment, which it sees as a way for China to better use of its railway
network, safely.
Siemens also stresses the importance of local partnerships, and sees two key
opportunities from the Chinese market. The first is in urban mass transit. A
consortium including Siemens and AEG last week clinched a DM700m (Pounds
277.7m) deal to supply the trains and related electrical equipment for an
underground railway in Guangzhou in the southern province of Canton.
Similar projects could be available in six or seven other Chinese cities in
the next five or 10 years, Siemens said.
The second main opportunity is in national railway services, where China is
considering building a high-speed rail network. The first step would be a
line from Beijing to Shanghai, which China has already been discussing with
the big western suppliers, notably Siemens with its ICE train and GEC
Alsthom, which builds the TGV.
Expansion of the railway network also creates export opportunities for
suppliers of premium grade rails such as British Steel. The UK steel
producer sold 10,000 tonnes of such rail to China last year and yesterday
welcomed the planned network expansion.

<TEXT>
Taiwan yesterday announced a package of reforms easing curbs on foreign
investment in its financial markets to accompany the island's bid to join
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Reuter reports from Taipei.
All curbs on remittances of capital gains and principal out of Taiwan by
foreign investors in the island's securities markets would be removed, the
finance ministry said. Foreign investors would have nine months after
initial approval to bring funds into Taiwan, up from six months at present.
The 10 per cent ceiling on combined foreign investment in any individual
stock, and a 5 per cent ceiling on investment by a single foreign
institution, would both be raised. An official said the first ceiling would
be raised to 20-30 per cent, and the second to 10-15 per cent.
The ministry planned to abolish all curbs on foreign investment in
securities houses, insurance firms and investment companies. The reforms
'will open our markets, helping us to join Gatt and speeding our development
into a regional financial centre,' the ministry added.
All relevant government agencies had agreed to the reforms, which still
needed the approval of the cabinet and in some cases parliament. No schedule
was set. Foreign fund managers welcomed the reforms. Curbs on fund
remittances, such as a rule that capital gains can only be remitted out once
a year, have helped deter inflows of foreign equity investment funds,
totalling Dollars 1.86bn (Pounds 1.24bn) since 1991.

Sikdi, on TV a few hours after the attack, warned the government would
toughen its clampdown on Islamic extremists. 'We are going to control this
by all feasible, and any other means,' he said.
Eight members of Jihad, which its members claim is a revival of the group
which assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981, were sentenced to death on
terrorist charges last month. Nearly 40 extremists have been condemned to
death since the government introduced special military courts earlier this
year, and 18 have been hanged.
The government's security operations have led to an abatement in attacks on
tourist targets and bombings in the Egyptian capital, although tit-for-tat
killings of Moslem extremists and police have persisted in in Upper Egypt.
Since last year 210 people have died in extremist violence.
Another 400 alleged members of Jihad are scheduled for trial, facing
possible death sentences, in the next few months.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Hosokawa in bid to settle coalition rifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa yesterday met leaders of the seven
parties in his fragile coalition, in an attempt to make progress on the most
divisive tasks facing the government.
The meeting follows a warning from senior members of the Social Democratic
party, the largest coalition member, that they will walk out if the
government drops the ban on rice imports.
The SDP has threatened to defect on other issues before, risking the
collapse of the coalition, but has each time compromised.
This time, it will be harder for the rest of the coalition to satisfy the
SDP on rice, because it is holding to an agreement between coalition members
in July, when the government was formed, to oppose rice market
liberalisation.
Mr Hosokawa told the SDP at a meeting earlier this week that he cannot
negotiate on rice 'if my hands are tied,' SDP officials said.
Pressure on the coalition to settle its internal difference on rice is
increasing with the approach of the December 15 deadline for concluding the
Gatt world trade liberalisation talks.
An agriculture ministry draft, leaked to the Japanese press, is said to
propose a period of limited market opening until 1991, to be followed by
negotiations to allow imports subject to tariffs.
The SDP remains out of line with the rest of the coalition on most of the
main issues. On rice and on political reform, it is in curious company with
the right wing of the opposition LDP.
The LDP was yesterday delaying the start of a debate on four political
reform bills in the upper house, on which many Socialists also have
reservations. This increases the likelihood that Mr Hosokawa will have to
prolong the current parliamentary session beyond its normal closure on
December 15, to meet his deadline of passing the bills by the end of the
year.
Coalition leaders appear to be making progress, however, towards settling
the main difference over tax reform with the SDP.
The socialists opposed initial plans for an income tax cut, to be
automatically followed by a consumption tax rise, on the grounds this would
hit the less well-off.
The coalition is understood to be in the final phase of preparing plans for
a tax cut to be financed by the issue of treasury bonds, to be followed by a
possible rise in consumption tax at an unspecified later date.
Department store sales fell 6.5 per cent year-on-year in October, for the
20th month running, according to the Japan Department Stores' Association.
This is slightly better than the previous month's 6.7 per cent fall, but
November sales are expected to be poor.

<TEXT>
Fundamentalist Moslems won two victories over their secular opponents in
south-east Asia yesterday, underlining the growing importance of Islam in
the region's politics.
In Jakarta, the Indonesian government bowed to pressure from students and
religious leaders and abolished a national lottery after weeks of
demonstrations.
Gambling is prohibited under Islam, and the lottery was criticised for the
way it was managed and for attracting money from people who could ill-afford
it.
Ms Endang Kusuma Suweng, Indonesian social affairs minister, told a
parliamentary commission that the government was reversing an earlier
decision to continue the lottery, which raised money for sports and welfare
projects and contributed to the government's tax revenue.
Hundreds of students, confronted by riot police outside the parliament
buildings, cheered the minister's announcement.
In Malaysia's Kelantan State 1,400km to the north west, the state assembly
unanimously passed a bill to introduce a sharia criminal code that includes
stoning to death for adulterers and the amputation of limbs for thieves.
The Kelantan coalition government is led by fundamentalists from the Parti
Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) who oppose the federal government of Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister.
Malaysian officials say that for the measures to take effect in Kelantan,
PAS will have to engineer a two-thirds majority in the national parliament
in Kuala Lumpur to change the constitution.
A constitutional amendment is likely to be blocked by Chinese Christians and
moderate Moslems but the federal government has reason to be concerned:
among the state legislators who voted for the sharia bill were two
representatives from Dr Mahathir's ruling National Front.
'Let the law of the state be Islamic law,' Mr Wan Najib Wan Mohamad of the
National Front was quoted by the Bernama news agency.
Jakarta has ruthlessly suppressed an Islamic separatist rebellion in Aceh,
northern Sumatra, but both President Suharto of Indonesia and Dr Mahathir
have sought to co-opt staunch Moslems by encouraging 'interest-free' Islamic
banking and establishing Moslem organisations.
Indonesia, with 90 per cent of its 190m inhabitants nominally Moslem, has
the world's largest Moslem population. In 1991, Mr Suharto undertook a
pilgrimage to Mecca and returned with an honorary first name, Mohammed.

A consortium of seven Japanese companies has won a contract worth an
estimated Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m) to Dollars 600m to supply equipment for
a new steel production facility at the Baoshan complex, near Shanghai.
The Japanese group, headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi
Corporation, signed a contract at the weekend, despite a long history of
problems at the plant, touted as China's largest industrial project when
conceived two decades ago.
Members of the consortium say they have been told by the Chinese partner not
to release details of the contract, but the companies will supply equipment
for a hot-rolled steel sheet facility capable of producing 2.8m tonnes a
year.
The Baoshan complex produced 6.3m tonnes of steel last year, and is expected
to increase its output to 10m tonnes by 2000, as part of a national plan to
lift steel production from 80m tonnes last year to 100m tonnes by the
century's end. Chinese steel producers have been unable to meet demand over
the past two years of rapid growth.

companies, Tanayong and Thanachart Holding, are ranked second and third.
Bangkok Land's turnkey contractors will be Thai Leighton and Bouygues Thai,
associates of Australian and French groups respectively. The US-German AEG
Westinghouse group is to supply equipment. Ironically Leighton and AEG, as
the Euro Asia Consortium, bid for this contract in the 1980s when it was
known as the Skytrain project.
Skytrain's original concessionaire, Canada's Lavelin-SNC group, was fired
last year nearly two decades after the project was conceived.
Mr Anant Kanjanapas, chairman of Bangkok Land, joins the long-running game
of trying to beat the political infighting and planning inertia which has so
far prevented one metre of mass transit track being laid to relieve
Bangkok's appalling traffic.
However Mr Anant is unusually ambitious and confident: he surprised the
financial community in October by announcing a Dollars 600m convertible bond
issue in the international market to fund the MRTA project before he had
even won it.

FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: French MPs put in the Gatt balance -
Balladur may have to put his political survival on the line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The French government yesterday made clear its intention to use its
parliament as an instrument of pressure in the Gatt talks, just as President
Bill Clinton is using the time limit on his ability to get 'fast-track'
congressional approval of any deal to bring negotiations to an end next
month.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wants a draft Gatt text to put before both
the National Assembly and the Senate between December 10 and 15, Mr Gerard
Longuet, the trade minister, said yesterday.
After a subsequent cabinet crisis meeting yesterday on Gatt, it became
evident the government was hesitant about putting a draft deal to a vote,
because constitutionally that would probably have to be done in the form of
a motion of confidence in itself. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister,
said: 'We first need to know whether there will be a (Gatt) deal, because
one votes on texts.'
But, if such a draft Gatt text is not a law or international treaty - which
it cannot be by mid-December - then under the French constitution the
National Assembly can only vote on a matter of 'general policy' involving a
motion of confidence in the government itself.
Procedurally, the previous Socialist government had to put forward a
confidence motion in itself to get the National Assembly to vote a year ago
against the Blair House farm trade deal between the US and the European
Commission.
Given that vote a year ago, and the subsequent raging national controversy
over Gatt, Mr Balladur probably has no choice but to put his political
survival on the line. A confidence motion should also have the effect of
forcing his own RPR Gaullist party, which has a strong rural electorate, to
line up behind his position.
Equally, however, there is an outside risk of Mr Balladur being toppled, if
for instance, he falls out over Gatt with his party leader and presidential
rival, Mr Jacques Chirac. The latter would take France on an even tougher
course in trade and European policy, a risk that Mr Balladur is now
effectively, through his parliamentary tactics, asking his negotiating
partners to weigh.
The irony is the National Assembly - the directly elected house of the
French parliament which determines the fate of French governments - has
never voted on any aspect of Gatt negotiations, since France's membership of
Gatt in 1947.
The main French farm union, FNSEA, has asked the French government to demand
compensation from the US, Canada and Mexico for diversion of French and
European farm exports as a result of the forming of the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
Both US and European Union trade negotiators spoke encouragingly yesterday
of prospects for settlement of differences in the Uruguay Round of global
trade liberalisation, David Dodwell, World Trade editor, adds from Geneva.
They raised hopes that details of a deal might be ready for disclosure by
Wednesday next week, when Mr Mickey Kantor, chief US trade negotiator, flies
to Brussels for further discussions with Sir Leon Brittan, his EU
counterpart.
One senior US official fresh from this week's Kantor-Brittan meetings in
Washington talked of 'a close-out sort of mood' in the negotiations: 'There
was a very positive sense that we are going to get there,' he said. He
acknowledged agreement terms - notably over tariff cuts on semi-conductors,
textiles, wood, paper, ceramics and glass - needed to be spelled out to
other negotiators well before the December 15 deadline for completing the
round.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and Germany yesterday warned that failure to reach agreement on the
Uruguay Round of trade talks on December 15 would have 'intolerable'
consequences for the developing world, perpetuating recession in western
Europe and leading to protectionist measures by individual countries.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Helmut Kohl, the German
chancellor, also issued grim warnings about the level of unemployment and
uncompetitiveness in Europe.
If European Union countries did not tackle, and come up with solutions at
next month's EU summit, both leaders said Europe would be unable to respond
to the challenges posed by Asian economies. Speaking after the one-day
Anglo-German summit in Bonn, Mr Major and Mr Kohl said a trade agreement was
'achievable'. But without naming countries, Mr Major said several countries
had to show more 'flexibility'.
'Market access, agriculture, and audio visual issues, which affect both the
US and France are now the main stumbling blocks to a deal,' a British
official said, adding that Bonn and London are 'extremely worried about any
failure. It will do nothing to stimulate our own economies.'
British officials confirmed that US president Bill Clinton telephoned Mr
Major on Wednesday evening to discuss the trade talks. They said Mr Clinton
wanted Britain to ask Bonn how far German officials would be prepared to put
pressure on France into making compromises over the Uruguay Round. French
and German leaders meet next week.
Apart from Gatt, which dominated the summit, British and German officials
said EU countries would have to adopt greater flexibility and training
schemes to increase competitiveness and create jobs. 'By the year 2000, the
output of Asia will exceed the output levels of the European Community
countries combined,' said Mr Major.
The issue of unemployment and competitiveness will be the main agenda items
during the European Union summit meeting early next month.
Both leaders also ruled out increasing public expenditure. 'Sound finance,
low inflation and flexibility on the labour market, and reducing barriers to
part time work' are the basis for growth,' Mr Major said.

<TEXT>
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, arrives in South Africa tomorrow
for a visit which signals the opening of a more constructive era in economic
relations between the two countries.
His trip comes only days after President Bill Clinton signed the South
Africa Democratic Transition Support Act, formally bringing to an end the
era of federal US sanctions aimed at ending apartheid.
Although Mr Brown's visit will probably have limited practical impact in the
short term, it conveys a powerful symbolic message. Mr Princeton Lyman, US
ambassador in South Africa, comments: 'It signifies a very basic change from
a negative to a positive relationship with South Africa. The whole tone
shifts.'
This shift from isolation to engagement was confirmed on Tuesday by Mr
Clinton. He noted that removing sanctions was not enough. 'Americans who
have been so active in toppling apartheid must remain committed to building
South Africa's non-racial market democracy.'
'The visit confirms a real interest in South Africa's potential as a viable
trading partner and bulwark of economic strength and stability in the region
and on the continent,' said Mr Brown.
Despite the impact of sanctions, there is a substantial base upon which to
develop US-South Africa trade relations.
South Africa is only the US's 34th largest export market, but it remains the
largest in Africa, a continent where, Mr Lyman concedes, 'the US has not
done very well'.
The US recently surpassed Germany as South Africa's largest trade partner.
Mr Lyman estimates bilateral trade now to be in the region of Dollars 5bn.
Commerce Department figures show that in 1992 US exports to South Africa
totalled Dollars 2.4bn, 14 per cent of South Africa's total import market,
with US imports from South Africa of Dollars 1.7bn.
The US has fared less well in terms of investment. Figures from the
Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC) show that as
of September only 135 US companies had employees or direct investment in
South Africa, compared to 267 in May 1986.
The stock of US investment in South Africa is put at about Dollars 1bn.
Certainly, however, the trend has started to turn.
The past two months have seen food manufacturers Pillsbury and CPC
International enter the market, following such other companies as Mars,
Microsoft and Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM has recently confirmed it
will probably be returning, Procter &amp; Gamble is known to be taking a close
look and McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch and Hyatt are all expected to establish
a presence.
A focus of Mr Brown's visit - his 50-member delegation contains
representatives of many large US companies - will be an attempt to establish
links between US companies and the emerging black business community in
South Africa. Another issue sure to be discussed is South Africa's offer to
Gatt in terms of the Uruguay round of trade talks. Aspects of the offer -
particularly the high protection, and longer phasing-in period for tariff
reductions for the clothing and textiles, motor and electronics industries -
did not meet with approval from South Africa's trading partners.

FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japanese consortium wins Shanghai steel
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of seven Japanese companies has won a contract worth an
estimated Dollars 500m to Dollars 600m (Pounds 340m to Pounds 408m) to
supply equipment for a new steel production facility at the Baoshan complex,
near Shanghai.
The Japanese group, headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi
Corporation, signed a contract at the weekend, despite a long history of
problems at the plant, touted as China's largest industrial project when
conceived two decades ago.
Members of the consortium say they have been told by the Chinese partner not
to release details of the contract, but the companies will supply equipment
for a hot-rolled steel sheet facility capable of producing 2.8m tonnes a
year.
The Baoshan plant was plagued by problems after its conception, and a decade
ago Japanese companies suffered when contracts to supply equipment were
renegotiated by the Chinese government.
Construction schedules had to be revised because the marshy plant site was
far softer than estimated in a feasibility study and extra foundation work
was necessary to stop the facility from sinking.
Equipment exported from Japan was designed to process higher-grade ore than
was generally found in China, forcing Baoshan to import more Australian ore
than was planned. Meanwhile, the site's port was too shallow for large ore
carriers to dock, forcing them to unload down river, increasing the
transport costs.
'We think we will have no problems this time,' one of the Japanese companies
said. Apart from MHI and Mitsubishi Corporation, the consortium includes
Mitsubishi Electric, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Nippon Steel,
Chugai Ro, an industrial furnace maker, and Ube Industries, a chemicals and
machinery producer
It is understood that Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex corporation, which has
traditionally relied on investment funds from the state, will be responsible
for raising much of the finance for the expansion, to be completed in late
1996.
The Baoshan complex produced 6.3m tonnes of steel last year, and is expected
to increase its output to 10m tonnes by 2000, as part of a national plan to
lift steel production from 80m tonnes last year to 100m tonnes by the
century's end.

The queue of Japanese companies seeking to expand in China lengthened
yesterday, when Fujitsu, the computer group, and Shiseido, the cosmetics
maker, announced projects there, William Dawkins writes from Tokyo.
Fujitsu is planning to open two joint ventures there next year, to make
10,000 cellular telephones a month and 1m switchboard circuits a year. The
aim is move from exporting cellular phones to China from the US and Japan,
to producing locally, said Fujitsu.
The group already has a joint venture in Shanghai making switchboard
software and hardware, and wants to expand to meet the growth in local
demand.
Shiseido has announced the opening of a cosmetics factory operated with a
local partner, Beijing Liyuan, in Beijing.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Mexican move on investor rights: Law would extend
Nafta-style protection worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government has sent to congress a foreign investment law to give
investors worldwide almost all the rights enjoyed by the US and Canada under
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The new legislation, which is certain to be approved, would replace the 1973
law that substantially restricted foreign investment. While the 1973 law has
been partly modified by subsequent regulations, foreigners have complained
that the rules do not offer legal transparency, and still protect important
sectors.
The law permits foreign investment in all areas of the economy and under the
same terms granted to the US and Canada under Nafta, except the financial
sector. It eliminates all performance requirements for foreign investment,
such as obligations to transfer technology or meet local content rules, that
govern industries such as car parts and computers.
Under Nafta, Mexico agreed to open up only partly some sectors such as
airlines to foreign investment. Others, such as the car parts industry,
secondary petrochemicals and mining, were fully opened. Nafta also put into
law existing regulations that permitted 100 per cent investment in most
businesses. Such rules will now apply to all countries.
However, investors outside the US and Canada would not have recourse to
arbitration panels in disputes over investment, as envisaged under Nafta,
nor would they be guaranteed the same treatment as domestic investors. Mr
Pedro Noyola, under-secretary for foreign investment in the Trade Ministry,
said Mexico was ready to open talks with countries on investor protection on
a bilateral basis.
The proposed law, like Nafta, does not open up strategic sectors such as oil
and satellites to private investment; other sectors, such as television and
internal transport are reserved exclusively to Mexicans.
The law goes further than Nafta in permitting foreigners to invest within
100km of the border and 50km of the coasts through Mexican incorporated
companies in industry, hotels or commerce.
The legislation would limit foreign investment in banks and brokerages to 30
per cent, and 49 per cent in insurance companies. Labour Minister Arsenio
Farell said yesterday there would be no revision to Mexico's federal labour
law. Trade unions had objected to proposed reforms, including the scrapping
of a seniority clause that restricted companies' ability to promote workers
and proposals to speed up the arbitration of disputes.

Prospective foreign investors in Cuba have been warned by the US and by at
least one company whose assets were seized by the Cuban government that they
could face legal problems if they invest in nationalised property.
This follows recent Cuban statements that its efforts to attract foreign
investors to several sectors of the state-controlled economy are succeeding.
Jamaica's economic development agency has told the island's hoteliers that
the US government has suggested that they proceed with caution in investing
in Cuban resort properties, as many of these could be the subject of legal
proceedings in the future.
Bacardi, the world's largest rum producer, said on Wednesday that potential
investors in Cuba faced legal risks if they became involved in confiscated
property, including three breweries and a distillery which were seized from
it by the government.
The US State Department said it sent warnings periodically through
government agencies in countries from which investments in Cuba are being
made. Jamaican hoteliers have invested in Cuban properties.
'These notices have been sent not only to Caribbean countries, but also
mainly to Europe, Canada and Latin America,' said an official. 'We cannot
tell people not to invest in Cuba, but we are warning them that when the
political and economic situation in Cuba changes, the real owners of the
property will either want to recover their assets or will want what could be
a significant compensation. Some will want both.'
Earlier this month President Fidel Castro told foreign businessmen that
investment opportunities in Cuba were worth many billions of dollars.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Belgium to push EU growth plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian presidency of the European Union intends to to strengthen the
European Commission's programme for economic growth and job creation at a
meeting of EU finance ministers early next month.
The move is in response to UK and German success in neutering Commission
efforts to set EU-wide targets for halting rising unemployment and promoting
growth.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, is understood to have been
surprised by the Commission's abrupt retreat from earlier calls for specific
targets to spur a recovery and disappointed by the document's bloodless tone
compared with previous drafts.
Brussels had earlier called for a 2-3 per cent reduction in short-term
interest rates contingent upon wage restraint and cuts in budget deficits, a
broadening of the tax base to pay for cuts in employment taxes, and a
specific recommendation to create 15m jobs by the end of the century.
Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands all voiced strong objections to these
targets, pointing out that the EU had no legal instruments to fulfil them
and that the levers of macroeconomic power still rested with member states.
However, France, Italy and Spain were much less hostile, according to an
official.
Mr Maystadt is said to be determined to put forward a strongly-worded
document on the grounds that it will have legal status according to the
recently ratified Maastricht treaty.
Under the Maastricht treaty, the Commission is required to put forward a
recommendation on macroeconomic targets which can be adopted by qualified
majority by the European Council on December 10-11. Belgian officials point
out, with a touch of bravado, that this could mean that the Germans and
British alone could be outvoted.
A Commission official defended the watering down of the original
macro-economic guidelines on the grounds that it was important to 'carry'
along member states.
In Brussels, officials are concerned that Mr Jacques Delors' white paper on
employment, competitiveness and growth could lose impact because of the
Commission's retreat, particularly since it has no legal status and is
unlikely to contain recommendations.

Hopes are rising for an end to the US coal strike, Reuter reports from
Charleston.
Mr Cecil Roberts, vice president of the United Mine Workers of America, said
this week that union negotiators had reached an oral agreement with the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association on a comprehensive new contract.
However, the union was waiting to see written copies of the contract before
calling off the six-month strike.
'We are approaching the time when we can see the light,' Mr Roberts said.
Some 17,500 UMW workers in seven states are now on strike in a selective
programme of action over working conditions and job security.
Neither the mine operators nor the government-appointed mediator, Mr William
Usery, have commented on speculation that a settlement is close.
However, UMW members began abandoning picket lines on Tuesday in response to
a union order, heightening expectations of an announcement following
yesterday's Thanksgiving holiday.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Row looms over shipping cartels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A political row is building up between the European Commission, Parliament
and European Union ministers over controversial Commission inquiries into
shipping cartels.
The Commission and Parliament, backed by exporters, are worried that
transport ministers, who meet in Brussels on Monday, may try to meddle with
the Commission's exclusive authority to rule on competition cases.
At issue is a draft resolution on the application of competition rules to
maritime transport, which could be adopted by ministers on Monday. EU
exporters - including companies such as ICI and Mars - say the resolution is
largely the work of shipowners, trying to protect themselves from the latest
in a series of Commission investigations into shipping cartels.
The European Parliament's legal affairs committee has written to the council
of ministers warning that adoption of such a resolution could upset the
balance between the EU's institutions.
The pressure already appears to be having an effect. National officials said
yesterday that member states' enthusiasm for a prescriptive resolution was
waning, although they may still call for a Commission report on the subject.
Much will depend on how ministers react to Monday's statement by Mr Karel
Van Miert, the competition commissioner, about the maritime industry.
The shipowners said this week that all they wanted from the Commission was
greater legal certainty about the treatment of shipping conferences, in
particular those that now offer door-to-door container services, including
road haulage.
In the last two years, the Commission has aroused the wrath of shipowners by
imposing fines on two cartels operating between Europe and Africa. Brussels
is now poised to publish a statement of objections to the Trans-Atlantic
Agreement, signed last year by 14 shipping companies including P&amp;O
Containers of the UK, Hapag-Lloyd of Germany and Maersk of Denmark, and
should also take a decision on the Far East Freight Conference.
The shipping lines say the TAA is essential to combat overcapacity in the
transatlantic container market, but exporters say that it has led to
'exorbitant' rate increases in 1993. The original draft resolution tabled by
the Belgian presidency of the EU was sharply criticised by MEPs and the
Commission for going too far.

Plans for Poland's first commercial national TV channel have run into
opposition from the military which is unwilling to release the necessary
frequencies.
This emerged shortly before the closing date for applications to run the
channel to compete with the two state TV ones, which will still carry
advertising. Foreign media groups including Bertelsmann, Compagnie
Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion and Time Warner have declared an interest
in running the channel with local partners.
Adml Piotr Kolodziejczyk, defence minister, said the army would be able to
free the frequencies in three years. Frequencies available to private
broadcasters provide access to 40 per cent of Poland.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Brazil corruption inquiry is 'opportunity for democracy':
Hopes of a flushing out of the political system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an annex to the Brazilian Congress in Brasilia, government and central
bank officials have been poring over the financial records of some of the
country's leading politicians. The findings, released amid the din of a
congressional hearing, have detailed a wide network of political corruption,
led to the downfall of several senior figures and threaten many others.
There is no consensus about whether these politicians are likely to be
punished. But there is that the process is positive for Brazil's still
emerging democracy.
After the peaceful removal of ex-president Fernando Collor last year amid
separate corruption allegations, the latest scandal is seen as marking
another chance to modernise the country's political system, which emerged in
the mid-1980s from two decades of military rule.
'With democracy you learn by mistakes. After so many years of the military,
it is taking time for society to win back control of their government,' says
Mr Fernando de Hollanda Barbosa, a Rio de Janeiro-based economist.
The scandal surfaced last month when a former government official accused
nearly 30 politicians and former and acting ministers of involvement in
corruption schemes. He said those involved had received fees in return for
approving construction projects detailed in the government's budget.
A special parliamentary inquiry was set up and has unearthed payments, often
of several million dollars, in the bank accounts of some of the accused.
Although no politician has admitted wrong-doing, the affair has already
forced the resignation of Mr Henrique Hargreaves, the equivalent of a chief
of staff, and two of the most senior figures in the country's largest
political party, the PMDB. It is also likely to lead to further inquiries
into related allegations, including claims that large construction companies
paid fees to politicians in return for favours.
Among ordinary Brazilians, already cynical about their institutions after
the resignation of former president Collor and his replacement by President
Itamar Franco, the affair has led to a wave of protest. Helped by intensive
media coverage, public anger has been visible in marches organised in many
Brazilian cities to demand action.
Mr Lucia Bemquerer, a businessman in the south-eastern state of Minas
Gerais, helped organise a march to the country's capital Braslia and the
lighting of a special torch. 'The torch will burn until these people are
punished,' he says.
It may need to burn long. Constitutionally, congressmen have immunity from
prosecution for any crime unless their respective house votes to withdraw
it. This unusually wide immunity was introduced after the military period to
bolster the powers of Congress against the executive. Immunities have rarely
been lifted.
Meanwhile, the inquiry's only form of punishment is the cassacao of anyone
suspected of guilt, equivalent to the withdrawal of political rights and
immunities.
Even without congressional protection, proving money came from corrupt
sources would be difficult. For example, some of the accused claim that
money was left over from campaign contributions (though other politicians
point out that campaigns usually run up big debts rather than profits).
These difficulties have prompted suggestions that, other than the cassacao
of about 10 main suspects, the affair will blow over once the inquiry
finishes just before Christmas. For real change, some analysts argue, Brazil
needs an independent judiciary willing to prosecute. At present, Brazil's
judiciary is poorly funded and is perceived as neither independent nor
willing.
However, this view overlooks two important changes which are already taking
place. Public anger has accelerated moves in Congress to confront
long-standing problems for the first time. For example, the rules on
immunity are likely to be tightened and the lower house is already
considering lifting immunities more regularly. New regulations on regular
disclosure of assets for all members of Congress are also being proposed.
Mr Jarbas Passarinho, a respected senator and the chairman of the inquiry,
believes Congress now has the chance to show it can tackle its own problems.
'We have to convince the public that Congress is not the centre of all
Brazil's wrongs,' he says.
The scandal has also forced political parties to rethink plans on candidates
for congressional and presidential elections next year. Any politician with
links to the accused is now vulnerable to press or political attack.
This has greatly worried the PMDB, which has been most closely linked with
the allegations. Some party leaders say it will not survive the elections
intact and that some groups may break away so as not to be tainted.
At least three potential presidential candidates have been touched by the
scandal or have become targets of other allegations, such as the taking of
illegal commissions, since the inquiry began.
Although the media, middle classes and the left will increasingly demand
probity in politics, the process may take longer to take root elsewhere. For
example, a frequently heard sobriquet in Sao Paulo about one of its leading
politicians translates as 'he robs but at least he gets things done'.
Mr Nelson Jobim, a leading PMDB congressman, argues that candidates seeking
re-election will have to prove their honesty, while new candidates will have
to promise it convincingly. 'Discussion of morality will be acute in the
1994 elections,' he says.
However, a proportional representation system which strengthens regional
rather than national affiliations and a weak party system which exaggerates
the power of individuals will remain problems.
'The majority of actors will change, but the personality-types will remain
more or less the same,' Mr Jobim says.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Bulgaria reaches agreement on debt reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bulgaria has reached a comprehensive debt and debt-service agreement which
could amount to a 50 per cent cut in the estimated Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds
6.24bn) it owes to a group of over 300 commercial banks, Mr Stoyan
Alexandrov, finance minister, said in Sofia yesterday.
The agreement in principle, reached after months of difficult negotiations
with its London Club creditors headed by Deutsche Bank, includes an initial
downpayment of not more than Dollars 865m and average annual payments of
less than Dollars 300m in the first seven years of the agreement, Mr Chavdar
Kanchev, a member of the negotiating team, told Reuter.
'The agreement contemplates a menu of options consisting of a debt buyback
at a price to be announced by Bulgaria, a collateralised discount bond
option, a front-loaded interest reduction bond (FIRB) option and a
comprehensive treatment of interest arrears,' Deutsche Bank added.
The discounted bond option offers a 30-year discount bond exchanged for
existing debt at a 50 per cent discount at LIBOR plus 13/16 per cent and
with full principle and 12 months' interest collateral. The FIRB option,
with an eight-year grace period, offers an 18-year bond with a stepped-up
fixed interest rate starting at 2 per cent for the first eight years and a
floating coupon of Libor plus 13/16 per cent for the remainder, West
Merchant bank said.
The agreement, still to be approved by the Bulgarian parliament and the
boards of several creditor banks, is similar to the kind of deal being
sought by Poland for its over-Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt. But leading
creditor banks last night insisted Poland no longer qualified for the kind
of relief achieved by Bulgaria, which has a much weaker economy and a GDP
which is continuing to fall.
Poland's London Club creditors offered a 33 per cent debt relief package
earlier this year. This was rejected by the Polish side which wants a 50 per
cent reduction similar to that already achieved on its Dollars 33bn Paris
club official debt. The banks are due to meet shortly to discuss making a
revised offer to the Polish team, an improvement on the original 33 per cent
relief offer, but still well below the 50 per cent the Poles seek.

FT  26 NOV 93 / US gives warning over foreign interests in Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prospective foreign investors in Cuba have been warned by the US and by at
least one company whose assets were seized by the Cuban government that they
could face legal problems if they invest in nationalised property.
This follows recent Cuban statements that its efforts to attract foreign
investors to several sectors of the state-controlled economy are succeeding.
Jamaica's economic development agency has told the island's hoteliers that
the US government has suggested that they proceed with caution in investing
in Cuban resort properties, as many of these could be the subject of legal
proceedings in the future.
Bacardi, the world's largest rum producer, said on Wednesday that potential
investors in Cuba faced legal risks if they became involved in confiscated
property, including three breweries and a distillery which were seized from
it by the government.
The US State Department said it sent warnings periodically through
government agencies in countries from which investments in Cuba are being
made. Jamaican hoteliers have invested in Cuban properties.
'These notices have been sent not only to Caribbean countries, but also
mainly to Europe, Canada and Latin America,' said an official. 'We cannot
tell people not to invest in Cuba, but we are warning them that when the
political and economic situation in Cuba changes, the real owners of the
property will either want to recover their assets or will want what could be
a significant compensation. Some will want both.'
Mr Manuel Cutillas, president of Bacardi, has written to big distillers and
brewers in several countries, saying the three Cuban breweries were on a
list of 131 properties for which the Cuban government was seeking foreign
partners. The company's assets in Cuba were worth Dollars 70m (Pounds 47m)
when they were confiscated, he said.
'It is Bacardi's position, supported by expert legal advice, that its
confiscated assets continue to be its lawful property, and that no one who
accepts a purported conveyance of any such property from the Castro regime
will acquire good title under either Cuban or international law,' Mr
Cutillas said.
Earlier this month President Fidel Castro told foreign businessmen that
investment opportunities in Cuba were worth many billions of dollars, and
that the tourism sector alone had the potential for Dollars 20bn in new
foreign business.
He said opportunities for foreign investment in Cuba were going so fast
there would be 'not one square metre of beach' left for US companies because
of Washington's economic embargo.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Owen foresees Moslem state: Mediator warns of new EU
sanctions over Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Owen, one of the two international mediators on the former Yugoslavia,
forecast yesterday that the creation of a new independent Moslem state in
Bosnia was inevitable and that the Serbian and Croat parts of Bosnia would
eventually join their respective mother countries.
Such a solution, he admitted ruefully in the annual Churchill lecture in
London's Guildhall, was certainly one he did not favour originally in the
abortive Vance-Owen plan, which called for a unitary Bosnian state divided
into largely autonomous provinces.
Lord Owen accused the US of having killed off that plan in May this year and
thus destroying any hope of keeping Bosnia-Hercegovina together. However, he
recognised that history might show that the emergence of an independent
Moslem Bosnian republic was 'inherently more stable,' that the
demilitarisation of Bosnia proposed in the Vance-Owen plan was unrealistic
and that the Moslems' fight for their very survival required to find
expression in the creation of their own country.
Lord Owen's remarks were a clear indication of his belief that the union of
the three republics which he and his fellow mediator Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg
had proposed as a replacement for the Vance-Owen plan would be no more than
a temporary solution.
That plan was rejected by the Bosnian Moslem 'parliament' last September
because the Moslems claimed it did not give them enough territory.
European Union foreign ministers suggested earlier this week that the
international community might be prepared progressively to suspend sanctions
against Serbia if a political settlement could be reached giving the Bosnian
Moslems an additional 3 to 4 per cent of territory.
Such a possible solution will be discussed at a conference in Geneva
starting next Monday, grouping EU foreign ministers, the leaders of the
three warring parties in Bosnia and senior representatives from the US and
Russia.
Lord Owen warned the Bosnian Serb and Croat parties that, if they failed to
compromise, the European Union would have to strengthen existing sanctions
or start advocating new sanctions. At the same time he warned the Bosnian
Moslems that, if they were not prepared to accept compromises, outside
governments could reconsider their contribution to United Nations
peace-keeping forces in Bosnia, which would then have to be withdrawn.
'The parties, tragically, then would be left to fight it out with no holds
barred and the misery and mayhem of what was once Yugoslavia would
continue.'
Whatever political solution was chosen by the warring parties, certain key
Bosnian Moslem demands had to be dealt with.
A predominantly Moslem Bosnian republic had to have open access to a port on
a navigable part of the Sava river in the north and to a sea port of its own
on the navigable part of the river Neretva to the south. In addition, the
Moslems would have to be given, 'as an important symbol', a tract of land on
the Adriatic sea, and, as far as possible, natural and defendable
boundaries.
Lord Owen strongly supported the trial of Yugoslav war criminals by the
international tribunal set up by the UN. 'I believe it is essential for the
moral order of the 21st century that we re-emphasise over Yugoslavia the
rejection in the Nuremberg trials of the belief that, in war, anything
goes.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / VW in deal to reduce work time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen and the IG Metall engineering union yesterday agreed a framework
deal temporarily cutting working times in VW's six German works by 20 per
cent, but gave strikingly different views on how it would affect wages and
costs.
Mr Jurgen Peters, chief union negotiator, said the annual incomes of around
100,000 workers would be reduced by 10 per cent, while Mr Jochen Schumm,
representing VW, said the pact would cut total personnel costs by almost 20
per cent or DM1.8bn (Pounds 713m) a year.
The draft pact, which still needs much detailed work before final approval,
according to VW officials, will be presented to a meeting of the group's
supervisory board in Wolfsburg this morning.
Agreement was reached under the shadow of threats from VW that 30,000 of the
company's 100,000-plus German jobs would have to go unless cost-savings
could be reached through other means.
The settlement on a basic 28.8 hour working week would apply 'in principle'
to all 105,000 employees, a spokesman said last night.
While trade union officials saw the deal as opening the way for widespread
reductions in working hours - the union movement's favoured way of spreading
work and preventing lay-offs - economists and industrialists were sceptical.
Mr Thorsten Neufeld of the Deutsche Bank said the package would not lead to
reductions in unit labour costs necessary to restore VW's competitiveness.
Adam Opel, VW's main rival, said it was not an appropriate starting point
for restructuring the car industry.
Mr Ludwig Horatz, head of Hamburg components supplier Phoenix, said the deal
had been made possible by VW's generous pay scales which, he claimed, were
at least 20 per cent above the metal industry average. Audi, part of the VW
group, where pay rates are already 10 per cent below those at the parent,
said it was examining the idea.
Volkswagen's project is widely seen as an emergency stop-gap measure to
allow the deeply troubled company to avoid conflict with its labour force
and its principle shareholder, the Social Democrat/Green party government of
Lower Saxony.
Already committed to bailing out its Spanish subsidiary Seat with a DM1.5bn
emergency cash injection, VW would be hard-pressed to find the funds to
finance 30,000 redundancies, according to critics of the scheme.
Details so far available include withdrawal of a 3.5 per cent general pay
increase, which took effect on November 1. Christmas bonuses, holiday
payments and other perks are to be reduced and the balance will be
distributed monthly instead of in one-off sums.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Berlusconi's 'courage' makes others see black: Italian media
magnate's backing for neo-fascist candidate in Rome mayoral election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's media magnate, claims he has done no more than
follow a maxim of Tolstoy - a courageous man does what he feels is
necessary.
But what Mr Berlusconi considers 'necessary' has created a near mutiny among
his employees and provoked a storm of controversy in Italy's political and
intellectual establishment.
Mr Berlusconi, who controls three quarters of Italian commercial television
and a string of publishing interests, has decided to enter the political
fray in Italy.
Throughout this year he has been hinting he might form a political party and
appeared to be flirting with the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto
Bossi. But this week he chose the occasion of the opening of a shopping
centre in Bologna to urge the formation of a new centrist party.
Apparently off script, he went further. If he were in Rome he would back Mr
Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the neo-fascist MSI, in the run-off on
December 5 for the mayoralty against Mr Francesco Rutelli, the candidate of
the left.
This was immediately interpreted not only as an endorsement of the MSI but
as placing this party, always seen on the far right, in the centre of
Italian politics.
This produced headlines such as 'Berlusconi in black' (a reference to
Mussolini's infamous black shirts) and cartoons such as the one with a
bubble coming from Mr Berlusconi's mouth saying 'Fini-vest' (a play on
Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi's principal media group).
Accompanying such sarcasm was a flood of criticism and protest. The next
issue of Panorama, the main Berlusconi weekly, will not appear because of a
strike; a stoppage was observed on Wednesday at Mondadori, his main
publishing group, and television journalists loudly proclaimed their
independence. Some groups have threatened a boycott of his Milan football
team.
The objections to Mr Berlusconi's stance centre on two separate issues. The
first is whether someone who wields so much power, especially through
television, should take sides so openly and harbour political ambitions.
These objections are on weak grounds since media owners in Italy, discreetly
or clumsily, do support causes - indeed that is partly why they are
proprietors.
Mr Berlusconi himself has always been a political animal, and built his
empire on the back of a close friendship with Mr Bettino Craxi, the former
Socialist leader. Mr Berlusconi himself has not been implicated in the
corruption scandals but Milan magistrates are investigating whether his
media interests allowed discounted advertising slots on television to the
political parties during elections. Another investigation is examining
allegations of kick-backs to obtain television licences.
The second issue is whether the MSI is a dangerous rightist phenomenon,
foreshadowing a return to the Mussolini era. The spectre of a party,
inspired by Mussolini, gaining substantial electoral space in Italy has
frightened the left and all those with long memories. They feel Mr
Berlusconi is highly irresponsible in lending his considerable weight to
making the MSI respectable.
However, most of the criticism is based on historical memory rather than the
MSI today, led by Mr Fini, who was born in 1952 (seven years after Il Duce
was executed). The criticism also contains an element of hypocrisy since he
would have earned little odium if he had associated himself with the
leftists' candidate in Rome, Mr Rutelli.
Mr Berlusconi is unrepentant. He wrote in yesterday's newspapers: 'I'm
completely foreign to fascist culture and traditions; but I refuse to accept
the use - or worse the blackmail - of anti-fascism as a demagogic device to
steer the country away from a liberal democratic government which we and
Europe need.'
He added that if and when it was necessary he would establish a 'clear
distinction between politics and editorial control'.
By taking such a high profile, Mr Berlusconi may well encourage more of the
media to focus on the financial problems of his empire. La Repubblica
newspaper and L'Espresso magazine, controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, have
been running for some months a campaign demonstrating that the debts of
Fininvest are well above the L3,333bn (Pounds 1.3bn) published in the 1992
accounts.
They also claim that close scrutiny of the accounts reveals a L174bn loss
instead of the declared L21bn profit. This has not been denied by Fininvest.

Spain's two largest unions staged big protest marches in 50 cities yesterday

to have turned out in Madrid and nearly 60,000 in Barcelona, far higher
numbers than the protest organisers had expected. The turnout is likely to
fuel rank-and-file calls for a general strike next month, which until
yesterday had seemingly divided the union leadership.
The demonstrations were the first test of strength by the unions against
government plans to restore competitiveness by imposing wage restraints,
reducing benefits and overhauling labour market legislation to allow
part-time employment, apprenticeships and easier dismissal procedures.
The Communist-led Commissiones Obreras union has called for national
mobilisation to paralyse the country on December 17, but the rival Union
General de Trabajadores, which co-sponsored yesterday's protests, is more
hesitant, believing a full strike could prompt the government to take even
tougher economic measures. The two unions staged a successful 24-hour strike
in December 1988 that forced the government to withdraw a planned youth
employment scheme and to increase pensions and unemployment pay. A half-day
general strike last May in protest at social spending cuts was poorly
attended, however.
The government is due to meet the unions today in a last effort to salvage a
social pact on incomes policy and labour reforms under discussion since
September. But it has warned that it will impose its policies next week if
there is no agreement. The employers' confederation, which held separate
talks with the government yesterday about the social pact, termed the
proposed labour markets reforms as 'too weak'.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Germans expect exports to give economy a boost

An increasing number of German businessmen believe the economy has
stabilised at its lowest point and expect some export-led improvement in the
coming months, according to Ifo, the Munich-based economic institute.
An Ifo study, which polls 500 managers, says the business community is less
pessimistic than in previous months.
The survey lends weight to a statement by the German industry federation,
the BDI, that the economy is stabilising. The BDI points out production
plans and orders stopped falling at the beginning of summer and capacity
utilisation was dropping 'very mildly' compared with the beginning of the
year.
Ifo notes that companies do not expect a pick-up in domestic demand but that
export prospects are 'substantially improving.' Companies in general say
orders in October held steady against September.
The business community continues to complain that stocks are too high. But
they add that prices could fall further as a result.
The brighter outlook varies from sector to sector. Manufacturers of
semi-finished goods say the situation remains bad but an export-led pick-up
is foreseeable over the next six months - a view shared by the chemical
industry. But manufacturers of consumer goods, especially cars and
electronics, warn that orders will still not match the September level
although they are decreasing at a slower pace than earlier.
Wholesale and retail traders hit by depressed domestic demand are
pessimistic. Over 40 per cent of wholesalers say they expect orders to fall,
the worst result polled by the institute since 1982.
In eastern Germany, business confidence is up, mostly because of a rise in
local demand. Capacity utilisation is stabilising at 72 per cent.

Pilots and stewards at the French domestic airline Air Inter launched a
surprise strike yesterday, union and company officials said, Reuter reports
from Paris.
The strike, which began at 2pm was expected to continue until midnight,
delaying flights. It was the latest protest against the government's plans
to open up the airline, a subsidiary of state-owned carrier Air France, to
foreign competition. A two-week strike last month cost Air France about
FFr1bn (Pounds 114.28m).

FT  26 NOV 93 / Chemical industry close to pact on cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's petrochemicals industry is close to agreeing rationalisation plans
aimed at reducing losses running at hundreds of millions of dollars a month.
The Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe (APPE) yesterday
revealed its members had failed to agree plans to cut ethylene capacity by
at least 1.5m tonnes a year. However, most petrochemicals groups were
optimistic the complex plan would be approved next month. The APPE is
scheduled to meet on December 17 .
Chemical company shares responded favourably to the news. Imperial Chemical
Industries shares rose 45p to 719p, while shares in DSM of the Netherlands
increased Fl 4 to Fl 102.2.
It is understood 25 APPE members voted, with 20 in favour, three against and
two abstentions. Those hostile to the proposals, which involve setting up an
industry fund worth about DM550m (Pounds 217m) to help close capacity, are
believed to be producers that have already shut plants and have efficient
complexes. Some believe more capacity needs to be taken out. During the
early 1980s more than 4m tonnes was shut down.
Legal and technical details of the APPE plan also remain to be settled. The
European Commission would have to approve any plan.
The European industry is dogged by over-capacity. Next year it will have
capacity to manufacture 19.34m tonnes of ethylene, against expected demand
of 15.58m tonnes, according to Trichem consultants, the London-based
industry specialists.
The company believes all European manufacturers of derivatives such as PVC
and polyethylene have failed to cover their cash costs this year, let alone
cover depreciation.
The plan involves setting up an industry-financed restructuring fund.
Companies would bid for funds in exchange for closing down capacity.
Analysts were divided about the impact of the plan yesterday. S G Warburg
said the move was a turning point for the industry and would improve
earnings considerably.
Others were more doubtful, saying the plan had yet to be agreed and would
still require approval from competition authorities. They also said
over-capacity was a worldwide problem and that Middle East and US
petrochemicals manufacturers had a considerable cost advantage over European
producers.

A new breed of successful businessmen is using financial clout to win a
political voice, writes Chrystia Freeland in Moscow. Typical is Mr Rafis
Kadyrov, a 37-year-old banker running for the Russian parliament and the
presidency of the tiny autonomous republic of Bashkortostan.
Yesterday, he promised an increase in the wealth of the republic's citizens
from Dollars 250 to Dollars 250,000 over the next four years. His model may
have been Mr Kirsan Iliumzhinov, a businessman who last spring was elected
president of Kalmykia, another autonomous republic, after promising to pay
each citizen Dollars 100 out of his own pocket.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: Media build an even balance from 13
blocs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian election campaign, it is already clear, will not be fair.
However, unlike the 'elections' of the Soviet days, where fairness had
nothing to do with it, they will be unfair in a recognisably democratic way,
with money, personalities, image, showbiz, and arm-twisting taking place
against a backdrop of state-defined rules.
The technical requirements for the registration of parties and candidates
for the two houses of the new parliament - the federal assembly - have been
completed, and have thrown up 13 blocs and more than 600 candidates covering
a range of views from neo-liberal to Communist and neo-imperialist right. In
one republic - Chechnya - elections will probably not take place at all and
in another - Tatarstan - insufficient candidates have registered for the
upper house.
The key questions now are the overall political context within which the
elections take place, and, crucially, the coverage given to the parties and
candidates by the media.
President Boris Yeltsin is presently the only source of legitimate power in
Russia: government is carried on through decrees he issues and though the
government he has chosen. He has not, and may not, declare his support for
any party.
The main reformist parties are all linked to, or enjoy the support of,
groups of enterprises and banks. This is quite overt: businessmen and
industrialists appear on party slates and/or sit beside leading candidates
at press conferences. Their backing allows the parties to run the campaigns
and pay for media coverage: under the election rules, donations from each
enterprise are limited to a maximum of 20,000-times the minimum wage to
parties and 200-times the minimum wage to an individual candidate. However,
the scrutiny of these donations is lax, and will, anyway, not take place
until after the event.
Further, the linkage of money and campaigning looks improper. Mr Yegor
Gaidar, first deputy prime minister but also leader of the main radical
bloc, Choice of Russia, held a meeting last week with the heads of Russia's
commercial banks - during which he promised them protection from foreign
competition, a promise which quickly took the form of a presidential decree.
They met in his party headquarters, not his office. Did they promise support
for the party? Had they already given it? The site of the meeting pointed to
these questions.
Most of the curbs on the central press have now been removed: censorship
appeared only briefly after the suppression of the parliamentary revolt, and
the daily newspaper which is still banned, Sovyetskaya Rossiya, won a court
judgement against the ban earlier this week. While the most prestigious
daily, Izvestiya, is pro-presidential and supports Mr Gaidar's movement,
other papers - such as Pravda - are strongly critical. The liberal daily
Nezavisimaya Gazeta is waspish about Mr Yeltsin and about the government.
Television is - as everywhere - the dominant medium. The rules of the game,
drawn up with some advice from the British Broadcasting Corporation,
specified that parties could buy TV time up to November 22, when the
campaign proper began: thereafter, each of the 13 competing blocs was
allocated equal time on the two main national channels, dolled out in
20-minute segments, with the times of appearance determined by drawing lots.
The party political broadcasts are wholly fascinating. At one end, they are
fairly slick: Choice of Russia, with a professional, well-staffed central
election staff, produced earlier this week a 20-minute show which mixed
clips from a concert with a smart Mr Gaidar. Other parties have simply
pushed their candidates in front of cameras.
The marvellous amateurism is gold dust to anyone attuned to the banalities
of western party politicals.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: Search for recipe to turn tanks to
sausage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's Choice, the pro-Yeltsin bloc that began by dominating the economic
agenda of the election campaign, is having to bend to meet the political
limits to reform.
'Any government which allows 80 per cent of industry to go bankrupt won't
even have time to complete financial stabilisation because it will be
immediately thrown out of office,' says Mr Denis Kisilyov, a Russian
economist at the World Bank office in Moscow.
As the parties competing for pro-reform voters have increased their promises
of ways to kick-start economic growth without a financial squeeze that will
throw millions out of work, Russia's Choice is having to respond with a
softening of its own programme.
It is still promising radical land reform, an elimination of most subsidies
and further liberalisation of foreign trade, but it is having to fudge the
issue of how much unemployment it is prepared to countenance as a result of
its promised financial austerity.
Russian output is expected to decline this year by 16 per cent, slowing just
a little from an 18.8 per cent fall in 1992. Incorporating an increase in
exports and the trading sector, only gross national product is expected to
decline somewhat more slowly than last year.
When the deputy prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia's
Choice, launched market reforms in January last year with a liberalisation
of prices and imports, he hoped that state-owned enterprises would
automatically adapt to market conditions, loss-makers would go to the wall,
and both inflation and output would stabilise. This in turn would pave the
way for new investment and the creation of new businesses.
But today, with inflation at 20 per cent a month, and production still
falling, the radicals say the problem is they never achieved a tough
financial policy in the first place.
If allowed to pursue what Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, described
yesterday as 'a painful but absolutely necessary transformation', Russia's
Choice is promising to bring inflation down to 4-5 per cent a month by the
end of 1994.
But the consensus uniting Mr Gaidar's critics, including the Party of Unity
and Accord, set up by three rebel pro-reform ministers, is that inflation
cannot be fought through a restrictive financial policy alone. They say the
very structure of an economy geared towards defence production, with
obsolete technology and very little competition, means that the state must
play a much more active role in restructuring the economy.
'When people go to the shops, they want to buy sausage, not tanks,' says
Prof Nikolai Petrakov, a parliamentary candidate for the electoral bloc
headed by his fellow-economist, Mr Grigory Yavlinsky. 'We are having to
repent for this unnatural economic system built up by the Communists . . .
.It is not enough to allow private farming. Farmers need roads and
equipment.'
They say that mass unemployment would simply cause a popular backlash which
would bring communists or neo-fascists into power. Mr Arkady Volsky, the
leader of Civic Union, the most conservative of the pro-reform parties, is
even continuing to cite China as an example of the merits of gradual reform
and increased state control over the economy. The only problem is that
Russia is dominated by obsolete heavy industry rather than agriculture, and
has a democracy instead of a one-party state. But elements of the new
critique have rubbed off on Russia's Choice, and are likely to be reflected
in the economic policies pursued after the elections.
For instance, the prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is likely to
remain in his post as the most suitable compromise figure for both
conservative and radical reformers, said this week that 'no government'
would allow mass unemployment. Russia's Choice is downplaying the
unemployment issue, with Mr Gaidar claiming that allowing enterprises to go
bankrupt would in most cases mean reorganising them rather than closing them
down.
Mr Gaidar still differs from other politicians in that he remains keen to
cut back the state's role on the grounds that Russian bureaucrats are
incapable of running a market economy. But there is another point he has
already embraced, and that is calls for increased protection for Russian
producers and entrepreneurs against foreign competition.
Last week he agreed to restrict the activities of foreign banks. He also
categorically denied any plans to break up big enterprises such as Gasprom,
the country's monopoly gas-producer, despite hopes by the World Bank he
would endorse such proposals. Finally, he promised to use import tariffs to
defend Russian producers.
Calls by Civic Union and the smaller Democratic party for the creation of
large financial-industrial groups capable of withstanding international
competition have already been taken over by the government. A presidential
decree allowing for their creation is to be published soon.
Efforts will also continue to restore trading ties with former Soviet
republics - a natural market for Russian companies after seven decades of
state planning interlocked their economies.
Another target for changes is likely to be the government's mass
privatisation programme.
Even Mr Sergei Vasiliev, one of the main economic ideologues for Russia's
Choice, admitted yesterday that the programme was imperfect. But he said its
flaws, including big benefits given to employees, and the distribution of
shares for vouchers instead of money, had been the result of necessary
compromises with conservatives.
Finally Mr Chernomyrdin, who has refused to explicitly endorse any of the
parties, echoed the promises being made by all parties, that economic
reforms would be accompanied by better social protection for Russians.
'If, like Gaidar, you tell an ambulance driver that all he is ever going to
earn is Rbs30,000 (Pounds 20) a month, then he will cast his vote for the
Communists,' claims Prof Petrakov, the economist and candidate.
The unspoken conclusion of this consensus is that Russia will have to live
with high inflation for some years to come, albeit avoiding Ukrainian-style
hyperinflation, while looking for ways of promoting investment in
enterprises which can produce sellable goods.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: Voters fed Bolshevik slogan of bread
and peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'Bread, peace and land' is the 1917 slogan that won the Bolsheviks a 74-year
hold on power. Today, it is being echoed in the contest for the new
parliament, to be elected on December 12. For bread, read standard of living
 -bread prices now reflect the cost of production, as do most foods and
commodities. And real incomes, which rose by 10 per cent from January to
September this year compared with last, have stagnated since.
The number of people with incomes below the subsistence minimum, or upper
poverty line, hovers around 45 per cent - down on last year's peak of 64 per
cent, but still very high.
And the gap is widening between the rich - being the 20 per cent of the
population who receive 43 per cent of total income - and the poor - the 20
per cent who receive 7 per cent of income. As a result, the 'feelgood'
factor is slender, and the ordinary voter has a constant and consuming
interest in the cost of living.
It is a tribute to the relative success of policies of the last two years
that few groups are overtly calling for restoration of subsidies. Instead,
they are focusing on the need for a rise in state pensions and wages,
student stipends, and sickness and invalidity benefit.
One political group - the Dignity and Charity bloc - is devoted solely to
the interests of pensioners and invalids. All Others nod towards the
alleviation of their poverty. If peace is widely defined to include personal
security (with the Bolsheviks it was an end to the war) then it, too, is an
important election issue. Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic party
called it 'the first issue in our campaign' in his election broadcast on
Tuesday evening, while the candidates of the the far-right Liberal Democrats
say that 'we will restore order - by peaceful means, of course'. The growing
gap in incomes - with the conspicuously rich, Mercedes-driving class now
visible in most cities - is fuelling calls for a crackdown on corruption and
organised crime as much as on the soaring rise in general crime.
Real war also features - as candidates, especially the Communists, conjure
up ethnic struggles in the Caucasus and Central Asia to hammer home their
point that the collapse of the Soviet Union, provoked by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and leading members of his current government, has been a
disaster for Russia in lost prestige as much as in lost production. Fearful
that patriotism may become the sole preserve of the far right and left, Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, the liberally-inclined foreign minister who is standing in
Murmansk, has been taking a hard line in recent weeks - threatening Armenia
with intervention if it does not apologise for an attack on a Russian
diplomat and Ukraine with sanctions if it does not return its nuclear
missiles to Russia.
Land features in all the blocs' rhetoric and programmes. A presidential
decree allowing the free purchase and sale of land was signed last month and
all parties have had to take a position on it. The majority supports it with
reservations. Even the Communists and the Agrarians, the twin defenders of
socialist ownership, feel impelled to say that they are not against the free
possession of land, just its purchase and sale. On the issue of the
privatisation of enterprises, the reform consensus also appears to have won
the day. No party flatly advocates a return to state ownership, although the
Communists and Agrarians, with the Liberal Democrats and the Dignity and
Charity group, clearly favour the state.
The pull of electoral politics is presently towards the centre: the
neo-fascists (Liberal Democrats) and the Communists emphasise their peaceful
intent; while the radical liberals (Russia's Choice) play up their
patriotism. Parties and electorates are new to each other in the new Russia:
but for the moment, they can both say that we are all centrists now.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL REFORMERS
Russia's Choice
Led by first deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar
Bloc of pro-government Yeltsin supporters, consisting of several parties and
movements, including Democratic Russia, the Peasants' Party of Russia, the
Association of Privatised and Private Enterpreneurs, and the Party of
Democratic Initiative. Considerably ahead in all polling, at between 20 and
30 per cent of the vote.
SLOWER REFORM
YABLOKO BLOC
Led by Grigory Yavlinsky, young free-market economist.
Without an official name, the bloc has been nicknamed Yabloko (Apple), as a
pun on the acronym of the names of its leaders: Grigory Yavlinsky, Yuri
Boldyrev, scientist, and Vladimir Lukin, former Russian ambassador to the
US. It promises less painful, but more effective market reforms and a real
stake for the regions in the federal state.
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORMS
Led by Mayor Anatoly Sobchak of St. Petersburg
This bloc, also led by Gavriil Popov, former mayor of Moscow, is pro-reform,
but stresses political independence from Yeltsin. It is calling for higher
education for all, the protection of low incomes and pensions from
inflation, and a wider distribution of privately owned land.
PARTY OF RUSSIAN UNITY AND ACCORD
Led by Deputy Premier Sergei Shakhrai.
Pushing a strong regional role, it favours a more gradual approach to
economic reform. The bloc includes two deputy prime ministers, Sergei
Shakhrai and Alexander Shokhin, as well as Konstantin Zatulin, the head of
Entrepreneurs for a New Russia.
CENTRIST
Civic Union for Stabilisation, Justice and Progress
Led by Arkady Volsky, industrialist.
Dominated by its core group, the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, the bloc favours a more moderate approach to market reform to
protect the interests of big industries. It is calling for tax rises for the
rich, subsidies to be redirected from producers to consumers and incentives
on landowners to use land effectively.
FUTURE OF RUSSIA - NEW NAMES
Led by Vyacheslav Lashchevsky.
Most of the leaders of this youth movement come from the Russian Union of
Youth, itself heir to the Komsomol of Soviet times. It stands for
step-by-step adoption of the market system, higher wages for state
employees, a 'reasonable and equitable' tax system, a cut in the government
apparatus and higher domestic and foreign investment.
DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF RUSSIA
Led by Nikolai Travkin.
The party favours moderate reform, including privatisation of land. It is,
however, emphatic about the need to strengthen Russian statehood, and on the
need for a strong central power. Consistently populist, it is stressing
practical politics in the localities.
AGAINST REFORM
Russian Agrarian Party
Led by Mikhail Lapshin
Conservative, nationalist, and in favour of collective and state farming, it
says it also supports private farmers and private land ownership, with
restrictions. It promises 'renewal of Russia through renewal of the
village', and expects strong support from rural areas in southern Russia.
Its best-known candidate is Alexander Zaveryukha, deputy prime minister
responsible for developing agriculture.
RUSSIAN COMMUNIST PARTY
Led by Gennady Zyuganov.
The party, which favours a command economy and strong social programmes,
still draws strong support from pensioners, peasants, and the poor. It is
urging voters to reject the new Russian constitution on the basis that it
gives Yeltsin far too much power.
LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY
Led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Flamboyantly nationalist, with right-wing views, Vladimir Zhirinovsky once
promised to reconquer all former Soviet republics and use some of them as
nuclear dumping sites. His party campaigns under the slogan 'I will protect
Russians everywhere'.
ISSUE PARTIES
Women of Russia
Led by Alvetina Fedulova
First of its kind in Russia, the party aims to promote female influence in
politics and defend women's interests. It includes entrepreneurs, women in
the Black Sea Fleet, and Yekaterina Lakova, adviser to Yeltsin on womens'
issues.
KEDR, THE CONSTRUCTIVE ECOLOGICAL MOVEMENT
Led by Anatoliy Panfilov
The movement is calling for serious approaches to the solution of
environmental problems, and draws its strongest support from high-pollution
regions such as Bashkortostan, Voronezh and Yekaterinburg and the Republic
of Mari-El.
DIGNITY AND CHARITY ALLIANCE
Led by co-chairmans, Mikhail Trunov and Vyachelsav Grishin
A party for the 'small boats in a large river, which in the turbulent stream
of today's life, are unable to find a mooring,' according to its leader.
Those include invalids groups, afghan veterans, and cultural figures.

THE VOTE AND THE VOTERS
Some 107m voters will take part in the elections and in the parallel
referendum on the constitution.
The Federal Assembly, or new parliament has two chambers. The Federation
Council, or upper house has 178 seats, two for each of the 89 subjects of
the Russian federation - which includes republics, regions, districts and
the two major cities of Moscow and St Petersburg. At present, three
'subjects' - the republics of Chechnya and Tatarstan and the region of
Chelyabinsk - have failed to put forward sufficient candidates for a contest
for these two seats. The Central Electoral Commission has registered 487
candidates for the upper house.
The State Duma, or lower house, has 450 seats, half of which will be filled
by candidates from the 13 parties running in the elections. Each party must
receive more than 5 per cent  of the vote to gain a share of the seats.
The other half of the Duma's seats are filled by a first-past-the-post
contest in constituencies of about 500,000 electors. There are 1,566
candidates for these seats. are
In all parliamentary elections, at least 25 per cent of the electorate must
turn out for the votes to be valid. The new parliament must meet a month
after its election: the provisional date is January 11, 1994.
The constitutional question is simply: 'Do you agree to the constitution of
the Russian Federation?' Here, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent and
the constitution is approved if a simple majority of these votes yes.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: Yeltsin invites about 1,000 observers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to 1,000 international observers are expected to descend upon Russia to
monitor the conduct of the elections, at the invitation of President Boris
Yeltsin, writes Leyla Boulton.
There will be large delegations from western governments and international
bodies such as the Council of Europe. There will also be a single monitor
from the Caribbean island of Antigua.
Russia's Central Electoral Commission, which is organising the elections and
accrediting the observers, says most will arrive a week before polling.
However, some of them, such as envoys from the Dusseldorf-based European
Media Institute, are already on the ground to monitor not the conduct of the
voting itself but the media coverage which will help determine how people
vote.
Mr Andrei Davidov, head of the commission's international department, says
the observers will be free to travel wherever they wish. 'We want to hear
what was good and what was bad so we can do even better next time,' he says.
'After all, these elections will not be the last.'

FT  26 NOV 93 / Top SIB official to head retail finance watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulatory body for
retail financial services, has appointed Ms Colette Bowe, a top official at
the City's main watchdog, as its chief executive.
Ms Bowe has been group director in charge of retail markets at the
Securities and Investments Board since 1991 and has been responsible for
communicating the new tougher stance towards the insurance industry set out
by SIB chairman Mr Andrew Large.
Mr Large has made the creation of the PIA a centrepiece of his plan to
improve the effectiveness of the two-tier system of self-regulation as set
out by the Financial Services Act. Mr Large has said the PIA must also
demonstrably improve the quality of retail investor protection and has set
tougher, sometimes controversial standards its members will have to meet.
In September, the former chairman of the PIA, Sir Gordon Downey, resigned
abruptly and was replaced by SIB board member Mr Joe Palmer. Sir Gordon had
been criticised for failing to move swiftly enough to include Mr Large's
reforms in a proposed prospectus and for failing to appoint a chief
executive.
Regulators feared that the authority's board had been plagued by
in-fighting, delaying the completion of its proposed rulebook.
Ms Bowe, who came to prominence during the Westland helicopter affair in
1986 when she was principal information officer at the Department of Trade
and Industry, said she intended to have the PIA running by summer of 1994.
'My aim, with the support of my colleagues, will be to deliver a high
standard of investor protection, through a cost-effective regulator,' she
said. The main goal for the PIA would be to attract a 'critical mass' of
firms applying for membership.
The SIB has no power to force firms to join a particular self-regulatory
body and there has been concern that too few firms will seek to join the new
body. In particular, some members of Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for
independent financial advisers, have expressed unhappiness about some
aspects of the tough new regime, particularly a requirement for them to have
minimum capital of Pounds 10,000.
In addition, the life insurance industry has said it will not join unless
the banks and building societies which sell life insurance, most of which
are currently regulated directly by the SIB, join as well.
Mr Lawrence Churchill, chief executive of NatWest Life, said he was
'delighted' by the appointment. 'She is well suited to maintain the
communication with the SIB,' he said.
However, NatWest Life 'will have to take a look at the prospectus when it is
issued and make a judgment about whether to join', he said.

FT  26 NOV 93 / BAe in deal to develop Indonesian car industry: Joint
venture on regional aircraft to be considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is seeking to take a leading role in the development of
indigenous aircraft and car industries in Indonesia in one of the
fastest-growing regions of the world.
Rover group, BAe's motor vehicles subsidiary, has signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Indonesian government to lead the development of a
national car project to design, develop and manufacture a small car for
production in Indonesia.
BAe also agreed yesterday to consider forming a joint venture to develop and
manufacture regional turbopropeller aircraft with the Indonesian state-owned
aerospace company PT Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN).
With a population of almost 194m and an economy forecast to grow at more
than 6 per cent a year in 1993 and 1994, Indonesia has long had ambitions to
develop its car and aerospace sectors as part of the rapid industrialisation
of south-east Asia.
BAe said yesterday it had signed the two agreements after meetings in London
with Dr Bacharrudin Habibie, the Indonesian minister for research and
technology and chairman both of the Indonesian Agency for Strategic
Industries and of IPTN.
According to the motor industry memorandum, Rover will provide technology
transfer and technical support to a joint small car programme.
The car would be sold initially in the home market but subsequently would
also be aimed at export markets. Production volumes would be up to 50,000 a
year with output probably starting in 1996-97.
It is understood that the car would be based on the chassis platform of the
present Metro/Rover 100 and would be powered by Rover's 1.1 litre K-Series
engine.
In the early stages of the project Rover would supply mechanical components
such as engines and gearboxes but the company said the ultimate aim was for
the car to be completely manufactured in Indonesia.
Rover would not take any equity stake in the project, and the strategic
industries agency would be responsible for the financing, said the UK
carmaker.
Rover will head a group of five British companies developing the car jointly
with the Indonesians, including T&amp;N, the engine components group; IAD, the
automotive design and engineering consultancy; Mira, the automotive testing
facility, and Inchcape, the international trading and motor retailing group,
which is one of the leading independent car importer/distributors in Asia.
Indonesia's plan for an indigenous car industry follows the success of
neighbouring Malaysia in developing a national car, the Proton Saga, based
on technology from Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. Indonesia is one of BAe's
biggest customers and is its second biggest overseas military export market
after Saudi Arabia.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Motorway charges put on hold until after election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has decided to press ahead with its long-term plan for
electronic charging of motorway users, but ruled out proposals for an
interim system of permits to finance maintenance improvements on the
motorway network.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is expected to announce before
Christmas that there will be no charges for motorway users this side of the
general election due by 1997. But his cabinet colleagues have given him the
go-ahead to develop a scheme for electronic road tolls - based on
computerised recorders or tags in cars and lorries - which could be
operational by 1998, a year or so after the last date for the election.
The transport department's wrangle with the Treasury over whether money
raised through the road charges should be committed in full to spending on
the network is unresolved. Treasury ministers remain strongly opposed to
this direct hypothecation of revenue from user charges.
With the Pounds 19bn road-building programme one of the main targets of the
government's public spending squeeze, Mr MacGregor floated the idea, in a
consultation paper during the summer, of charging for monthly or yearly
motorway permits.
The roads programme will be one of the main victims of the spending cuts in
next Tuesday's Budget, although Mr MacGregor has won a firm commitment from
the Treasury to fill some of the resulting gap through privately-financed
schemes.
The government's green paper on road pricing suggested a permit system could
bridge the gap before the technology which is under development is
sufficiently advanced to introduce electronic pricing.
Ministers said the government could introduce a scheme similar to
Switzerland's vignette system - under which motorists display a permit
bought from post offices or petrol stations - by 1996. But Mr MacGregor
intends to announce within the next few weeks that the government has
decided the idea is unworkable. He has rejected it for political and
practical reasons.
On one level ministers decided that it would be foolish to introduce any
charges before the next general election. On another they concluded that the
flat-rate charges implied by permits would alienate many traditional
Conservative party supporters in rural or semi-rural areas who use sections
of the motorway for relatively short journeys. The practical difficulties
include the fact that the cost of permits would bear no relation to use or
to the timing of journeys.
Once they had bought a permit motorists could increase their use of
motorways to get the most from the cost. A flat-rate charge would also
provide no incentive for drivers to travel offpeak.
By contrast electronic pricing would provide the flexibility to vary charges
for length and timing and charges would be on a strictly pay-as-go basis.

FT  26 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: Industry may avoid main burden of
Budget tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke offered a clear hint yesterday that the burden of
tax increases in next Tuesday's Budget would fall on consumers rather than
industry. In Whitehall there was speculation that he would seek to soften
the impact on the construction industry of government spending cuts by
setting firm targets for privately-financed infrastructure projects.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Oil prices hit five-year low as Opec fails to agree output
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices dropped to their lowest point in five years yesterday as the
markets reacted with disappointment to Opec's failure to reach agreement on
production cuts.
The benchmark Brent crude price fell nearly Dollars 1 in early trading to
Dollars 14.18 on the overnight news from the oil cartel's headquarters in
Vienna, although it recovered slightly to close at Dollars 14.56. The
Dollars 14.18 price was its lowest point since autumn 1988 when Opec
overproduction sent prices into decline.
Opec members dispersed yesterday after failing late the previous evening to
agree on a new production ceiling. This was despite the steady fall in the
oil price since the last Opec ministerial meeting in September. A communique
said that the September output ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day was
'reasonable and objective' and should be given time to work.
Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at stockbrokers Smith Barney in
London, described the market reaction as 'a vehement backlash to Opec's
indecision', which raised questions as to whether Opec wished to remain a
cartel.
Mr Mehdi Varzi, research director at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London,
called the Opec decision a 'disaster' and said it could lead to a price
collapse similar to one in 1986, when prices fell below Dollars 10 a barrel.
He said Opec was 'suffering from an absence of leadership' and persistently
low prices would force ministers to return to an emergency session well
before their next scheduled conference at the end of March.
Most ministers who left the Vienna conference refused to be drawn on what
they might do if faced with a prolonged period of low oil prices.
Mr Ali Ahmad Al-Baghli, the Kuwaiti minister, said he 'hoped the
fundamentals would rectify the situation', although he suggested that some
Opec producers which are close to their capacity might make voluntary
production cuts. He did not name specific countries.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (6): The head-office factor /
Tracing the financial services' rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest single influence on the Gloucestershire economy during the 1980s
was the huge rise in jobs in banking, insurance and financial services.
The increase, between 1987 and 1989 alone, was almost 12,000, taking
employment in the county to over 26,000, as indigenous companies expanded
and others relocated, driven away from the London area by high rents, labour
costs and the difficulties of recruitment.
By 1991, the recession had already cost some 2,000 of those jobs as the
industry, as elsewhere in the UK, retrenched. The question is whether the
sector, which is concentrated on Cheltenham and Gloucester, can now
stabilise as a significant, although second-tier, regional centre.
If the community was restricted to a 'back office' function, then
computerisation would mean future employment prospects were poor. In fact,
the county has a good share of head offices, some of which are long
established, and which should be able to continue to attract senior staff.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, the UK's sixth largest, has always
been based in the county, as has the much smaller society, Stroud &amp; Swindon,
which has 25 branches. Chelsea building society, with 50 branches, set up
its headquarters 20 years ago at Thirlestaine Hall, a Victorian mansion in
Cheltenham, and extended it in 1987. Endsleigh, the insurance company which
this season started sponsorship of the football league, moved to the town
from London 20 years ago.
Northern Star Insurance, the Italian-owned general insurer, moved from
Croydon to Gloucester 10 years ago and has expanded to over 350 staff
locally. Ecclesiastical Insurance is also based there. Another headquarters
is that of the Canadian-owned Laurentian Financial Group, which moved from
Guildford in 1986 to set up shop at Barnswood, on the city's outskirts.
(Also at Barnswood is one of the main computer centres of Barclays Bank.)
In Cheltenham, there is Royal Bank Leasing and Mercantile &amp; General
Reinsurance, which moved much of its operations there 20 years ago. Although
its headquarters remains in London, it has more staff based in Cheltenham,
nearly 400. There was, however, a reassessment of group staffing levels last
year, which led to about 50 local redundancies.
The most important relocation has been by Eagle Star, the BAT Industries
subsidiary. Last year it joined its life subsidiary in Cheltenham by moving
its head office and general insurance business from London to a new 170,000
sq ft building at Bishop's Cleeve, just outside the town. The group employs
3,000 people locally.
Mr John Bishop, chairman of Eagle Star, which worldwide has Pounds 12bn of
funds under management, says the relocation was initiated by the need to
expand and the difficulties of finding a large enough building in London
(the move was accelerated by IRA bomb damage to its existing City offices.)
Mr Bishop - whose office now overlooks a parkland of sheep - says of any
disadvantages of being out of London: 'There is none at all as far as Eagle
Star is concerned.' He points out that many insurance companies are now
based outside the capital. 'We are a national company that happens to be
based in Cheltenham.'
The company, he says, has been able to improve its efficiency. 'We are able
to operate as an entity, and the whole thing works much better. We have our
costs under control. We are convinced that, in the long term, this was the
right thing to do, with real economies by being here and being able to
operate in the way we do, and which will stand Eagle Star in good stead in
the future.'
Mr Bishop sees no reason why the county should not continue to attract
financial services companies. 'If I were in London looking for somewhere to
come, this region would be high on my list.'
The Eagle Star Life subsidiary moved its own headquarters in 1968 to
Cheltenham, where its 13-storey tower block, now being refurbished, is the
most prominent landmark. The head office has moved this year to a building
with a facade more in keeping with the town's architecture.
'I can think of very few disadvantages to being in Cheltenham, and the
quality of life is very good,' says Mr Ian Owen, Eagle Star Life's managing
director. 'There is good access, good employment, good schools and rents are
cheaper than in London.'
Other than Eagle Star, the last sizeable relocation was that of the Bank of
England's registrars department, which completed a move from the City of
London in 1991. It occupies a Pounds 13m building of nearly 130,000 sq ft in
Gloucester, where it employs 380 people, most of them recruited locally.
The Bank decided, in 1987, to move the department on cost grounds. It needed
a large building at a lower cost than could be found at that time in the
London region, but needed to stay within reach of the City, because of the
physical exchange of paper - its main function is the registration of
gilt-edged securities. It concluded that Gloucester fitted the bill.
One important factor in the future will be how support services develop to
give the local sector more depth and range of employment. One new company is
Marlborough Stirling, in Cheltenham, set up in 1988 to sell tailor-made
software and business solutions for the sector. It has grown rapidly to over
90 staff, and its clients include some of the leading companies within and
outside the county. Mr Huw Evans, its managing director, sees 'enormous
scope' for further growth.
As a regional centre, a limiting factor is the proximity of the larger
financial communities of Bristol and Birmingham, and the big companies tend
to retain London-based auditors, law firms and advertising agencies. KPMG
Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, closed its Cheltenham office this year,
although Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Grant Thornton keep offices in Gloucester. 'A
local presence is important, because the Gloucester office has its own
expertise,' says Mr Nicholas Houghton-Brown, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Mr Darryl Whitehead, Grant Thornton's managing partner in Gloucester, says:
'Relative to the indigenous work, the indigenous professionals can handle it
very well.' A leading Gloucestershire-based accountancy firm is Hazelwoods.
Even in the present climate, investment has not ceased in the county.
Endsleigh, which employs 350 people on seven sites around Cheltenham, has
just bought a 28-acre site on the outskirts where it plans to consolidate.
'It is a statement of our commitment to Gloucestershire as the future focal
point of the company,' says Mr Stuart Wartalski, of Endsleigh.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Taipei eases foreign investment curbs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan yesterday announced a package of reforms easing curbs on foreign
investment in its financial markets to accompany the island's bid to join
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Reuter reports from Taipei.
All curbs on remittances of capital gains and principal out of Taiwan by
foreign investors in the island's securities markets would be removed, the
finance ministry said. Foreign investors would have nine months after
initial approval to bring funds into Taiwan, up from six months at present.
The 10 per cent ceiling on combined foreign investment in any individual
stock, and a 5 per cent ceiling on investment by a single foreign
institution, would both be raised. An official said the first ceiling would
be raised to 20-30 per cent, and the second to 10-15 per cent.
The ministry planned to abolish all curbs on foreign investment in
securities houses, insurance firms and investment companies. The reforms
'will open our markets, helping us to join Gatt and speeding our development
into a regional financial centre,' the ministry added.
All relevant government agencies had agreed to the reforms, which still
needed the approval of the cabinet and in some cases parliament. No schedule
was set. Foreign fund managers welcomed the reforms. Curbs on fund
remittances, such as a rule that capital gains can only be remitted out once
a year, have helped deter inflows of foreign equity investment funds,
totalling Dollars 1.86bn (Pounds 1.24bn) since 1991.

FT  26 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) World Stock Markets: French equities falter in
uncertain trading - Prospects for the Paris bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 27th November 1993) appended to this article.
Even Mr Edmond Alphandery, the ascetic economy minister, could scarcely
conceal his glee yesterday when he announced that the public part of the
FFr13bn sale of shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the second company to be sold in
France's privatisation drive, had been heavily over-subscribed.
The Economy Ministry is today expected to report that the institutional part
of the Rhone-Poulenc sale has also been comfortably over-subscribed.
The timing could scarcely be better. The successful sale of Rhone-Poulenc
not only sets an encouraging precedent for the next round of privatisations,
scheduled for next year, but comes at a propitious moment when the Paris
stock market seems to be flagging.
The CAC-40 index, which soared to record levels during the summer and early
autumn, has faltered recently on concern about the outcome of the Gatt
negotiations, the Balladur government's cautious approach to cutting
interest rates and the recent spate of industrial unrest in France.
'There is a great deal of uncertainty about the prospects for the market,'
said Mr David Harrington, of James Capel's Paris office. 'The fundamentals
are still strong, but investors are likely to remain nervous until the Gatt
issue has been resolved and there is clear evidence of further falls in
interest rates'.
Once these problems have been addressed, most analysts and economists expect
the market to return to growth. Mr Didier Cherpitel, managing director of
Morgan Stanley in Paris, predicts that the CAC-40 will rise to a new record
of 2,500 next year.
'We are rather optimistic,' he admitted. 'But the economic environment does
look encouraging. If Germany comes out of recession, interest rates could
fall steadily in France and Germany, and that would be a big boost to the
stock market'.
Other observers take a slightly less rosy view. But most are confident,
barring a Gatt impasse, that the CAC-40 Index should reach a new record of
around 2,400 in 1994.
One reason for their confidence is the corporate sector's promising outlook.
Companies have had a tough time in the early 1990s due to the impact of high
interest rates and rising unemployment on domestic demand and, since the
September 1992 currency crisis, the depressive effect of the strong franc on
exports: CAC-40 companies are now approaching the end of their fourth
successive year of earnings decline.
Next year should mark the start of the recovery. Official figures show that
consumer spending was slightly less sluggish during the summer.
The strong franc is still affecting the competitiveness of French exports,
but companies are now achieving significant productivity gains after years
of low inflation and pay restraint. JP Morgan in Paris forecasts an
inflation rate of just 2 per cent in 1994, thereby fuelling further
improvements in cost competitiveness next year.
James Capel expects to see a rebound in CAC-40 earnings of 35 per cent for
1994. But the eventual rate of growth will be heavily influenced by the
progress of interest rate reduction and its impact on the economy.
Salomon Brothers forecasts a fall in short-term interest rates from the
present level of 6.45 per cent to between 4.5 and 5 per cent next year.
The progress of the CAC-40 index will also be determined by the flow of
funds into French equities.
One of the main reasons for the recent slowdown in the Paris market is that
US investors, who invested heavily during the summer bull run, have stopped
pouring new money into France because of the appeal of high yields in the
US.
Most brokers expect to see a fresh influx of funds soon from domestic
investors, thereby compensating for the US withdrawal. But the French have
historically favoured cash over equity investments.
Savings ratios are still rising suggesting that, in spite of the
government's efforts to coax investors into equities through initiatives
such as this summer's highly successful 'Balladur bond' issue, the French
are still not ready to convert their cash into shares.
Recent reductions in interest rates have already made equities seem more
attractive against the dwindling returns on savings.
This trend should continue as interest rates fall further next year, thereby
providing a new pool of money to bolster the market.
The other main influence will be the volume of new equity arriving on the
market. Almost FFr100bn (Dollars 16bn) of new shares have already been added
this year through the combination of the first two privatisations and a
stream of private sector issues, from companies such as Schneider, Axa and
Lafarge Coppee, thereby artificially depressing the index.
'So far, there has been no shortage of takers for these new issues and most
have been healthily over-subscribed,' says Mr Harrington of James Capel.
'Unless there is a Gatt crisis there is no reason why next year's issues
should not be as successful - unless, of course, the government is too
greedy and privatises too many companies too quickly.'
CORRECTION
In yesterday's feature on the French equity market, a predicted level of
2,500 for the CAC-40 index was attributed to Mr Didier Cherpitel as managing
director of Morgan Stanley in Paris. In fact, Mr Cherpitel holds the same
position at JP Morgan in Paris.

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: FNAC plunges to FFr31.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressures on the French retail sector triggered a sharp fall in profits for
FNAC, the dominant force in music and books retailing. In the year to August
31 net profits fell to FFr31.9m (Dollars 5.5m) from FFr159.5m in the
previous year.
FNAC has in recent months been clouded by the controversy over the decision
by GMF, its troubled parent company, to sell its controlling stake to a
consortium composed of Altus Finance, part of the Credit Lyonnais banking
group, and Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, a property subsidiary of the
Compagnie Generale des Eaux utility concern.
The uncertainty over its ownership, coupled with the strains of France's
economic recession, took a toll on FNAC last year.
It faced the challenge of its first serious competitor in French cultural
retailing due to the aggressive expansion in France of Virgin, the UK
leisure company controlled Mr Richard Branson. FNAC mustered an overall
increase in turnover of 8.3 per cent to FFr8.9bn from FFr8.2bn, but most of
this growth came from new openings.
Sales at its existing stores rose by 0.3 per cent during the year.
The group increased operating profits by 14.3 per cent to FFr102.5m from
FFr89.9m. But it was left with an exceptional debit of FFr77m having
benefited from an exceptional credit of FFr107.8m in the previous year.

Home shopping, which has in recent years been one of the fastest growing

FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: MIM swaps zinc smelter interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Australian metals group, and Germany's Metallgesellschaft,
which holds a 14.9 per cent stake in MIM, are negotiating to swap interests
in two loss-making German zinc smelters which they currently own on a joint
basis.
Under the restructuring plan, MIM would acquire the 50 per cent interest
which the German company holds in MHD 'Berzelius' Duisburg. This would give
the Australian group full ownership of the Duisburg operation, which also
takes in Rhine-Zink, a downstream product-manufacturing operation. The
capacity at the smelter is around 100,000 tonnes.
Conversely, Metallgesellschaft would acquire MIM's 50 per cent interest in
Ruhr-Zink, also achieving outright ownership. Capacity there is around
170,000 tonnes.
As a further element in the package, the German group would buy from MIM a
25 per cent stake in Metallgesellschaft Ltd, the London-based brokerage,
lifting its stake to around 86 per cent. MIM would continue to own about 9
per cent and have board representation.
In Brisbane, MIM said that there might be some additional cash adjustment
when the restructuring deal was finalised, hopefully by the end of 1993, but
declined to give details at this stage.
It said that both groups were unhappy at the losses being made at the
smelters, and claimed that the deal 'should improve the positions for both
parties'. The restructuring will mean that MIM acquires full ownership of a
second European zinc smelter using the Imperial Smelting Process (ISP), in a
matter of months.
Only a few weeks ago, the Australian company completed the purchase of the
Avonmouth zinc smelter from Pasminco, where it has since announced
redundancies in an effort to boost cost-efficiency.
Although there has been talk of reducing zinc smelter capacity in Europe,
MIM made clear yesterday that it intends to operate both smelters.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Bundesbank warning on 'quick fix'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Any attempt to revive German exports and thereby curb domestic unemployment
would be the 'wrong medicine', the Bundesbank's chief economist warned last
night.
Speaking in Frankfurt, Mr Otmar Issing, member of the central bank's policy
making council, appeared to be directing his remarks at calls for European
countries to slash interest rates as a way of combating unemployment.
Mr Issing acknowledged that there had been a sharp fall in German exports
since German reunification, and that this had contributed to German
unemployment because lay-offs were concentrated in export-oriented
industries. Germany's trade surplus has fallen from DM135bn (Pounds 53.50bn)
in 1989 to DM34bn last year to DM28bn in the first eight months of the
current year.
However, he rejected arguments that the fall in exports had been triggered
by the strength of the D-Mark, pointing out that measured against the
currencies of Germany's 18 most important trading partners the D-Mark had
risen by a modest 3 per cent in the past two years, and had fallen by nearly
1 per cent since the end of last year.
He blamed the export decline on recession in Germany's most important
trading partners. Any attempt to combat the decline in exports by
competitive devaluation, would prove illusory, Mr Issing said, as it would
only serve to worsen trading partners' recessions and diminish demand for
German goods still further. A devaluation would stoke up inflationary
pressures and trigger a wage-price spiral which would lead to more, not less
inflation.
Mr Issing's comments follow Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer's remarks
on Wednesday that governments should not try to buy economic recovery by
means of rate cuts.
Mr Johann Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, however, awakened speculation
of further rate cuts in Germany in Paris yesterday. He was quoted as saying
Germany was 'over the hump' on inflation and there was scope for further
interest rate cuts.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Swiss to vote on introduction of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss voters pride themselves on using their direct democracy responsibly;
if taxes need to be raised, this action will be approved in a referendum.
That sense of responsibility will be tested on Sunday when the Swiss will be
asked, for the fourth time, to vote on the introduction of a value added
tax.
At a time when every other European government has long since introduced
VAT, it may be asked why the Swiss have rejected the idea. The Swiss answer
would be that no negative consequences have resulted from previous
rejections in 1977, 1979 and 1991.
This time, however, there is a sense of urgency. Federal government finances
are in disarray as soaring social security spending in the recession led to
record deficits.
Another concern is the competitiveness of Swiss industry. Last December,
Swiss voters rejected joining the European Economic Area (EEA), an expanded
free trade area between the European Union and the countries of the European
Free Trade Association.
Swiss manufacturing companies have become increasingly nervous that exports
to Europe will face increased costs when the EEA comes into force next year.
Thus, their campaign to replace the existing 6.2 per cent turnover tax,
which applies only to goods and capital spending, with VAT has been more
passionate than on previous outings.
It is estimated that Swiss industry would save SFr2.6bn a year if a 6.2 per
cent VAT, applicable to services as well as goods and refunded from exports,
were introduced.
As is often the case in Swiss referendums, the balloting process will
require considerable concentration from voters. They can vote for 6.2 per
cent VAT or 6.5 per cent, which the government would prefer because it would
raise more revenue. There is also an opportunity to vote in favour of adding
another 1 percentage point to help underwrite soaring public pension costs.
The VAT proposal has the full support of all the main political parties and
business groups, with the exception of the restaurant and hairdressing
trades which dread being brought into the tax net.
Polls indicate that it will probably be approved by a narrow majority, but
that the people will only approve a 6.2 per cent rate. Swiss voters would
prefer to keep the pressure on the politicians to cut spending rather than
let them have more money.
In addition to VAT voters will also decide whether or not to abolish tobacco
and liquor advertising, an issue brought to a referendum by concerned
citizens.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Companies neglecting tax rebates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Millions of pounds in value added tax rebates are unclaimed across the EU,
according to a survey by accountants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.
Nearly 60 per cent of companies do not reclaim all the VAT they are entitled
to receive from countries in which they are not registered, and more than 20
per cent do not claim any of their rebates.
The survey, which questioned more than 600 companies, notes that almost a
quarter of businesses pay VAT in countries where they are not registered, on
transactions such as one-off purchases, hotel bills and travel. About 8 per
cent are paying more VAT than they were before 1993.
Most say the primary reason is that recoveries would cost too much. A number
of companies highlighted administrative difficulties in receiving rebates in
Italy, Germany and France. 'The system clearly needs to be simplified,'
Deloitte said.
Across the EU, British companies are the most likely to fail to make
refunds.
The survey showed that just 23 per cent of companies said they had found
their transport costs becoming cheaper as a result of the new system,
although 39 per cent said goods reached their destinations more quickly.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Pressure for Japan discount rate cut resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's central bank yesterday resisted pressure for another cut in the
official discount rate, despite a continued slide in industrial output.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, admitted to 'grave concern'
about the continued falls in share prices, which brought the Nikkei index
down another 1.8 per cent yesterday. A fall of 317.73 points to 17,067.11
reflected deepening gloom about Japanese industry's poor profits outlook.
Shares opened firmer today, with the Nikkei more than 100 points higher
after five minutes of trading.
Mr Mieno, responding to suggestions that the bank might be considering
another cut in its main rate, already at a record low, said yesterday: 'In
the current economic adjustment phase, lower interest rates alone will not
create fresh demand.'
As he spoke, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry disclosed that
industrial production dropped by 3.8 per cent year-on-year in the third
quarter, the eighth quarterly decline running.
Worryingly, inventories were 1.1 per cent higher at the end of September
than three months earlier. This indicates that production will stay sluggish
at least until the end of the year, Miti said.
To worsen the gloom, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
announced the sharpest monthly drop in vehicle production for 19 years.
Vehicle output, which with car sales is an important indicator of consumer
sentiment, plunged 15.7 per cent in October from a year earlier.
Mr Mieno saw no sign of a general economic recovery, but doubted that a the
recession would develop into a 'worsening spiral'.
The central bank had 'taken all necessary steps in terms of monetary
policy,' after cutting its main rate seven times since July 1991, to 1.75
per cent.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Jordan bank deal imminent

Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are close to signing an
agreement which will give the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) wide-ranging
monetary responsibilities in the occupied territories during the transitory
period of Palestinian self-rule.
A draft copy of the document gives Jordan's central bank the job of
supervising and monitoring banks which open branches in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. It provides for the continuation of the Jordanian dinar as legal
tender during the interim period. And it gives the CBJ ultimate
responsibility for control of the money supply in the occupied territories
and inflation and capital flows.
Mr Mohammad Nashashibi, chairman of the PLO's department of economic affairs
and planning, says once the agreement is signed within the next few weeks, a
joint Jordanian/Palestinian monetary and banking committee will be
established to oversee the bank's policies in the territories. This will
include CBJ officials and Palestinian economists approved by the PLO.
The agreement is still pending approval by the PLO in Tunis which remains
nervous about giving too much control to the Jordanian monetary authorities.
PLO officials insist the arrangements will be temporary.
Mr Michel Martou, deputy governor at the central bank, says it is happy to
play the role of supervisor but before the agreement enters into force it
must iron out differences with Israel over foreign exchange controls and the
convertibility of the Israeli shekel.
One of the first tasks of the central bank will be to help commercial banks
open branches in the occupied territories. Eight banks operating in Jordan,
including the British Bank of the Middle East and ANZ Grindlays, have
expressed an interest in re-opening branches closed after the 1967 war.
The Jordanian/Palestinian draft agreement stipulates that banks in the
occupied territories will operate solely under Jordanian law. It also
provides for Palestinian companies in the territories to issue shares on the
Amman financial market. An official announcement is expected by
mid-December.
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials have announced plans to establish a
mixed-sector Palestinian Bank for Development and Reconstruction in the West
Bank town of Jericho. Mr Nashashibi says the bank's capital will come from
wealthy Palestinian businessmen and the PLO and will be used to develop
housing, industry and agriculture.
The Palestinians eventually want their own central bank, currency, and a
Palestine stock exchange. But Mr Mohammad Saed Nabulsi, Jordan's central
bank governor, recently said in a speech to Jordanian businessmen that such
ideas would be unmanageable.
Since the announcement of the PLO-Israeli peace accord, Jordan has been
concerned about economic marginalisation by both Israeli domination of the
Palestinian market and foreign aid aimed at developing the occupied
territories to the exclusion of Jordan. However, monetary and banking
responsibilities in the occupied territories goes some way to allay these
fears.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday hailed the killing of Imad Aqel, a
Hamas guerrilla considered the most wanted fugitive in the Gaza Strip,
saying this would be the fate of all extremists who try to murder Israelis,
Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The killing took place yesterday in a
shoot-out with troops.

Jordan's two biggest commercial banks, Bank of Jordan and Arab Bank, are
preparing to open 30 branches in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
serve the Palestinian economy, due to be self-governing by April.
Israel and the Palestinians have yet to agree on future economic relations
in trade, money and banking, but the Jordanian banks, controlled by
Palestinian money, have proceeded to buy land and start buildings.
The only bank operating in the territories is Cairo-Amman Bank which has
eight branches.
Mr Yahya Kadamani, a director of Bank of Jordan, said his bank was ready to
open its first branch in Ramallah in January. The building merely awaited
furniture from Italy.
He expected to be conducting operations in both the Israeli shekel and the
Jordanian dinar, which would come under control of the respective central
banks of Israel and Jordan. Interest rates would vary according to the
currency lent. All foreign exchange business and issuance of letters of
credit would have to come under the Israeli central bank. Commercial banks
operating in the Palestinian economy would have to establish correspondent
banking relations with Israeli commercial banks to carry out foreign
exchange transactions.
Arab Bank, one of the biggest banks in the Middle East, has also said it
will open up to 24 branches across the occupied territories over the next
two years. The first are planned to open in six months in Nablus, Ramallah
and Hebron.
The first Palestinian bank, Palestinian Commercial bank, is also to open
eight branches.
The decisions of the commercial banks to go ahead with planning branches
appears to suggest the bankers have concluded detailed negotiations with the
central banks of both Jordan and Israel and with the PLO.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Seoul tough line could delay quick end to nuclear dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea has reasserted its influence in the negotiations to resolve the
North Korean nuclear issue, but at a possible cost of delaying a quick
solution to the dispute.
In his meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington on Tuesday, South
Korean president Kim Young-sam sidetracked a US proposal that would have
suspended the joint Team Spirit military exercise in return for North Korea
accepting the resumption of routine international nuclear inspections and
exchanging special envoys with Seoul to discuss nuclear issues.
Instead, the two leaders said the North would have to fulfil the two
conditions before concessions would be made. The statement amounted to a
rejection of a recent North Korean proposal that Washington and Pyongyang
make simultaneous compromises as part of a package solution.
South Korea has been concerned about recent US press reports that Washington
was seriously considering the North Korean offer, which conflicts with
Seoul's position that Pyongyang has to make the first concession. The unease
felt by South Korean officials over the North's proposal was that it would
lead to direct negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington, leaving Seoul
on the sidelines.
The main worry expressed by South Korean officials was that the talks
between Washington and Pyongyang would focus on inspections conducted by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), ignoring the issue of
inter-Korean nuclear inspections.
Mutual nuclear inspections between the two Koreas lie at the heart of the
present dispute. Seoul demanded last year that North Korea accept
inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in compliance with a bilateral
non-nuclear treaty that North and South Korea signed in December 1991.
Pyongyang refused the request, explaining the treaty did not support this
demand.
In response, Seoul sought to press Pyongyang by asking Washington to resume
the annual US-South Korean Team Spirit military exercise this year, South
Korean foreign ministry officials say.
Team Spirit had been suspended in 1992 as a goodwill gesture by Washington
in response to North Korea's signing of the non-nuclear treaty with the
South. Shortly after, Pyongyang agreed to accept routine IAEA inspections of
its nuclear facilities. But last autumn's decision to resume Team Spirit
angered Pyongyang.
Last March, it threatened to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty and stop IAEA inspections, citing resumption of Team Spirit as one
reason, and protesting at an IAEA demand that it accept inspections of
undeclared facilities.
Some analysts believe North Korea refused the IAEA request for special
inspections because it would have created a precedent for accepting similar
inspections by South Korea, the issue at the centre of their disagreements
over mutual inspections.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Thailand sets out on path to freer market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai government plans a series of economic reforms in the coming months,
with the emphasis on liberalising the financial sector and reducing import
tariffs to improve the competitiveness of Thai commerce and industry, Mr
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, finance minister, said yesterday.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Tarrin said the first step was
to expand the scope of operations which can be undertaken by the 47 banks
granted offshore banking licences under the Bangkok International Banking
Facility (BIBF).
The plan was to allow BIBF licence holders from early next year to open
additional branches outside Bangkok and start lending in local currency up
to specified limits, although they would not be permitted to accept local
deposits and would have to raise funding from the money markets. 'The BIBF
would be upgraded into restricted branch operations.'
Later, foreign banks would be allowed to open additional conventional
branches and more such institutions would be granted access to Thailand.
Now, foreign banks are allowed only one branch and cannot have electronic
banking outlets except on their premises.
The hope was that the Uruguay Round of world trade talks would be
successfully concluded this year. Thailand was planning 'massive' customs
tariff reforms, involving lowering those on raw materials imports, making
tariffs more logical, and cutting the number of rates to six from 31.
Import tariffs would be progressively reduced, independent of reductions due
under the Asean Free Trade Area and the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, to expose Thai business to competition.
'This is a big move for Thailand. What you will see in the longer term (say
three years from now) is a much freer market, much more vibrant imports;
you'll begin to see more investments taking advantage of this and turning it
around to exports,' Mr Tarrin, former president of Siam Commercial Bank,
added.
Although the five-party coalition government of which Mr Tarrin is a member
is unstable, economic reform plans are at an advanced stage and generally
supported by technocrats in the bureaucracy, if not by industrialists in
protected sectors such as petrochemicals.
The Thai economy continues to perform robustly despite the weak state of
Thailand's export markets in Europe and Japan. Export growth is expected to
reach only 10 per cent this year, compared to a forecast 15 per cent, but
this is mainly the result of weak agricultural commodity prices; electronics
exports are still rising sharply and the domestic market remains strong.
Mr Tarrin said he expected real gross domestic product to increase 7.5 per
cent this year and 7.5-8 per cent in 1994. Inflation this year has fallen to
about 3.6 per cent, but inflationary pressures next year would probably
prompt a rise in interest rates.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Keating unlikely to testify before inquiry into newspaper
ownership

Australia's prime minister Paul Keating yesterday indicated he was unlikely
to give evidence to a Senate committee which would look into foreign
ownership of Australian newspapers. Approval for the new committee is
expected later this week, after its terms of reference were tabled in
parliament yesterday.
Under these, the committee would look into 'the origin and basis for
decisions in 1991 and 1993 to increase the permissible percentage of foreign
ownership of newspapers' and 'whether those decisions were influenced by
considerations relating to the content of newspapers including the
requirement for 'balanced' coverage'. It would also consider the
effectiveness of Foreign Investment Review Board rules.
The committee would be made up of four senators from the ruling Labor party,
four from the opposition, and one nominated by the minority Australian
Democrats. It could request that people appear before it, but could not
demand they give evidence.
The committee's formation has been spurred by disclosures that Mr Keating
demanded more balanced coverage from the John Fairfax newspapers, including
the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age and Australian Financial Review, as
a precondition to any increase in the stake held by Mr Conrad Black, the
Canadian media tycoon.
The conversation between Mr Keating and Mr Black took place before the
federal election. After the March election, the cabinet approved an increase
from 15 to 25 per cent in Mr Black's interest.
But the prime minister, under attack over the Fairfax decision during
parliamentary question time yesterday, told the opposition: 'Listen,
brother. . . I know my place in the world. I do not slum it before senate
committees.'
Mr Keating defended the government's handling of the Fairfax issue, denying
any impropriety had occurred, and accused Mr John Hewson, the opposition
leader, of promising Mr Black a much larger stake.
Chances of passage this year of the government's contentious land rights
legislation, to set up a system for dealing with native title claims,
dwindled yesterday when the two Green party senators gave conditional
support to a Senate inquiry into the package.
The government lacks a majority in the Senate, and minority parties hold the
balance of power.

FT  25 NOV 93 / India and Pakistan to resume talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India and Pakistan are to resume talks on bilateral problems, including the
status of the contentious Jammu and Kashmir, after a gap of nearly 15
months.
Mr JN Dixit and Mr Shahryar Khan, the foreign secretaries of India and
Pakistan, agreed to meet in Islamabad from January 1-3, under an accord
signed by the two countries in 1972 after Pakistan lost to India in a war
over Bangladesh. The talks had been postponed for more than a year as
relations between the two neighbours reached their worst point in 20 years.
India has consistently held that Kashmir is a domestic dispute to be
resolved internally, and has accused Pakistan of training and funding
Kashmiri militants engaged in armed warfare in the Kashmir valley. Pakistan
has denied the allegation and insists on interpreting the so-called Simla
Agreement of 1972 in the light of a United Nations resolution of 1948
providing for an internationally supervised plebiscite through which
Kashmiris could choose between India and Pakistan.
An Indian foreign ministry official said that the recent peaceful resolution
of the month-long stand-off between armed Kashmiri separatists and the
Indian armed forces at Hazratbal, Kashmir's holiest shrine, and Islamabad's
subsequent inability to move a resolution on the human rights issue at the
UN general assembly paved the way for talks. Both nations appear to be
responding to US pressure to resolve the Kashmir dispute through talks.
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, had expressed India's
readiness to resume a dialogue in his congratulatory message to Ms Benazir
Bhutto, the newly elected Pakistani prime minister.
The Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, India's largest opposition
party, yesterday demanded that the ruling Congress government should convene
a meeting of all Indian political parties before resuming talks with
Pakistan. Mr Krishan Lal Sharma, the party spokesman, said Pakistan must be
told that India would not tolerate interference in its internal affairs,
that Pakistan should stop funding infiltrators fighting a separatist war in
the Kashmir valley, and that the issue should not be raised in international
forums.
Officials on both sides are sceptical that the talks will resolve the
Kashmir dispute which has hindered relations between the two countries since
partition in 1947, and over which two wars have been fought. But they agree
that the resumption of talks is 'a step in the right direction'.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Lee risks losing face on Taiwan vote trail: The first time
the president has publicly sought the support of the people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS ENGBARTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui is putting his prestige and political future
on the line by publicly campaigning for candidates of his ruling nationalist
party, the Kuomintang (KMT), in city and county elections to be held on
Saturday.
The election is the first to take place since Mr Lee completed the process
of bringing the Taiwan government and the KMT under the control of
Taiwan-born leaders this year. The results could affect the stability of his
hold on power and the progress of liberalising political and economic
reforms.
Mr Lee said last week that his campaigning marked the first time in Taiwan's
 -or China's - history 'that the head of state has directly faced the
people'.
County and city mayors have wide powers over their districts. They exercise
control over local police forces, grant business and development licences
and arbitrate environmental or labour disputes. This makes them the focus of
intense contention among political and financial interests.
Of most relevance to the ruling party is the fact that mayors also oversee
the administration of elections.
The KMT holds 13 mayorships. The main opposition Democratic Progressive
party controls seven cities and counties. There is also one city run by a
pro-DPP independent.
Further erosion could damage the KMT's hopes in elections next year for
Taiwan provincial governor and for the mayors of the big Taipei and
Kaohsiung municipalities.
In a blow to the KMT's fortunes yesterday, a senior member of the party
defected to the opposition Chinese New Party, which was formed in August by
a group of rebel KMT legislators.
Mr Hsu Li-nung, a veteran leader of the ruling party's conservative wing and
a member of its central advisory committee, said he was joining the New
Party because he was disgusted with rampant corruption.
On the campaign front, Mr Lee's longer-term aim seems to be his ambition to
become Taiwan's first directly-elected president, says Mr Huang Hui-chen,
executive director of the Institute for National Policy Research think-tank.
Mr Lee was elected indirectly in 1990 by the National Assembly to a six-year
term. There are moves to submit a constitutional amendment to allow direct
presidential elections before his term expires.
Despite previous denials about running for president, Mr Lee last week left
the door open when he told the China Times newspaper: 'It's not yet time to
make a decision.'
'If Lee wants to continue his reforms, he needs to firm up the KMT's control
at the local level or else his control over the KMT itself may weaken,' Mr
Huang notes.
Mr Lee and the opposition DPP were often indirect allies in past
confrontations with more conservative mainland-born KMT leaders.
The last powerful mainland-born leaders were sidelined by Mr Lee at the 14th
KMT Congress in August. This now pits 'a Taiwanese KMT against a Taiwanese
DPP,' says Mr Huang.
Mr Lee's greatest risk on the campaign trail is that he may wear out his
welcome among the electorate which has indicated widespread approval of his
moves to liberalise Taiwan's political regime.
'The main result of this campaign will be the disappearance of the Lee
Teng-hui love-knot,' says Mr Chao Shao-kang, convener of the New Party.
'Many voters forgive him for everything as he's the first Taiwanese
president, but his dictatorial ways won't be tolerated forever,' Mr Chao
says.
Meanwhile the DPP is campaigning primarily on the clean and generally
effective performance of its mayors. Like those of the New Party, DPP
candidates have also pointed to a series of big cases of corruption or
inefficiency, including delays and cost overruns of KMT-run Taipei city's
mass transit system.

South Korea bowed to cries for help from struggling small manufacturers and

low-paid jobs that locals shun, Reuter reports from Seoul.
A Justice Ministry official said the workers would be permitted to stay for
periods of up to two years.
The ministry also announced it would extend the limited amnesty for illegal
guest workers for another six months.
Some 15,000 of the estimated 60,000 illegal foreign workers in South Korea
registered for the six-month amnesty in June. They were originally required
to leave the country by December 15.

Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Cambodia's first prime minister, yesterday
rejected as unconstitutional a suggestion by King Norodom Sihanouk, his
father, that the Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction could be offered ministerial
roles in government, Reuter reports from Dey Eith, Cambodia.
'The constitution prevents us appointing any people not members of the
parties which have members in parliament,' Prince Ranariddh told Khmer Rouge
defectors being inducted into the army. By failing to respond to government
peace offers, the guerrillas ran the risk of disappearing.
But the guerrillas might be offered a role as special envoys to report on
the sovereignty of Cambodia's common borders with Laos, Thailand and
Vietnam, he added.
King Sihanouk earlier proposed to offer 'acceptable' Khmer Rouge officials
positions as co-ministers, co-deputy ministers, co-secretaries of state and
advisers in the new coalition government led by Prince Ranariddh. The
Cambodian constitution forbids appointment of non-elected people to
parliament.
The Khmer Rouge, held responsible for the deaths of 1m Cambodians during the
1975-79 'killing fields' years, have sought an advisory role in government.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK airline may sue over EU subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Midland Airways (BMA), the UK's second largest airline, is
considering taking legal action against the European Commission for failing
to enforce new rules against government subsidies for financially troubled
European state-controlled airlines.
Sir Michael Bishop, BMA's chairman, said yesterday his airline was already
taking legal advice over possible action against the Commission.
He claimed Brussels was distorting the new liberalised European aviation
market by failing to uphold the new rules against state subsidies to ensure
fair competition in its third airline liberalisation package which came into
force at the beginning of this year.
'Smaller airlines were enticed to expand their services in the new
deregulated market on the grounds that the EU would stop state aid for
national flag carriers,' Sir Michael said. With Brussels failing to clamp
down on these subsidies, smaller airlines have been badly hit while bigger,
financially troubled, state-owned carriers have been able to continue
operating under the protection of large government handouts, he argued.
Troubled state carriers, including Air France, Air Portugal and Aer Lingus,
are receiving substantial financial support from their governments
provoking, in Sir Michael's view , 'a grotesque distortion' of the new EU
open airline market.
'A number of smaller airlines are going bust, while the bigger companies
which are really bust are being allowed to carry on through artificial
supports,' he said.
Sir Michael said he had already raised these issues with the EU competition
and transport commissioners at a meeting of the European Airlines
Association in Brussels last Friday.
Although the UK government has also campaigned against state support for
European national carriers, Sir Michael also accused the British government
of distorting the UK airline market by failing to review last year's
acquisition of Dan-Air, the Gatwick-based regional carrier, by British
Airways for a nominal Pounds 1.
'The UK government has also let down smaller airlines by turning Nelson's
eye to BA's takeover, first of British Caledonian and then of Dan-Air,' he
said. As a result BMA had been squeezed on two fronts: in Europe and the UK.
Unlike several other smaller European airlines, BMA had been able to compete
against the larger flag carriers because of its strong position at London's
Heathrow airport, where it holds the second largest number of landing slots
after BA, and its partnership with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), which
currently owns 34.9 per cent of the UK carrier.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Bosnian Serbs ease blockade on aid convoys

United Nations aid convoys yesterday crossed front lines carrying emergency
relief for central and eastern Bosnia while Serb leaders called for the
lifting of punitive sanctions against Yugoslavia.
Serb commanders in eastern Bosnia yesterday finally allowed the passage of
three convoys carrying food for the Moslem enclaves of Tuzla, Zepa and
Srebrenica, which have been designated UN 'safe areas', said Miss Lyndall
Sachs of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
But Serb leaders continued to block the passage of food and winter supplies
for another 'safe area', Gorazde, south-eastern Bosnia, as they apparently
tried to push forward towards the Moslem enclave. UN military observers
yesterday reported heavy Serb artillery fire on the enclave.
At the same time, two convoys headed for UNHCR warehouses in Zenica, central
Bosnia. Overland convoys were suspended to central Bosnia on October 26
after a Danish lorry driver was killed. The leaders of the three warring
parties last week pledged to allow free access for relief.
Serb leaders stepped up their campaign for the lifting of UN sanctions,
imposed 19 months ago in response to the carve-up of Bosnia. Mr Radovan
Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, called on the UN to suspend sanctions on what
remains of Yugoslavia. 'We must not rely only on hints to suspend sanctions.
If the international community wishes talks to succeed, it must suspend
sanctions now and allow the Serb side to be fully equal in the talks,'
reported Tanjug, the official news agency.
But remarks by Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday cast
doubt on new peace talks with the 12 European Union foreign ministers in
Geneva next Monday. The Serbian side would apparently seek a postponement,
although he added they would attend if necessary.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Spanish showdown on incomes policy: Talks between unions,
employers and government have failed to secure a social pact and protests
begin today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers in Spain are planning protests across the country today as the
unions start to test the government on its attempts to secure an incomes
policy for the next three years.
Agreement on wage moderation is central to efforts by Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
the prime minister, to pull Spain out of recession. But three months of
talks aimed at securing a social pact between unions, employers and
government have produced nothing.
Both the government and unions are digging in their heels. Mr Gonzalez says
he will force through measures to deregulate the labour market and to peg
wages below inflation, whether or not he has an agreement. He has put a
November 30 deadline on the talks. Officials say emergency legislation will
be put before the cabinet on December 3.
The unions say they will follow up today's protests with a 24-hour strike
towards the end of December. The prospect is now one of a government-union
showdown marked by escalating industrial unrest that is likely to undermine
confidence in the peseta.
More talks on the social pact are planned for tomorrow but it is unlikely
anything can now be agreed.
Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy minister, who drew up the reform package, sums
up the government's frustration over the negotiating process: 'Rarely have I
attended such long meetings with so little to show for them.' The government
would have preferred a consensus, but it is determined to act alone because
the reforms are 'urgent and necessary'.
The talks were probably doomed from the start. In early October Mr Gonzalez
acknowledged as much in an interview with the FT: 'The great problem of (the
social) pact is that the government has nothing to give in exchange. We are
asking for an incomes policy to improve competitiveness, for changes in
traditional collective bargaining procedures and for a modification of the
labour market that will make it more flexible . . . this requires a cultural
change in union attitudes and this is very difficult.'
The unions may be blamed for intransigence but the government can equally be
accused of failing to face up to the unions in the past and of now
attempting to do too much, too late. The rigidities concerning fixed
employment conditions, severance terms and job classifications that Mr
Gonzalez now seeks to loosen were enshrined in a Workers' Statute that was
legislated by his government in 1984.
At that time Spain, which was then not a member of the European Union,
enjoyed a highly protected economy, had strong pent-up growth potential and
a cheap labour force. None of these conditions applies today as Spain enters
its second year of recession, with the domestic economy contracting 1 per
cent by the third quarter.
During the economic growth period of the late 1980s, the government did
little to curb inflationary wage agreements in public sector companies and
forced up unit labour costs by transferring a growing social security burden
on to companies. At present 24 per cent of Spain's social security
expenditure is financed directly by companies, against an average of 9.8 per
cent in the EU.
Attempts by the government to stimulate jobs were counter-productive or
short-lived. A system of short-term contracts introduced in 1986 merely
created a rotating system that had employees alternately working and
receiving unemployment benefits, and a youth employment scheme was abandoned
after a general strike in 1987.
Mr Carlos Ferrer Salat, the chairman of Unice, the European employers'
confederation, points out that Spain now has double the the EU's
unemployment rate, three-times that of the US and 10-times that of the
Pacific rim. 'Europe has the most costly and rigid labour market in the
world and Spain has the most costly and rigid market in Europe,' said the
Barcelona-born businessman.
In the midst of the worst post-war recession that Spain has endured, the
government has now come round to facing the deep-seated structural problems
that it believes are preventing job creation, even in growth periods, and
which have forced up wages even when the economy was flat.
'Why does our economy only create jobs when it is growing by more than 2 per
cent?' Mr Solbes asked a recent meeting of businessmen in Barcelona. 'Why,
even when we are booming, do we have unemployment levels of 16 per cent? How
is it that in the midst of a recession, wages increases are above our
inflation level and above those in other countries that are better off then
Spain?'
Mr Solbes, an economist, knows the answers perfectly well and he has brought
Mr Gonzalez round to understanding the nature of the problem. This is why
the government has embarked on its go-it-alone course of imposing an incomes
policy and reforming the labour market.
By January 1 Mr Solbes wants clear guidelines in place that will hold down
wages to below inflation over the next three years. He also wants new laws
that end fixed-term employment contracts, permit job mobility, streamline
redundancy procedures and lower severance costs, and which substitute
sectorial collective wage agreements with case-by-case deals.
Bracing himself for the forthcoming bout of labour unrest, Mr Solbes is
talking tough: 'The country is in no position to have strikes. It has to get
down to work.'

FT  25 NOV 93 / French express optimism on deficit target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government said yesterday it would be able to keep this year's
budget deficit to the original target of FFr317.6bn (Pounds 36.3bn), chiefly
thanks to the influx of privatisation receipts and some juggling with social
security accounts.
Presenting a year-end 'rectifying' mini-budget, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the
budget minister, said it had been a long time since a French government had
'hit its deficit target to the very last centime'.
Since this year's budget was voted in June, the government has been able to
make economies of FFr22.3bn. Half of this has come from smaller debt service
charges (FFr3.7bn) as a result of lower interest rates and from this
summer's big 'Balladur bond' issue. The bond saved the government FFr7.8bn
it would otherwise have had to pay in short-term borrowing costs.
The FFr22.3bn savings balanced out the recession-induced FFr3.2bn drop in
tax receipts - which would have been far greater had not Paris paid FFr5.5bn
less to the European Union budget than it originally calculated - and an
extra FFr19.1bn which the Balladur government has forked out this year to
help the housing sector and to placate its farmers.
But Mr Sarkozy's self-satisfaction yesterday was made possible by charging
some FFr4.5bn in school aid to the family allowance fund - one of the few in
the welfare system to be in surplus - and by using some of the privatisation
receipts, which constitute backing for the Balladur bond issue, for current
budget expenditure.
Such ruses may become increasingly necessary if France is to stick to its
commitment, contained in the Maastricht convergence plan it presented to EU
partners this week, to reduce total French public deficits to 2 per cent of
national output by 1997.
The credibility of this goal depends on the economy returning to growth in
1994. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday dismissed
October's 1.2 per cent drop in consumer goods sales as a blip in the uneven
path to recovery. Citing encouraging trends in housing starts and investment
intentions, he held to his forecast of 1.4 per cent real growth next year.

FT  25 NOV 93 / EU eases terms for entrants: Prospects look brighter of
meeting enlargement deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of the European Union meeting its January 1995 deadline to
bring in four new members brightened yesterday after the European Commission
proposed significant concessions on regional policy and agriculture.
The enlargement negotiations, begun last February, must be completed by
March in time for Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway to put their proposed
entry to referendum. All four countries' subsidy regimes for their remote or
mountainous regions, and for Arctic and Alpine farming, are sensitive
issues.
On regional policy, the Commission agreed yesterday on a plan to offer each
of the four applicants the highest level of structural aid - so-called
Objective 1 status - for their remote and poorer regions. The strict
definition of eligibility for Objective 1 aid, invented for backward regions
like Andalusia in Spain or the poorest member states, Greece, Portugal and
Ireland, is an average per capita income below 75 per cent of the EU
average.
Brussels wants to offer it to Burgenland, on Austria's Hungarian border;
Finland's three eastern provinces, Lapland in northern Finland, and Kuusamo
which is in between these two Finnish areas; the four northern counties of
Norway; and Norrbotten, Sweden's northernmost province.
All four applicants are richer than the 12 EU member states on average
income, and all these regions are above - some well above - the Objective 1
income threshold. But when the 12 shared out the Ecu96bn (Dollars 109.4bn)
Objective 1 pot in July, the intense horse-trading led to a relaxation of
the rules. 'There were a lot of strands of new elastic to hold (regional
policy) together for the 12,' a senior official said, and this flexibility
is now being extended to the four.
Similarly, rules for state aids in remote regions will probably be more
flexible to take account of the huge distances in the Nordic applicant
countries, and their concern to keep their inaccessible northern and border
areas populated.
On agriculture, the Commission yesterday moved towards a way of levelling
out the big farm price support differences between the 12 and the Four. In
previous enlargements, these differences were ironed out by border levies.
Brussels yesterday decided, however, that there could be no retaining of
borders because of the barrier-free Single Market.
Instead, prices will be aligned from the moment of entry, and direct
compensation will be paid to Nordic and Alpine farmers. The intention is
that the applicants should pay for this compensation as their consumers and
taxpayers do now. But officials acknowledge that in the end, the EU budget
will have to bear part of this cost, especially as all four candidates will
be net contributors.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Commission attacks UK stance on waste water law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday hit back at UK demands to postpone
implementation of a Euro-law on cleaning up sewage water pollution, claiming
that Britain had not done its homework on costs, and was trying to shift
blame onto Brussels for expenditure it would have to make anyway.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, told EU finance ministers
on Monday that Britain was seeking a longer phasing in of the waste water
treatment directive as part of a campaign to review, and in some cases
repeal, EU laws which impose costs hindering competitiveness. Mr Clarke
maintained that the cost of implementing the waste water directive would be
Pounds 10.5bn (Dollars 15.6bn), or five-times more than originally thought,
although he admitted that the UK Department of the Environment was
responsible for the miscalculation.
But yesterday, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner,
queried Britain's figures and motives in launching its attack on the waste
water directive.
The British government has a habit of shifting blame onto Europe, he said
yesterday, but this is 'a debate between them and the British people'.
'Before complaining, the British government should do its homework more
carefully,' he added. Mr Clarke, was 'either misinformed,' Mr Paleokrassas
said, 'or he has some other motives which have nothing to do with the waste
water directive.' Other EC officials and diplomats present at Monday's
meeting believe Mr John Major's Conservative government is concerned about
passing on rising water costs in south-west England, which could effect its
slim electoral majority.
The UK claims the directive will add Pounds 525 to average household water
bills in 1995-2000, and a further Pounds 12 in between 2000 and 2005, by
which time its provisions should be fully implemented. The current average
for water bills is Pounds 193, Whitehall says. Mr Clarke said on Monday that
EU finance ministers should have closer oversight of all Euro-laws which
placed new cost burdens on industry.
Mr Paleokrassas, a former Greek finance minister, argued yesterday that:
The waste water directive, along with all other directives to clean up
European drinking and bathing water, had been passed unanimously by the 12,
with UK assent. The UK to date has presented four different sets of figures:
the original Pounds 2bn estimate; a 1989 figure of Pounds 7bn-8bn; Mr
Clarke's Pounds 10.5bn; and an additional Pounds 27bn to maintain and
improve the sewage system, which the UK acknowledges has nothing to do with
the directive.
The commissioner said UK water costs were anyway well below EU averages, and
that the jump in costs was due to the privatised water boards passing on the
investment costs immediately rather than taking advantage of the directive's
greater flexibility.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Court rebukes big retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has issued a stern warning that it is fed up
with examining complaints from big retailers against national restrictions
which have no effect on cross-border trade.
The ruling comes in the wake of a series of cases brought against national
laws which prohibit Sunday trading.
Court officials said the European judges wanted to deter retailers from
making similar challenges in the future unless they can prove that national
rules are discriminatory and a hindrance to the free movement of goods - one
of the central planks of the single European market.
'There's an increasing number of these cases and I think their lordships are
thoroughly fed up with them,' said one court official yesterday.
The warning comes in the form of a judgment yesterday on a test case brought
by two French supermarket chains against national laws which prevent
retailers from selling everyday products at a loss to bring customers into
their stores.
The European Court ruled that the national legislation restricting use of
'loss leaders' was compatible with European law. The judgment means two
managers from the big French supermarket chains Cora and Coop could be
prosecuted for flouting the rules.
The last British case of this sort to be judged by the Luxembourg-based
court was in December 1992, when the court decided that rules restricting
Sunday trading in England and Wales were not contrary to European law.

Spending in these areas is expected to be about FFr6.42bn for the year.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Reformers lead in Russian poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A new, authoritative poll taken in Russia's cities and towns shows a clear
lead for the liberal reformist Russia's Choice political bloc headed by Mr
Yegor Gaidar.
But the poll also shows the grouping headed by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky not far
behind, with both of them far ahead of the rest of the field.
The survey, to be published today in the newspaper Sevodnya, shows Russia's
Choice on 29.2 per cent, and Mr Yavlinsky's group on 20.5 per cent. The
Russian Communist party is next - on 7.7 per cent.
One of the surprises of the poll is the very low showing of the Party of
Unity and Accord, headed by deputy prime ministers, Mr Sergei Shakhrai and
Mr Alexander Shokhin. They poll a mere 3.7 per cent, well down the field and
below the 5 per cent minimum vote needed for the party to have seats in the
state duma, or lower house.
The strong showing of Mr Yavlinsky's party, which has campaigned on a
programme of more moderate reform with an accent on wider privatisation and
ending monopolies, as well as (on the part of some of its leading
candidates) opposition to the draft constitution, points to a powerful role
for the group's leaders in the next parliament - if they can sustain this
momentum. Mr Yavlinsky has had talks with Mr Gaidar on co-operation but with
no result so far.
Without an official name, Mr Yavlinsky's party is nicknamed Yabloko (Apple),
as a pun on the acronym of its leadership; Mr Yavlinsky, Mr Yuri Boldyrev, a
scientist, and Mr Vladimir Lukin, former Russian ambassador to the US.
The supply of energy to industry and homes in Russia over the winter is at
risk - under the twin pressures of cuts in the budget and threatened
mineworkers strikes.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister and acting head of the
government in the absence on holiday of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
has warned of shortages by early next year unless billions of roubles are
provided to energy producing industries.

FT  25 NOV 93 / VW seeks ways to curb costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed efforts to drag Volkswagen out of the red will head the agenda at a
meeting of the automotive group's supervisory board in Wolfsburg tomorrow.
According to independent estimates, the company is heading for a loss of
around DM2bn (Pounds 700m) this year and faces renewed challenges in 1994,
when its key domestic market is expected to shrink by at least 5 per cent.
Tomorrow's discussions will revolve around a draft agreement with unions,
expected last night, to reduce labour costs by temporarily introducing a
four-day week in VW's six German factories.
But the group chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, is also expected to seek
approval for cuts of around a third in his medium-term investment programme.
He will also be closely questioned on the group's relatively poor showing in
Europe this year and his plans for rebuilding its loss-making US and
Japanese operations.
The circumstances surrounding the Seat subsidiary's unexpected crash into
losses of at least DM1.25bn this year will feature prominently in a report
prepared by independent auditors, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, on the orders of
Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the watchdog supervisory board.
The document, sent to board members yesterday, is believed to blame poor
financial controls and reporting systems. Seat's losses, first discovered in
late summer, followed the collapse of a new business plan, drawn up on Mr
Piech's orders earlier in the year, and designed to generate a break-even
result.
Analysts suggest the group's 1993 results will be pushed further into the
red by the costs of closing Seat's Zona Franca plant in Barcelona.
The KPMG report also confirms that investigators have been unable to find
any evidence that industrial secrets allegedly stolen from General Motors by
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM director and now Mr Piech's
top production executive, have been used by VW.

As western carmakers fight for markets, Russia's Avtovaz which makes the
Lada, is in the unusual position of being unable to meet demand.
Now Avtovaz is looking to western capital markets and carmakers to help
finance its expansion and modernisation.
It considers itself lucky compared with other Russian manufacturers, many of
them fighting for day-to-day survival and facing a continuing fall in
output.
Earlier this week, the Moscow mayor's office announced that Zil, the maker
of presidential limousines and ordinary trucks, was switching to a four-day
week and could suspend production altogether.
But at Avtovaz, Mr Nikolai Lyachenkov, the production manager, says: 'We
have managed to keep output at the same level as last year.' His company
makes around 650,000 cars a year. It is only problems with suppliers in the
former Soviet Union which prevent it reaching full capacity of 1m cars, he
says.
A rare source of support for Avtovaz has been the hard-currency revenues
from the export of 40 per cent of its output. Under the government's
sweeping privatisation programme, the enterprise has been turned into a
joint stock company and its 100,000 employees have already opted to acquire
51 per cent of the capital.
Next month, the government will auction off another 25 per cent in the form
of vouchers distributed to every citizen of Russia, and a further 22.5 per
cent will be offered to corporate investors at a special investment tender.
But despite relishing the new independence afforded by the government's
privatisation efforts, Mr Nikolai Glushkov, Avtovaz's deputy director for
finance, does not place much hope in attracting any significant investment
at either sale.
Instead, once Price Waterhouse produces its first set of western-style
accounts around April next year, the company plans to attract foreign
investors by increasing its capital.
Avtovaz also hopes next year to produce a new family of passenger cars in
the same class as the Vauxhall/Opel Astra. It is taking part in a separate
industrial consortium which wants to produce a lower-quality car in the Opel
Corsa range a few years later.
In the longer-term, says Mr Peter Rogers, a partner at Price Waterhouse
which has been hired as auditors and advisers to Avtovaz, the company must
aim for a western stock exchange listing.
Avtovaz has been talking with potential foreign investors for three years
now. In 1991, before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Soviet car
industry ministry hired Bear Stearns, the US investment bank, to value the
company, and Deloitte Touche was involved in a first attempt to translate
Avtovaz's accounts into terms understandable to western businesses. But that
arrangement collapsed. The enthusiasm of Fiat, which was negotiating the
possibility of taking a 30 per cent stake in Avtovaz also waned.
As Russian industry clamours for protection, Avtovaz executives say they are
not bothered by the flood of Mercedes, BMWs, and Cadillacs which makes
Moscow a promising market for western luxury cars. 'They will never be our
competitors,' said Mr Boris Kruyenkov, the company's deputy finance
director.
But as Avtovaz's domestic costs approach world levels, he says the
government should be ready to protect it in future from the sort of imported
cars which could compete with it.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Economic policy defeat for Brussels: EU finance ministers
force changes in paper on growth and jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday bowed to opposition from EU finance
ministers and published a watered-down version of its guidelines to boost
economic growth and halt rising unemployment.
The Commission's document avoids earlier calls for a reduction of 2-3 per
cent in short-term interest rates, steers away from recommendations to
broaden the tax system to pay for reductions in employment taxes, and
retreats from the specific goal of creating 15m new jobs by the end of the
century.
Although senior Commission officials played down the extent of the political
defeat, other officials warned that a similar fate might overtake Mr Jacques
Delors' White Paper on competitiveness and growth. The Commission
president's long-waited paper is supposed to be the centrepiece of the
European summit early next month.
European finance ministers picked holes in a summary of the Commission
president's White Paper at a meeting in Brussels last Monday, particularly
his tentative proposals for work-sharing as a means of alleviating
unemployment. Mr Delors is said to be determined to bypass finance ministers
and deliver his paper direct to heads of government at the December 10-11
summit.
The Commission's 'Broad Guidelines for the Economic Policies' of the 12
member states was published according to provisions in the Maastricht
treaty. Commission officials said the document had taken on added
significance as a framework for policy-making after the collapse of the
exchange rate mechanism.
The guidelines agreed by the Commission yesterday include a general call for
cuts in interest rates, wage restraint, lower budget deficits and government
debt, as well as higher investment and alterations in the tax system.
The paper must still be approved by EU finance ministers.
The only specific targets include an average inflation rate of no more than
2-3 per cent in the EU by 1996, against 3.8 per cent this year, and wage
rises to be kept below one percentage point of productivity growth. The
paper also urges member states in 1994 to prevent any further deterioration
in their budget deficits.
Mr Henning Christophersen, European commissioner for economics, said there
was never any intention to set specific macro-economic targets. 'This is not
a planned economy,' he said.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Regional finance centres need a lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cheaper services offered by Europe's regional financial centres has done
little to weaken the dominance of London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan.
Manchester Business School yesterday published a study of 17 regional
centres in the European Union which found that the cost of communications
was favouring the increasing centralisation of big decision-making in London
and Paris, and acting as a brake on the development of regional centres.
Air fares are as much as 22 per cent higher between regional centres and
their financial capitals - and for region-to-region travel - than for
flights between the international financial capitals themselves.
Emerging regional financial centres such as Lille, Manchester, Stuttgart or
Turin have grown in the past 10 years by offering cheaper prices in regional
markets as prices charged by 'first-tier' international centres have been
rising. However, they are making little headway in the wider European single
market, the report suggests.
Regional centres will have to develop better networks if cross-border deals
and fee-income are not to be perpetually channelled through first-tier
centres, it concludes.
Six of the second-tier cities in the study - Athens, Berlin, Brussels,
Copenhagen, Dublin and Lisbon - are national capitals but all 17 serve
comparable markets. For example, north-west England, with Manchester as its
regional capital, has a similarly sized economy to that of Greece.
London is increasingly becoming the dominant force across European financial
markets but, like Paris, has intensified its domestic competitiveness during
the recession.
Mr David Baker, a former Bank of England official who is chief executive of
Manchester Financial and Professional Forum, said: 'We need to look 10 years
ahead, and try to ensure regional centres get their fair share of European
business.'
The centres have recently formed a European association to improve their
networking led by Turin and its stock exchange. This is expected to help
them develop contacts for cross-border deals.
However, strong local leadership is also crucial. The research suggests most
regional centres suffer confusion from a plethora of promotional bodies.
Barcelona is emerging as Europe's best example of a good regional centre in
this respect, in that it promotes itself clearly and has control of its own
affairs, the report says.

FT  25 NOV 93 / VW seeks ways to reduce its costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed efforts to drag Volkswagen out of the red will head the agenda at a
meeting of the automotive group's supervisory board in Wolfsburg tomorrow.
According to independent estimates, the company is heading for a loss of
around DM2bn (Pounds 700m) this year and faces renewed challenges in 1994,
when its key domestic market is expected to shrink by at least 5 per cent.
Tomorrow's discussions will revolve around a draft agreement with unions,
expected last night, to reduce labour costs by temporarily introducing a
four-day week in VW's six German factories.
But the group chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, is also expected to seek
approval for cuts of around a third in his medium-term investment programme.
He will also be closely questioned on the group's relatively poor showing in
Europe this year and his plans for rebuilding its loss-making US and
Japanese operations.
The circumstances surrounding the Seat subsidiary's unexpected crash into
losses of at least DM1.25bn this year will feature prominently in a report
prepared by independent auditors, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, on the orders of
Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the watchdog supervisory board.
The document, sent to board members yesterday, is believed to blame poor
financial controls and reporting systems. Seat's losses, first discovered in
late summer, followed the collapse of a new business plan, drawn up on Mr
Piech's orders earlier in the year, and designed to generate a break-even
result.
Analysts suggest the group's 1993 results will be pushed further into the
red by the costs of closing Seat's Zona Franca plant in Barcelona and
redundancy payments.
The KPMG report also confirms that investigators have been unable to find
any evidence that industrial secrets allegedly stolen from General Motors by
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM director and now Mr Piech's
top production executive, have been used by VW.
Criminal investigations are still under way against Mr Lopez in Germany and
the US, following his abrupt departure from GM in March, and Hamburg
prosecutors are also examining a possible perjury charge against him.
The group's difficulties have worsened dramatically in the course of this
year, dashing Mr Piech's early hopes of a break-even in his first year of
office.
Although the company says it expects to sell 1.4m VW marque vehicles in
1994, unchanged from this year, business plan forecasts drafted at Adam
Opel, the local GM subsidiary, say total new registrations in the German car
market - VW and Opel's main outlet - will reach only 3.02m compared with
3.2m this year and 3.93m in 1992. The industry total will slide below 3m in
1995, according to the Opel projections.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Euro court wags finger at litigious retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has issued a stern warning that it is fed up
with examining complaints from big retailers against national restrictions
which have no effect on cross-border trade.
The ruling comes in the wake of a series of cases brought against national
laws which prohibit Sunday trading.
Court officials said the European judges wanted to deter retailers from
making similar challenges in the future unless they can prove that national
rules are discriminatory and a hindrance to the free movement of goods - one
of the central planks of the single European market.
'There's an increasing number of these cases and I think their lordships are
thoroughly sick and fed up with them,' said one court official yesterday.
The warning comes in the form of a judgment yesterday on a test case brought
by two French supermarket chains against national laws which prevent
retailers from selling everyday products at a loss to bring customers into
their stores.
The European Court ruled that the national legislation restricting use of
'loss leaders' was compatible with European law. The judgment means two
managers from the big French supermarket chains Cora and Coop could be
prosecuted for flouting the rules.
The last British case of this sort to be judged by the Luxembourg-based
court was in December 1992, when the court decided that rules restricting
Sunday trading in England and Wales were not contrary to European law.
British stores are unlikely to bring another challenge in the near future,
because of the imminent debate in the British parliament on a new bill to
reform the laws on Sunday shopping.
The most important European judgment on the free movement of goods was the
celebrated Cassis de Dijon case in 1979. That judgment paved the way for the
single market by holding that national technical requirements could not be
used to prevent the free movement of goods unless justified by public
interest objectives such as health or consumer protection.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Tietmeyer scorns UK recipe for 'recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European governments should not try to buy their way out of recession with
interest rate reductions and devaluations, the Bundesbank president warned
yesterday.
Increased internal competitiveness was the surest way to establish a stable
community economy, Mr Hans Tietmeyer told bankers in Bonn last night.
'Sanctioning cost increases with subsequent devaluations has regularly been
shown to be an unsuitable recipe,' he said.
Such policies - as applied in Britain and often cited in the Anglo-Saxon
press as 'successful' - were hardly models for other countries.
In the first place it had to be remembered that the UK's economic recovery
was already under way before Britain suspended its membership of the
European monetary system, he added.
'It should also be noted that any competitive advantage gained from
devaluation is lost when all countries use this method.'
Companies could enjoy cost advantages only as long as wages were kept under
control and domestic inflation was not driven upwards by the higher import
prices resulting from devaluation, he warned.
Rejecting charges from German industry that the Bundesbank's strict monetary
policies had damaged competitiveness by effectively revaluing the D-Mark, Mr
Tietmeyer refused flatly to contemplate any devaluation strategy at the
Bundesbank.
He blamed companies' pay and government's fiscal policies for driving up
domestic prices and costs, and in the process unbalancing the Bundesbank's
monetary policy and contributing to the nominal revaluation of the D-Mark.
In an apparent attempt to dampen speculation that German interest rates were
due for another cut to promote economic growth, Mr Tietmeyer warned against
'false expectations' and said the bank had to be increasingly cautious when
considering further reductions.
Policy would continue to be guided primarily by monetary developments.
'This does not mean that interest rate levels and the D-Mark's external
value play no role at all. . . . but they are without doubt only of
secondary importance to money supply,' he said.
Repeating his recent calls for monetary discipline in individual member
states, Mr Tietmeyer said public discussions on when a return to narrow
bands within the European exchange rate mechanism might be possible were far
from helpful.
It was more important to concentrate on economic convergence and restoring
the EMS's lost credibility.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Italian parties raise hopes of passing budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's main political parties last night appeared to have reached a broad
agreement on a formula to ensure parliamentary approval for the 1994 budget
without undermining the planned austerity measures.
The basis for the agreement was laid in talks yesterday between Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, and his three economic ministers with
representatives of the principal parliamentary parties.
The prospect of the budget passing through parliament with its principal
objectives in tact prompted a recovery of the lira and a modest rise on the
Milan stock exchange. In the previous two days the financial markets have
been nervous about the prospect of the Ciampi government being able to carry
out its pledge to implement a tough budget that reduces the public sector
deficit.
Mr Ciampi was obliged to call the meetings on Tuesday when it became evident
a number of deputies in the Christian and Democrat party were threatening to
withdraw their support. Their threat followed the disastrous performance of
the four-party ruling coalition in last Sunday's local elections.
In the wake of the poll, there have signs of serious strains within the
Christian Democrats, the dominant partner of the coalition. Some deputies
have openly said it is no longer worthwhile backing unpopular measures, such
as pruning the civil service, which they had never fully accepted when first
announced two months ago.
However, the Christian Democrat leadership has issued a strong call to
order. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the party secretary, said he would never be a
party to sabotaging the budget. The 1994 budget envisages raising L32,000bn
(Pounds 12.9bn), mainly through spending cuts in order to reduce the public
sector deficit to 8.7 per cent of GDP. Mr Ciampi has indicated the
government is willing to consider small amendments providing the overall
framework is unaltered.
Yesterday, representatives of the former communist Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS) indicated they would be backing the budget after seeing Mr
Ciampi. However, the PDS said it was anxious to ensure the budget was more
explicit in providing measures to combat unemployment, with a jobless total
close to 11 per cent.
As part of yesterday's meetings, the Christian Democrats and PDS were
seeking to forge an agreement on avoiding extensive amendments. That could
mean the budget passing quickly through parliament.
The Christian Democrats are also understood to be demanding that the
Northern League makes a formal commitment ot support the budget.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Brussels draws the line over visas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday approved a proposed list of 129 countries
whose citizens will require visas to enter the European Union.
But plans to draw up a 'positive' list of non-EU nationals who would not
require a visa had to be dropped following opposition within the Commission.
So far Brussels is reluctant to go further than national governments in
experimenting with its new powers under the Maastricht treaty to initiate
legislation on immigration, justice or internal affairs.
But although cautious, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the internal market
commissioner, and Mr Padraig Flynn, commissioner responsible for
immigration, said yesterday that by strengthening external frontiers, the
measures proposed yesterday would help persuade EU member states to lift
controls on people at internal frontiers.
The Commission also pushed through proposed revisions to the European
convention on external frontiers, to take account of the Maastricht changes.
Justice ministers will discuss the measures at their meeting next week in
Brussels.
The proposals, including the list of nationalities requiring visas, follow
closely work done by the nine members of the intergovernmental Schengen free
travel agreement - all the EU members except Britain, Denmark and Ireland.
If approved unanimously, the proposals will also mean that EU countries will
have to recognise each others' visas.
The Schengen countries have already agreed to abolish all controls at
internal frontiers from February 1, 1994. But Britain, Ireland and Denmark
are likely to maintain certain systematic passport checks at their borders
beyond that date.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Tube power failure traps 20,000 commuters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fault in 70-year-old cabling emerged as the cause of power failure that
halted much of the London Underground network yesterday, trapping more than
20,000 passengers in tunnels.
An unprecedented breakdown of both the main power supply and an emergency
back-up system halted trains across London during the morning rush-hour.
Further trouble stopped trains during the evening peak.
Engineers struggled last night to remedy the fault, but the capital will
face the possibility of a second day of disruption today. London Underground
says no Central Line trains will run east of Liverpool Street.
The scale of yesterday's breakdown prompted calls from business
organisations, the rail unions and retailers for additional government
spending on the hard-pressed Underground system.
This year, London Underground published a study of its investment needs,
arguing for spending at least Pounds 900m a year in the next 10 years on
track, bridges, escalators, signalling and trains. It did not mention power
supplies.
Yesterday's disruption began with a power failure in west London at 7.10am.
Power was restored 20 minutes later but at 8am primary and back-up power to
much of the District, Central and Metropolitan lines failed.
More than 20,000 people on 26 Tube trains were trapped in darkened tunnels
for up to 3 1/2 hours. 'It is unprecedented for both systems to fail at the
same time,' an official said.
Engineers traced the fault to cabling on the Central Line between Bow and
Leyton, east London, but were still unsure about the exact cause of the
breakdown. Empty trains were run throughout the afternoon to test the system
and buses were used to carry passengers on parts of the Central Line.
Seventy-year-old cables are not unusual on the Underground - many escalators
are more than 60 years old. Cables are tested daily electronically while
physical inspections are carried out less regularly.
Business organisations and retailers said it was difficult to assess the
impact of such a widespread failure but the Confederation of British
Industry estimated the cost to business at tens of millions of pounds.
'It is vitally important that the government makes enough money available to
complete the Underground's modernisation programme,' commented Mr Alex Jan,
CBI transport policy co-ordinator. Oxford Street, one of London's main
shopping streets, was quieter than normal but the British Retail Consortium
said shoppers would either spend their money locally or delay their
purchases, so overall spending levels would not be depressed.
Companies reported that most employees managed to straggle into work.
Journeys that normally took an hour were taking up to three hours,
travellers reported.
London Underground said yesterday's events would form the subject of a
senior management review.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Euro Disney plunges on stock market
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group desperately trying to negotiate a
financial rescue, lost a sixth of its stock market value yesterday.
Its shares closed FFr6.20 lower at FFr27.20 in Paris and fell 62p to 318p in
London. The decline may complicate efforts by the company to restructure.
In Paris, the shares slid after heavy selling from convertible preference
holders. More than 4.14m Euro Disney shares, or 2.4 per cent of its equity,
changed hands.
The decline followed steady selling since Euro Disney, which is burdened by
heavy debt and has suffered in the European recession, disclosed an
unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 604m) for the year to
September 30.
The share price peaked at FFr160 in April 1992 and was worth FFr43.70 before
the announcement of last year's loss.
Euro Disney, with Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per
cent of its equity, began negotiations last week over the restructuring with
the 60 international banks that own its FFr20.3bn net debt.

FT  25 NOV 93 / BT halves cost of electronic checks on cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecom has reached a deal with banks and credit card companies to
halve the cost of electronic fraud checks on card purchases. BT was warned
that it might otherwise lose business to Mercury or US telecommunications
companies.
BT has agreed a new pricing structure with credit and debit card companies
for 'on-line' verification of transactions that cuts prices in return for
higher volumes. It might save banks a total of about Pounds 25m annually
within three years.
Mr Peter Macleod, BT's sales director, said yesterday that BT believed it
could reach similar deals, discounting price in return for higher volume, in
other corporate markets. He said BT had responded rationally to competitive
pressures.
Banks will be charged less per call the more on-line checks they make. Seven
banks process transactions, and they were represented in talks, as were the
Visa, Switch, Diners Club, American Express and Mastercard groups.
BT could not disclose the new prices because individual contracts were being
discussed. Banks said the cost per call would fall to between 2.5p and 3.5p
next year, and to between 1.9p and 2.9p by 1996.
BT has established a new network called 0800 Cardway Dial to handle the
calls. Mr Macleod said: 'I think we have stolen a march on AT&amp;T (the US
telephone company) and Mercury. No doubt they will respond in due course.'
Mr Mervyn Gibson, Visa's director of interbank processing, said banks had
co-operated because of the growth in card fraud. 'That galvanised them. If
it had not been for fraud, they would have just haggled by themselves,' he
said.
About 200m checks are expected to be carried out this year, about a fifth of
card transactions. Banks think the share of transactions checked may rise to
45 per cent by 1996, giving an annual volume of 1bn calls. Banks have blamed
the high costs of calls for the fact that relatively few purchases have been
checked until now. Some 90 per cent of card transactions are authorised in
the US, and all Visa purchases there will be checked from next May.
BT announced Pounds 125m price cuts aimed mainly at residential users this
month. It faces competition for domestic corporate services from Mercury,
and AT&amp;T is also seeking a licence to compete in the UK.
Banks have become worried about the rapid growth of fraud in recent years.
Fraud cost the industry about Pounds 165m last year, but the figure is
expected to fall at least 10 per cent this year because of added security.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Molyneaux calls for new N Ireland assembly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux (above) yesterday urged Mr John Major
to help set up a new Northern Ireland assembly instead of searching for a
comprehensive constitutional settlement for Ulster.
He said the groundwork for all-party talks on devolved government could be
completed within two weeks. The resumed negotiations should focus on the
creation of an 85-seat legislative assembly - the model for which was drawn
up in abortive talks last year.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Molyneaux said the Major-Reynolds initiative
was doomed to failure.

murder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two 11-year-old boys were found guilty of murdering James Bulger, the
two-year-old who was abducted from his mother, and then stoned, kicked and
battered to death on a railway track at Walton, Liverpool in February.
Robert Thompson - referred to during the trial as Child A - and Jon Venables
 -Child B - were ordered to be detained for 'very, very many years'. The
jury at Preston crown court was unanimous that the boys abducted and
murdered James, but failed to agree on whether they tried to abduct another
two year old. That charge will lie on the file.

A huge consignment of weapons destined for Northern Ireland terrorists was
seized at Teesport, Cleveland, after a joint Customs-MI6 operation. The
outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force admitted that the arms had been intended for
it. The shipment from Poland included more than 300 assault rifles,
handguns, two tons of explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The
seizure resulted from an operation that started when Polish authorities
uncovered loyalist efforts to buy arms. Picture, Page 8

FT  25 NOV 93 / Philip Morris to shed 14,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and beer group, plans a drastic
restructuring to defend its brands from low-cost competitors.
It is to close or scale down 40 plants worldwide over the next few years,
resulting in the loss of 14,000 jobs, about 8 per cent of its 168,000
workforce.
The immediate effect of the action will be to produce a Dollars 457m (Pounds
307m) charge against net earnings in the fourth quarter of 1993. Another
Dollars 495m will be wiped out by an accounting change relating to the
treatment of severance payments.
The combined effect will be to leave full-year 1993 net earnings 16 per cent
lower than last year's Dollars 4.9bn, the company said.
But Philip Morris said the longer-term effect of its action would be to
reduce operating costs by Dollars 1bn a year, producing extra funds for
investment and increasing after-tax profits by about Dollars 600m a year by
1997.
Investors appeared to welcome the cost-cutting plan. The company had already
warned that the current year's earnings would take a restructuring charge,
and the shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 1/2 in anticipation of future
profits growth.
Philip Morris's action comes as further evidence of the pressure facing
manufacturers of branded goods as consumers in depressed international
markets switch to cheaper products.
The group's brands include Marlboro - the world's biggest-selling cigarette
 -Kraft cheese, Maxwell House coffee, Vegemite spread and Toblerone
chocolate.
Earlier this year Philip Morris showed its determination to defend its US
cigarette market against inroads by low-cost competitors by reducing the
price of Marlboro and its other premium brands by 20 per cent, so provoking
a price war.
Yesterday, however, the company emphasised that the cost-cutting plans were
aimed not just at cigarette manufacturing but at all its products. Mr
Michael Miles, chairman, said they reflected the company's determination to
be the lowest-cost producer in all its core operations.
Philip Morris refused to say which plants would be closed or to offer any
geographical breakdown of the job cuts. It said most of the job losses would
come in the consolidation of manufacturing resulting from more efficient
manufacturing methods.
Some of the planned actions will be started before the end of this year,
with the company seeking to minimise the need for compulsory redundancies.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Battle begins for future of ITV: Takeovers likely as
government prepares to ease rules on regional licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday set off a 'phoney war' for the future of
independent television by proposing that each ITV company be allowed to own
two large regional licences - but not yet.
As Mr Peter Brooke's National Heritage Department talked of 'stable
movement' and 'evolution rather than revolution', the big potential
predators such as Carlton Communications and Granada sat on their hands.
Shares in most ITV companies moved up by only a few pence. That reflected
the need for both houses of parliament to approve the change, which is
unlikely before January 1, and the view that many companies are highly
priced because of takeover speculation. Mr Brooke made clear that he had
tried to balance ITV arguments that companies needed to be larger to compete
in world markets with calls for protection for the regional nature of ITV.
In London, the weekday and the weekend broadcasting licences must continue
to be held by two separate companies.
Arguments that Scottish Television and HTV, the ITV company for Wales and
the West, could be protected from takeover from other large ITV companies
were rejected. Ministers decided that the regional identity of the Scottish
and Welsh broadcasters would continue to be safeguarded by programming
obligations in their licences.
The government also rejected pleas from newspaper publishers to be able to
own more than 20 per cent of an ITV company, but promised to keep ownership
restrictions under review and to look again at the wider questions of
cross-media ownership.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow national heritage secretary, accused Mr Brooke of
causing chaos by tinkering to try to correct errors in the 1990 Broadcasting
Act.
A number of ITV companies issued bullish statements yesterday. Mr Leslie
Hill, chairman of Central, whose share price rose from Pounds 20.93 to
Pounds 21.70, said he was confident that the company would be able to become
one of Britain's leading international operators.
Carlton, the London weekday franchise holder which already owns 20 per cent
of Central, is widely expected to pounce - when it considers the time is
right.
Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian Television, franchise holder for southern
England, said the changes would allow the company to expand in the
broadcasting market. Meridian's natural target is Anglia Television.
Granada, which owns 20 per cent of London Weekend Television, is expected
eventually to launch a takeover bid for it. 'Everybody is looking at every
permutation. Our blackboard's covered in them,' said one ITV chief
executive.
Mr Gus MacDonald, chief executive of Scottish TV, said: 'I'm peering over
Hadrian's Wall waiting for the opportunity to invade.'
The fact that the government has decided to set a limit of two licences
makes it very unlikely that anyone will tackle financially troubled
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which already holds two licences, or try to acquire any
of the five smallest companies such as Grampian or Border.
By doing so, they would forfeit their chance of acquiring a large licence -
unless a big company sought a sweetheart deal with a tiny company before the
end of 1993 to protect its independence.

It was 40 years ago that the first locally manufactured food products of
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, were offered to the Turkish
housewife. Today the foods sector is again attracting foreign attention as
incomes rise, urbanisation gains pace and consumers become more brand
conscious.
The interest is focused on the whole range of activities from food
processing to distribution and retailing. According to Treasury figures,
foreign investment in the food, beverage and tobacco sectors outpaced any
other area in 1992 with permits for Dollars 283m approved, compared with
total investment in manufacturing of Dollars 1.2bn. The amount in 1991 was
even higher at Dollars 364m.
Much of the capital is still targeted at the domestic market, particularly
in tobacco where both Philip Morris and Reynolds have made sizeable
commitments in the past year. But there is also a significant trend in
export-oriented food manufacturing, with tomato paste and fruit concentrates
being the favoured products.
In addition, the retail industry is starting to attract big foreign names,
with Carrefour, the French stores group, due to open its first hypermarket
in the Asian part of Istanbul before the end of the year. Promodes, also of
France, is looking at a possible venture with the local Dogus Holding.
Prisunic of France is seeking a local partner. And Migros, originally a
joint venture between the Swiss and the local Koc group but now controlled
by the local partner, is rationalising its smaller stores, while increasing
the product range of its larger outlets.
Begindik, a meat processing group from Kayseri, has opened a series of
hypermarkets, including one housed under the vast Kocatepe mosque in Ankara.
Several manufacturing joint ventures have been set up. Jacobs Suchard, the
Philip Morris affiliate, earlier this year agreed with the local Sabanci's
Marsa company to market and eventually manufacture a range of confectionery
products. There remain some big players. For example, Ulker, a chocolate
manufacturer, is larger in Turkey than Nestle. But as competition
intensifies, bankers expect more mergers as foreign names, in the wake of
Turkey's move to achieve a customs union with the European Union in 1995,
buy up market share.
In 1992 Unilever took over Komili liquid oils company, in an agreed merger
in what one western banker has described as the first example of a foreign
multinational putting a value on a Turkish brand name. Corn Products of the
US, owner of the Knorr soup brand name, has bought out its local partner, in
this case another Koc company. Coca-Cola is seeking to acquire its local
bottling operations. Cargill of the US has acquired the Vanikoy glucose
operation. 'If you want to move ahead aggressively, then the only way is to
acquire the competition,' says a leading foreign food concern.
In the early days food processors were vertical operations where the
manufacturer was often involved in everything from seed production, through
cultivation to packaging and marketing. The export sector was and still is
largely in intermediate goods, many of which end up back on Turkish shop
shelves as finished products.
In the dry goods sector, Unilever was very much the pioneer. From just two
products in 1950, today the range covers some 100 brands. Unilever enjoys a
unique position in the market with a sales team of more than 400, supplying
some 2,600 wholesalers and almost a third of Turkey's 180,000 small retail
outlets or bakkals.
In 1990, Sana, Unilever's sunflower oil and one of its original brands, was
the company's largest single product worldwide. Such was its initial success
that sana is now the Turkish word for margarine. 'Ten years ago when a
housewife went to her local shop, she would ask for Sana not as a brand but
as a product name,' says Mr Taksin Tuglular, technical director of Unilever
Foods Turkey.
Today, Unilever makes sales of Dollars 800m and is the largest food company
in Turkey, with a dominant position in margarines and liquid oils. It has
recently launched its Algida ice cream range.
It remains a tough market. Total demand for margarine is decreasing, as
consumers switch to liquid oils. New entrants are also sharpening the
competition. The Turkish consumer is becoming more choosy and as a result
more importance is being placed on packaging and marketing.
Unilever's production is still targeted at the domestic market. However,
around 10 per cent of output goes to exports. Its principal markets are in
the Middle East, particularly Iraq, where Unilever is selling Vita. In the
Black Sea countries, it sells its Aymar products; but the company stresses
this is relatively new territory.
Turkey has long been an exporter of hazelnuts and other agricultural
products but the export of processed foods got under way only in the 1970s,
when the Ecevit government gave incentives to farm co-operatives. This gave
a spur to the frozen fruit and vegetable producers although a number of
operations subsequently failed through lack of capital.
A good example is tomato paste where Heinz of the US, offering technical
assistance in exchange, sourced some of its material locally. Turkey is now
the world's third largest producer, after the US and Italy. It is also the
largest supplier to the Japanese market. Indeed Japan's Kagome and Sumitomo
now have equity stakes in the Koc group's Tat Konserve, the largest local
producer.
But if the sector is really to take off, there will also have to be
significant new investment in frozen distribution infrastructure. This is a
vital constraint on the fresh product business. It is also a factor to a
producer like Unilever, particularly when launching a new product
nationally, currently the best way to expand sales in the local market.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (14): Tourism revenue
drops - Terrorist attacks frighten off visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lure of cheap holidays in Turkey has been severely diminished by this
year's spate of kidnappings and bombings by Kurdish separatists.
Visitors to Turkey plummeted from 2.8m to 2.2m in the peak months of July,
August and September, according to government figures. Earnings for the year
are likely to be well below expectations and short of last year's Dollars
3.6bn.
'Terrorism has seriously undermined revenues from tourism,' says one western
diplomat in Ankara. 'The government had hoped for Dollars 6bn from tourism
this year. That is likely to be halved because of the PKK (Kurdish
separatist group).'
Tourism is still one of Turkey's biggest single foreign exchange earners.
Last year, the country took a 1.3 per cent share of the world's Dollars
279bn income from tourism. And the government says it believes earnings will
pick up again next year.
'I am cautious about this year,' says Ms Ayse Feyizoglu, of the Turkish
tourism ministry. 'But in the long run I think the numbers should go on
increasing.'
The industry has grown rapidly since the mid-1980s when the government set
out to encourage tourism by improving the infrastructure, including roads,
hotels and airport facilities, particularly along the Mediterranean and
Aegean coast.
'In 1987, we had only 65,000 hotel beds,' says Ms Feyizoglu. 'Now there are
more than 300,000, and facilities for a further 200,000 are under
construction. In the next two to three years, we expect the number of
foreign visitors to rise to 10m a year.'
Earnings from tourism rose sharply between 1985 and 1990 as droves of
visitors, mostly from western Europe, took up the promise of a cheap and
exotic holiday, with good food and virtually guaranteed sunshine.
Between 1985 and 1990 the number of foreigners visiting Turkey jumped from
2.5m to 5.4m, with receipts from tourism rising from Dollars 1.5bn to
Dollars 3.2bn.
The rise was interrupted in the aftermath of the Gulf War, when earnings
dropped to Dollars 2.65bn in 1991. Last year, the numbers bounced back, with
7m visitors, producing receipts of Dollars 3.6bn.
However, up to September this year Turkey had attracted only 5m foreign
tourists, against 6.7m a year ago.
The latest figures, coupled with a rising number of Turks travelling abroad,
undermine government attempts to improve the country's balance of payments
position with earnings from tourism. An estimated 3.2m Turks going abroad
will reduce the net figure from tourism this year by Dollars 950,000. Turks
are expected to spend Dollars 1bn on holidays abroad next year.
Ms Feyizoglu says that Turkey is making up some of the losses from Europe
with a rising number of visitors from the south-east Asia, in particular
from Japan. Last year, nearly 28,000 Japanese tourists visited Turkey,
according to government figures, against 12,000 the year before.
After terrorist attacks on coastal resorts and kidnappings of foreigners,
the government has promised greater security at hotels and other holiday
accommodation. The slide in earnings has also prompted new minimum
regulations for the industry.
Recession in Europe has discouraged visitors from abroad, says Ms Feyizoglu.
The number of Germans, who account for the largest group of tourists in
Turkey at about 12 per cent, has declined this year by more than 5 per cent.
But officials say terrorist attacks are only part of the problem.
'The Germans also fear reprisals after neo-Nazi attacks on Turks in
Germany,' says Ms Feyizoglu. 'But no-one here would contemplate such an act
of revenge.'
Western embassies in Ankara, including those of the US, Germany and the UK,
are still warning their citizens to steer clear of south-east Turkey,
although not of the rest of the country.
Yet thousands of foreigners are staying away, for whatever reason, and next
year's official target of 8m visitors to Turkey may prove optimistic.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (13): Needlework at
the bank - Profile, Bulent Gultekin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building a market economy is harder than people realise,' says Mr Bulent
Gultekin, Turkey's new central bank governor. And he should know. As one of
the breed of international jet set economists, Mr Gultekin, when not
teaching at Wharton School in the US, has spent the last three years
advising the Poles, Uzbeks, Kazaks, Ukrainians and Belarussians on how to do
it.
He is more optimistic about Turkey's prospects however. 'In eastern Europe,
you go in a good mood and come out depressed. When you come to Istanbul,
even after Vienna, this is a metropolis. It has the same liveliness as Hong
Kong, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur or Jakarta. The lenders and creditors always
look at the current account. The institutions, the equity investors, they
notice this vibrancy.'
Mr Gultekin brings a wealth of experience to the job. A one-time adviser to
the World Bank, the EBRD, the United Nations Development Office and the US
Agency for International Development, he first came to prominence in Turkey
as a pivotal figure in the late Mr Turgut Ozal's economic reforms in the
mid-1980s, running the newly created privatisation agency.
He remembers drafting a study on the Istanbul stock exchange, when it was
still just an idea on Mr Ozal's drawing board. 'Friends in the US thought we
were a lot of science fiction writers. Now look at the market,' he says.
Turkey, he believes, is at the second stage of reform. 'The first stage was
easy. All you needed was a politician of vision, pushing changes through by
decree. We are now at the second stage. It requires something more like
needlework,' he says.
The choice of metaphor might seem appropriate as Mr Gultekin moves to forge
a working relationship with Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister - never the
easiest of tasks. When appointed, the Turkish press made life briefly
uncomfortable, forcing him to renounce his US passport. His wife is an
American.
The governor was very much a surprise choice to replace the long-serving Mr
Rusdu Saracoglu. It was a surprise to him, too. The first his colleagues at
Wharton knew of it was from the pages of the Financial Times. 'I was on
holiday in Turkey. I'd never met Mrs Ciller before. Within half an hour
she'd offered me the job.' When asked if he set any preconditions his reply
is loaded: 'I asked her whether she wanted a clerk or a governor.'
He faces a difficult job. Mrs Ciller appears intent on bringing down
interest rates, in a bid to reduce the government's debt service costs -
even if it means renewed pressure on the lira. Since she took over in June,
the depreciation of the currency has been accelerated and is now running at
around 5 per cent a month compared with around 3 per cent in the first half
of 1993. The bank reserves, while healthy at around Dollars 8bn, will need
to be sustained to see off any unforeseen volatility.
Mr Gultekin is reluctant at this early stage to outline his plans for what
he likes to call the banks' bank. But he has already shown his mettle, in
the first week in November, successfully intervening to the tune of Dollars
300m to 'stabilise' the currency. Although as a former World Bank adviser,
this is not a verb he would use, of course.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (10): Mrs Ciller
stubs her toe - Why privatisation has limped to a halt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a clapped-out car, Turkey's privatisation programme appears finally to
have limped to a halt. The process of state sell-offs was set in motion
nearly 10 years ago, but it never really picked up speed.
Turkey has raised only Dollars 1.7bn in state sales since Turgut Ozal
announced plans to liberalise the economy in the early 1980s. But
privatisation has faced formidable opposition, from the bureaucrats and
politicians with vested interests, to the unions and Social Democrats (now
the junior partner in the coalition government) fearing thousands of
lay-offs across Turkish industry.
The election in June of Mrs Tansu Ciller held out new promise. In a move to
speed up privatisation, Mrs Ciller pledged to raise as much in one year as
the programme had raised in the past decade. Seen as a moderniser and
radical economic reformer, the new prime minister seemed to have enough
support and enthusiasm to pull it off. More important, the need for revenues
had become urgent.
Mrs Ciller promised to sell Turkey's biggest state companies, including
telecommunications, electricity, oil and the motor and steel industries. The
revenues, which the government still says will reach Dollars 1.7bn this
year, are needed to ease the burden of the loss-making state sector, to
reduce the budget deficit and to dampen down inflation. It is more an
economic imperative than a political crusade.
Turkey's 34 state-run industries are expected to lose around Dollars 3bn
this year. They employ 600,000 people in more than 400 affiliates.
Economists estimate that around 60,000 jobs will have to go across state
industry if it is to become efficient.
So far this year, Dollars 350m has been raised through block sales, public
offerings and flotations on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. But the government
has no chance of reaching its 1993 target. Last month, Mrs Ciller's decree
enabling the sale of PTT, the national telecommunications company and jewel
in the state crown, was ruled unconstitutional.
The sale, of up to 49 per cent of the company, was expected to raise between
Dollars 2bn and Dollars 4bn. The constitutional court in Ankara ruled the
sale should have been put to parliament. A lower court then overturned Mrs
Ciller's proposals to restructure PTT in preparation for sale. The rulings
have thrown the whole programme into doubt.
'Telecoms was the big test case and Mrs Ciller failed,' says one western
observer. 'Not only is there no chance of selling PTT for at least a year,
but the government cannot even restructure the company. The ruling means all
major projects must be halted, there can be no investment, no transfer of
debt, nothing that was part of the move towards privatisation. Mrs Ciller
has stubbed her toe on PTT.'
Some economic analysts have questioned the wisdom of Mrs Ciller's heading
straight for the big companies: PTT, TEK, the national electricity company,
and Petrol Ofisi, Turkey's largest petrol retailer. They argue the
government should hold on to the profit-makers to secure revenues over the
long term and to reduce the burden on the state by closing the many
loss-makers that are too hopeless to be rehabilitated.
'Selling the winners is not a smart move,' says one economist in Ankara. 'It
provides a one-shot input of capital and doesn't cut the overall burden. Mrs
Ciller should start by cutting the bureaucracies and imposing a wage
freeze.'
Yet the criticisms and recent setbacks appear to be forcing a change of
tack. Mrs Ciller is pressing on with other sales and putting energy into a
campaign to answer her critics. Two weeks ago, the government's trade and
industry committee passed a further decree, despite the recent court
rulings, empowering the energy ministry to sell TEK. The company is another
of the government's showcase sales and potentially among its biggest revenue
earners. Parliamentary deputies, who sought the ruling on PTT, are now said
to be preparing their case against the restructuring and sale of TEK.
Mrs Ciller has responded to criticism from the left by promising to use
privatisation funds for job creation and redundancy payments. The priority
now is to close loss-makers and to make provisions for unemployment with job
creation programmes and special welfare provision. Revenues from
privatisation 'are earmarked for industrialisation incentives and job
creation,' government officials said two weeks ago.
Sales this year have enabled several foreign companies to build controlling
stakes in Turkish subsidiaries, and to position themselves in the market for
the larger sales. Northern Telecom of Canada paid Dollars 27.8m for a
further 20 per cent in Netas the telephone and switch manufacturer, taking
its holding to 51 per cent. Alcatel of France built its share of Teletas,
the second biggest telecoms group, to 65 per cent, buying 18 per cent of the
company for Dollars 21m.
Other stakes up for sale and attracting foreign interest include Tofas, the
Fiat car assembly subsidiary. The government has decided to sell its 21.1
per cent stake and its 18.5 per cent in the company's distributing arm,
Tofas Oto, in an initial public offering on international markets, along
with private placements in the US and Europe.
Private domestic companies have bought up state competitors. Earlier this
year, Rumeli Cement bought out three state cement makers for a total of
Dollars 135m, and Ercimsan paid Dollars 31m for another small cement
company. Rumeli's sister company. Rumeli Electric paid Dollars 114m for
minority holdings in two electricity utilities.
Such sales are small beer against the larger sell-offs stalled by the
constitutional court. There are many companies still to come to market.
Among the large companies planned for sale in the next few years are Petkim,
the petrochemicals company, which the government says needs substantial
investment, and the Turban hotel chain, which operates a tourist agency,
four marinas, and 19 hotels and holiday villas.
Such companies might well be an enticing prospect for an overseas investor,
and the need for foreign money might yet strengthen Mrs Ciller's hand.
Much will depend on municipal elections in March, and the prime minister's
future relationship with the Social Democrats, on whom she is relying to
mediate with the unions.
Mrs Ciller has won few friends in her attempts to sell Turkey so far. She is
accused of naivety, even arrogance, in trying to push sales through in the
face of an entrenched bureaucracy and wider opposition.
As one western diplomat says: 'Whichever way she does it, she'll get
political flak: from the unions, from her coalition partners, from the
courts. It's impossible to make rational policies in such circumstances. Mrs
Ciller is up against bureaucratic gridlock and parliamentary constipation.'

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (11): Jostling for
the best spots - The Petrol Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look out towards the Bosporus from Istanbul's western hillside, along the
roads winding down to the coast, and you will see some familiar brand names.
Turkey's retail petrol operators are jostling with the oil majors, including
Shell, Mobil and BP, for the best spot in a fast-growing market.
The multinationals and a handful of smaller operators have dotted the
country with retail outlets, taking on Petrol Ofisi, the state-owned fuel
distribution company, for market share. Competition is fierce.
'It is typical of the state of the market in western Europe 30 years ago,'
says one industry observer. 'In some areas, you'll see five or six petrol
stations on one spot, and some will be the same company. The strategy is
simple. The big operators want to build presence.'
By concentrating in urban areas, the multinationals have dented Ofisi's
share of sales. Between 1991 and 1992, the company lost an estimated 17 per
cent to the oil majors in the cities, including Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.
The trend is continuing, although Ofisi is trying to fight back by
modernising and by shifting focus to the busy urban market.
Petrol Ofisi's share of total sales has dropped from 62 per cent in 1988 to
just under 50 per cent today, according to industry estimates. Shell, Mobil,
BP, and Turkpetrol - a joint venture including Burmah Castrol of the UK -
have just over 44 per cent of sales between them, with the rest split
between a handful of relative newcomers, including Total and Elf. Shell
leads the foreign operators with about 13.7 per cent, Mobil has about 12.6
per cent, Turkpetrol has 9.8 per cent and BP 8 per cent. Total, which
entered the market in 1991, has built a 3.5 per cent share.
Petrol Ofisi argues that it has recently recouped sales, although it runs
more low-volume, low-income petrol stations than the multinationals, which
have closed such outlets in favour of the more lucrative city sites.
The cities produce the bulk of the sector's income. Istanbul alone accounts
for about 40 per cent of the car-owning population, and is expected to
produce market growth rates of at least 5 per cent annually in coming years.
The number of cars and trucks on Turkey's roads has more than doubled in the
past 10 years from 1.35m in 1983 to more than 3m today. The demand for cars
is growing faster than for trucks, fuelled by rising household incomes and a
growing population. Total petroleum product sales, including transport fuel,
lubricants and heavy fuel oils, rose 3 per cent to 16.6m tonnes last year,
of which about 10m tonnes were sold at the petrol pumps.
Growth in the number of retail outlets - about 7,000 - has slowed in recent
years. The oil majors are now waiting to pounce on Petrol Ofisi's network of
4,300 outlets when the company is privatised. The sale was expected to take
place in the next year, though the timing is now unclear because of recent
setbacks in the government's privatisation programme.
Petrol Ofisi dominates in rural areas, and it still has a large share of
sales in the cities. In addition to its general sales, the company supplies
fuels and lubricants to the police, military and the public transport
system. Last year, Ofisi made pre-tax profits of Dollars 100m, well below
its potential, according to industry analysts, and little more than the rate
of inflation. Turnover rose 61 per cent to Dollars 2bn and sales so far this
year are up by about the same amount.
The government, which wants to attract foreign investment, plans to sell at
least 15 per cent of the company, possibly selling a strategic stake to a
single buyer. Industry analysts say the nature of the sector militates
against the sale of only a small portion of the government's 96.1 per cent
holding, partly because it would leave control with the government, but also
because the best of the company could be sold at the outset: 'Any buyer
would want the best of the network, and once that has gone, what is there
left to sell?'
A foreign buyer would want to restructure, closing thousands of low-volume
outlets, laying off workers and operating at international prices. All three
issues are politically sensitive for the government, which may want to
retain a controlling stake.
Petrol Ofisi employs more than 7,000 people. 'I don't know where they all
are or what they are doing,' says one industry observer. 'Virtually all the
company's retail outlets are run as dealerships, so they aren't there. Staff
could be cut by more than half and it would be much more efficient.'
Mr Mustafa Korel Aytac, Ofisi's general manager, says that the company would
like to cut staff to around 5,000. But it is a slow process, and while staff
numbers have dropped from 8,133 in 1990 to 7,144 this year, the company's
wage bill is still rising faster than inflation.
Another factor in privatisation is whether or not the government sells Ofisi
in a package with Tupras, the loss-making refining company which has about
85 per cent of the refining market.
Mobil suggests a package sale could be attractive in a fully-liberalised
market, with Tupras split into geographical sections, each containing a
refinery integrated with marketing facilities. A company such as BP, which
is more focused on retailing, would probably prefer Petrol Ofisi on its own.
The company is less capital intensive than Tupras, and virtually ready to
take over. Any buyer, though, would need to secure access to refining if
Ofisi was sold alone. Some of the multinationals' refining needs are met by
the Atas refinery in Mersin, operated by Mobil, Shell, BP and Turkpetrol.
Atas refines about 15 per cent of the market.
But for the multinationals, the central point is whether or not the market
is fully liberalised. They complain that the contest is uneven because pump
prices are kept artificially low. The government, keen to control inflation,
has restricted the price at which petrol leaves the refinery. Even when
crude prices are rising on world markets, Tupras has not been allowed to
raise ex-refinery rates. This enables Petrol Ofisi to discount at the pumps;
the multinationals have to match the price cut or risk losing share.
The problem is compounded by the structure of pump prices. The state takes
65 per cent in levies and taxes and 24 per cent currently goes to the
refiner. This leaves the multinationals tiny room for manoeuvre,
particularly when world crude prices are rising. They say Tupras cushions
Petrol Ofisi when prices rise, and that it absorbs some state levies.
Thus, discounting at the pumps eats directly into the multinationals'
margins. Some operators say their margins could be increased by 0.2 per cent
a day if there were no price controls.
Petrol in Turkey is the cheapest in Europe, according to industry analysts.
Premium sells at around 65 cents a litre. Diesel, which accounts for 65 per
cent of the retail market, sells at around 43.5 cents a litre. Unleaded, at
64.5 cents, takes barely 1 per cent of sales.
With economic growth estimated at between 5 and 10 per cent annually in the
next few years, Turkey's petrol market has the highest growth potential in
Europe, according to industry analysts, but the market has to change.
'Profit margins are still substantially lower than in western Europe, but
that will change as the market is deregulated. It won't produce a pot of
gold, but there is great potential.'

'We've decided to drop the p for project and the z for zone,' said the
Turkish foreign ministry official, trying to explain why there seemed to be
a word missing from the title of the newly formed Black Sea Economic
Co-operation.
Agreeing a name will probably turn out to be one of the easier tasks, as
officials try to jump-start this fledgling trading body of 325m consumers
which Turkey initiated in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Today, more than a year after its fanfare inauguration, the world's youngest
trading organisation is making steady, if slow, progress. It now boasts a
secretariat housed in the grounds of the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul. The
building was originally used by the sultans to shelter during the
earthquakes that periodically shake the city.
Not an inappropriate choice of site, some might say. For the thrust of the
BSEC may be economic and commercial, but as Georgian president Eduard
Shevardnadze once warned, the idea could be 'still-born' unless the region's
various political disputes are resolved.
'It's an achievement every time they meet together,' says a western official
in Ankara. At the first - and so far only - BSEC summit in June 1992, the
real prize should have gone to the official who arranged the seating. After
all, as many as seven of the 11 members were in open dispute with each other
 -Romania and Moldova over the Dnieper; Ukraine and Russia at loggerheads
over the future of the Black Sea Fleet; Russia and Georgia over Abkhazia and
perhaps the biggest obstacle to regional peace the ongoing conflict in
Nagorno Karabakh, between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The idea, though, is a laudable one - to help boost trade ties between the
region's market economies and the former Comecon bloc. As Mr Ercan Ozer of
the Turkish foreign ministry puts it: 'The driving force, the locomotive, is
to be the private sector. You shouldn't put a label on the BSEC. It is sui
generis.'
And what progress there has been is largely the result of the energy and
vision of Turkey which is footing the bill, at a time when its own budget is
under strain.
The BSEC today comprises Turkey, Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova,
Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan with latecomers Albania and Greece.
Officials say the club is open to new applicants. Poland has observer status
and Belarus is considering a similar move. But joining is the easy part.
Achieving concrete results is more difficult.
Organisationally, the work load is split between an international
secretariat representing national governments and a parliamentary assembly
to agree the implementation of legislative changes needed to underpin trade
relations.
For Turkish officials, some of the teething problems should have been easier
to predict than others. The parliamentary assembly, for example, was meant
to comprise 70 members; however both Greece and Bulgaria currently choose
not to participate. Finding the staff to run the secretariat has been
bedevilled by other, more unusual, coincidences. As one official explains:
'We did in fact appoint a Russian in charge of financial affairs. But after
recent events in Moscow, we have no idea of his fate.'
The objective is to improve on the current negligible trade volumes within
the region, and co-ordinate policy in such areas as telecommunications,
energy and port and road infrastructure development. A separate agreement
has been made by Black Sea states to address the environmental issues.
The region's industries, within the communist bloc, were typically organised
so as to be dependent on Moscow. Today they need to reforge those links.
However, this time relations will be based on mutual agreement and benefit.
The long-term hope is that these economies, while competing with each other,
may find new areas of co-operation.
Turkey's trade relations with the region have had a scatter-gun quality
since the Soviet break-up, but the trend is improving. In the first half of
1993, imports from the former Soviet republics more than doubled to Dollars
1bn while exports increased 60 per cent over the same period in 1992 -
Russia and Azerbaijan accounting for the largest share.
Other areas have produced immediate dividends. In Romania, Turkey now has
some 3,000 registered companies in Bucharest. Turkish beer is now being
bottled in Romania. Coca-Cola's Turkish bottling operation is supplying the
Romanian market. Turkish bakers are said to have a virtual monopoly of bread
production in the Romanian capital.
Groups such as Penta say counter-trade or barter is an indispensable part of
a trader's armoury. To help oil the wheels, some Turkish businesses have
sought out partnerships with international counter-trade firms.
However, the markets are difficult. Interbank, a small privately owned
Istanbul bank, joined up with the Finnish concern Kaukomarkkinat, hoping to
take advantage of its partner's knowledge of trading with the Comecon
countries. However, today their joint venture has been liquidated. And as Mr
Melih Araz, the head of Interbank, says: 'When you get into a dispute on
every shipment, why do it?'
But Mr Ozer of the foreign ministry has a different perspective. 'You're not
dealing here with Africa. Remember all these countries have some basic
industry and an educated manpower.'
In the short term BSEC officials believe the best they can hope to achieve
is to address businessmen's day-to-day problems, such as visas, and legal
questions such as protection of investment and the implementation of double
taxation codes.
Institutionally, there is an urgent need to compile a statistical base.
About the only fact on which officials currently agree is that the BSEC's
trade with the rest of the world is falling.
Where governments can also play a part to further business activity is in
such areas as telecommunications. A fibre optic sub-sea cable is to link
Istanbul with Varna, Costanza and Moldova. Turkey's Eximbank is expected to
provide financial support. Already officials claim that 40 per cent of the
cable traffic has been pre-sold. Separately, agreement has been reached for
a Dollars 60m cable, running from Russia and the Ukraine through the Black
Sea and eventually to Italy.
The idea has even been mooted to extend the cable to Israel, to facilitate
contacts between Israel and Jewish immigrants still in Russia. Georgia,
Azerbaijan and Turkey have a fibre optic and radio telephone link. The
launch of Turkey's Turksat satellite next January will allow further
collaborations.
In the transport sector too, the BSEC is considering a Greek suggestion to
create a corridor connecting all the littoral cities of the Black Sea.
Officials say Greece is keen to use its experience in port construction.
Romania has also proposed a scheme to upgrade Turkey's Samsun harbour so
that freight arriving in the Black Sea via the Danube could be loaded onto
trains to reach the Mediterranean across Turkey rather than add to
congestion in the Bosporus.
Next month, the organisation faces perhaps its biggest test when foreign
ministers of the 11 member states meet in Sofia to finalise the launch of a
trade and development bank. According a draft of the memorandum to be
agreed, the bank is being set up to 'finance and promote regional projects
. and to assist in encouraging intra-regional trade especially in capital
goods.'
All member countries have agreed their contributions to the bank's capital
structure, although this is not to say they have yet committed the funds.
The main sticking point is likely to be the site. Istanbul, Sofia,
Bucharest, Costanza and Thessalonika are all bidding to host the bank
headquarters.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (7): Industry
prepares to lobby on tariff cuts - Businesses are worried as the customs
union deadline approaches
</HEADLINE>

In Turkey, Euro-sceptics were once a rare breed. Not any longer, it seems.
With the government preparing to cross the the historic threshold and enter
a customs union with the European Union in 1995, many Turkish businesses are
awaking to the fact that Turkey's trade policy will very soon be determined
by the grey men in Brussels.
Europe is vital to the Turkish economy. The EU already accounts for 50 per
cent of Turkey's exports. In turn, Turkey takes close to 40 per cent of its
imported goods from the EU. Total trade between Turkey and the EU is
expected to exceed Dollars 20bn in 1993. The EU accounts for more than half
of Turkey's total foreign investment.
Under the terms of the additional protocol of the 1963 Ankara Association
Agreement with the EU, Turkey will reduce its high tariff wall. That is
expected to result in increased capital flows to Turkey. The broader impact
is that competition from EU imports will encourage greater efficiencies and
force companies to upgrade their technologies. Turkey will also be required
to introduce legislation to harmonise Turkish trade and commercial policies
with the EU countries.
In parallel with the customs union negotiations, convergence in services is
proceeding apace. Under a new law, the banking industry recently saw changes
in capital ratios which bring it more in line with European standards. One
of the remaining restrictions on foreign banks is a requirement that paid-up
capital is converted into Turkish lira. Foreign banks are thus required
repeatedly to inject new capital, as inflation takes its toll. New rules
have been recently introduced for the insurance sector.
The two sides have also outlined a raft of legislative changes which should
be in place to complement the customs union. The issues cover intellectual
property rights, state aid and competition policy. This might seem like a
heavy workload for Turkish legislators, given the current snail's pace with
which bills secure passage through parliament.
However, officials point out that should there be an agreement of the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Turkey would
have to comply with many of these pieces of legislation to meet its Gatt
obligations.
Commission officials make clear that the implementation of a customs union
is a technical exercise which does not require any further treaty
negotiations. It does not even have to be ratified by the European
parliament. To meet the deadline, Turkey will have to reduce tariffs and
non-tariff barriers to zero, while adopting the EU's common commercial
tariff for third countries.
Turkey would, in addition, be required to assume the EU's preferential trade
policies and defensive measures such as anti-dumping towards third
countries. This would apply to the voluntary restraints with Japanese car
imports, as well as preferential trade arrangements with the Maghreb and
other Middle East countries including Israel and Jordan.
Customs union will have a sectoral impact on Turkish industry, as well as
budgetary ramifications for the government. On the budgetary side, the
government calculates the loss of import duties at about Dollars 3bn,
including the scrapping of the Mass Housing Fund, now levied on a range of
luxury goods imports. This figure would be offset by an increase in import
volumes which would add an estimated Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn to
Turkey's already large trade deficit. The EU is now understood to be
considering ways to provide the Turks with some form of financial
assistance, which avoids being blocked by the use of the Greek veto.
For many Turkish industries, the tariff cuts represent a considerable loss
of protection. Today, according to EU calculations, the average protection
rates for a sample of 501 industrial products are still around 15 per cent,
despite a reduction of 6 per cent at the start of 1993. The Treasury is now
compiling the details of the import regime for 1994. 'There will have to be
a strong signal that the government is going ahead with customs union,' said
one European Commission official.
The Commission's concern is that some powerful industries are preparing to
lobby to see protection retained beyond the deadline. The sectors - motor
vehicles, white goods and packaged foods - are seen as particularly
vulnerable. Commission officials are adamant that this would be in
contravention of a customs union. They also warn that some member states may
use this as a pretext to retain the current quotas on Turkish textile
imports to the Community.
With around Dollars 5bn of exports in 1992, the textiles industry is
Turkey's largest exporter, accounting for 36 per cent of the country's total
export earnings. Turkey is already the biggest supplier to the EU despite
the quotas, accounting for 10 per cent of EU textile imports. The removal of
quotas would provide a welcome boost to the industry.
The motor vehicle sector, on the other hand, is bracing itself for an cold
blast of competition. The industry is dominated by the local operations of
Fiat of Italy and Renault of France. Local producers currently enjoy very
high protection. On passenger vehicles less than 2,000cc, import taxes are
charged at 39 per cent.
The car sector is now rushing to reinvest in new lines, and introduce new
models to compete against imports. The threat to market share is not so much
from EU manufacturers, who already account for the top end of the market.
The main concern is over increased shipments of Skodas and Ladas from
eastern Europe, once Turkey adopts the EU's common external tariff of 10 per
cent. Car imports are already growing at 80 per cent, compared with an
increase in domestic production of around 25 per cent.
Foreign investors, too, are expected to have to rethink their strategies in
Turkey. For foreign companies already manufacturing in Turkey, it will make
sense to source more of their industrial inputs to EC countries. Philip
Morris, the US cigarette producer, going one step further, now argues it
will be cheaper to import finished products from one of its EC subsidiaries
than manufacture at the newly installed Dollars 400m investment near Izmir.
The broader impact is that Turkey will no longer be attractive for companies
seeking to get behind high tariff barriers. The trend will be to sectors
where Turkish production offers cost-competitiveness, economies of scale and
suitable levels of technology. One area that is now attracting interest is
the food processing and food retail and distribution sectors.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (9): First of the
raiders - Profile, Cem Uzan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The black leather furniture and the abstract canvas are the props of tycoons
all over the world. Only the insistent drone of the nearby mosque reminds
one that this is old Istanbul, not Milan or Manhattan.
The office is that of Mr Cem Uzan, 32, who is Turkey's youngest and brashest
businessman, and the country's first corporate raider.
Rumeli Holding, the family's flagship company, today boasts assets worth up
to Dollars 1bn, after a programme of acquisitions which has taken the
business scene by storm. In less than a year, the company has staked a claim
to a place among Turkey's top five groups.
Rumeli was active in the early 1980s in building infrastructure for the
Libyan oil industry. The family then acquired two small banks - Adabank and
Imarbank. With Mr Uzan's return from university in the US, the group
ventured into television, exploiting the technology which allowed it to beam
in from Germany, thus sidestepping the constitutional ban on private
stations.
InterStar was Turkey's first private TV station and now has close to 25 per
cent of the sector's advertising revenues.
This year, the Uzans embarked on a spending spree, forking out close to
Dollars 500m worth in asset purchases. The government's bid to speed up its
privatisation programme provided the richest pickings, the group
concentrating on sectors which are least affected by the threat of import
competition as Turkey moves to a customs union with the European Union.
The Uzans bought five state cement factories, in the process outbidding a
number of foreign cement concerns.
The acquisition of power utilities in Adana and Antalya has given the group
a strong presence in the sector ahead of government plans to privatise TEK,
the electricity monopoly.
The company is now trying to position itself in telecommunications with
moves to set up with Alcatel of France on Turkey's GSM system, the
pan-European digital standard which will allow countries across Europe to
use the same cellular system. With this link-up, Rumeli is well placed for
eventual flotation of the telecom arm of PTT, the state post and telephone
monopoly.
Mr Uzan likes to put a diplomatic gloss on his swashbuckling business style.
'As long as there are mutual benefits, there are alliances. If there are
benefits that collide, then there's competition,' he says.
On other areas, he is less forthcoming. 'As a private holding company, we
don't publish financial figures. But there is no external borrowing on the
series of transactions .. It's all being internally financed.'
His business methods have not always been transparent. When a Turkish
business magazine carried a cover story on the family, Mr Uzan had the
entire staff sacked. The story alleged that in 1990 the group orchestrated a
run on Imarbank, so as to avoid paying interest on time deposits. The bank
had been offering the best rates in the market. Whatever the truth, it was a
brilliantly executed exercise. Depositors withdrew their savings and then,
seeing how the bank had managed the crisis, piled back in. Imar Bankasi is
now one of the best capitalised of the private banks.
Mr Uzan's battles continue. Star is engaged in a war of words - and ratings
 -with Show, its main rival. Show's owner, the banker, Mr Erol Aksoy, has
been labelled a 'son of a Greek' - and in Turkey, that rates as an insult.
If that was not enough for Mr Uzan's lawyers, the group also has ongoing
court actions against Mr Asil Nadir, the Turkish Cypriot businessman, and Mr
Ahmet Ozal, son of the former president, not to mention with Cumhuriyet,
Turkey's only serious newspaper.
Mr Nadir says he still owns the land on which Media Print, a business he
sold to the Uzans, is located. Gunaydin, Mr Nadir's former newspaper, sought
court bankruptcy from its creditors, creating a new title under which it now
prints. Cumhuriyet took similar action. Both newspapers owe money to the
Uzan banks.
The takeover of the privatised Cukurova electricity utility proved even more
controversial. The Uzans paid over Dollars 80m for an 11.25 per cent stake
in the Adana-based utility, then solicited shareholders' proxy voting rights
to gain control in a move criticised by the Capital Markets Board, the
government's watchdog agent.
Finally, there was a series of tense negotiations with members of the
Sabanci family. Through Akbank, Sabanci owned 5 per cent of the Cukurova
stock. 'They tested us, we tested them. It was all in a civilised manner.
There is no big room for bitterness in business. When you grow, I think it's
inevitable you tread on people's toes,' says Mr Uzan.'
So rapid a diversification of interests might be a cause of concern, but Mr
Uzan points out: 'All the acquisitions represent monopolies. There is
practically no competition now and none in the foreseeable future. In terms
of profits, we don't like competition.'

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (9): Thrifty from the
cradle up - The wooing of the small investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium has the highest savings rate among European Union members. Small
investors are important people on the country's investment landscape.
But it is too early to see whether sweeping changes to taxation on
investment revenues, agreed by the government as part of a national plan to
increase growth and jobs and balance the Treasury books, will influence
small investors' choices. In order to retain the support of its socialist
coalition partners, the government balanced social security spending cuts by
raising taxes on unearned income.
Whether or not their damp, dreary climate is the reason, the average Belgian
sets aside 25 per cent of his or her disposable income for a rainy day
(according to the Ministry of Finance).
A recent survey by the International Savings Bank Institute found Belgian
thriftiness surpassed only by Japan, Switzerland and Singapore. Each Belgian
citizen, the institute found, has an average of Pounds 11,222 stashed away
in a bank account.
The large amount of cash sloshing around in Belgium partly results from
Belgian tax laws. Belgium still has one of the highest income tax levels in
the EU. According to economists, Belgians like to keep their money handy, in
case a larger than expected tax bill drops through the letter box. More
cynically, high taxes means that tax evasion is a national sport - the
guilty need to invest away from the sight of the tax inspector.
A Belgian's wealth is staggering. Economists at Generale de Banque,
Belgium's largest bank, found that the average Belgian household has BFr7m
(Pounds 130,OOO) invested in property and financial products - increasingly,
since the early 1980s, in the latter. According to the 1991 Generale de
Banque survey, 33.9 per cent of Belgian wealth was invested in property, 66
per cent in savings accounts, government bonds, life insurance and shares.
The high savings rate in Belgium is one of the main reasons why, until
recently, the government did not feel compelled to deal with its debt
problem. In fact about 80 per cent of government's huge borrowings in
Belgian francs is owned either directly via the purchase of government
bonds, or indirectly through banks investing in government bonds.
Belgians have been purchasing government bonds since the second world war,
but before 1990 government bonds were not the obvious choice for the small
investor. The products were complicated; it was difficult for individuals to
understand what they were buying. So the government launched a new two-tier
debt instrument system, with linear bonds for larger and institutional
investors and bonds sold over the counter directly to retail clients - known
as Philippe bonds after Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister, who dreamed
them up. Priced at about Pounds 2,000, and announced on the radio, Philippe
bonds have been very successful. Even during the Belgian franc's recent
roller coaster ride on the foreign exchange markets, small investors
remained loyal and held on to their bonds.
'Generally, the small investor doesn't plan to trade his or her bonds, but
hangs on to them until maturity. They are not nominative, so even if an
owner dies they can be passed on to children,' says Mr Jean-Daul Hologne, an
economist with Banque Bruxelles Lambert. National investors are also less
concerned about the effects oPounds currency fluctuations.
The government's decision to increase taxes on the interest earned on bonds
and fixed-term interest accounts to 13.4 per cent from 10.3 per cent, part
of a package of reforms, is unlikely to dampen the Philippe bond's
popularity. The amount by which to raise the tax was carefully negotiated
between the banks and the government so as not to spark a capital flight to
neighbouring Luxembourg, where there is no withholding tax, but at the same
time to increase government revenue.
The economic reforms will also have an inflation-reducing effect, by
adjusting the basis on which the consumer price index is calculated, pulling
out tobacco, alcohol and diesel oil from the list, adding to the bond's
popularity.
Another important Belgian financial instrument for the retail investor is
the Sicav Capitalisation investment funds, said to total around BFr600bn.
Most of the funds invest in short-term Belgian franc treasury certificates
and are exempt from withholding taxes. In order to prevent a capital flow
from government bonds to Sicavs, at the same time as it raised its
withholding tax rates, the Belgian government also raised Sicav entrance
taxes. Furthermore, it raised taxes on switching operations within the fund
to 1 per cent 0.35 per cent - and the duty charged when an investor takes
money out of the fund, from0.5 per cent to 0.35 per cent.
'We have a very distorted flow of funds. People pay a lot of money to the
government but they are also paid a lot back in interest. The flow of funds
between households and the government is too large compared to the amount of
money invested in business,' explains Mr Verfaille./ Check. Who he?
'Belgians still trust the state to repay and they get a good yield from
bonds. Investors, on the other hand, don't trust the Belgian stock market
because of its illiquidity.'
The government would like to inject more dynamism into the Belgian stock
market. Despite a number of well publicised court cases involving minority
shareholders in Belgium - including the legal victory of minority
institutional shareholders in Wagon-Lit, the Belgian travel firm, forcing
Accor, the French hotel chain, to increase its offer when it bought the
company out two years ago - small investors shy from the stock market. In
fact the first moves against Accor were made by a British shareholder; the
Belgians followed afterwards.
'Even larger institutional investors often lack the independence to act  -
as was the case with Wagons-Lit for a long time, even though the injustice
was so obvious,' says Mr Pierre Nothomb, of Deminor. His consulting firm
specialises in helping minority shareholders, and launched the Wagon-Lit
minority shareholders' offensive. The interdependence of large investors in
Belgium makes it very difficult for the small outsider. So far, no
shareholders have ever taken investment funds to court in Belgium for
failing to act in their interests.
The proposed privatisation of Belgacom, the state-owned telephone company,
next year, could give the Belgian stock market a much-needed boost,
especially if it is carried out by a public share issue (as with British
Telecom.)
Meanwhile, in a bid to encourage investment in enterprises and help Belgian
firms stay out of debt, taxes on earnings from shares were cut to the same
level as taxes on interest earnings from bonds - 13.4 per cent, from 25 per
cent, as part of the government's economic reforms.
The move has received a mixed reaction from the experts. Belgium already has
two classes of shares, one with tax privileges worth about BFr30bn, targeted
at domestic shareholders - who are, say critics, are an important cause of
illiquidity in the market.
'They've scored an own goal on that one,' says Mr Philip Richards, who
analyses Belgian stocks for Smith New Court in London.
Although the new tax rates on new issues may initially appear attractive to
small investors (overseas institutional investors will not benefit from the
tax reduction, because they already pay a lower amount), they will be
'inherently illiquid, and in the long run their value would be pushed down,'
says Mr Richards.
