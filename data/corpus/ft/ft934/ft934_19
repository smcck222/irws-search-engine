FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (8): Girl's best
friend survives a crisis - Antwerp is still the diamond capital of Europe
</HEADLINE>

When Pete Sampras swept to victory in the European Union tennis
championships in Antwerp this month, he picked up a rare first prize.
Instead of the standard cheque, Sampras, the world's number one tennis
player, won a diamond-encrusted racquet. It was a testimony to the
champion's heavyweight serve, but also to Antwerp's skill in promoting
itself as the diamond capital of Europe
After a sluggish 1992, Antwerp is bouncing back.
Revelling in its designated role this year as Europe's cultural capital, the
city has devised a succession of glittering events to showcase the diamond
trade, an industry whose roots in Flanders go back to the 17th century.
Perhaps the most eye-catching was the exhibition called 'From the Treasury'
which featured more than 10,000 carats of diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and
rubies. The jewels came from the Romanov family of Russia, Thurn and Taxis
of Germany, from the late Duchess of Windsor's collection and from other
distinguished families.
The three-week-long event attracted more than 175,000 visitors, a record for
Antwerp and a considerable boost to the local tourist industry. It took
place shortly after the 26th World Diamond Congress, whose principal message
was one of cautious optimism about the prospects for a revival for the
diamond trade in 1993/4.
In his keynote speech, Mr Julian Ogilvy-Thompson, chairman of De Beers
Centenary and De Beers Consolidated Mines, said that the diamond industry
had weathered a crisis which some outside commentators had predicted would
be terminal.
Prudent intervention by the Central Selling Organisation in London (CSO: the
body which regulates the distribution of rough diamonds) had helped to bring
supply and demand in the cutting centres more into balance. Confidence was
now returning to the trade, Mr Ogilvy-Thompson told delegates.
This view is reflected in the performance of the Belgian diamond market
which saw a strong expansion in the 1980s, followed by a period of
stabilisation between 1991-2. In the past six months, the market showed
signs of a revival.
The chief reasons for the improvement were a recovery in the US; a decline
in the supply of illegally mined diamonds from Angola (which continues to be
disrupted by the civil war); and preventive action by the CSO to deal with
dumping by Russian producers on key world markets.
The downside for the producers were tighter margins, cuts in production and
multiple lay-offs. In South Africa and Namibia, De Beers laid off 4000
people - about 25 per cent of its workforce.
The raw statistics tell a part of the story. Imports of diamonds rose from
65.6 per cent in weight to 87m carats. Measured by value, imports rose by 15
per cent to Dollars 4.4bn.
Exports showed the same degree of expansion, with volume increasing by 66
per cent to 66m carats. Exports by value rose by 14 per cent to Dollars
4.3bn, with an increase in polished diamond exports to the UK, Germany,
Italy, and France, despite the persistent weakness of the European economy.
As a result, the rise in turnover to 153.6m carats was markedly better than
the 92.6m achieved in the first of 1992; meanwhile, value increased
substantially from Dollars 7.6bn (1992) to Dollars 8.7bn. Of about 45m
carats of directly imported rough diamonds of gem quality, 25m - 56 per cent
 -come from the CSO in London.
Antwerp remains the world's most important distribution point for rough
diamonds, after the CSO.
It also boasts four of the world's 20 diamond bourses which together form
the Federation of Belgian Diamond Bourses: Diamantclub van Antwerpen (which
celebrated its centenary this year); Beurs voor Diamanathandel; Antwerpsche
Diamantkring; and the Vrije Diamanthandel.
Together, the total membership of the four bourses is nearly 6000, with more
than 1200 offices.
They have come a long way since the old polishing factories of the 1860s,
many of which were steam-driven. Today, electronic data processing has
transformed the operation of the diamond trade and industry, breaking down
distances and speeding up communications.
If there is a darker side to the new age, it is that Belgian's diamond
industry faces ever tougher competition, particularly from rival centres in
the Far East which can exploit lower wages and costs.
Smaller Belgian manufacturers are therefore pressing for regular supplies of
rough diamonds which are traded through Antwerp, while others are urging
younger members of the industry to come up with new technological
breakthroughs to improve competitiveness.
On the other hand, the Far East clearly offers enormous potential as a
consumer market, particularly in China.
Last February the Diamond High Council organised a visit to Asia which
included stops in the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong. Local traders in
Manila lobbied hard for deregulation of the industry in order to exploit its
potential as an important foreign exchange earner.
Mr Ogilvy-Thompson is cautiously optimistic about the future. But he warns:
'There will be no dramatic increase in business, until there is a resurgence
of world economic activity, and that, unfortunately, may still be up to a
year away.'

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (7): Facts prove
stronger than ideology - The progess of Belgium's modest privatisation
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
October 4, 1993, was an important date for the Belgian government. It was on
that day that the first piece of the the centre-left coalition's BFr85bn
four-year privatisation programme was put in place - the sale of 49.9 per
cent of CGER-ASLK, a network of insurance and banking branches.
Although the BFr35bn paid by Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services
group, more than meets the government's goal for privatisation in 1993, the
significance of the purchase was not so much its size as the speed with
which it was achieved and the way in which ideological preconceptions were
jettisoned once the sell-off got under way.
The Belgian privatisation programme is modest, mainly because Belgium did
not nationalise large chunks of its economy after the war (unlike France and
Britain). There is, quite simply, not much the Belgian government can sell
off before it runs up against the political complexities of privatising
postal and rail services - sensitive areas which even the British government
has left until last.
The current centre-left coalition took power in Belgium only 20 months ago.
Felicitously for Hill Samuel, the British merchant bank, and Petercam
Securities of Brussels, the formation of the coalition coincided with the
publication of a study they had commissioned, estimating for the first time
the value of state holdings in Belgium at a total of BFr318bn. As Petercam's
directors now freely admit, injecting some round figures into the debate
seemed to give energy to a government which had to raise money fast to curb
its growing budget deficit.
'Before that, people had only philosophical debate about it, and we said:
let's take philosophy out and find facts,' says Mr Alain Camu, a director of
Petercam and Hill Samuel.
Nonetheless, the speed with which the government moved was remarkable. This
was no hard-line Thatcherite coalition but an uneasy alliance of Christian
Democrats and socialists - not the world's most enthusiastic privatisers.
But by Christmas 1992, the government had rewarded Petercam with a mandate
to organise the sale of a 'significant' part of CGER-ASLK. A bulky
'memorandum' on the group was prepared and sold to five potential buyers in
April. By the beginning of October, the deal was signed.
The only ideological skirmish was fought last year when Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
the Belgian prime minister, upset his socialist coalition partners by
indicating that there was nothing to stop potential buyers purchasing more
than 50 per cent in state enterprises. In the end, the legislation governing
CGER-ASLK was amended with hardly a murmur from the socialists in September
this year, to allow the sale of a majority stake. Fortis now has an option
to increase its holding to 50 per cent from January 1, 1995, and the state
holding company can, if it so wishes, sell a further 9.8 per cent to the
Dutch-Belgian venture.
Mr Maurice Lippens, chairman of Fortis, says the idea of buying the
state-owned banking and insurance group had not occurred to his company
before the beginning of the year, simply because it was felt that CGER-ASLK
was not for sale.
It was at a lunch in January with Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance
minister, that Mr Lippens first suggested that Fortis would be interested.
In fact, when the interested parties were whittled down to just two, Fortis
was the only serious bidder. The other proposal, from Generale de Banque,
was to pilot CGER-ASLK to a public flotation.
Petercam points out that the government itself was not directly involved in
the day-to-day process of privatisation. The advisers dealt mainly with the
state holding company, which decided against a flotation, principally
because the price would have been unsatisfactory. Petercam points out that
the French government's sale of Banque Nationale de Paris to small
shareholders, though hailed as a great public relations success, realised
only 70 per cent of the state-owned bank's net asset value.
Generale de Banque was disappointed by the decision. Floating CGER-ASLK, or
a part of it, would have given new energy to the stock market, the bank
argued, benefiting the whole economy. But the Belgian government was
constrained by its tight timetable and tough targets for privatisation
proceeds - BFr25bn this year, BFr40bn next, BFr10bn in 1995 and the same
again in 1996. It did not have time to prepare a full-scale public
flotation.
Given the constraints, is there still a chance of a public flotation in
Belgium? Mr Maystadt has always said that Belgacom, the state
telecommunications company, might be a candidate for a public sell-off. He
is determined that part of Belgacom will be sold, possibly as early as the
end of next year.
But the government could face some stiff opposition - both from socialists
within its own ranks, and from Mr Bessel Kok, the pugnacious chief executive
of Belgacom, who argues that readying the group for pan-European
liberalisation of telephone services puts Belgacom under enough pressure,
without also having to bear the burden of a quick privatisation.
Easier targets for the next stage of privatisation are the credit
institutions, SNCI-NMKN (which offers credit to Belgian industry through a
network of independent agents), and OCCH-CBHK, a mortgage lender. Mr
Maystadt believes SNCI-NMKN will prove interesting to foreign banks, and
expects to begin a public auction before the end of the year.
By contrast, there is growing controversy over the sale of SNI-NIM, a state
holding company, one of the most complex candidates for privatisation. The
Antwerp-based industrial holding company, Ackermans &amp; van Haaren, has put
together a bid for SNI-NIM, in alliance with other interested parties. This
is now being scrutinised by the government.
The proposal is said to be worth some BFr18bn and is probably the most
realistic offer on the table. But it is bound to cause the government some
headaches: Ackermans has indicated that it will let its bid lapse if a
decision is not taken by the end of the year, and the Belgian finance
ministry is said to want at least BFr15bn from the sale for its 1993
accounts.
But the sensitivity of some of SNI-NIM's energy holdings - notably a 50 per
cent stake in Distrigaz, the Belgian gas distribution and supply monopoly -
means that the government will almost certainly have to consider the
possibility of taking a 'golden share' to defuse political controversy over
the sale.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (5): How TV got Gama
to Russia - The dynamism of the country's construction sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Russian troops blasted the White House building in Moscow during the
anti-Yeltsin rebellion, executives at Gama Industry in Turkey watched on
televison with particular interest. For they were working out how to put the
building back together again.
Within days of the ending of the rebellion on October 4, Gama was on the
phone to Moscow. A verbal agreement was secured on October 14, and Gama
workers were on site the next day.
It is only a small contract - Dollars 17m for the first phase of repairs -
but Gama, one of Turkey's leading construction and engineering groups, was
keen to establish a reputation in Russia.
It is a story that illustrates the relative dynamism of Turkey's private
sector. Gama is owned by its managers and other key employees, although it
is considering a stock market flotation.
Gama earns much of its income from public contracts at home. It undertakes
big infrastructure projects, including hydroelectric schemes, a new
underground rail system and residential building. But, while the government
is battling to contain costs and reduce the budget deficit, Gama is looking
overseas for new work.
'Spending on infrastructure projects is our bread and butter,' says Mr Ergil
Ersu, Gama's managing director. 'But on the other hand, Turkey has to cope
with an inflation problem. To reduce inflation, this government, or any
other government, needs to curb investment.
'A second point is that Turkey is borrowing - securing foreign financing to
support such projects. There is a limit to this  .. As much as we want to do
more work in Turkey, we realise there are limits.' The domestic market,
according to Mr Ersu, cannot be relied on in coming years to sustain
Turkey's large construction sector, which contributes about 5.5 per cent to
gross domestic product.
Along with many other companies in the sector, Gama has grown steadily by
tapping the overseas market. It is the second major push by Turkish
contractors in recent years to bolster earnings abroad because of a
tightening domestic market. Turkish construction companies produced
spectacular growth overseas in the mid-1980s because of a depression in the
industry at home in the early 1980s.
In the past year, contracts won overseas have pushed Gama earnings towards
an even split between domestic and foreign work. Turnover more than doubled
last year to Dollars 97.8m, producing pre-tax profits of Dollars 7.62m
against Dollars 3.97m in 1991. It currently has Dollars 500m contracts in
progress, and says it is close to concluding a further Dollars 500m.
Contracts secured in the past two to three years have averaged about Dollars
200m.
Gama has targeted Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of
Independent States for expansion. It believes that, despite the
uncertainties, there are vast opportunities in Russia's wide-open market.
'No matter what, even if governments change, there will be a need for our
services,' says Mr Ersu.
The company, which employs on average around 5,000 contract workers, has
operated in eastern Europe since 1985 in a joint venture with four other
Turkish contractors. Last year, Gama pulled out of the Mir Construction
partnership to build up its work as a single operator. As a result, nearly
half of its new business volume last year came from Russia.
Gama recently completed a 650-room luxury hotel in Sochi on the Black Sea
coast, in which the company retains a 16.6 per cent interest. The Dollars
35m hotel, which is due to take its first guests by the end of the year, is
operated by Radisson, the US hotels group. The contract did not produce a
huge profit for Gama, but like the White House deal, it was important in
terms of visibility.
'We see the hotel as our show case in Russia,' says Mr Ersu. 'It has the
best of everything - carpets from the UK, wallpaper from Belgium, kitchens
from Sweden, marble from Turkey.'
Gama's investment in the hotel represents a further strand of
diversification. It is shifting away from construction into property, mining
and tourism. Construction is still the core business, but, says Mr Ersu,
'there are ups and downs in contracting work, so we are investing in a way
that will provide more constant returns and improve overall cash flow.'
Other big contracts in Russia include a Dollars 78m complex in Moscow for
Gazprom, Russia's gas distribution company. Work began in April on its
36-storey headquarters, due to be completed by mid-1995. The company is also
building a Dollars 12.5m hotel and offices in Tyumen, western Siberia, to
service the oil and gas industry.
It recently completed work with Babcock and Wilcox International of Canada
on a Dollars 100m heat-waste project in Bratsk, east of Lake Baikal. The
project, for which Gama won Dollars 35m of the work, was to convert heat
generated at a pulp and paper mill into energy.
Gama's push in eastern Europe could underpin growth for the company in
coming decades. Earlier this month, Turkmenistan signed a letter of intent
with a US-Turkish consortium, including Gama, that could lead to the
construction of a Dollars 4bn natural gas pipeline across Europe. A
feasibility study on the project is under way.
The company has secured small contracts in Turkmenistan, including a Dollars
10m scheme for a mosque, financed by a Turkish government grant. But it
believes that opportunities are limited in other Turkic states, which it
says would be hard-pressed at the moment to secure western financing.
Gama is established in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia,
although it has secured fewer contracts in the region recently than it had
hoped. Elsewhere, the company signed a Dollars 50m contract last month to
build a cement plant in Malaysia in partnership with Krupp of Germany.
Several high profile contracts are under way at home. Work began in March on
the first phase of Ankara's underground metro rail system. Gama has secured
a Dollars 260m contract shared with Guris of Turkey to build a 15km line and
station from the city centre to the west, due to open by the end of 1996 or
early 1997. Other companies in the project include Bombardier and SNC
Engineering of Canada.
One of Gama's biggest contracts to date is for a 672MW hydroelectric power
dam on the Euphrates river at Birecik close to the Syrian border. Gama and
Philipp Holzmann are leading a European consortium on the DM2bn contract,
which was signed nearly a year ago. Gama says it hopes financing
arrangements will be finalised soon.
The project is a build, operate and transfer (BOT) scheme, under which the
consortium of Turkish, German, Belgian, French and Austrian contractors
build and operate the dam and then transfer it to the government under a
15-year contract. Gama has a 19.4 per cent stake, Philipp Holzmann 16.4 per
cent, TEK, Turkey's state electricity company, has 30 per cent, and the
other three companies hold smaller stakes. The financing package will be in
export credits and commercial loans. The dam, which will take more than five
years to build, is part of Turkey's south-east Anatolian project to provide
irrigation and power in the poor and arid south-east.
Gama has linked up with Thames Water of the UK on a Dollars 700m water
supply scheme for the city of Izmit, east of Istanbul. The plant was to have
been financed by government money, but it was converted to a BOT scheme when
the budget allocation was cut. Financing, which is still to be finalised,
will now come from export credits, commercial loans and direct investment by
the partners.
Gama will construct the dam and pipelines. The water treatment plant will be
built jointly with Thames Water, the majority owner, which will operate the
plant. The project is underpinned by government guarantees to buy the water
and energy.
For the moment, Gama will continue to look east, towards Asia and the CIS,
for future growth. It believes that while Ankara's politicians look west, to
membership of the European Union, it will be some time before Turkish
industry as a whole will be able to compete effectively in western European
markets.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (6): The market moves
ahead - The Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a small alley off Istanbul's dockside, young share traders stream through
the doors of a tattered building each morning and head for the trading
floor, writes Sheila Jones.
They work shoulder to shoulder, ducking past each other to buy and sell
shares in the 156 companies quoted on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
Conditions are cramped in the market's temporary home. Yet the Istanbul
exchange has produced the best performance among the world's emerging
markets so far this year. Istanbul's 60-share composite index has scaled new
heights this month. It has climbed from 4,000 at the start of the year to
around 16,500 today.
The Istanbul Stock Exchange, a baby among emerging markets, is growing up.
Ten days ago, the Istanbul market joined the 21 exchanges around the world
granted 'designated offshore securities market' status by the US Securities
and Exchange Commission. This means the procedure for companies seeking
listings overseas can be simplified, in recognition of the market's own
regulatory system.
Daily volumes on the exchange have tripled since 1991 to average Dollars 75m
this year, with 120m shares changing hands each day. Foreign investors now
account for 25 per cent of total volume. Market capitalisation, which had
reached just over Dollars 2.2bn by the end of the first-half this year, is
now estimated by the Stock Exchange to be close to Dollars 3bn, helped by
sales of shares in companies being privatised.
Like many emerging markets, the Istanbul exchange has been fuelled by
foreign interest in countries enjoying stronger economic growth rates than
in the developed economies. And while Turkey is grappling with a huge budget
deficit and inflation of around 65 per cent, the corporate sector is
producing healthy profits.
'There's no real connection between the macro side and the performance of
companies, which are continuing to do well into the third quarter this
year,' says one London broker. 'Economic growth is up 12 per cent in the
second quarter and up more than 9 per cent year on year. Annual growth will
be at least 7-7.5 per cent, so companies are thriving.'
The market is due to switch to computerised trading on December 3 with 50
less active shares and the whole market should be screen-based within 12
months.
Mr Yaman Toruner, chairman of the Istanbul exchange, believes the switch to
an automated trading system will lift volumes substantially. 'We can double
volume within a year,' he says.
The exchange has been further stimulated this year by legislation
introducing substantial tax incentives for mutual funds with 25 per cent of
shares in Istanbul-quoted companies. This has attracted more investment from
the institutions.
'Since January, the market has moved ahead mainly because of encouragement
for institutional investors, and improvements in legal procedures,' says Mr
Ozkan Gokdemir, of Carsi Securities in Istanbul. 'Many shares were
undervalued with price/earnings ratios of under 10. So the market was
cheap.'
Mr Korhan Kurdoglu, of Ata Securities, also believes Istanbul shares are
undervalued. He adds that company procedures could be further improved to
encourage investment in the market.
'Accounting and reporting procedures could be improved, and so could the
control of insider trading although there is no system that works 100 per
cent.'
The market's bull run has continued this month, helped by an easing in
interest rate policy and by the government's pledge to press on with
privatisation. Brokers say the market is eager for new issues and ready to
take whatever the government can get to the market in coming years.
While some brokers fear the market has reached the top and might be
vulnerable to profit-takers, many believe it is heading yet higher.
'There has been a tremendous run this year with the index rising fourfold,'
says Mr Emre Yigit, of Global Securities in Istanbul. 'At these levels the
majority of shares are fairly valued and the prospect of a significant
run-up in prices is not that bright. But a number of stocks are undervalued
and there are still bargains.'
Mr Yigit believes the fundamental health of corporate earnings could
underpin the market for some time. 'The corporate situation is good - some
companies are regularly clocking up earnings growth of 20 per cent,' he
says. 'And in the long run, inflation can be brought down - the causes are
not insurmountable  .. people will continue to invest in Turkey.'
Mr Atilla Yesilada, of Karon Securities, shares a belief in the market's
long-term strength, but he is cautious about the market's immediate
direction. 'My gut feeling is that it has to go down, though I don't see it
going below 12,000. But long-term prospects are tremendous  .. corporate
sector earnings are robust and the economy's growth rates are unbelievable.'
The exchange is due to move to its new Istinye premises in the business
district of Istanbul in April next year. By then, trading should be fully
automated and perhaps operating on higher volumes than ever before.
Its direction depends in part on the outcome of municipal elections next
March, and whether or not Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, can
strengthen her position, and push through privatisation and radical
restructuring of industry.
It is likely the stock market will look to the corporate sector for
direction in the meantime. And it will watch the progress of its
footballers. On November 4, the Istanbul index jumped 500 points the day
after Galatasaray knocked Manchester United out of the European Cup. Like
stock markets the world over, the Istanbul exchange enjoys a bit of good
news.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (5): Not so cosy as it
was - The banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advent of Europe's single market, together with domestic reforms to
adjust to it, have forced Belgium's traditionally cosy banking system to
take a cold look at itself. But the changes set in train are 'creeping and
discreet', as Mr Georges Martin, head of the research department at the
Association Belge des Banques (ABB), puts it.
The trend is not so much to seek the protection and weight of mergers and
alliances as to look ruthlessly at items such as costs, asset and liability
management, new sources of income, pricing, and improved risk management and
provisioning.
Such alliances as are beginning to emerge - or be mooted - in response to
competition between the biggest players. They normally take the form of
setting up Bancassurance or Allfinanz groups, selling banking and insurance
products. Almost no one in the sector foresees large-scale mergers.
The larger players are too like each other, attempting to provide a
universal banking service strongly rooted in the Belgian (or at most the
supra-regional) market, encompassing the Benelux countries and bits of
France and Germany. The entry of more aggressive outsiders such as Credit
Lyonnais, offering higher interest rates, has shaken some of the
complacency. But there is little sign of any significant restructuring of
the sector as a result.
Competition in the Belgian banking sector is not new, but it is growing.
There are now 90 banks - only 23 of them with a majority Belgian interest -
as well as a clutch of powerful private savings banks and public credit
institutions providing the most dense branch network in Europe.
Top of the league in consolidated balance sheet terms are the Big Three
private commercial banks: Generale de Banque, Banque Bruxelles Lambert
(BBL), and Kredietbank. These are closely trailed by Credit Communal,
jointly owned by all Belgium's provinces and municipalities, and ASLK-CGER,
the state-owned savings bank which has been recently half privatised.
Until the end of the 1980s, banks in Belgium could rely on earning high bond
yields from a government already well-launched into a serious public
indebtedness problem (see article on bonds), while paying out relatively low
interest on a very high stock of private savings, big chunks of which were
regulated.
Belgium's savings profile was and remains an important part of the rationale
behind maintaining a branch network which would raise boardroom eyebrows
elsewhere.
At the end of 1991, net household savings in Belgium as a portion of
disposable income was 17 per cent. This is a ratio even higher even than
14.6 per cent in Japan; 12.6 per cent in Germany; 9.8 per cent (for gross
household savings) in the UK; 4.9 per cent in the US.
Between a quarter and a third of these deposits, depending on the type of
credit institution, were remunerated at a low fixed net interest rate. These
accounts, originally designed to fund low-cost public housing, were
attractive to savers because in exchange they were exempted from a stiff
withholding tax.
The number of branches climbed to nearly 9,000, raising the number of
accounts per 100 inhabitants from 26.5 in 1965 to 97.9 in 1991. Belgium, not
a sparsely populated country, now provides a branch for every 742
inhabitants against, say, one for every 1,839 people in the Netherlands or
one for every 1,385 people in the UK.
Belgian bankers, in the main, resist suggestions that this is
over-branching, much less overstaffing. Each branch employs between a third
and a quarter of the staff numbers common in Europe, and banks have invested
heavily in automation. Since 1980, total staff costs have nearly doubled -
but ABB figures show that net profit in the sector as a whole has more than
quadrupled. Increased branching has gone hand in hand with increased
competition.
One leading economist in the sector underlines the point that judgment of
risk is more accurate at this grass-roots level, and that, for the Big Three
as much as the savings banks, a strong domestic base is essential. Mr Eric
Pollefliet, head of Kredietbank's information department, says: 'We want to
be a universal bank in the Belgian market, and to do that you have to
present in every village.'
Nevertheless, deregulation at European and domestic level is forcing
changes. The government's 1990 decision to slash withholding tax from 25 to
10 per cent has sucked savings back into Belgium from tax havens such as
neighbouring Luxembourg, but it has also sharply reduced the pool of cheap
regulated deposits. As a portion of all deposits, the latter have fallen
from 24.8 per cent in 1980 to 13.2 per cent in 1992 for the banks, and from
46 per cent to 28.8 per cent over the same period for private savings banks.
At the same time as this big shift from low to high-yielding deposits, the
government is aggressively repricing large chunks of its debt, moving it
into longer-term bonds, and eating into bank margins. Most banks are now
expecting to get about a tenth of their earnings from financing the
government, against nearly a third barely five years ago.
Interest margins overall have declined sharply, from an average 3.2 per cent
in 1970 to 1.4 per cent in 1992. This goes well beyond similar slides across
the European Union, where the average remains 2.1 per cent.
As a result, there is new emphasis on cutting costs, on profitability, and
on boosting capital ratios to ease access to cheaper working funds. Costs
across the sector have dropped from 76 per cent of net earnings in 1980 to
66 per cent last year. Despite the recession, all three big banks reported
double digit increases in consolidated net profits for the first half of
this year.
Most banks have opted to consolidate a strong domestic customer base (where
margins are higher, partly because of generalised repricing of credit and
new charges on customers), and to generate more non-retail income in areas
opened up by deregulation (although margins are keener).
Most institutions are developing a sizeable fee earning base in equity
dealing (some 20 brokers are now linked to banks); in foreign exchange
transactions; in swaps and futures; in new products like Sicavs (a kind of
unit trust); and most visibly in insurance.
CGER, for example, surprised the market by consolidating its bancassurance
strategy through a link-up with Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services
group. It has bought half the savings group's equity.
The move contrasts with unconsummated attempts by bigger players to
establish supra-regional financial services groups: Generale de Banque's
proposed link up with Amro of the Netherlands foundered in 1989, while BBL
abandoned advanced discussions last year to ally with Internationale
Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company.
BBL has since opted to pursue insurance links with Royale Belge of Belgium,
and Winterthur of Switzerland. Kredietbank has its own insurance division.
In the rest of the sector, the Government's privatisation programme could
produce new partnerships, on the CGER-Fortis model. Mr Martin of ABB argues:
'What we've seen with CGER could happen with others, drawing in not only the
Belgian private sector, but foreign (credit and insurance) institutions
too.'

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (6): 'Franc fort' may
pay off after all - Bonds took a bashing - but debt is becoming manageable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a very tough 12 months, during which the turmoil on Europe's currency
markets battered the Belgian franc and Belgium's bond market, there are
signs that the Belgian Government's management of its huge public debt is
moving back on to an even keel.
What is widely perceived by the markets and the Belgian political class as a
significant breakthrough came in the early hours of November 17.
It was then that the Centre-Left coalition led by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the
Belgian prime minister, agreed on a package to rein in budget and social
security deficits, increase industrial competitiveness, and freeze wages in
real terms until 1996.
The bourse rose immediately; short-term interest rates were cut by more than
a full percentage point; the franc strengthened, and the the risk premium
which the government has to pay on its paper, fell.
The public debt mountain, equivalent to between 125 and 130 per cent of
Belgium's gross domestic product depending on the method of consolidation
chosen, still towers over a basically strong, high-productivity,
export-oriented economy.
But there are now grounds for believing that the government's franc fort
policy of shadowing the D-mark, and the renewed effort to get a grip on
public finances, could pay off.
When the storms in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) first broke in
September 1992, the Belgian franc weathered them well. The franc fort policy
had earned Belgium the right to be considered part of the 'hard core' inside
the ERM, alongside Germany, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (with
which Belgium has a 71-year old currency union).
Over the previous year and a half, the Belgian franc had strayed no further
than 0.06 out of alignment with the D-mark, and the narrowing of interest
rate differentials with Germany was almost complete. At one stage, Belgian
short-term rates of interest even dipped below the German rates.
The size of the public debt stock - at about Dollars 200bn - remained a
problem.
The public debt stock is more than double the debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 per
cent indicated in the Maastricht criteria for those European Union member
states seeking to create a single currency by the end of the century. Annual
interest payments to service the debt eat up an unsustainable 11 per cent of
GDP.
Thus, even though the 'primary' budget balance (exclusive of interest
payments) was turned round, over the decade 1981 to 1991, from a deficit of
5.5 per cent of GDP to a surplus of 4.1 per cent, the actual deficit, after
the interest bill, was reduced from 13.3 per cent to only 6.3 per cent -
again, double the Maastricht criterion of 3 per cent.
As long as the deficit was moving in the right direction, however, Belgium's
partners and the markets perceived the debt stock as a hangover.
In January this year, for instance, the yield on 10-year Belgian benchmark
bonds narrowed to 40 basis points against their German equivalent, compared
to 120 basis points in August 1992, just before the first ERM crisis.
The 1992 budget deficit had climbed to BFr485bn, or 6.9 per cent of GDP. But
throughout Europe, as recession deepened, unemployment costs rose and the
tax take shrank, deficits were rising.
Belgium could justly point out that in the depths of such a recession its
primary surplus was actually rising, heading on latest Finance Ministry
estimates for 4.5 per cent this year.
'The feeling was, it's as good as the D-mark, except you get a premium,'
summarises Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Belgium's leading bank,
Generale de Banque.
But after the de facto implosion of the ERM this August, sentiment changed.
Investors in government bonds, particularly from outside Belgium, 'wondered
how they could buy paper from a country with such a high public debt,' says
Mr Praet.
Throughout September and October, the central bank had to fight hard to
maintain the credibility of the franc fort against market conviction that
the authorities - in Belgium as in France - could not sustain the high
interest rates needed to keep the link with the D-mark.
The psychological low point came at the beginning of October when Luxembourg
held its first public bond auction. Belgium's currency union partner offered
a substantially lower coupon on 10-year bonds, even though the Luxembourg
and Belgian francs are interchangeable. Speculation flared that Luxembourg
was steeling itself to break the link with Belgium.
But despite the dent to the credibility of Belgian bonds, the market was
surprisingly resilient. 'It was tested in very difficult conditions and it
proved to be liquid,' Mr Praet emphasises.
But nevertheless, the need to get a stabilisation package became all
important, and Mr Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, persevered even after
the trade unions walked out of what was initially conceived as a tripartite
pact between government, business and the unions.
The precise financial details remain sketchy as this survey goes to press,
but the Government appears to have found savings of BFr70bn on the social
security budget - the estimated deficit for next year. And these savings
will be recurrent through changes, for example, in eligibility for child
allowances.
On the eve of the crunch cabinet meeting to finalise the package, the risk
premium offered by Belgian 10-year bonds over German equivalents was 109
basis points; within hours of markets opening the yield differential had
narrowed to 90 basis points.
The package, moreover, reinforces the government's already well-advanced
strategy of repricing its debt.
According to estimates prepared by Generale de Banque, this could save the
Treasury the equivalent of 2 per cent of GDP a year. Some BFr2,000bn of
short term debt, which is currently attracting implicit rates of just over
7.3 per cent, is being moved to longer maturities.
More debt falling due between next year and 1996 will be similarly
refinanced.
Restored credibility in the bond market could win the government more
leverage and yield further savings. That will be in addition to - as seems
likely - about 2 per cent of GDP savings from the stabilisation package
agreed earlier this month.
It will be well into the next century before Belgian debt gets near the
Maastricht debt stock criteria. But the emerging longer-term and cheaper
profile of the debt will make it far easier to manage any intervening
shocks.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (2): Action needed on
financing problems - Public sector borrowing is too high, and the balance of
payments is under strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crunch is coming; on that point government and private sector economists
seem agreed. The only question is when. For no one believes the fiscal
profligacy currently practised can be sustained while annual inflation is
nudging 70 per cent.
Recent turbulence in the foreign exchange markets suggests that traders
remain unconvinced of the government's commitment to address the structural
issues on the budget. Domestic interest rates also appear to be edging up,
adding to the government's short-term financing problems and further
delaying the recovery in private sector investment.
The root cause remains the government's failure to address the problem of
its own finances, with the public sector borrowing requirement officially
set to rise to 16 per cent of gross national product in 1993 against a 9 per
cent target. The situation is exacerbated by the deteriorating picture on
the trade account, which is putting the balance of payments under strain for
the first time since the early 1980s when Turkey last rescheduled its
foreign debt.
But if the impression sometimes given is that Turkey is heading towards the
brink, the business community is confident that with a firm hand on the helm
the situation can be turned round.
Prudent management of the reserves should give the authorities a comfortable
cushion to withstand external shocks. Indeed, the long-term health of the
economy is not in doubt. The historical trend of foreign investment
approvals, the best indicator of confidence, continues to rise. The UK, for
example, seems to be preparing for its second coming in Turkey.
The first wave of UK investment in the mid-1980s was led by Polly Peck
International, the fruit-to-electronics group, run by Mr Asil Nadir, the
Turkish Cypriot businessman. After the group's collapse, the Department of
Trade and Industry is trusting that the next investment generation will
prove more robust.
As if to underline the point, the DTI has just opened a Turkish investment
office. The British Chamber of Commerce in Turkey is hosting a series of
workshops in London in April in a bid to attract investment.
In the past decade, the country has come a long way. This is underlined by
the recent resurgence of the Istanbul stock exchange, and the ability of the
Turkish private sector to tap international debt markets. But Turkey's real
problems are short-term. Every day the authorities baulk at the need for
reform, the problems deepen.
The policy challenge is to curb inflation while sustaining sufficient growth
to create jobs for a population that is approaching 60m. It is a difficult
trade-off and the task has become much harder since the liberalisation of
exchange controls in the mid-1980s. Turkey's economy is now more vulnerable
to policy error. For a coalition, divided on some of the basic tenets of
economic policy, the balancing act is that much more perilous.
The government has made some progress in lengthening its debt maturities,
through tax changes encouraging investors to hold longer-term paper,
nine-month or one-year bills rather than three-month paper. The profile of
Turkey's foreign debt has also improved slightly, shifting attention from
the syndicated loans to bond issues.
Progress on both privatisation and tax reform has been more disappointing.
Both policies have been stymied by political wrangling. The possibility that
the proposed new tax law may be passed by the end of the year looks remote.
Recent increases in value added tax may raise some revenues but could also
encourage the already widespread problem of tax avoidance.
One area where the government has had some success is in the reform of
agricultural subsidies, a continuing burden on the budget. Cotton prices
have been partly deregulated. Attention has now turned to tobacco. And for
the first time the subsidies are to be consolidated into the central
government budget.
For all that, recent indicators suggest the policy dilemma is still
unresolved. In the second quarter growth exceeded 12 per cent, as imports
surged and domestic consumption continued to be fuelled by easy credit. Some
economists explain the latest figures as evidence of pent-up demand held
back during the period of the Gulf War. However, few believe such a
performance is sustainable, without serious implications on the fiscal and
monetary side.
The trade deficit by August had reached Dollars 9.4bn with imports rising to
almost Dollars 19bn, much of the increase being in consumer goods. While
remittances from workers overseas have remained steady, tourism - the other
main invisible trade item - is down following terrorist attacks by PKK, the
Kurdish Workers' Party.
The current account is expected to be in deficit to the tune of Dollars 5bn
by the year-end, compared with just under Dollars 1bn in 1992. On the
capital account of the balance of payments, Turkish stocks have attracted
increasing foreign portfolio investment. Changes in the rules on foreign
funds should hasten the trend.
However, actual direct fixed capital inflows have slowed down, partly as a
result of the contraction of government project work. Companies also seem
hesitant to commit themselves before Turkey's expected move to a customs
union with the European Community when trade barriers will be reduced to
zero and imports are likely to surge further.
To make up the shortfall on the capital account, the government this year
has gone to the bond markets for Dollars 3.8bn. Turkish foreign debt - both
public and private sector - is now a dizzy Dollars 59bn, up from Dollars
54bn at the start of the year.
The increase in the debt is also explained by the number of Turkish banks
resorting to offshore borrowing to fund their lira loan book, a strategy
which will remain attractive as long as the central bank continues its
strong lira policy. There is also a growing appetite among Turkish
depositors to keep their savings in foreign exchange.
The increased capital flows have strengthened the reserve position. At the
end of September, total international reserves of the central bank and
commercial banks stood at Dollars 18bn, equivalent to about eight months of
imports.
However, the government's latest rush to the international markets was
prompted more by concern over the announcement that Moody's, the US rating
agency, is reviewing Turkey's credit standing. Any move to downgrade Turkey
from investment to speculative category could cut off a whole of range of
institutional investors, at least in US markets. It could also upset
Turkey's debt strategy which has been heavily dependent on bond issues in
the last two years, helping to lengthen the maturity of government and
spreading the investor base.
The worst prospect is that the government could be forced to return to the
syndicated loan markets. Such an outcome would produce a crowding out effect
for the Turkish private sector banks. They would then be forced back to
domestic borrowing, pushing up interest rates as they seek to attract
depositors and move to close their foreign exchange open positions.
When she succeeded as prime minister in June, Mrs Tansu Ciller warned that
1994 would be a difficult year, with the growth rate falling to 4-5 per
cent. Many governments would welcome such a prospect. but in Turkey, after a
decade averaging closer to 6 per cent and in the wake of this year's likely
figure of 8 per cent, the decline is hard to accept.
The new budget presented to parliament envisages a deficit of TL192,000bn.
Personnel expenditures remain the largest item at TL265,000bn, while
interest payment on the government's debt is projected at TL217,000bn. The
budget deficit is around 8.5 per cent of GNP. However, when the losses of
state enterprises, municipalities and other funds are taken into account,
the PSBR is targeted to reach around 14 per cent of GNP. Many banks in
Istanbul believe the figure could be closer to 20 per cent.
The size of the deficit, while worrying, is not itself a problem. The main
issue is how to finance it. The treasury is hoping to raise around Dollars
1.5bn in privatisation revenues and to go to the international debt markets
for another Dollars 1.5bn.
But given the narrowness of domestic capital markets and signs that
international demand for Turkish paper may be cooling off, the temptation
will be for the government to resort to monetary financing. The central bank
law currently allows the government to go to the bank for up to 15 per cent
of budgetary outlays. In 1994 this would result in a 50 per cent increase in
broad money M2, with all that means for inflation.
Hitherto, the bank has intervened in the market, selling dollars to absorb
the excess lira liquidity, in effect 'sterilising' the monetary expansion.
But with Turkey's external account under some strain, the bank is likely to
have less room to manoeuvre.
Apparent indecision on the correct level for the lira is creating additional
uncertainty. Since June, the monthly devaluation has averaged 5 per cent
against the basket of currencies, compared with 3 per cent for the first
half year.
The more rapid depreciation may help exporters who have been losing market
share because of the overvalued lira. But as the pace of depreciation speeds
up, so the lira cost of the government's foreign debt repayments rises. The
competitive advantage gained by exporters is very quickly eroded by
increases in inflation. Sooner rather than later, Turkey will have to break
out of this vicious circle.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (3): Banking enjoys a
shake-up - The balance is shifting from the public to the private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few Turkish industries have welcomed the government's commitment to Europe
quite as readily as the banks. A new decree, passed with the effect of law
in September, brought Turkey into line with its European competitors in a
number of important areas and marked a further deepening of the financial
sector.
The confidence is readily apparent. On the Istanbul stock exchange the banks
listed are among the most profitable and heavily traded stocks. For the
first time a Turkish bank has floated shares internationally, with Garanti
Bankasi selling Dollars 103m worth of stock through an American Depositary
Receipt in November.
With growing frequency, the private sector banks are able to tap
international debt markets. A whole host of banks have successfully ventured
into the markets including Korfez, Turkey's most profitable bank, which
raised Dollars 25m in a one-year loan arranged by Bank of New York. In
November Akbank, Turkey's largest family-owned bank, was due to conclude its
first-ever foreign syndication - a Dollars 100m one-year borrowing. Mr Erol
Sabanci, the bank's chief executive, said that at point 85 over London Inter
Bank Offered Rate, the deal underscored Akbank's standing as the best rated
bank in Turkey.
The Turkish banking industry is still dominated by the state with the five
state banks accounting for close to half the total assets, which at the end
of 1992 were around Dollars 67bn. The largest private sector banks are run
by family holdings, including Sabanci's Akbank, Cukurova's Yapi Kredi,
Pamukbank and Interbank or the Dogus Holding's Garanti.
But the new law should help shift the balance in favour of the private
sector. For the state banks, like others, are being forced to improve their
capital ratios. With the government reluctant to inject new capital into the
state banks, the only way to meet the targets is to run down their equity
participations and reduce their loan book.
Troubled banks can be forced into liquidation, where before they were
absorbed by a state bank. 'It's a long overdue signal that depositors will
have to take the risk of a bank into account,' says Mr Ibrahim Betil of
Expresbank.
In the case of a failed state bank, the government will continue to step in.
Last year, the government announced that Tobank, the teachers' bank, was to
be merged with the Halk Bankasi and Denizcilik Bankasi, the maritime bank,
was merged with Emlak, the state housing bank.
The wholesale privatisation of the big state banks, such as Ziraat and
Emlak, may be some way off. Ziraat is more like an arm of the treasury,
dispensing credits to farmers and using its extensive branch network to pay
civil servants and other government employees in rural areas.
But on a smaller scale, the banking operations of Sumerbank, the textile
manufacturing and general retailing outfit, have been offered for sale.
Similar moves have been made to allow for the disposal of the banking side
of Etibank, the minerals concern.
A more promising prospect is the government's planned sale of its 12 per
cent stake in Turkiye Is Bankasi, the country's largest commercial bank.
The shake-up in the state sector is mirrored by a rapid restructuring among
private banks. Banks are closing branches and laying off staff while
enhancing electronic banking. In less than a decade, Turkey has moved from a
relative lack of sophistication to become a modern industry. But for most
Turks, the plastic card is not so much an instrument of credit as a way to
obtain cash.
Most transactions are still done on a cash basis. The main thrust for
introducing automatic teller machines (ATMs) was 'to keep the customers out
of the bank,' says Mr Akin Ongor of Garanti. His bank is leading the way in
computerisation, with all 201 Garanti branches now using real time clearing
systems.
The development of electronic banking has also forced banks to improve their
credit supervision. 'Today you can go to 10 different banks and get a card
from each one and no one will know,' says Mr Ongor. The foreign card
companies like Visa are said to be concerned by the growing number of
defaults.
In parallel with these moves, many banks are boosting their consumer lending
business, still a fairly small share of most banks' asset books. Garanti
says consumer credit currently accounts for around 4 per cent of its total
loans - corporate loans making up the lion's share. But as interest margins
on corporate lending have narrowed, banks are turning to consumer loans.
Garanti says it intends to increase its operations. Consumer credit is
particularly attractive for the banks with links with big corporations,
which can then offer customers hire purchase financing. Koc, the largest
holding company, is boosting its banking services, in part to take advantage
of the booming car sales and sales of consumer durables, two sectors where
it has a dominant position. Akbank is developing its consumer credit
facilities to finance Toyota's joint venture with its parent, Sabanci
Holding.
In 1992 the government liberalised the rules on the issue of asset-backed
securities. The securitisation of various debt instruments such as car and
housing loans has been a popular practice in recent months, providing banks
with a cheaper source of funds. By shifting the risk of default to new
investors, it also reduces the onerous capital adequacy requirements set
under the new law.
But the broader economic impact is potentially more dangerous. 'The banks
have now been given an incentive to lend to customers for consumption,' says
a foreign economist.
In a related issue, in October a number of banks applied to the Capital
Markets Board to be allowed to issue commercial paper. Again, like
securitised loans, this is seen as a cheap funding for banks as it would not
incur liquidity requirements set by the central bank.
However, under the current rules only investment banks, which are restricted
from taking deposits, municipalities, corporations and state enterprises are
allowed to issue commercial paper. No decision has been made to allow banks
to issue commercial paper. Nonetheless, the issue has thrown into relief the
tension between the need to deepen the financial markets and the perhaps
more pressing concern of the banking authorities to keep a hold on money
supply.
Currently for every 100 lira put on time deposit with a bank, on average 46
lira has to be held as reserve or liquidity requirements - in effect, it is
a tax on the banking system.
Call deposits are a slightly cheaper way to raise funds. As a result, the
intermediation costs - the spread between deposits and credits - keep
interest rates high. Another result is that rates between different banks
can vary as much as 15 per cent. 'Nowhere in the world are interest rates
quite as free as in Turkey,' says Mr Erol Sabanci, disapprovingly.
Inflation continues to make it difficult to assess bank performance. IBCA,
the London-based rating agency, estimates that most major banks in Turkey
saw a negative return on equity in 1992.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, has pledged to reduce banks costs in a
bid to bring down interest rates. However, there is little possibility of
that while the government deficit continues to grow.
The sector has other more urgent problems. The banking authorities are
watching closely the foreign exchange exposure of many private sector banks
as they seek to fund their lira business by borrowing offshore. Given high
real interest rates offered in lira deposits, the attractions of borrowing
offshore are enormous. Garanti estimates that currently 27 per cent of its
profits result from trading on its short positions.
Garanti was the most profitable of the large privately owned banks in 1992.
The bank, however, remains cautious. 'We have a policy that the open
position should not exceed the equity of the bank,' says Mr Aclan Acar, a
director. 'That means the shareholders take the risk, not the depositors.
We've suggested to the central bank that they should make this rule
applicable to all banks.'
But the danger, particularly with the government indicating that it favours
a more rapid depreciation of the lira, is that it could result in a massive
one-way currency flow as banks seek to close on their foreign exchange
positions.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (4): Party fights for
Ataturk shares - Profile, Isbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, must be turning in his grave as
politicians and bureaucrats squabble over the shares in Turkiye Is Bankasi
that were left in his will, writes John Murray Brown.
Ataturk's holding in the country's largest commercial bank is today the
subject of a rumbling legal battle between the Turkish treasury and his old
party, the People's Republican Party, (CHP).
Isbank has a unique place in the Turkish banking hierarchy. It was a pioneer
in many of Turkey's key industries, a role which made it seem more like a
Japanese or German bank than an institution from the Anglo-Saxon world.
Isbank was a partner with Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, and had
shares in the Cukurova power utility, which it sold at a handsome profit to
the Uzan family. It is now selling many of these stakes to meet capital
standards.
Isbank's curious share structure means the bank is neither state-owned nor
truly in the private sector. Its largest shareholder until recently was its
pension fund, with close to 40 per cent of the stock. The Treasury owned 12
per cent, while around 29 per cent represented what was known as the Ataturk
shares.
But when Ataturk died, entailing his holding to the CHP, he can hardly have
envisaged that all political parties would be outlawed in the wake of the
military coup in 1980.
The current dispute surfaced when the ban was lifted. It was decided to
revive the CHP. However, at Isbank's annual general meeting, the board ruled
that the CHP was entitled not to 29 per cent, but to just 2 per cent of the
bank.
The logic is that during the period of the ban, it was the presidential
secretariat which had held the shares. Dividends were distributed to the
Turkish Literature and History Society, another condition of Ataturk's will.
However, the capital increases - a common practice in Turkey where inflation
is close to 70 per cent - were met out of the treasury coffers. The CHP thus
found its holding dramatically diluted.
The party, not unnaturally, is now claiming title to its original stake in
full, even if it means paying for the capital contributions. It argues that,
while it was banned, it was not exactly in a position to participate in the
capital increases.
The CHP has some public support. And if there is some reservation over the
general philosophy of privatisation, there is likely to be specific
resistance to the idea of selling off Ataturk's shares in Isbank, as the
government is planning.
The twist in the tail is that the government now says it plans to sell the
12 per cent it does own while the court case with the CHP continues. This
would allow the pension fund to buy the shares and become the majority
owners of the bank. This may prove far more of a threat to the current
management of the bank than any arcane legal argument about who owns the
Ataturk shares.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (4): Difficult times
ahead - The property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It ranks as the most expensive building in Europe. Shaped like a gigantic
glass juke box, the new European Parliament headquarters is known in
Brussels as the Caprice des Dieux - a French pun which refers to the oval
shape of the roof, a brand of cheese, as well as to its folly.
The Parliament's futuristic headquarters is a monument to a bygone era of
grand political designs. Its BFr40bn price tag is out of step with today's
more sober expectations about the pace of integration in Europe, but it also
matches the new mood of austerity in the Belgian property market.
After the Roaring Eighties, when development and rents expanded at breakneck
speed, Belgium is experiencing stagnation in the property market. Brussels
boom will not be followed by bust, in London or New York style, mainly
because built-in 'stabilisers' are offered by the presence of European
institutions, the Belgian national government, and the 19 Brussels communes.
Still, there is a nagging feeling that the good times are unlikely to return
any time soon.
'We face a difficult period of one to two years,' says Mr Jean-Claude
Vandecauter, general manager of the Brussels office of Knight, Frank and
Rutley.
Mr John Travers, senior partner with Healey &amp; Baker in Belgium, agrees:
'Yields on property are good, but growth is less good. We are going to have
a difficult two to three years.'
Experts compare the present slackness to the period immediately after the
first oil shock in 1973. This led to a period of slow growth from 1975 to
1985, characterised by a slump in office rentals and a rise in vacancies.
What is striking is how the upturn which followed in the mid-to-late 1980s
coincided with a fresh political impetus given by the 1992 single market
programme. Thus, in the period between 1985 and 1991, rent levels increased
at an annual rate of between 12 and 15 per cent a year.
Mr Richard Ray, manager of investment at Richard Ellis, believes that rents
have dropped as much as between 5 and 10 per cent since the top of the
market in late 1991. He quotes BFr8250 and BFr8500 per sq m. 'There is still
a little slippage likely next year, but not much more than 10 per cent,'
says Mr Ray.
Availability tells a similarly bleak story. As recently as 18 months ago,
availability in the capital was as low as 2.5 per cent. But according to
January figures, 6.4 per cent of office space was now available for rent. In
the summer of 1993, it rose to 7 per cent. It could rise to 8.5 per cent in
1994.
Mr Philippe Winssinger, managing director of Debenham, Tewson, Winssinger,
explains: 'There is less demand. Corporate profits are stagnant, so the
first place companies look to cut costs is office space and personnel.' He
cites examples such as the recent restructuring ordered by IBM and Wang, two
important computer employers in Belgium, as well as Societe Generale de
Belgique, the industrial holding company.
Aside from the recession, the strict urban planning policy of Mr Charles
Picque, minister-president of the Brussels-capital region has restricted
development. The policy has, however, helped to support rents; and most
developers recognise that there is no chance of returning to the late 1960s,
when many of the capital's historic areas were torn down in a free-for-all
which reflected as badly on the politicians and planners as on the
developers.
Today, one of the built-in insurances is the continuing expansion of the
European Commission. Though the Commission is not taking up availability at
its former rate, it is still on the look-out for places to put
fonctionnaires displaced from its Berlaymont headquarters, which remains an
empty shell awaiting renovation. The Quartier Leopold area still looks a
good long-term bet.
Yet the present difficulties should not be exaggerated. Healey &amp; Baker's
recent survey of the European property market placed Brussels in a strong
fourth position behind London, Paris and Frankfurt.
Brussels continues to be seen as the most important political centre in
Europe, boasting not only the the Commission but also the Council of
Ministers, the Council Secretariat and the European Parliament - with all
the attendant lobbyists and lawyers.
The addition of new members to the newly-formed European Union over the next
decade will also maintain momentum in the property market. Austria, Finland,
Sweden, and Norway are seeking to enter the EU by January 1, 1995. If they
succeed, there will an immediate requirement for more interpreters, more
translators - and more office space. 'It is a psychological boost,' says Mr
Vandecauter.
On the other hand, international institutions are not the dominant players
in the Brussels letting market - they only account for about 16 per cent of
office occupation. Belgian state (30 per cent), international private sector
(24 per cent) and Belgian private sector (23 per cent) all have a bigger
presence.
In the longer term, the former European Community occupied 400,000 square
feet only 15 years ago; today, it occupies 1m square feet. In 15 years, some
experts put the requirement as high as 3m square feet.
Outside Brussels, the highlight of the Belgian property market this year was
the opening of the country's largest out-of-town shopping centre at
Wijnegem, near Antwerp.
It contains 170 shops spread over 37,000 sq m, together with a 14,000 sq m
hypermarket. Mr Travers says that foreign retailers are moving into Belgium
at an impressive rate. Recent newcomers include Henness &amp; Mauritz, the
Swedish clothes chain, and Zara, a Spanish competitor. They follow in the
footsteps of some important French and Dutch entrants into the Belgian
market.
However difficult the present market, the longer-term outlook seems assured.
Even though building and development will not be on the scale of the
European Parliament complex, the fundamentals look fairly strong.
Mr Travers has spent the last 20 years in Belgium. 'I believe in Brussels,'
he says.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (3): Belfox thrives in
the gentleman's club - Backed by the old bourse, the new futures and options
market has proved itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The majestic Brussels stock exchange building, which dates from 1873, is
home to two very different institutions.
Most of the 20,000 sq m in the centre of Belgium's capital is used by the
venerable stock exchange. Mr Henri Servais, its dapper, bow tie-wearing new
president, is under no illusions about the task which faces him. 'The stock
exchange is still an old gentleman's club,' he says. 'It's very difficult to
get them to accept changes and challenges.'
Sharing the premises - with a meagre 200 sq m or so - is Belfox, the
country's fledgling futures and options market. Since its launch two years
ago it has had to face a series of changes and challenges, ranging from
computer breakdown to debilitating lack of volume and liquidity.
Now, Mr Jos Schmitt, Belfox general manager, says the exchange has emerged
as one of Europe's strongest, most efficient and least costly futures and
options markets. As proof, Belfox has just announced that it reached its
profit target for 1993 by the end of September.
That does not mean that the exchange is growing complacent. As part of a new
marketing drive, Mr Schmitt and his colleagues expect to have delivered
nearly 200 presentations all round Belgium by the end of the year,
explaining, in particular, how stock options work. Belfox has added a series
of options on other stocks to its original limited choice and continues to
expand.
The interest of Belgium's sophisticated private investors is heartening for
the Belfox management, but much more encouraging has been this year's
spectacular recovery of professional trade in futures. The future on the
benchmark Belgian government bond (BGB) was supposed to be one of the
central planks of Belfox's success, but by August last year trade was so
thin that a 'gentleman's agreement' had to be arranged between 15 financial
institutions to underpin the contract.
Happily for Belfox, when the agreement expired in January, the BGB future
continued to flourish, benefiting, together with the future offered on the
three-month Belgian interbank offered rate (Bibor), from an unusually
turbulent year for the Belgian government and currency. 'Turmoil is very
good for us,' points out Mr Schmitt, 'not so much for the volume itself, but
because these periods make people try to use our contracts.'
Belfox has also experienced particular success with its option on the Bel-20
index of most heavily traded stocks. The exchange had anticipated that some
500 contracts would be traded daily, and hoped for 1,000 a day. In fact,
volume has started to average 2,000 contracts a day, and is regularly
breaking its own daily records. A Bel-20 future has just been added to
Belfox's list of products.
The stock exchange has also caught the trend for new investment products,
listing warrants on the Bel-20, and offering professional investors an easy
way of hedging their risks, by promoting 'Belix', a basket of Bel-20 stocks,
weighted in the same way as the index itself.
As yet there is no open rivalry between landlord and tenant. After all,
Belfox would never have existed without the backing of the bourse itself.
But Mr Servais says the bourse is watching carefully to ensure that its
products do not overlap with those of Belfox - and vice versa.
It would be understandable if the stock exchange were a little envious of
Belfox's apparent success. The bourse has always been plagued by lack of
volume and liquidity, and although this year's 25 per cent increase in share
values to record levels looks impressive, Brussels is still underperforming
its main European rivals.
Mr Servais knows that the bourse has a lot more to lose than Belfox, and he
is acutely conscious of the challenges ahead. He is warning his colleagues
on the stock exchange council, and on other European stock exchanges, of the
dangers of complacency in the face of European legislation which could crack
open the gentleman's club.
The investment services directive - which comes into force in 1996 - will
end the cosy situation in which most investment in Belgian stocks is
funnelled through the 80 members of the bourse. A large proportion of
business in the most heavily traded shares is already handled by
London-based Seaq International, but Mr Servais says that from 1996 such new
'regulated markets' based on telephone trading will be even better placed to
win big investment business away from Belgian firms.
Mr Servais is convinced that there will always be a need for 'traditional'
continental-style stock exchanges, particularly as a safety net during
difficult trading periods. His problem is persuading his fellow brokers that
the threat is real, and that action must be taken. 'We need to be able to
offer an excellent service, at a low price, or we will disappear in favour
of other regulated markets,' he warns.
With the 1996 deadline in mind, the stock exchange is trying to reform
itself. For example, Mr Servais is fighting internal opposition to linking
up the exchange's trading and clearing computer systems. At the same time,
the stock exchange is pursuing limited deregulation of commissions, which it
believes will make large trades cheaper, while avoiding an increase in the
cost of small transactions. The finance ministry is under pressure to remove
the tax on transactions by foreign investors, and Mr Servais is examining
ways in which to diffuse stock exchange prices more efficiently to the
public: one possibility is a formal link with one of Belgium's financial
newspapers.
Belfox, meanwhile, is also introducing changes to widen its appeal: foreign
banks and brokers will be allowed to participate directly in the futures and
options market; the fee structure will be relaxed between members of Belfox;
and the definition of Belfox products will be formally widened to allow new
instruments to be traded.
In spite of the growing pressure from rival markets, both Mr Schmitt and Mr
Servais are confident that they can attract new investors, if preparations
for a new era of liberalised investment are made now.
To illustrate the point, Mr Servais brandishes a recent report showing that
US fund managers increased their investments overseas by Dollars 46bn in the
first half of 1993 to nearly Dollars 200bn. Brussels' market capitalisation
may represent only 0.7 per cent of world stock market capitalisation, but,
as Mr Servais points out, eyes gleaming, a 0.7 per cent share of that US
overseas investment would account for about a third of the bourse's
turnover.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (1): Skating on thin
ice - Though the economy continues to bowl along, the public deficit is
growing and the balance of payments is deteriorating. Meanwhile, Turkey is
preparing for the challenge of customs union with the European Community in
1995
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As winter sets in, Turkey skates uneasily on a rink of dangerously thin ice.
While industry reports record profits and the stock exchange reaches new
heights, the politicians in Ankara give the impression of lurching from one
dilemma to the next, unable to offer solutions or even dictate their own
agenda.
Turkey faces a looming crisis. The coalition government of Mrs Tansu Ciller
is faced with a growing public deficit, a deterioration in the balance of
payments and rising foreign debt. Already Moody's, the US rating agency, has
said it is considering a downgrading, which could impair Turkey's access to
the debt markets.
It seems only a matter of time before the escalating violence in the
Kurdish- speaking region starts to impinge on the investment decisions of
foreign companies in western Turkey. Mobil Oil of the US pulled out of the
Kurdish area in September. All public works have been suspended after
allegations that Kurdish rebels are demanding protection money from
contractors. While the government refuses to countenance political and
social reform for this hard-pressed minority, the violence can only get
worse.
The next few months could well prove decisive as the campaign train rumbles
into action ahead of municipal elections across the country in March.
The solitary comfort in this otherwise rather gloomy picture is that the
economy continues to bowl along. Growth for 1993 is set to exceed last
year's 6 per cent figure, after a staggering second quarter which saw the
gross national product increase by 12 per cent. Indeed, while the rest of
Europe pulls wearily out of recession, Turkey is enjoying a consumer boom,
fuelled by looser domestic credit and increased foreign capital inflows. But
if this heady cocktail is attractive today, the after-effects are not likely
to be so pleasant.
Against such a background, corporate Turkey is now trying to prepare itself
for the most momentous change in the trade regime in over 20 years. In 1995,
barring upsets, a customs union will be established with the European Union.
The motivation is as much political as economic. But the short-term cost to
the Turkish economy will be considerable - a topic which is likely to
dominate the negotiations which formally got under way at a meeting of the
EU-Turkey Association Council early this month.
The implementation of a customs union will transform the face of Turkish
industry. The charmed life of Turkey's large privately-owned companies,
which have prospered behind high tariff barriers, is coming to an end. The
market share of key sectors such as cars and consumer durables is likely to
be squeezed by cheaper imports, particularly when Turkey adopts the EU's
common commercial tariff for third countries, including eastern Europe.
McKinsey, the US management consultants, has just been employed to look at
the car sector. The study will almost certainly conclude that Turkey's
vehicle manu- facturers are not ready.
Turkey's full membership of the EU is today a distant prospect. But both
sides of the negotiating table appear resolved to deepen the relationship.
Turkey is fearful that it is slipping down the queue, with the EU's moves to
invite applications from Scandinavia and eastern Europe. Even Turkey's
membership of Nato and the Council of Europe no longer carries as big a
cachet, as these two organisations also consider new applicants.
critical. Brussels will be watching for any sign that Turkey is going back
on its undertaking to meet the next round of tariff cuts. All tariffs have
to be reduced to zero in 1995.
Industry complains at the failure of repeated governments to bring the
budget deficit to heel. Managers say this has discouraged the long-term
investment decisions necessary to upgrade technologies, the only way many
local companies will survive the renewed competition which will follow
customs union.
Much now depends on resolving the current political gridlock. When the
coalition was formed in October 1991, there was popular expectation that the
search for common cause would force both parties to moderate their positions
 -the right-wing True Path party (DYP), forced to take on a more reformist
Kurdish policy and the Social Democratic Populists (SHP) a more pro-business
stance. That did not happen. Indeed with Mrs Ciller's appointment as DYP
leader, and as prime minister in June, after Mr Suleyman Demirel's move to
the presidency - the lines of communication have become even more atrophied.
Mrs Ciller's attempts to legislate by decree have now been abandoned. The
sale of state enterprises and tax reform, the twin pillars of her bid to
bring down the deficit, remain blocked. The courts, on appeal from SHP
deputies, have moved to prevent the sale of the state telecommunications
company, and are poised to take similar action in the case of Tek, the power
utility.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited tax bill, which Mrs Ciller earlier withdrew from
parliament in an effort to extend its provisions, has still to be debated.
Few officials believe it can be legislated before the end of the year. In
that case, its effects will not be felt until the 1995 tax year at the
earliest.
In the absence of much progress on reform, officials are counting on strong
economic growth to boost the fiscal side by increasing the tax take. The
competition resulting from the surge in lower cost imports may also prove
instrumental in restraining inflation, although it still hovers around 65
per cent. In turn, there is every expectation that the frenetic pace of
industrial activity will have eased the unemployment problem.
More worrying is the reserves position, which while healthy now, cannot long
be sustained while the current account deficit is projected at Dollars 5bn.
Foreign debt has risen sharply and is expected to have exceeded Dollars 60bn
with the latest spate of bond issues by the government.
Turkey's public sector borrowing requirement is not huge by the standards of
many European countries. Indeed, given the narrowness of the tax base, there
is plenty of room for fiscal consolidation. One difficulty will be
convincing the public of the case for extra taxation, while implementing a
slowdown and in some cases a freeze on investment in public services and
infrastructure.
On welfare, public health and education, there is a strong case for more
spending rather than less. SSK, the rudimentary national health and
retirement plan, is all but bankrupt, unable to pay its debts to the
pharmaceutical companies. Many public infrastructure projects have come to a
standstill and contractors complain that even the government is behind in
instalments on the work already completed.
President Demirel, in a strongly worded speech earlier this month, warned of
the dangers if early decisions were not made on a new generation of power
stations. Energy experts have projected that without substantial new
investment, Turkey could face a supply shortfall as early as 1995.
All eyes are now on the municipal elections in March. In 1991, the
Motherland party government tried to spend its way to the polls -
unsuccessfully. Given the current growth rate, Mrs Ciller hardly needs to
pump-prime the economy. Should the DYP make strong gains next spring, it
will be tempted to break with the SHP and call early general elections. But
unless there is a new consensus, Turkey will continue to have difficulties
in addressing its mounting economic problems.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (1): An austerity
route agreed - Belgium has long been home to the European Community's
political institutions, but do the country's many financial institutions
have the clout to survive and prosper in the competitive single market which
'Brussels' has created?

Since Belgium took over the presidency of the European Union in July, the
country has often seemed like a storm-tossed miniature replica of the
12-nation community over which it presides until the end of next month.
Belgian industry has been on the rack of recession, its sufferings
exacerbated by fading competitiveness. Strikes have disrupted daily life;
and perceived weaknesses in the country's public finances - notably looming
budget and social security deficits - have made the Belgian franc, once
considered a surrogate for the D-Mark, a prey to fierce speculation on the
bond and foreign exchange markets.
Sometimes the authorities' only defence appears to have been to lash the
currency to the D-Mark and hope for the squalls to blow out. But at a time
when other European currencies have cut free, and apparently profited from
their liberty, that policy has itself been blamed for aggravating some of
the country's problems.
Early on the morning of November 17, however, Belgium's coalition of
Christian Democrats and socialists found what should prove to be a more
constructive way out of their difficulties. After weeks of wrangling, and in
spite of the abandonment of the original three-way talks with unions and
employers, ministers finally agreed an austerity plan - a series of measures
to limit social spending and wage increases, improve competitiveness and
tackle unemployment. It is easily the most far-reaching recovery programme
in Belgium since the second world war.
The plan - inevitably compared to the European Commission's planned white
paper on competitiveness, growth and employment, due to be presented at next
month's Brussels summit of EU leaders - had an instant and dramatic impact
on the financial markets. The Belgian central bank responded immediately
with a bigger than expected cut in leading interest rates; the Bel-20 index
of leading Belgian stocks rose sharply; the yield gap between Belgian franc
and D-Mark denominated bonds narrowed; the franc itself strengthened.
The Belgian coalition - which constructed the plan in the teeth of actual
and threatened strike action - will be justifiably pleased with this
reaction. But it is not clear whether the short-term market rally can be
sustained and the risk of continuing industrial action by unions seen off.
What, then, will be the medium-term impact on Belgium's public and private
finances?
Belgian public finances are overshadowed by debt which stands at more than
120 per cent of gross domestic product. Gradual cuts in interest rates will
fit in well with the government's existing strategy to reduce the cost of
its borrowing by refinancing its debt. Cuts of about BFr75bn in spending on
health benefits, family allowances and pensions will also help restrict the
overall rise in borrowing.
The austerity plan will also strengthen Belgium's chances of meeting the
goals set out in its programme for convergence with other EU economies. The
government's own forecast of how Belgium will meet the Maastricht treaty
target of cutting its budget deficit from 6.9 to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996
depends on a delicate balance between GDP growth and falling interest rates.
The plan should improve both those.
The impact on private sector savings is more difficult to predict. Included
in the plan - partly as a way of offsetting the edginess of socialist
coalition partners about cuts in social spending - are revenue-raising
measures which could penalise certain investments. For example, the
government plans to increase withholding tax on interest income from 10.3
per cent to 13.4 per cent, while withholding tax on dividends should come
down from 25 per cent to 13.4 per cent.
The question of withholding tax is particularly sensitive for Belgium's
financial sector, which in the past has lost savings business to
neighbouring Luxembourg with its limited taxes and banking secrecy laws. One
of the original recommendations of the experts who laid the groundwork for
the austerity plan was that Belgium should find a way to accelerate plans
for Europe-wide harmonisation of withholding tax, but that seems no more
than a long-term objective.
A more reliable, and quicker way for Belgian banks to overcome the
attractions of the Grand Duchy (most of them have profitable Luxembourg
subsidiaries too) is to find new means of persuading the wealthy ordinary
Belgian to invest at home.
'Ordinary' Belgian bank customers are not small fry. A recent survey showed
that with average savings of BFr600,000, Belgians lagged behind only the
inhabitants of Switzerland, Japan and Singapore as savers. Separate surveys
show that at the end of 1991, Belgian households topped the world league
with net household savings taking up 17 per cent of disposable income.
Belgians are also extremely well off for banking branches, and daily banking
transactions have attained a sophistication which is only just being matched
by many other European countries. A nationwide system of cash and debit
cards - many linked to the Eurocheque network - means that Belgians can pay
for goods at most retail outlets with just a card and their personal code
number. In some cases, most notably at petrol stations, the outlet does not
even have to be manned.
Paradoxically, however, although the big banks provide a blanket service,
with branches in every village, their bid to persuade cautious customers to
branch out into investments more complex than low-interest savings accounts
is relatively recent.
Liberalisation and increasing competition - both at an EU and national level
 -is beginning to open up the market and all the main participants in
Belgium's private financial sector are trying to get involved.
For example, the Brussels stock exchange is trying to promote the
attractions of ordinary shares - likely to be helped by the proposed
reduction in withholding tax on dividends - while listing new products such
as warrants.
Belfox, the growing futures and options exchange, has a nationwide roadshow
aimed at persuading more sophisticated Belgian investors to switch some
savings out of low-interest accounts into stock options.
Banks, meanwhile, have expanded their range of high-interest accounts, and
offer a widening range of Sicavs, a form of unit trust for shares, bonds or
currency. They are also rapidly branching out into the potentially lucrative
field of bancassurance. By trimming the state's comparatively generous
pension benefits, the austerity plan may help accelerate that process by
persuading more Belgians that it is worth investing in simple life insurance
products, sold through the dense banking network.
As Mr Valere Croes, a director of Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch financial
services group, says: 'Total saving is as high or even higher than in other
countries, but the share of life insurance isn't high enough.'
This is where analysts expect most changes to take place. Fortis recently
stole a march on its competitors by buying half of CGER-ASLK, a network of
savings and insurance branches, from the government, in the first stage of a
modest BFr85m four-year privatisation programme.
But both insurers and bankers say existing competition between companies
already established on the Belgian market will make it difficult for foreign
financial institutions to set up from scratch. The privatisation programme -
focused at the moment on state-owned credit institutions - is one way into
Belgian financial services for outsiders.
The rapid evolution of financial services in Belgium is unlikely to slacken
off, even if last week's austerity plan is only partially implemented. But
if the Belgian government does indeed manage to turn what looked like
becoming a winter of discontent into a glorious summer of economic revival,
Belgian banking and finance can only benefit.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (2): Push comes to
shove - The insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nudged and prodded by new European Community rules, the Belgian insurance
market is edging into the harsh light of liberalisation.
The transformation is likely to be dramatic. Until recently, the country's
insurance control authorities had to vet tariffs and conditions before a new
policy could be launched, limiting insurers' creativity. Unit-linked life
insurance policies were not allowed.
Motor insurance tariffs were among the most rigid in Europe: until last year
a 22-year-old boy-racer burning up the back streets of Brussels' roughest
quartier was subject to roughly the same tariffs and conditions as a
53-year-old spinster poodling round the picturesque Ardennes.
With the EC already framing legislation to liberalise the insurance market,
a 'round table' of all those involved in the Belgian insurance market was
convened in 1990, with the objective of laying the foundation for
deregulation in Belgium. The result has been a pile of technical and fiscal
reform, coming on top of the EC liberalisation programme which comes into
full effect in the middle of next year.
There are still teething problems. The non-life sector is barely profitable,
and most large Belgian insurers agree that the Belgian authorities will have
to allow greater increases in fire and car insurance premiums. At the same
time, the right to discriminate between car insurance policy-holders has
created an underclass of high-risk drivers who are almost uninsurable.
As a result of years of rigid controls, the insurance market is strangely
underdeveloped compared with the rest of northern Europe. Whether expressed
in terms of premium per inhabitant, or as a share of gross national product,
the Belgian insurance sector is less than half as important as the British
market, and lags behind its French, Dutch and German counterparts.
Belgium's extensive system of social security and pensions also means that
the market for life insurance has not developed as quickly. Life business
represents only a third of the BFr330bn of premium income in Belgium,
compared with 55 per cent in the Netherlands. Insurance brokers - the
principal distribution network in Belgium - have tended to concentrate on
the sale of non-life policies.
But although Belgium is a small country, it is also a comparatively wealthy
one. Belgians are among the world's biggest savers (up there with the
Japanese and the Swiss).
'One can take a pessimistic or an optimistic view,' says Mr Wautier Robyns
of the UPEA, trade association of the Belgian insurance industry. 'There's
not a lot of insurance awareness among the Belgian public - but compared
with surrounding countries there's plenty of room for development of the
Belgian market.'
That does not necessarily mean that Belgium is waiting to be consumed by
powerful outsiders. In fact, other than insurance companies linked to trade
unions or political parties, most of the 250 or so insurers operating in
Belgium are either subsidiaries of, or already have strong links with groups
outside the country.
Belgium's two largest quoted insurers are AG and Royale Belge. AG is part of
the Fortis joint venture with Amev, the Dutch financial services group.
Royale Belge is controlled by UAP, the French insurer.
Both AG and Royale Belge are gearing up for the challenge of liberalisation.
Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, chief executive of Royale Belge, says the UAP
connection means that his company will be 'better protected' than many
others once the single market in insurance is declared open next summer.
Mr Maurice Lippens, chairman and chief executive of AG, believes that
competition is already so fierce that it will be very difficult for new
companies to set up. Many smaller units of large non-Belgian companies have
already been forced to pull out of the Belgian market, he points out: 'It's
all very well to have a nice map of the world and put flags all over it, but
it just doesn't work, unless you have a substantial percentage of the market
and a back-up office.'
But that does not mean that the large insurers are resting on their laurels.
Instead they are in a fierce battle for the life business and their main
weapon is bancassurance. Most of the Belgian banks now have some links with
the insurance sector. The principle is simple: to sell basic 'stock'
insurance products through ordinary branches. Fire and life insurance, for
example, can be linked to more traditional banking products, such as
mortgages. The aim is to unlock some of those famous Belgian savings.
'For the private consumer, going into a bank branch is part of daily life,
but going to put a question to an insurance broker is less common,' points
out Mr Robyns of the UPEA.
The Belgian consumers' association is backing the initiative, and opposes
plans for unnecessarily restrictive legislation which might oblige bank
staff to become qualified insurance intermediaries. The association believes
that would impose extra costs, deter the banks from entering the market, and
drive customers back to the brokers, whose expertise in selling life
products has been much criticised.
Fortis claims to have won itself a head start in this potentially lucrative
market by buying from the government a 50 per cent stake in CGER-ASLK, a
network of banking and insurance branches, earlier this year. With CGER-ASLK
already claiming 14 per cent of the Belgian market in personal life
insurance, and Fortis adding a further 12 per cent, Mr Lippens believes the
other banks and insurers will have difficulty catching up.
Mr Gerard, unsurprisingly, begs to differ. His company has joined
Winterthur, the Swiss insurance group, in a bancassurance deal with Banque
Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's three largest banks. He says the
alliance is at an early stage, but foresees a healthy future. He also
believes there may be short-term problems marrying the different cultures,
wages and personnel of Fortis and CGER-ASLK, although in the medium term it
is clear he sees Fortis as a tough competitor in bancassurance.
As the UPEA points out, Europe's single market initiative has 'really shaken
up
the Belgian market'. The next few years will reveal how many home-grown
insurers are strong enough to survive.

FT  25 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stores conglomerate Kingfisher came under pressure as poor French economic
data, combined with the postponement of a subsidiary's results, hit the
shares. They finished 13 down at 654p, although turnover was a low 1m.
Analysts said the company had postponed preliminary results from Darty, the
French electrical retail arm purchased last February for Pounds 560m, that
were due next week.
While Kingfisher said the one-month delay was to enable a more detailed set
of results to be published, some in the market read the move with suspicion.
The shares were not helped by publication of dull French household
consumption figures.
However, Kingfisher was not alone in a weak stores sector, undermined by
press headlines forecasting a tough Budget next week for consumers following
the base rate cut on Tuesday. Among those hurt, Dixons slipped 5 to 265p,
Great Universal Stores 6 to 555p and Marks and Spencer 3 to 404p.
Big turnover was seen in Burton as one US institution sold some 19.4m shares
at 63p to Lehman Brothers, which sold them on at 63 3/4 p. With total
turnover showing 30m being traded by the close, there were suggestions that
possibly not all the stock had been placed. Burton shed 2 to 64p.
Azlan, the leading value-added distribution group to the network computing
market, made a highly successful debut in the market. The shares, offered at
230p, moved up steadily throughout the session to finish at 241p. Turnover
totalled 7.1m shares.
Another successful market debut was seen, this time from DFS Furniture,
which came to the market at 260p and closed 11 ahead at 271p.
The absence of any hard news from the Opec meeting in Vienna left the oil
sector in limbo. Analysts said there were suggestions that a 2 per cent
output cut may be achieved by Opec members. 'That would be viewed favourably
by the market at the outset, but longer term would be cutting things too
fine. A deep cut and stringent discipline is needed or oil prices could
easily slip another Dollars 2 to Dollars 3 a barrel.' One senior oil analyst
went on to say that the near term performance of the oil sector 'depends
entirely on Opec's ability to achieve a workable output accord; if they do
not, the sector will go sharply lower'.
Shell Transport managed a minor improvement at 687p following a presentation
in London to UK oil analysts. Analysts said the meeting produced an
extremely solid performance by Shell, with the company communicating its
determination to cut costs and raise the return of capital. 'There was not
much for the bears to get their teeth into,' said one analyst who attended
the meeting.
Sugar and sweetener group Tate &amp; Lyle produced results at the top end of
market forecasts and, together with an upbeat statement, sent the shares
smartly forward by 9 to 395p. But analysts pointed out that operating
profits, which were up 11.2 per cent, would have actually slipped once
currency benefits and the effect of the pound's devaluation on EU sugar
support prices had been stripped out.
Figures from Kwik Save, the discount supermarket operator, met analysts'
expectations. However, the company cautioned over the increasingly tough
price competition in the industry. The shares retreated 9 to 573p.
Further trouble for Euro Disney, the loss-making theme park operator, saw
the shares driven sharply lower and prompted three separate suspensions of
trading in Paris. A rumour that the group's creditor bankers were planning
the setting up of a committee to help in any restructuring was being heard.
On Tuesday, there was also speculation that big creditors were attempting to
sell their loans at a hefty discount. In London the stock dropped 62 to
318p.
Thorn EMI weakened on cautious comment after Tuesday's results, ending 19
down at 895p. There were also news reports that Thorn's music division had
spent Dollars 200m aquiring Michael Jackson's music catalogue, but the
company finally denied the story after the market had closed.
Bank shares rallied after the mauling they received on Tuesday when the
market reeled from worries about shrinking margins and talk that a leading
broker had prepared a bearish review of the sector.
Barclays ran up 6 to 554p, Lloyds 4 to 567p and National Westminster 6 to
531p. HSBC, with buying fuelled by the rise on the Hong Kong market,
advanced 12 to 733p.
Scotia, the research-based pharmaceutical group, jumped 9 to 287p after it
was announced that a treatment being developed by the company to combat
cancer might also be used to fight the HIV Aids virus. Wellcome, which
manufactures the leading Aids treatment Retrovir, relinquished 5 to 618p.
Automotive components manufacturer BSG International tumbled 12 1/4 to 56
1/4 p after issuing a profits warning. The news pulled down T&amp;N, off 4 at
190p, and GKN lost the same amount at 480p.
There was also a profits warning from aerospace component producer AIM
Group, which plummeted 30 to 143p.
Glass manufacturer Pilkington managed a slight rise to 152p on turnover of
1.5m in spite of late hints around the market that the company may be about
to launch a sizeable rights issue.
News of the profits warning from Philip Morris came too late to impact on
the London market, although tobacco-related concerns BAT Industries and
Rothmans were down 5 at 485p and 2 at 416p respectively.

FT  25 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks on bid alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television provided a glimmer of activity in an otherwise dull London market
yesterday as the government finally gave the go-ahead for mergers within the
sector.
Investors had expected the news last week and have been preparing themselves
for a rash of bids for some time. But there was surprise over a couple of
riders in the announcement which could impinge on the future of
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, Scottish and HTV.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees had been considered as a prime bid candidate, but Mr
Peter Brooke, the national heritage minister, said one company would only be
allowed to hold two regional licences. Dealers said that, as Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees TV already represented two regions, it would be protected.
Consequently, the share price fell 17 to 194p.
Analysts had also anticipated that the national status of the Welsh and
Scottish channels would have been protected, but there was no exclusion
clause in the final announcement and the possibility of bids sent HTV up 4
to 92p and Scottish 5 higher to 449p. Among the more likely bid targets,
Anglia rose 8 to 436p and Central climbed 77 to 2170p.

FT  25 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares steady in modest trading
volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional investors could find nothing to go for yesterday in a London
market where base rate hopes have been fulfilled; share prices drifted
aimlessly in the general direction of Budget Day, next Tuesday. Although
trading volume remained fairly good, business largely focused around company
statements and special situations.
London paid little heed to the early firmness on Wall Street, where the
Thanksgiving Day holiday is expected to extend until the weekend. After
moving erratically through a narrow range, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 2.1
down at 3,067.2. Sentiment appeared to soften in the final minutes after
suggestions that Pilkington, the glassmaker, planned to make a rights issue.
The stock market made a slow start, with City workers struggling into their
offices against a background of serious disruption of London's underground
rail network. In the first hour of trading, interest was largely confined to
a batch of share placings among relatively small companies which kept some
traders busy without exciting the market.
Blue chip internationals were generally easier, shying away ahead of Wall
Street's likely torpor rather than responding to firmness on other European
bourses. Pharmaceutical stocks acted as a drag on the market and oil shares
lacked decision while the market continued to keep a wary eye on the
weakness of global prices for crude oil.
On the domestic front, store and retail issues, the prime beneficiaries from
lower interest rates, gave ground as traders waited see if Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, has any unpleasant surprises for
them when he delivers his Budget speech.
However, there was activity among the UK television stocks as the government
proposed limited changes in rules governing commercial television ownership.
Equity strategists continued to express disappointment that the half-point
cut in base rates announced on Tuesday almost certainly rules out another
cut in the Budget. 'We had been hoping for one per cent (cut),' commented Mr
Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon, the UK brokerage house. He pointed out the
Bank of England should be more market sensitive than the chancellor, a fact
which he thinks will create more avid speculation about rate cuts in the
future.
Nervousness over the general outlook for global markets also continued to
run high, with London traders responding cautiously to comments on the GATT
talks prospects from France. Mr Nicholas Knight, the strongest bull of the
London market, told clients that they should 'worry less about US, more
about Japan.'
He believes that Wall Street has ridden fairly comfortably through the scare
that US interest rates may be about to rise. But he advises selling into any
rally in the Japanese market. For the UK, he reiterates the view expressed
by many UK strategists that this week's cut in base rates surprised only in
its timing and that 'stock prices are going up - period.'
Seaq trading volume, at 567.1m shares, against 667.1m in the previous
session, was relatively good but the total was swollen by activity in some
of the second-line issues.
On Tuesday, retail, or customer, business recovered from recent weakness to
return a value total of Pounds 1.58bn in spite of the turbulence in the
market as the base rate cut was digested.

FT  25 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Future and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traded options took centre stage in London's equity derivative dealings
yesterday as volumes were boosted by expiry of the November series, writes
Peter John.
Equity options turnover represented more than half of the total options
volume of just over 56,000 contracts as dealers rolled out their holdings.
Royal Insurance with 2,716 lots traded, GEC (2,312 lots), BT (1,805),
British Aerospace (1,681), Vodafone (1,310) and Guinness (1,174) all had
expiring November series yesterday.
However, the most active stock option - National Power with 3,501 lots dealt
 -was the result of one very large bearish deal carried out by a leading UK
securities house. Dealers said BZW bought 3,500 puts, options giving the
right but not the obligation to sell stock at a fixed price and time,
expiring in March at 390p. BZW was not available for comment
The out-of-the-money options, priced at 11p and 12p per share and
representing 3.5m shares, was seen as representing protection against the
stock falling over the next four months. National Power shares slipped 8 to
399p in the underlying market.
Futures trade was very quiet after Tuesday's frenetic trading. The December
contract on the Footsie opened up at 3,072 and hit a high of 3,086 in
mid-morning. December ticked all the way back to 3,062 by the afternoon but
it clawed its way back to 3,070 by the official close, some four points
above cash. Volume was a pitiful 7,670 contracts during official dealing.
Elsewhere on Liffe, long gilt futures for December were the most active
series with more than 91,000 lots dealt.

Brazilian equities rose by 4.5 per cent in moderate activity on continued
'safe-haven' buying, ahead of possible anti-inflation measures and a drop in
interest rates. The Bovespa index of the 48 most active stocks ended at
27,013, up 1,174. Newspaper reports saying that the government had issued a
decree aimed at limiting legal objections to future government measures, for
example on tax reforms, also provided support.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic data give gentle
support to Dow
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices firmed slightly across the board yesterday, but trading was
subdued ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday break, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 13.41 up at 3,687.58. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 gained 1.33 at 462.36, while the American SE composite was ahead
2.47 at 463.51 and the Nasdaq composite 6.36 higher at 753.18. New York SE
volume totalled 230.6m shares.
As on Tuesday, prices opened firmer following early gains in bond prices. At
2pm, when the bond market closed early, the benchmark 30-year bond was up
slightly, and the yield had eased to 6.3 per cent.
Bonds have rallied strongly over the past two days, which has helped to
alleviate the worries of equity investors. With interest rate concern
temporarily shelved, share prices have been able to post modest advances.
Although the day's economic news was mixed, it was positive for equities on
balance. Government reports on weekly unemployment insurance claims and
October durable goods orders were both moderately bullish, and sustained the
recent pattern of statistics revealing a steadily expanding economy. On the
debit side, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell in
November. This, however, did not surprise investors. Over the past year, one
of the features of the economic situation has been consistently weak
consumer sentiment.
While there was some steady buying, trading activity throughout the day was
relatively subdued, with many participants winding down their activities as
they prepared to leave for the long Thanksgiving weekend.
Technology issues were in favour. Hewlett-Packard moved ahead Dollars 2 1/8
to Dollars 73 5/8 and IBM, which benefited from a ratings upgrade by broking
house Smith Barney Shearson, finished Dollars 2 higher at Dollars 55 1/8 .
Compaq strengthened Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 70 1/4 .
Philip Morris moved up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 1/2 as investors reacted
positively to news that the big food and tobacco group is planning a
significant corporate restructuring that will involve a large number of
plant closures and workforce reductions. The restructuring, plus accounting
changes, will force the company to take a charge of Dollars 952m in the
fourth quarter.
Auto stocks, hit by selling earlier in the week, rebounded. Chrysler
appreciated Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54, Ford Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 61
and General Motors Dollars 1 to Dollars 53 3/4 .
Paramount Communications jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 80 1/8 after a
Delaware court removed 'poison pill' provisions in the company's merger
agreement with Viacom. The news raised hopes that rival bidder QVC Network
may succeed with its higher offer for Paramount. Viacom advanced Dollars 3
to Dollars 50 3/4 and QVC Network declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 3/4 .
Canada
The Toronto market staged a mild improvement as it shrugged off worries over
Ontario's debt ratings and reports that the 1993-94 federal budget deficit
may hit a record CDollars 45bn. The TSE 300 index ended 8.1 ahead at 4,223.3
and advances led falls by 379 to 340 after volume of 55.6m shares.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investor caution follows NZ
polls shock - A suddenly listless equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The New Zealand stock market is taking its time to recover from a severe
blow received following this month's general elections.
Inspired by opinion polls, it had been expecting the National Party to win
handsomely on November 6. The polls had also been predicting a possible
continuation of the Westminster style first past the post (FPP) voting
system. Businessmen whose identities are still secret had invested millions
in a massive advertising campaign which had warned everyone of the dangers
of abandoning FPP.
After the election, the initial reaction was that the business community had
got the worst of all outcomes. Not only had voters overwhelmingly endorsed
the German mixed member proportional (MMP) system, but it seemed as if a
minority National government would have to rely on the left wing Alliance
Party to govern, creating ongoing uncertainties.
The NZSE-40 index, which had hit a four-year high of 2,203.09 three days
before the election, dropped 7.6 per cent to 2,009.89 in the week following
the poll, as interest rates soared and the exchange rate dipped.
Ten days later a recount gave National a narrow, one-seat parliamentary
majority, but the subsequent rebound in equities was then worn away, partly
by weaker offshore markets and some selling by international investors.
Yesterday the index staged a minor rally, rising 13.63 to 2,058.43.
A key reason for the listless trading has been Prime Minister Jim Bolger's
refusal to confirm whether the hard line reformist finance minister, Ms Ruth
Richardson, would be reappointed, or whether her job will be given to the
moderate, Mr Wyatt Creech, who is more acceptable to opposition parties in
the perilously balanced parliament.
The new cabinet is expected to be announced tomorrow, or on Monday. The
business community is divided over how vital Ms Richardson's reappointment
will be. It is believed that the new political situation may have removed
any scope for further reforms.
However, it is accepted that Ms Richardson is wanted as finance minister by
overseas investors. Mr Nigel Hale, the Asian investment director of UK based
Invesco, got headlines in the press yesterday by saying that his company
would have 'to look at its investments in New Zealand' if Ms Richardson was
not reappointed. He said that his fund was full of admiration for what had
been achieved by the New Zealand reforms.
The domestic and international uncertainties are tending to obscure positive
economic news. Mr Bolger's recent series of meetings with US President Bill
Clinton marked an important breakthrough in the eight-year rupture in
relations between the two countries over New Zealand's anti-nuclear ships
issue, and the meetings are seen as healing the political rift.
Exporters say this will help trade with a key export partner. The latest
trade figures, released yesterday, showed a further improvement; the
inflation outlook remains low, business confidence is high and statistics
show a growth in employment. GDP growth is running at its highest level
since 1985.
Most analysts are predicting that corporate profitability, which improved
markedly this year, will continue to improve, helped by minimal growth in
wages and inflation, and by rising confidence. Most export commodity prices
are high, especially sheep meat and forestry.
In the short term the market is expected to be wary of changing sentiment
towards equities abroad, especially on Wall Street following substantial US
investment in New Zealand shares in recent years. An estimated 35 per cent
of the market is now held by US investors, and their attitude to New Zealand
recovery is seen as crucial.
Broadly there is confidence that the market is stable at current levels,
given the Reserve Bank Act's removal of the setting of monetary policy from
politicians, and the outlook for improving corporate profits. New Zealand
would be a principal beneficiary from any resolution of the GATT round.
Mr Kevyn Rendell of CS First Boston says that the market may mark time until
early next year - when the next round of corporate results are expected to
confirm the continuing improvement in business and economic fundamentals
which is believed to be occurring.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.8% as
Hong Kong halts slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage-linked selling and margin unwinding depressed share prices, and
the Nikkei average fell 1.8 per cent to a nine-month low, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 lost 317.73 at 17,067.11, after setting a day's high of
17,544.85 in the morning and a low in the afternoon of 16,993.90. The Topix
index of all first section stocks shed 27.79, or 1.9 per cent, to 1,466.04.
In London, later, Mr Nicholas Knight, the Nomura strategist, re-examined his
worst case scenario for the Nikkei and revised it down to 12,000.
Equities gained ground in early trading on a rise in the futures market.
However, as futures prices lost steam, profit-taking, arbitrage selling and
margin unwinding overwhelmed buying by life assurers and tokkin, or
specified money trusts.
Traders said life insurers were trying to support the Nikkei above the
17,000 level to sustain their unrealised profits on shareholdings.
Meanwhile, corporate investors unloaded stocks to establish profits before
share prices fell further.
Volume came to 270m shares, against 284m. Declines led rises by 872 to 158,
with 130 issues unchanged. In London, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put
on 3.15 at 1,186.62.
East Japan Railway dipped Y4,000 to Y436,000 and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Y15,000 to Y730,000. Foreign investors sold automobile stocks, and
Toyota Motor receded Y30 to Y1,740 and Honda Motor Y70 to Y1,310.
High-technology issues also lost ground, Sony weakening Y100 to Y4,650,
Hitachi Y17 to Y773 and NEC Y38 to Y822.
Financials were lower on arbitrage selling linked to the Topix index. Fuji
Bank dropped Y110 to Y2,120 and Sumitomo Bank Y130 to Y2,170.
Gas companies, which reported firm earnings after lower fuel costs, thanks
to the stronger yen, were among the day's few gainers. Tokyo Gas, which saw
its interim pre-tax profits surge by more than 200 per cent, added Y4 at
Y470.
Steels rallied after recent heavy selling. Kawasaki Steel put on Y4 at Y317.
Hohsui, a fishing concern, climbed Y80 to Y490 on rumours of a speculative
buy recommendation from an unknown source.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined for the third day in a row, falling
298.19 to 19,183.26 in volume of 19.7m shares. Nintendo, the video game
maker, lost Y400 to Y6,500.
Roundup
A firmer tone emerged in many Pacific Rim markets after the weakness of the
previous two sessions.
HONG KONG saw a halt to its six-day losing streak as the market closed 2.2
per cent higher, buoyed by moderate bargain hunting and futures linked
demand as concern eased over the outlook for US interest rates. The Hang
Seng index gained 202.04 at 9,238.06.
Hutchison Whampoa surged HKDollars 2.50, or 8.33 per cent, to HKDollars
32.50 amid speculation that the company is planning a convertible bond
issue.
AUSTRALIA was supported by bargain hunting, after Tuesday's falls, and an
improving futures market and the All Ordinaries index improved 22.8 to
2,032.4 in ADollars 421.9m turnover.
Boral's manufacturing arm, Azon, made its debut at a 12-cent premium to its
ADollars 2.00 issue price. It ended at ADollars 2.15.
SEOUL saw waves of strong buying focused on highly capitalised stocks swamp
profit-taking in asset situations, taking the composite index forward 11.08
to 828.98.
BANGKOK staged a decisive rebound, spurred by active buying by mutual funds.
The market index closed 16.43 higher at 1,321.67 in turnover of Bt12.7bn.
SINGAPORE edged ahead, the Straits Times Industrial index firming 4.10 to
2,080.79 and paring Tuesday's 20-point loss.
TAIWAN finished lower on a late wave of selling triggered by news that Hsu
Li-nung, a leading member of the ruling Nationalist Party, was defecting to
the New Party ahead of Saturday's local government elections.
The weighted index moved narrowly for most of the session but closed 44.87
down at 4,189.88, off a low of 4,177.31.
MANILA was mixed, with profit-takers dominating early trade and bargain
hunters coming in during the last hour. The composite index ended 16.40 off
at 2,372.40.
KUALA LUMPUR improved after two days of losses, the composite index gaining
3.42 at 970.30.
SHANGHAI's China B shares were hit by profit-taking, while SHENZHEN Bs
staged a rebound. The Standard Chartered Securities Shanghai B-share index
was 2.76, or 3.7 per cent, lower at 71.23, while the SC Securities Shenzhen
B-share index added 1.81, or 2.2 per cent, at 82.71 after the 6.2 per cent
decline of the previous two sessions.
KARACHI closed lower on a correction that took the KSE index 10.99 down to
1,704.93 after the sharp rise of the previous month.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris suspends Euro Disney
three times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of Wall Street's morning gains, bourses tended to close yesterday
less hopefully than they began, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was boosted initially by buying on the first day of the monthly
account, and by firmer bond futures; but the CAC-40 slipped into negative
territory at the close of trading, ending 0.86 lower at 2,070.61 on
profit-taking and growing concerns about last-minute GATT negotiations.
Turnover was FFr4.3bn. Euro Disney hit the headlines again, suspended limit
down three times during the day before closing FFr6.20, or 18.6 per cent
lower at FFr27.20 in volume of nearly 1m shares as the company waited for
its banks and its US parent, the Walt Disney Co, to put a restructuring
package together.
However, one of Tuesday's casualties, Elf Aquitaine, steadied with a fall of
just FFr1.10 to FFr415.60 after a 3.5 per cent drop on a profits warning the
day before. In New York, a Prudential Securities analyst upgraded the oil
company to buy from hold on the company's longer term attractions.
Among the winners, Societe Generale rose FFr16 to FFr681 after the bank's
chairman, Mr Marc Vienot, said that he expected 1993 net profit to rise
between 5 and 10 per cent.
MILAN rebounded after the cumulative 5.9 per cent fall of the previous two
sessions as the prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, sought to calm the
political situation by meeting the political parties that have given active
and tacit support in parliament.
The Comit index rose 13.83 or 2.7 per cent to 526.27.
Mr Michele Pacitti of NatWest Securities commented that foreign investors
were again viewing the market with a little more equanimity, although the
situation remained fragile.
Telecommunications issues, sold heavily by foreign investors early in the
week, made up some of the lost ground. Sip added L47 to L2,966 and Stet rose
L21 to L3,471.
Olivetti climbed L204 or 12.2 per cent to L1,780: news that the list of
bidders for Italy's second cellular telephone licence would be announced by
December 15 brought renewed speculation that Olivetti could win the
lucrative contract.
FRANKFURT had the will to recover but it was unable to sustain it, and the
DAX index closed just 2.14 higher at 2,029.55 after an intraday high of
2,045.66 on short covering.
Turnover fell from DM9.2bn to DM7.8bn. Hesse, the first of four western
German states to report inflation data, said thatconsumer prices rose by 0.3
per cent in November, the same rate as in October, but slowed to 3.8 per
cent for the year from 3.9 per cent; but this news was not striking enough
to boost the broad market.
At sector level, carmakers and automotive components suppliers regained some
of the losses they sustained earlier in the week, with Daimler up DM8.30 to
DM704.80 and Varta, the battery maker, DM7.50 higher at DM334.50.
Volkswagen, meanwhile, rose DM7.50 to DM402.50 after compromise seemed
possible in the negotiations over a four-day week at the company.
ZURICH ended a volatile day firmer, the SMI index adding 15.7 to 2,717.8.
Nestle finished SFr9 higher at SFr1,179 with its 10 month figures at the low
end of some expectations. The bearers rose to a day's high of SFr1,186 in
immediate response to higher group sales, but slipped back when details of
net debt raised the spectre of a rights issue. Nestle said that it was not
planning any capital increase or rights issue, although it might issue a
bond, perhaps with an equity content.
AMSTERDAM edged lower, the CBS Tendency index slipping 0.1 to 133.5, with
activity restrained ahead of today's US holiday.
KLM, 60 cents higher at Fl 38.10, continued to recoup some of the losses
which followed the collapse of the Alcazar talks. KNP BT, the paper and
packaging group, dipped 30 cents to Fl 40.20 ahead of its announcement of a
Fl 9m third quarter loss.
MADRID blamed foreign investor sales as the general index fell another 2.85
to 294.51. Banks were particularly weak, Santander leading the way down with
a fall of Pta240, or 3.6 per cent to Pta6,460.
BRUSSELS closed easier as strikes in six of the nine Belgian provinces kept
volume low, and foreign investors cautious. The Bel-20 finished 3.17 lower
at 1,384.09, with a general strike planned for tomorrow in protest at
government austerity measures.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Sterling extends gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Currency markets had a quiet session as traders squared their books ahead of
today's Thanksgiving holiday in the US, and European operators sat back to
wait for next Tuesday's UK Budget and Thursday's Bundesbank meeting, writes
Conner Middelmann.
Sterling extended Tuesday's climb against the D-Mark by another pfennig, but
ran out of steam just below key resistance at DM2.54 and edged back on
moderate volume, closing at DM2.5325, after a previous DM2.5275. Against the
dollar it ended at Dollars 1.4880, up from Dollars 1.4855.
The pound's rise follows Tuesday's  1/2 percentage point cut in UK base
rates. While many market participants are calling for another  1/2 point
reduction in coming months, the currency is widely expected to remain
underpinned as the UK economy continues its gradual recovery and continental
European central banks ease their interest rates more sharply than the UK.
'Many feel we are close to the trough for UK interest rates and the market
is confident on lower European rates,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior
currency economist at UBS. 'The resulting interest rate differential will
favour the pound.'
In the sterling money market, the Bank of England announced an early
shortage of some Pounds 750m, later revised to Pounds 650m. The Bank did not
operate in the money market throughout the day but provided late assistance
of Pounds 255m in the afternoon.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England set a weekly rollover rate for its special
money market facility at 5 13/16 per cent. Last week the weekly rollover
rate was established at 5 23/32 per cent.
The Italian lira recovered against the D-Mark after hitting a record low of
L1,005 on Tuesday. It slid sharply following Sunday's elections which
prompted worries over the country's political outlook and its government's
ability to pass the 1994 budget.
The lira rose to an intraday high of L986.25 per D-Mark and finished at
L988.5, against L994.5 on Tuesday.
'The market has taken a more sanguine view that the 1994 budget will be
passed,' said a London currency dealer, who reported heavy institutional
lira-buying against D-Marks. 'Towards the L1,000 level there is significant
support from medium-term investors, who feel that, once the political
concerns have passed after the elections, the lira will appreciate on the
back of fundamental factors,' he said.
The French franc firmed slightly against the D-Mark, boosted largely by
technical buying after the D-Mark breached psychologically important support
at FFr3.4700. It closed at FFr3.468, after FFr3.471 on Tuesday.
However, the Bank of France is not expected to take advantage of its
currency's strength to make rate cuts independently of the Bundesbank.
Instead, it should continue to use franc strength to rebuild its currency
reserves.
The first set of Germany's long-awaited November inflation numbers had
little market impact. The consumer price index in the western German state
of Hesse rose 0.3 per cent from October but the year-on-year rate slowed to
3.8 per cent. Economists are forecasting a year-on-year rate of around 3.7
per cent.
Two more preliminary inflation reports are due to be released today by the
states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, and
Baden-Wuerttemberg, the second-largest state. Bavaria's data are expected on
Friday.
The Bundesbank's allocation of DM82bn of 14-day securities repurchase
agreements at a fixed 6.25 per cent bore few surprises and left the rate for
German overnight money trading little changed around 6.45 per cent. The
central bank added DM12.2bn in liquidity to replace the Paragraph 17 funds
it had injected on Monday and rolled over on Tuesday.
Market operators are now looking to next week's round of repos and
Thursday's central bank council meeting - the penultimate before the end of
the year. In spite of Monday's higher than expected M3 money supply numbers,
many market participants are still speculating on another 50 basis-point cut
in Germany's official discount and Lombard rates at one of the two meetings
set for December 2 and 16.
The Canadian dollar came under pressure over fresh concern regarding the
country's federal deficit after a Finance Ministry offical confirmed
newspaper reports stating that the 1993/94 federal budget deficit will top
CDollars 40bn and could rise as high as CDollars 45bn. Mr Paul Martin,
Canada's finance minister, is to provide new projections of the 1993/94
deficit in Montreal next Monday.
The Bank of Canada was rumoured to have intervened to support the Canadian
dollar against the US dollar as it weakened past CDollars 1.3300. It closed
at CDollars 1.3295, down from CDollars 1.3270 on Tuesday.
The currency showed little reaction to news that the rating agency Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp lowered its credit rating for the province of Ontario to
double A minus from double A, a move that had been widely discounted.
The US dollar traded erratically in thin volume, rising briefly after the
release of strong US durable goods numbers but falling back on
position-squaring ahead of the holiday, which many are expected to turn into
a four-day weekend. The currency ended at DM1.7025, up from Tuesday's
DM1.7010, and at Y108.15, down from Y108.50. It closed in New York at
DM1.7023 and Y108.14.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gaza's farmers set for peace
dividend - Israeli efforts to boost the region's agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONTAGUE KEEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malachi Yosi is a worried man. Not far from his clean, modern nursery in the
new Moshav settlement of Ein Habesor in the western Negev is the Gaza Strip
 -full of fertile soil, citrus orchards, plastic covered greenhouses and
competent farmers impatiently awaiting the dawn of unrestricted trade with
all its neighbours.
Until the intifada uprising in 1987 made it too hazardous to be dependent on
the regular arrival of Palestinians from across the border, 90 per cent of
the 60-odd workers in Mr Yosi's company were Palestinians. Now they comprise
less than a third.
With surplus labour from large families earning much lower wages, Gazan
farmers can produce high quality fruit and vegetables at half the cost of
their Israeli counterparts. While Israel controlled Gazan trade that did not
much matter. But free trade is now an imminent prospect. Hence Mr Yosi's
furrowed brow.
International money is about to pour into the Gaza Strip, said to be the
world's most densely populated region.
And it will be liberally aided by its erstwhile conquerors. However worried
Israel's farmers may be about competition, Israel's rulers are far more
concerned to get the stricken Gazan economy on its feet and thriving as soon
as possible. Not only is this seen as the soundest insurance against
extremists: it is also in Israel's interests to channel Gaza's output of
intensively-grown produce into export markets. This means not merely
encouraging the most up-to-date production techniques in an industry already
advanced well beyond its Arab neighbours, but creating a marketing apparatus
and export facilities, which at present barely exist, save by courtesy of
Israel's own sophisticated export-orientated system.
Professor Avi Nachmias is the man nominated to head a group of Israeli and
Palestinian experts to help expand and modernise Gaza's agricultural
infrastructure, as part of a wider rehabilitation scheme.
Head of one of the research stations run by Israel's Volcani Institute, the
state's highly regarded agricultural research organisation, Prof Nachmias
knows how interlocked Gaza's economy is with Israel's. 'We want them to
export so that they don't undermine Israeli markets,' he says.
'We hope to get joint enterprises going, because Gaza is dependent on Israel
for drinking water, electricity, transport to the West Bank, export
facilities. . . Its agriculture is totally based on the Israeli economy -
their seeds and irrigation systems, for example.'
How close that connection already is can be seen from the fact that
strawberries grown in Gaza account for over 60 per cent of those exported
under the Israeli Carmel label. Here you have Palestinian production
expertise, involving use of the most modern irrigation techniques, plant
varieties and production methods, linked to an Israeli component comprising
forwarding, air freight and established marketing services.
Mr Ezra Sadan, one of Israel's most outspoken and influential economists, a
former director-general of agriculture and now head of the Volcani, is
scathing about the effect of the restrictive licensing system Israel has so
far operated to limit competition from Gazan enterprises, notably in
textiles, and is confident that free trade, by giving the Palestinians
access to a a market 30 times its present size, will also generate more
joint enterprises with Israel.
Gaza's agriculture has been changing, largely because of growing salinity in
the citrus groves (because of substantial over-pumping from the shallow
coastal aquifer) and the fact that population growth has outstripped the
rate of water replenishment. Together with the depressed prices for oranges
in world markets, this has forced Gazan farmers into concentrating on high
value, water-economical crops, creating what Mr Sadan recently described as
'an utterly modern horticultural industry'. In 1991 this comprised 400
hectares of greenhouses (Israel has 2,500 ha) and 700 ha of plastic tunnels.
They represented an investment of between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m
divided among several hundred families.
The horticultural industry is well poised to attack markets in northern
Europe and throughout the Middle East. In mid- October the first (official)
convoy of 17 produce-laden lorries crossed from Gaza through the West Bank
en route to Dubai: a harbinger of a potentially booming trade.
For Israel as a whole, with less than 3 per cent of its population now
directly involved in farming or horticulture, the liberalisation of trade
with Gaza is unlikely to have any serious economic impact. For people like
Malachi Yosi, however, a frisson of apprehension is understandable.
Nevertheless, the more speedily Israel and the West can help promote Gaza's
ravaged economy and raise its living standards, and wages, the less painful
will be this modest price for peace.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec fails to cut output
ceiling as prices slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night brushed aside
demands that it cut its production level to boost prices. Its failure to do
so is likely to lead to greater short-term volatility in international oil
markets.
Opec officials conceded that the strategy of sticking to its present output
ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day could lead to further price falls when
markets open today.
The communique issued after the meeting said, however, that the agreement
reached in Geneva in September was 'reasonable and objective' and should be
given 'the necessary time to achieve its goals'.
It also called for restraint and strict adherence to the accord. The
communique said that 'all producers should join in the effort' to balance
supply and demand.
Brent Blend, the benchmark crude, closed at Dollars 15.33 per barrel for
January delivery compared with Dollars 15.59 on Tuesday and Dollars 15.88 on
Monday prior to the conference. Traders took a gloomy view of the outcome of
the meeting before it ended last night.
Mr Subroto, Opec's secretary-general, told a news conference at the end of
the talks that ministers concluded that a small output cut would not be
effective and a large cut would have been hard to achieve.
He expected prices to decline initially but then recover.
There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia on the meeting's outcome.
Mr Ali Ahmed al Baghli, Kuwait's minister of oil, said he was happy with the
accord.
The Opec decision followed several weeks of mounting pressure on the
organisation as prices steadily weakened because of low demand in the main
oil consuming countries, especially in Europe and Japan. The perception
among refiners and traders that supplies are plentiful also helped to push
prices lower.
Several Opec members, including Iran, had called for a cut as the price of
the Opec basket of six crude oils fell.
An Opec delegate said moves to organise support for a 2 per cent cut in
production failed because it was considered too small to have an impact on
the price. He said there were also doubts that all members would abide by a
cut.
As for a larger reduction which some analysts said was necessary to prop up
prices, the delegate said: 'No one was in favour of a 1m barrel a day cut,'
although he conceded that a cut of such magnitude would have had a positive
influence on prices.
The ministers also castigated non-Opec producers, including the UK and
Norway, for boosting output.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelting to continue at
Avonmouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four weeks after acquiring the UK's sole lead-zinc smelter, at Avonmouth,
for ADollars 107m, MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, is calling
for a 19 per cent cut in the workforce, changes in working practices and
increased metal production.
However, employees were assured yesterday that, although the European zinc
industry is discussing the co-ordinated closure of a smelter, MIM had no
intention of shutting Avonmouth.
Mr Alan Pugh, managing director of Mount Isa Holdings (UK), said the new
management wanted to lift annual production from Avonmouth to 120,000 tonnes
of zinc. The rated capacity of the plant was only 105,000 tonnes but
recently it had operated at an annual rate of 111,000 tonnes, he said. Lead
production is to be boosted from 45,000 to 55,000 tonnes a year.
MIM, which bought the plant from Pasminco, another Australian company, has
started consultations with the unions and is asking for at least 115
volunteers for redundancy from the present workforce of 610.
Mr Pugh said that about 40 per cent of the redundancies would be among
managerial, supervisory and support staff.
The remaining employees would be asked to adopt more flexible working
practices 'to match the best in British industry'.
Increased productivity and extra metal production should improve operating
profit by Pounds 7.5m 'to lift Avonmouth from a position of marginal profit
to a world-class, low-cost producer of high quality zinc and lead that
provides an acceptable return on investment'.
Analysts suggested that Avonmouth was safe from closure once MIM took it
over.
The smelter uses the ISP (Imperial Smelting Process) technology, which has
the capability to process complex feedstocks, including the mixed zinc and
lead concentrate to be produced from 1995 at MIM's 70 per cent-owned
McArthur River project in the Northern Territory of Australia.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: One in four farm animal breeds
in danger of extinction, FAO warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over a quarter of the 4,000 breeds of animals used for food and agriculture
are in danger of becoming extinct, warns a report by the Food and
Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.
If only 5 per cent of the breeds are being lost every year says the FAO,
'the average loss could be about one breed a week'.
The most endangered species are in Europe, says the report. Breeds under
threat include the Regina cattle, in northern Italy, whose milk produces
Parmesan cheese, the North Ronaldsay sheep of the Orkney islands that
survive on seaweed, and the Yakut cattle of northern Siberia.
'A large number of European breeds are under threat because of their
perceived lack of economic competitiveness,' says the FAO.
It classifies breeds as endangered if there are 1,000 or less breeding
females or less than 20 breeding males. Natural disasters, wars and
indiscriminate cross-breeding are important causes for the extinction of
breeds, it says.
In Asia and the Pacific, the report details 51 breeds at risk, including the
Min Pig, which his highly prolific and disease-resistant and capable of
surviving in low temperatures, and Javanese Zebu cattle, a breed described
as 'highly fertile, hardy and resistant to tick-infestation'.
Breeds at risk in North America include Florida Cracker cattle, one of the
first to enter the United States, and the Imperial Sheep, which is capable
of breeding almost all the year round. In Latin America, the Canastra pig,
of Brazil, is said to be at risk and also the Blanco Orejinegro cattle, of
Colombia.
'Much of the genetic base of indigenous breeds is being eroded by 'grading
up' with exotics,' says the FAO.
Animal production contributes about 30 per cent to the total value of food
and agriculture and diversity of farm animals is vital for food production
for future generations, the report points out.
It suggests that breeds should be regularly monitored and incentives given
to encourage their use and maintenance.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lonrho in Dollars 250m Uzbek
gold venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than USDollars 250m will be spent over eight years on a gold mine in
the newly-independent republic of Uzbekistan, once part of the former Soviet
Union, Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate, announced yesterday. Lonrho will
develop the mine jointly with two Uzbek government-owned companies.
Mining is scheduled to start early in 1996 at an initial annual rate of
320,000 troy ounces, increasing after about four years to full production of
480,000 ounces. The first phase would cost Amantaytau Goldfields, set up to
develop the mine, Dollars 100m. Lonrho would contribute about Dollars 30m
and the International Finance Corporation, the private sector investment arm
of the World Bank, Dollars 5m.
Lonrho gave a strong hint that bacteria might be used to produce the Uzbek
gold. The group's 45-per-cent-owned associate, Ashanti Goldfields in Ghana,
is at present installing the world's biggest biological oxidation plant,
using technology developed by Gencor of South Africa. This will use a
naturally-occuring bacteria, thiobacillus ferro-oxidans, to release gold
from difficult ores instead of employing heat and pressure vessels.
Lonrho said tests carried out so far indicated that the Uzbek ores were
particularly amenable to biological oxidation. The process was particularly
attractive because it would not leave any harmful soluble materials in the
waste to damage the delicate desert ecology - the proposed mine will be in
the Kyzylkum desert, about 560km north-west of Tashkent.
Other finance for the project will come from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. The UK Know-How Fund helped to finance a
pre-feasibility study.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Attention turns to German regional
inflation figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The latest batch of west German regional inflation figures provided the main
focus of attention for the European government bond markets yesterday as
market participants were anxious to see whether they would provide the
Bundesbank with an excuse to lower key interest rates next month.
German government bonds ended little changed, with the release of the
cost-of-living figure for the state of Hesse providing the main highlight of
the day.
The cost of living rose 0.3 per cent in the month to mid-November, giving a
year-on-year increase of 3.8 per cent which was in line with market
expectations, dealers said.
The other west German states of Baden-Wurttemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia,
and Bavaria are due to report their cost-of-living data over the next few
days.
Consumer prices for western Germany are expected to climb about 3.7 per cent
in November from a year earlier, down from the October figure of 3.9 per
cent. Some market participants believe this would enable the Bundesbank to
cut its key Lombard and discount rates in December - in spite of the
higher-than-expected money supply figures for October which came out this
week.
At its repo, the Bundesbank added a net DM12.2bn to the banking system. The
funds were allotted at a fixed rate of 6.25 per cent, down from 6.29 per
cent the previous week.
Italian government bond prices bounced back again, with prices rising across
the yield curve and making up for some of the ground lost earlier in the
week.
Dealers said long-dated bonds outperformed the short end of the market, with
the 10-year yield spread over three-year bonds moving to around 30 basis
points, compared with about 55-60 basis points a week ago. Traders reported
some selling out of Asia Pacific yesterday, particularly in the
three-to-five year area, but said some semblance of calm had been restored
to the market when it appeared unlikely that approval of the 1994 budget
would be jeopardised by the recent political upsets.
Long-dated UK government bonds continued to benefit from the positive
sentiment about the low inflation background yesterday, while short-dated
issues drifted lower as investors ruled out the prospect of another interest
rate cut in the immediate future.
After the excitement of Tuesday's half-point cut in the base rate - which
prompted a flurry of activity - the gilt market experienced a somewhat
calmer trading session yesterday.
Short-dated stocks closed about  1/8 point lower while long-dated issues
gained nearly  1/4 point, helped by extension trades. The moves resulted in
a flattening of the gilt yield curve.
US Treasury prices ended little changed in light trading yesterday in the
wake of some mixed economic news.
The benchmark 30-year government bond closed  1/16 higher at 99 7/32 ,
yielding 6.303 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was unchanged at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.184 per cent.
After Tuesday's big rally, investors and dealers set about consolidating
their gains from the opening.
There was some nervousness that a round of strong economic data would spark
off fresh selling, but fortunately yesterday's news on the economy was not
consistent enough to drive the market lower. Although durable goods orders
rose 2.0 per cent in October - the third consecutive monthly gain - weekly
jobless claims came in weaker than expected, and the University of
Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed a decline from 82.7 in October to
81.2 in November.
Japanese government bond prices ended mixed with the yield curve steepening
sharply in the four to 10-year area.
Continued weakness in the Japanese stock market helped to support prices at
the short end of the bond market. Money market prices edged lower as
yesterday's fall in share prices once again revived hopes that the Bank of
Japan will cut interest rates.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most borrowers consider distribution capacity the top priority in selecting
an underwriter for Eurobond issues, according to a survey by IFR. Next in
importance are new issue pricing, secondary market support and impartiality.
However, the survey belies protests by underwriters that league tables are
not important: 51 per cent of respondents ranked position in league tables
either second or third on a scale of one to six.
In the Eurodollar bond market, Goldman Sachs is the top underwriter, with
perceived strength in generating new ideas and giving impartial advice.
In the sterling Eurobond market, UBS and CS First Boston topped the table.
Only two UK houses, Barclays de Zoete Wedd and SG Warburg, made it to the
top five. Borrowers said they received a better service in sectors which
were open to competition from foreign banks.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Swift offers price cuts and
rebate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swift, the electronic network owned by 2,000 banks, yesterday responded to
growing competition to handle cross-border payments by announcing a 20 per
cent rebate for its customers this year, and a 16 per cent price cut for
1994.
Swift, which passes payment and settlement messages between banks over an
electronic network run from Brussels, said the price cuts would save
customers BFr1.5bn next year and reduce the minimum message tariff to BFr6.
The price cuts come at the end of a year in which several consortia of banks
have disclosed plans to provide customers with cheaper and faster
cross-border payments. Visa, the credit card group, is piloting a new
system.
Mr Leonard Schrank, Swift's chief executive, said it was cutting prices
because it faced increasing competition.
Mr Schrank said Swift was facing competition not only from some of its
member banks but from card companies and European telecommunication
companies. 'We will not be the lowest cost producer, but we will lower,' he
said.
Swift was founded in 1973 to transfer to an electronic network standard bank
transactions which had been carried out by telex and other methods until
then. It comprises both a data network, and a standard method of
communicating.
The number of electronic messages carried by Swift this year rose by 12 per
cent, partly because of the turbulence in currency markets. The network
provides foreign exchange matching and netting among settlement services.
Some competitors have argued that Swift charges too much for data transfer
because its cost base is excessive. The network employs 1,100 people in 93
countries.
Among the systems now competing to transfer small payments across borders is
Ibos, the system run by Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander, Credit
Commercial de France and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Long-term debt ratings at Ontario
downgraded by S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's surprised the market yesterday when it cut the long-term
debt ratings of the province of Ontario and Ontario Hydro to double-A minus
from double-A.
Yield spreads on Eurobonds issued by Ontario had tightened over the last
week in the hope that S&amp;P would not cut the province's rating, which had
been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications on October 4.
S&amp;P said the downgrade reflected the weakened resolve of the Ontario
government to take unpopular expenditure adjustments in order to meet its
deficit targets in 1993-94 in the face of unexpected revenue deterioration.
The move reflected S&amp;P's view that deficit targets for succeeding years
outlined in the province's medium-term plan would be missed. S&amp;P removed
Ontario's rating from CreditWatch yesterday and said that the rating outlook
was stable.
Yield spreads on Ontario's Eurobonds widened by a couple of basis points
after the news broke. However, traders said that the news had removed the
uncertainty which had been hanging over the market.
S&amp;P's move allows Ontario to break its self-imposed exile from the Eurobond
market. Syndicate managers expect the province to launch a long-dated
Eurodollar offering in the near future.
There was speculation that Ontario might consider a Eurobond offering in the
D-Mark sector now that international sanctions against South Africa had been
lifted. Canadian issuers shunned the D-Mark sector while the sanctions were
in force because of the German banks' links with South Africa.
Elsewhere, Henderson Land, the Hong Kong property developer, raised Dollars
300m through a widely-expected offering of five-year Eurobonds. The bonds,
which were priced to yield 95 basis points over US Treasuries, had a mixed
reception. Some syndicate managers said the bonds looked expensive when
compared with the borrower's offering of three-year convertible Eurobonds.
If Henderson Land does not proceed with the public sale of shares in
Henderson China within three years, the bonds will yield 6.6 per cent to
maturity. This represents a yield spread over US Treasuries of about 260
basis points.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the bonds were priced in line with yield
spreads on bonds issued by Hong Kong corporate borrowers. Goldman said a
good portion of the bonds had been sold yesterday, with about 65 per cent
being placed in Asia Pacific. The bonds remained in syndicate overnight.
Sociedad Comercial del Plata of Argentina plans to launch a Dollars 100m,
five-year Eurobond issue on Monday with a spread of between 340 and 380
basis points over US Treasuries, lead manager Paribas said yesterday.
The launch depends on gaining the expected permission from the Argentine
securities commission. The company - a conglomerate mainly involved in
public services, energy and construction - aims to use the issue to pay off
short-term debt incurred during its purchases of stakes in Argentine
utilities during the privatisation process.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Jackson, the American pop singer facing legal and personal
difficulties, has agreed an estimated Dollars 250m deal under which EMI
would administer his music-publishing empire.
Mr Jackson's music-publishing operation, ATV, owns the rights to more than
4,000 songs.
Under the terms of agreement announced yesterday, EMI Music Publishing would
pay Dollars 100m in cash to Mr Jackson for the right to manage the song
catalogue for five years.
Over that period, the singer is expected to accrue an additional Dollars
150m in royalties, which are generated when recordings of the songs are sold
or played on radio and television. Mr Jackson would receive 92.5 per cent of
all proceeds, with the remainder allotted to EMI, part of Thorn-EMI, the
London-based entertainment group.
EMI is expected to raise Dollars 200m to fund copyright acquisitions for
ATV, according to Mr John Branca, an lawyer who represents Mr Jackson.
Mr Jackson faces allegations that he sexually molested a 13-year-old boy.
Last week, he cancelled the remainder of a world tour and admitted he was
addicted to pain killers.
The EMI deal represents a reprise for the company, which administered the
catalogue when the singer acquired it in 1985. For the past five years, the
business was managed by MCA.
A separate company, Mijac Music, owns the rights to Mr Jackson's own
compositions and is not included in the EMI deal.

<TEXT>
Fujitsu of Japan is to acquire HaL Computer Systems, a California company
that is developing high performance open systems computers. Previously,
Fujistu held a 44 per cent stake in the US company.
HaL will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fujitsu and serve as the
principal development centre for advanced 64-bit open systems hardware and
for operating systems products for the Fujitsu group of companies.
'This agreement is good for Fujitsu and HaL's employees because HaL now
assumes an expanded development responsibility with greater importance to
Fujitsu's open systems strategy,' said Mr Scott Metcalf, president of HaL.
Fujitsu also announced it had signed a contract with Dell Computer to market
Dell's personal computers to corporate clients in Japan.
Dell said the move was intended to broaden the company's reach in Japan,
where it has a sales force of only 30 people. Under the agreement, PFU, a
unit of Fujitsu, will also provide service and support for Dell computers in
Japan.
Mr Paul Allen, Microsoft co-founder, added to his high-technology portfolio
by buying part of Virtual Vision, a company that makes what it calls
'personal viewing systems', Reuter reports from Washington.

Royal Bank of Canada is to cut 4,100 jobs, about 8 per cent of its workforce
to improve competitiveness and integrate the recently-acquired operations of
Royal Trust.
The bank, Canada's biggest financial institution, said about 3,000 jobs will
be cut from its own payroll but Royal Trust will be more heavily hit
relative to its size, with more than one in five jobs being lost.
RBC plans to close more than a third of the trust company's 142 branches.
RBC acquired Royal Trust, formerly controlled by the Toronto branch of the
Bronfman family, mainly to gain a strong foothold in fiduciary services on
the heels of regulatory reforms last year.

advances 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wacoal, Japan's leading manufacturer of women's underwear, saw firm interim
profits due to rationalisation of sales and advertising costs, but lower
sales due to sluggish demand for nightwear and sportswear.
The company posted a 5.1 per cent rise to Y6.6bn (Dollars 60m) in pre-tax
profits for the six months to September. Sales slipped by 1.7 per cent to
Y65bn, but after-tax profits rose by 14.4 per cent to Y3.5bn.
Underwear sales rose by 4.8 per cent to Y49.8bn but nightwear sales fell by
12 per cent to Y6.1bn and outerwear and sportswear sales dropped by 25.6 per
cent to Y3.6bn.
Wacoal said better trading profits offset a fall in interest income due to
lower interest rates. After-tax profits were boosted by special gains of
Y803m on the sale of securities holdings.
The company expects continued sluggish demand during the second half, and
foresees a 2.3 per cent decline in full-year pre-tax profits to Y10.3bn on
sales up 0.4 per cent to Y128bn. After-tax profit is forecast to rise by 2.1
per cent to Y5.2bn.

</HEADLINE>

   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stet, the Italian state-owned telecom utility, and its consortium partner
Bell Atlantic, the US regional operator, have entered the leading
first-round bid in Hungary's telecom privatisation tender.
Stet International and Bell Atlantic are believed to have offered between
Dollars 800m and Dollars 850m for the 30 per cent shareholding in Matav, the
Hungarian national operator, in eastern Europe's largest single
privatisation so far.
The figure comfortably betters submissions made by two groups regarded as
the strongest contenders in the sale.
Deutsche Telekom of Germany, in alliance with the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless and
regional Bell company Ameritech, is understood to have bid Dollars
420m-Dollars 500m. France Telecom, linked with US West, another Baby Bell,
is thought to have offered over Dollars 450m.
The German and French-led proposals also lag behind that of Telefonica of
Spain, the fourth competitor to be shortlisted, although estimates of
Telefonica's bid vary.
None of the groups would officially confirm the figures. Advisers also
warned that consortium bids were 'apples and pears' and not wholly
comparable. Stet in particular worked on the assumption that Matav will
continue to dominate local telephone services.
Stet's lead in the first round of preliminary, 'indicative' bids is no
reliable guide to the outcome of the second and decisive phase. Final bids
are due on December 14 and the Budapest authorities hope to complete the
transaction by the end of the year.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank's
International Finance Corporation are to invest a combined Dollars 90m in
Matav.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, yesterday
completed the second of two cash-raising exercises by placing 40 per cent of
its Union Switch &amp; Signal subsidiary in the US.
US&amp;S was bought by Finmeccanica's quoted Ansaldo Trasporti unit in 1988 to
broaden its coverage of the railway equipment and signalling business.
The flotation, raising almost Dollars 49m through the sale of 3.25m shares
at Dollars 15 each, will give Ansaldo a Dollars 30m boost via a special
one-off dividend. The remaining proceeds will be used to reduce US&amp;S's
short-term debt.
Yesterday's transaction echoes last week's US initial public offering of
Finmeccanica's Elsag Bailey Process Automation subsidiary.
The transaction involved the flotation of 8.12m shares at Dollars 19 each,
raising more than Dollars 150m.
About 35 per cent of the total share capital was placed, with an option to
sell a further 5 per cent. The proceeds will be used to cut debt at both
Elsag Bailey and the Finmeccanica parent company.
Both deals are part of a rapid income raising drive by Finmeccanica, which
is facing a depressing year because of the recession and heavy losses at its
Alenia aerospace subsidiary.
Finmeccanica announced a first half pre-tax loss of L159.9bn (Dollars
94.5m), against net profits of L180.5bn in 1992. Analysts say the group
should reach break-even in the full year, boosted by the extraordinary
receipts from this month's two US transactions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's competition watchdog yesterday removed a key obstacle to the
proposed alliance between Canadian Airlines International and American
Airlines by allowing the Canadian carrier to pull out of a computerised
reservations system which it shares with Air Canada, its chief rival.
The competition tribunal gave the airlines a last opportunity to negotiate
the dissolution of their partnership in the Gemini network. But if they fail
to agree by December 8, a procedure spelt out by the tribunal will be
applied.
Under this arrangement, the partnership would be terminated in November
1994. Covia, a unit of United Airlines, is also a shareholder in Gemini.
AMR, American Airlines' parent company, has proposed injecting CDollars 246m
into Canadian, in return for a one-third equity stake. A key condition of
the deal is that Canadian move from the Gemini reservation system to AMR's
Sabre network.
Air Canada and Covia have strongly resisted Canadian's efforts to withdraw
from Gemini, arguing that such a move would leave Sabre with a virtual
monopoly of Canadian airline reservations. As an alternative to the AMR
deal, Air Canada has proposed buying Canadian's overseas routes and leaving
the Calgary-based airline as an exclusively North American carrier.

10-year collared FRN
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the principal subsidiary of
HSBC Holdings, is raising HKDollars 3bn (USDollars 388m) through a 10-year
'collared' floating-rate note issue in its first external fundraising since
1986.
The notes will pay interest equal to 25 basis points above three-month Hong
Kong interbank offered rate, subject to a minimum rate of 7 per cent and a
maximum of 9 per cent.
Analysts said the terms appeared expensive for a bank of Hongkong Bank's
quality in the market but it is understood that Wardley, which is arranging
the issue, has developed a mechanism for hedging the 7 per cent to 9 per
cent collar which will provide the bank with attractive Hibor-related
funding over its life.
The bank said the proceeds of the bond issue will be used to develop and
expand its business, pointing to planned infrastructure projects, in Hong
Kong, such as the building of an airport and the expansion of the colony's
container port.
The bond is redeemable in six years. Its worth to the bank as capital,
however, will diminish when the bond is five years old, when the bank will
have to begin to amortise 20 per cent of the bond a year.

Ryder System, the Florida-based transportation company, announced terms for
the spin-off of its aviation business, creating a new company with assets of
around Dollars 1bn and sales in 1992 of Dollars 1.2bn.
The completion of the divestment plan, first announced in June, pushed the
company's shares company up Dollars 1 to Dollars 28 1/4 yesterday.
Shareholders in Ryder will be given one share in the new company, Aviall,
for each four Ryder shares they already own in a tax-free distribution
beginning on December 14.
The move will enable both Aviall and the continuing Ryder business to
concentrate on their respective businesses. Aviall, which made net profits
last year of Dollars 20m out of the group's total of Dollars 118m, claims to
be the world's largest independent aviation repair and parts distribution

NCR, the computer subsidiary of AT&amp;T, yesterday unveiled details of a
redundancy programme to reduce its worldwide workforce by 12 to 15 per cent.
The company said it would take unspecified charges to cover the redundancies
in the first quarter of next year.
NCR said it was offering voluntary severance incentives to US employees who
agreed to leave the company by the end of January.
Of the approximately 27,000 NCR employees in the US, about 25,000 are
eligible for voluntary separation and 5,500 for early retirement.
Mr Jerre Stead, NCR chairman and chief executive, said the company recently
announced a new, customer-focused business model, which called for fewer
layers of management between NCR and its customers.

Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer, has announced pre-tax profits for
the six months to September 30 1993 of MDollars 135m (USDollars 52.9m),
compared with MDollars 130m a year ago.
Turnover rose substantially to MDollars 1.36bn, compared with MDollars 908m
previously. This was mainly due to high demand for a new model launched on
the home market in mid-year.
Analysts said that the marginal rise in profit was due to the increased cost
of imported parts. Proton cars are manufactured in partnership with
Mitsubishi of Japan, and the company has suffered from the appreciation of
the yen.
Proton has a 70 per cent share of the domestic market and is seeking to
increase exports, particularly to Europe. It expects an improved performance
in the second half of the financial year.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Battle to clean up in Indian
market - Competition in soaps and detergents is growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NAAZNEEN KARMALI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, champions of soaps and detergents markets
around the world, are preparing to do battle in a country with 880m
potential consumers. Not far behind them are other multinationals, including
Henkel and Benckiser of Germany and Kao of Japan.
Even two years ago, the prospects of the world's largest soaps and
detergents makers buying control of local competitors in India would have
been unthinkable. Now, economic liberalisation is freeing companies to fight
for a market, which is already worth Rs23bn (Dollars 733m) and is growing at
an annual average of 10 per cent.
Mr Sushim Datta, chairman of Hindustan Lever - the Indian affiliate of
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine - says that competition is all set to
intensify. 'There's going to be a fierce battle for shelf space.'
Unilever, which has been operating in India since before independence in
1947, is buying control of the Tata Oil Mills Company (Tomco), the
75-year-old soaps and detergents company of the Tata group. In March, the
boards of the two companies approved the merger of Tomco with Hindustan
Lever which has annual turnover of Rs20bn, two-thirds of it in detergents.
P&amp;G, a relative newcomer to India, last December struck a deal with Godrej
Soaps, a privately-owned manufacturer with annual sales of Rs5bn. They
formed P&amp;G Godrej, a joint venture in which P&amp;G took a 51 per cent stake. Mr
Adi Godrej, chairman of the new company, says joining forces made sense
because 'a major competitor is a partner now.'
By buying out strong home-grown brands, Unilever and P&amp;G have deftly
eliminated local competition and acquired wide-ranging distribution
networks.
The partnership with Tomco gives Hindustan Lever a considerable presence in
the market, with an overall share of 26 per cent in volume terms. In toilet
soaps, with the addition of Tomco's soaps to its own best-selling brands,
Hindustan Lever now has a 70 per cent market share. The Monopolies and
Restrictive Trade Practices Commission is examining claims that the merger
would make the multinational an over-dominant force in the market.
For P&amp;G, the corporate matchmaking is even more significant. Before signing
up with Godrej, P&amp;G's presence in India was limited to one product - Ariel,
an enzyme-based detergent concentrate powder which was launched two years
ago. P&amp;G's range now includes Godrej's detergents and soaps that
collectively have a 10 per cent market share. P&amp;G has also bought into
Godrej's distribution system and has gained access to Indian soap
technology. This is based on vegetable oils rather than animal fats, which
are extensively used elsewhere in the world but which are taboo in India.
Ever since Lever earlier this year introduced Surf Ultra in response to
Ariel, a squabble has broken out between the two companies, which has
included allegations of false advertising claims and unfair selling tactics.
The concentrated powder segment that they have been quarrelling over is tiny
 -less than 2 per cent of the total detergent market. Hindustan Lever's
general sales manager, Mr Rajendra Aneja, calls it 'a battle in sheer
futility . . . it's more a prestige issue'. Selling Ariel has been a strain
on P&amp;G's bottom line; in the last two years the company has suffered
accumulated net losses of Rs210m.
Lever and P&amp;G also have others to worry about: Germany's Henkel has a joint
venture with Southern Petrochemical Industries; Benckiser, also German, has
an office in Delhi; and Kao, the Japanese group, is eyeing the Indian
market.
For Indian consumers, it means a belated range of choice - not to mention a
dazzling display of marketing from some of the top consumer products
companies.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Lower demand takes its toll on
electricity groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's electric power utilities were hit by a fall in demand for air
conditioning due to the cold summer and the economic slump.
Lower fuel costs, due to the stronger yen and a fall in crude oil prices,
could not cover the decline in revenue from lower electricity demand, and
eight of the nine electric power companies posted lower interim parent
pre-tax profits for the half-year to September.
In spite of strong opposition from the utilities, the government has ordered
electricity and gas rates to be cut in order to pass on the benefits of the
higher yen to consumers. As a result, the electric power companies will
lower rates for an 11-month period starting this month, and face a drop in
income for the full year.
Tokyo Electric Power said total power consumption for the April-September
period fell 0.7 per cent from a year earlier, depressing revenue from
electricity sales. For the full year, the company expects a 14.8 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y135bn, on a 0.2 per cent rise in sales to
Y4,710bn. The company expects the rate cuts to reduce its income by Y36bn.
Kansai Electric Power said sharp increases in repair-related spending and
depreciation costs also squeezed profits. The company expects full year
pre-tax profits to fall 19 per cent to Y100bn on a 0.1 per cent rise in
sales to Y2,370bn.
Chubu Electric Power said its decline in pre-tax profit was due to a heavier
interest burden from increased capital investments. For the full year to
March, the company expects a 26 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y75bn on
a 0.6 per cent fall in sales to Y1,950bn.
Kyushu Electric Power saw profits fall for the first time in three years due
to typhoons and heavy rains. The company, which spent Y28.4bn on repairs,
sees an 8 per cent fall in full year pre-tax profits to Y76bn on a 1.4 per
cent rise in sales to Y1,280bn.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Warner-Lambert cuts drugs
dependency - The US group's efforts to counter the effects of healthcare
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warner-Lambert, the US drugs and consumer products group which this week
announced a Dollars 468m restructuring plan, is going through the
pharmaceuticals wringer.
Like other companies, Parke-Davis, its drugs subsidiary which is the 14th
largest pharmaceuticals group in the US, has been hit by healthcare reforms
in Europe and America. The speed of changes in the US, in particular, has
taken the company by surprise, admits Mr Lodewijk de Vink, president and
chief operating officer.
But the subsidiary's performance has also been affected by problems specific
to it. Its growth has been severely limited since January, when the US
patents of its best-selling drug, Lopid, a cholesterol-lowering treatment
with sales last year of Dollars 556m, expired.
Revenues have also been undermined by running foul of the US Food and Drug
Administration, which stopped production at six of its US and Puerto Rican
plants.
The company believes this will cost it Dollars 150m in lost turnover this
year. In addition, the group's tax rate is set to rise next year because of
the US government's decision to limit tax credits for manufacturing in
Puerto Rico.
Warner-Lambert's efforts to counter the expected decline in Lopid sales by
launching new drugs have been dogged by problems.
Cognex, a treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, had a rough ride through the
FDA, being rejected twice before finally being licensed in the US this
September.
New-York analysts HKS &amp; Co believe the medicine could be held back by its
limited efficacy and side-effect concerns, and annual sales could struggle
to only Dollars 100m or reach Dollars 500m.
Warner-Lambert's latest response is to announce a further round of
restructuring and rationalisation. About 2,800 of the group's 34,000
employees will leave the company. That follows job losses of 2,700 announced
earlier in 1991.
Research and development spending - running at 18 per cent of drugs sales -
is not sacrosanct, says Mr de Vink. 'Research used to be a cost centre that
was never questioned. We need to make some hard choices. We can't fish in
every therapeutic pond, but I want more lines in each pond,' he explains.
'The days of macho R&amp;D spending - when more was necessarily better - are
over. The industry's current level of spending on R&amp;D is clearly
unsustainable,' he insists.
Although the pharmaceuticals division is clearly in trouble, the group is
being supported from unexpected quarters.
Its confectionery operations and over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription
medicines business, with products ranging from Trident chewing gum to
Clorets breath-fresheners, have traditionally been regarded as a burden
because of their low margins compared with prescription pharmaceuticals.
'This is a Dollars 6bn company of which only a third is pharmaceuticals. The
other two-thirds are not affected by healthcare reforms or patent expiries.
Our diversity used to be a weakness. Now it's a strength,' says Mr de Vink.
Warner-Lambert has successfully created strong international brands capable
of generating a steady, though unspectacular, stream of earnings growth.
Some of its products, like Listerine mouth-wash, are more than 50 years old,
but are still growing. The company actually created the mouth-wash market in
Japan when it launched the product there.
The group is still expanding its consumer business through acquisition. In
May it bought the Wilkinson Sword wet shave operations, building a Dollars
500m razor and blade business.
Meanwhile, Warner-Lambert has continued to build its OTC medicines business,
the largest in the US. In July, the company secured access to Glaxo's Zantac
and Wellcome's Zovirax, the two most important drugs capable of switching
status from prescription only to OTC.
Mr de Vink's strategy to deal with expiry patents is to drive
Warner-Lambert's generics business harder.
'Some of the returns are not bad. And we don't have to do the R&amp;D,' he
explains. The operations will be more aggressive in future in an effort to
keep plant operating at capacity. He does not exclude manufacturing drugs
developed by other companies whose patents have expired.
The group's pharmaceuticals portfolio is, however, looking thin, apart from
Cognex and Accupril, an ace inhibitor heart drug, which is doing well thanks
to aggressive pricing. It should become a Dollars 250m product.
Meanwhile, Neurontin, an epilepsy treatment, has been filed with the FDA but
is not yet approved. Mr de Vink says it should generate at least Dollars
100m a year.
Mr de Vink says he wants more products in the pipeline. 'The typical
life-cycle of a drug could be falling to only four or five years and if that
is the case you have to have a lot more new products,' he explains.
The company is planning research alliances with other groups. In February it
acquired 34 per cent of Jouveinal, a French drugs maker with an innovative
pipeline. It already has an alliance with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in
antibiotics.
The efforts of Mr de Vink and his chairman and chief executive Mr Melvin
Goodes, mean that in spite of Warner-Lambert's difficulties in
pharmaceuticals, analysts expect the group to outperform most of the drugs
sector in the medium-term. A not unimpressive achievement for a mouth-wash
and chewing gum company.

Guoco Group plans to list Dao Heng Bank, its wholly-owned banking
subsidiary, early next month, company executives confirmed yesterday.
Dao Heng is Hong Kong's fourth largest bank in terms of assets and number of
branches in Hong Kong. Earlier this year it acquired Overseas Trust Bank
(OTB) for an estimated HKDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 58m) and promised a stock
market flotation later in the year.
Guoco will issue 38.52m shares to the public - equal to 5.87 per cent of the
bank's enlarged capital - at a price of HKDollars 21.70 each.
In addition, 151.75m shares (23.13 per cent of the bank's capital) will be
offered to holders of USDollars 350m worth of convertible preferred stock
which was issued to fund the acquisition of OTB.
The issue price represents a prospective price/earnings ratio of 14.5 on a
fully-diluted basis.
Dao Heng's net tangible assets value has been put at HKDollars 8.46 a share.
Guoco, which is controlled by the Kwek family of Singapore, will retain a 71
per cent interest in Dao Heng.

Dollars 130m

<TEXT>
Argentina is poised to raise more than USDollars 130m with the sale of the
government's remaining minority stake in the semi-privatised electricity
generator, Central Puerto.
Strong demand allowed the government on Monday to raise its maximum price
for the shares by 8 per cent, to Dollars 5.40. However, economy minister Mr
Domingo Cavallo announced on Tuesday that the government would offer its 30
per cent stake at Dollars 5.30 a share.
Mr Cavallo fixed the price slightly below the ceiling in order to attract
longer-term buyers and to deter speculation. However, analysts expect
trading in the Buenos Aires 'grey' market to be fierce, given that the issue
was heavily oversubscribed.
The government sold 60 per cent of Central Puerto for Dollars 92.2m in April
1992 to a consortium led by Chilgener of Chile. The company's employees hold
the remaining 10 per cent.
The next semi-privatised company in line for stock market flotation is
expected to be Central Costanera, a larger generator, which could be ready
for an international offering in December.
The government is expected next year to offer its minority stakes in 10 gas
transport and distribution companies.
Argentina plans to raise Dollars 750m next month from the sale of global
bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to refinance maturing debt.
Officials had earlier indicated that the offering would be around Dollars
500m. Pricing of the bonds should be detailed next month.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Israel reviews bank sell-offs
after Hapoalim setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's government was yesterday reviewing its large bank privatisation
programme after investors spurned the latest issue of 10 per cent of Bank
Hapoalim, Israel's largest bank, offered on the Tel Aviv stock market.
The government managed only to sell 69 per cent of its 1.2m share offer,
raising Shk403m (Dollars 139m), Shk200m less than expected. A further 1 per
cent of shares were sold to employees at a discounted price, raising
Shk43.7m. The government's first offer of 20 per cent of Bank Hapoalim in
May was oversubscribed 2.2 times and raised Shk780m.
Bankers and stock market analysts yesterday blamed the government for
mismanaging the share issue and warned of similar results at next week's
offer of 10 per cent of Bank Leumi unless technical changes were made to the
structure of the issue. They said the government had ensured the flop by
abolishing the maximum share price, leaving out underwriters and refusing to
attach options or warrants. The elimination of the maximum price on the
issue meant there was no pre-sale to institutional investors.
'The new structure of the issue precluded investors that usually invest on
the first day to make a quick killing. Basically, the concept of the market
was if there is an availability of shares on the market at a known price
then why go through the process of allocation without knowing what the price
will be,' said one banker.
'The problem was with the technical structure of the issue not with the
financial attractiveness of Bank Hapoalim,' he added. Shares in Bank
Hapoalim offered by the government in May have appreciated 30 per cent in
real terms in the past six months.
The government said yesterday it was committed to next week's sale of 10 per
cent of Bank Leumi, Israel's second largest bank, in spite of the failure of
the Bank Hapoalim issue. But market experts said unless the structure of the
issue was changed investors would spurn the Bank Leumi offer.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BF Goodrich, the speciality chemicals and aerospace group, launched a public
offering to sell its remaining 49.5 per cent interest in the Geon subsidiary
which it floated earlier this year.
The proceeds from the sale, put at Dollars 248m before tax, will be used to
fund part of the Dollars 300m acquisition of Emerson Electric's Rosemount
aerospace division, announced two weeks ago.
The two transactions mark the culmination of Goodrich's plan to narrow the
scope of its operations to speciality businesses which it believes have good
profit growth potential, and move away from cyclical businesses.
The company has said it expected earnings next year to be significantly
ahead of the 60 - 70 cents a share projected for this year.
The 12.9m shares in Geon, a maker of polyvinyl chloride, have been offered
at Dollars 20 each.
This is below the current market price, which edged down to Dollars 20 5/8
on the news, but still ahead of the Dollars 18 at which Goodrich floated its
first 13.1m shares in the company in April.
The company reported a one-off pre-tax gain of Dollars 91.9m after the
flotation, suggesting that the fourth-quarter gain from the latest sale will
top Dollars 100m.

Nestle, the world's largest foods group, said sales in the first 10 months
of 1993 were up 5.2 per cent to SFr46.6bn (Dollars 31.3bn). It attributed
the rise to a slight acceleration of growth in the second half.
Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman, said directors were 'satisfied' with progress
this year in the face of sagging sales in Europe, the group's principal
market area.
He indicated that the sales growth trend for the full year was established,
and that net income would also rise to a similar extent. The net margin
would remain at last year's level of 5 per cent of sales, he said. He
expected further sales and profit growth in 1994.
He dismissed suggestions that consumers were turning away from branded
products. 'To the extent that these products offer the consumer innovation
and convenience, and provided that their prices are competitive, they will
continue to benefit from consumers' loyalty,' he said.
Mr Reto Domeniconi, finance director, said Nestle had been able to raise its
prices an average 2.4 per cent in the first 10 months (except in countries
with hyperinflation).
The real internal growth of Nestle's sales remained a weak 1.2 per cent in
the first 10 months, well below the 3.3 per cent in the whole of 1992. Most
of the rest of the 5.2 per cent growth came from acquisitions.
Sales in Europe, where the group has traditionally made half its sales, were
down one per cent to SFr21.8bn. Sales in North and South America gained 10
per cent to SFr16.9bn, and those in the rest of the world jumped 14 per cent
to SFr7.9bn.
Mr Maucher said the group's heavy investments in developing countries were
paying off. 'We are the only large food group to have a quarter of our sales
in countries other than the US and Europe,' he said.

Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday confirmed that
Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, would be the first company to be privatised
next year. He said the government's stake may be sold in tranches.
'It is a large amount, and it is not impossible that it could be sold in
bits,' Mr Alphandery said, adding that no decision had yet been taken on the
process of the sale.
The government's 50.8 per cent stake in Elf-Aquitaine has an estimated value
of FFr50bn (Dollars 8.5bn), much larger than the FFr28bn raised through the
privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris, and the FFr13bn from the sale of
the state's holding in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group.
Industry observers say they expect the sale to be done in one block,
although payment for shares could be done in instalments.
Mr Alphandery was speaking after the government launch of a tender offer by
which companies can bid for stakes in Banque Hervet, the small private bank
to be sold as part of the privatisation programme.
The sale of 89 per cent of the shares in Banque Hervet, due to be completed
by the beginning of 1994, will not be open to a public offer. It is expected
to raise about FFr1bn.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank offshoot in L470bn
Italian deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banca d'America e d'Italia (BAI), Deutsche Bank's big Italian subsidiary, is
paying L470bn (Dollars 277m) to buy a controlling 58.07 per cent stake in
Banca Popolare di Lecco (BPL), a profitable northern regional bank.
BAI will also have to mount a compulsory offer to minority shareholders in
BPL, which is quoted on Milan's unlisted securities market, at the L18,279 a
share it is paying the bank's controlling shareholder, Banca Popolare di
Novarra. The offer will add an estimated L340bn to the transaction.
Final pricing, and terms of the public offer, will only be established in
early April 1994, after a due diligence examination of BPL's accounts.
The deal is the biggest single investment by Deutsche Bank in Italy since
its December 1986 takeover of BAI for Dollars 603m. Since then, the Italian
subsidiary has expanded its branches. Last year it made an unsuccessful bid
for Citibank's southern Italian retail banking operation.
The purchase comes at a time of ferment among Italy's medium-sized regional
banks, which have tended to steer clear of the big loan-loss provisions now
being made by the country's larger financial institutions.
Banca Popolare di Verona, a leading north Italian regional, has launched an
unprecedented hostile bid for Banco San Geminiano e San Prospero, a
medium-sized bank based in Modena. Separately, the Parma savings bank, which
has already grown through local mergers, last week confirmed it was in talks
to buy Credito Commerciale, a slightly bigger Milan-based counterpart.
In some cases, as in the BPL and Credito Commerciale deals, the
once-inconceivable sales of prized subsidiaries has become necessary to
staunch financial difficulties at their parent companies. In the case of
Banco San Geminiano, high profits and good geographic coverage have drawn
the unwanted attention of an ambitious neighbour taking advantage of
indirect encouragement from the Bank of Italy for more bank mergers.
BPL has about 1,200 staff and 100 branches in Lombardy, Italy's richest
region. The bank, which has total assets of about L6,000bn, will continue to
operate independently of BAI for the time being. BAI now has around 150
branches nationwide and about 3,000 staff.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Renault chief stands firm on
terms of Volvo merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
No changes can be expected to the terms of the proposed merger between
Renault and Volvo, according to Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault.
'The terms and conditions are final from the French side,' Mr Schweitzer
told the Financial Times late on Tuesday. 'The deal is fair and we have
fully answered the concerns of Volvo shareholders. This is it, there is a
time for decisions,' he said.
Mr Schweitzer yesterday met with a group of leading Volvo shareholders in
Paris in an attempt to counter Swedish resistance to the proposed merger.
Opposition from Volvo shareholders has already forced the postponement of a
vote on the deal - originally due earlier this month. A new vote has been
set for December 7. A group of 12 Swedish institutions controlling 44 per
cent of the votes in the Swedish company hold the key to approval of the
deal.
The French government has sought to win backing for the merger by giving
written commitments to Volvo shareholders concerning the two most
controversial aspects of the deal: the timetable for privatisation, and the
use of a golden share to be held by the state.
Last week, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, wrote to Mr Carl
Bildt, his Swedish counterpart, stating the French government's intent to
privatise the merged company next year, and pledging that the golden share
would not be used against Volvo.
Mr Schweitzer warned that a rejection of the planned merger between Renault
and Volvo would damage existing co-operation between the two automotive
groups, which are already engaged in a far-reaching alliance based on
minority cross shareholdings.
'The momentum would disappear,' said Mr Schweitzer. 'You cannot work
together without a strong sense of direction. And there would be none.' He
said recent disruption to the merger process had already slowed and
destabilised efforts to build a joint management organisation.
The Renault chairman said he had been surprised by the scale of opposition
from Swedish investors. 'Emotions built up in a rather violent way and have
overshadowed the issues and the progress we have made. It has become a
political issue in Sweden,' he said.
Mr Schweitzer stressed the industrial logic of the proposed merger, due to
take effect from the beginning of next year. The cost-savings from joint
purchasing, research and development and economies of scale would strengthen
the two companies' car and truck operations.
Mr Schweitzer said the European automotive markets showed signs of bottoming
out. He forecast a modest recovery in demand from mid-1994.
He said he was confident that Renault would remain profitable despite the
protracted downturn in the car and truck markets.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nobel little changed at SKr298m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals group to be taken over by Akzo of
the Netherlands, yesterday announced profits little changed at SKr298m
(Dollars 35.6m) for the first nine months of 1993, from SKr304m last time.
However, the company said it was benefiting from low interest rates and the
sharp fall this year in the value of the Swedish krona. It predicted that
full-year profits would 'improve somewhat' over the 1992 result of SKr237m.
Nobel and Akzo announced earlier this month an agreed deal under which Akzo
would pay SKr16.6bn to take control of the Swedish company. Nobel is 73 per
cent-owned by the state through Securum, a 'bad bank' set up to group the
bad debts of the state-owned Nordbanken.
When combined, Akzo-Nobel will be the world's biggest paints group and the
second largest pulp and paper chemicals producer.
Nobel said currency hedging had blunted the effect of the falling Swedish
krona, knocking SKr247m off operating profits in the nine months. The
operating profit was down at SKr819m from SKr836m last time, in spite of a
rise in sales, to SKr17bn from SKr15.8bn.
However the group, which has most of its production in Sweden, said the
currency fall had strengthened its competitiveness. It said the unwinding of
its hedged position would lead to stronger results in the first half of
1994.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Stora swings back to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stora, Europe's leading pulp and paper group, swung strongly back to profits
in the third quarter of 1993, with a sharp reduction in financial costs
offsetting persistent price weakness in its main markets.
Profits after financial items for the three months were SKr264m (Dollars
31.5m), compared with a SKr333m loss in the same 1992 quarter. The turnround
took profits for the first nine months to SKr294m from a SKr496m deficit a
year ago.
Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora president, said the market situation was
'largely unchanged', with prices stabilising at low levels during the third
quarter.
'The general economic picture in western Europe is weak, particularly in
Germany,' he said.
The benefit of the weaker krona lifted sales for the first nine months to
SKr37.7bn from SKr35.4bn. However, operating income only increased by SKr8m
to SKr850m.
The real impact on the result came from the drop in financial costs, to
SKr556m from SKr1.39bn. The group has benefited from lower interest rates
and a better trend within its financial services arm.
Cost-savings and new efficiency measures have helped the group compensate
for lower prices. The company said it had already cut costs this year by
SKr1.7bn. It expects savings for the full year to amount to SKr2bn, the same
as in 1992.
The group did not give a full-year forecast, although it will show a clear
improvement on last year's SKr1.42bn loss. Deliveries of the group's main
products in 1993 are expected to be largely unchanged on last year.
MoDo, another Swedish forestry group, said losses had nearly halved in the
first nine months of 1993, to SKr476m from SKr925m a year earlier.
It said price pressures, losses from French operations, and heavy interest
costs were keeping it in the red, even though the weaker krona and
rationalisation had enhanced its competitiveness.
The group effectively predicted a full-year loss of around SKr600m by saying
its final-quarter deficit would equal the SKr123m level struck in the third
quarter.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: German metals group falls
heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial conglomerate,
yesterday blamed a combination of falling metals prices, difficulties in the
motor industry, and restructuring costs for a swing from profits to a
pre-tax loss of DM347m (Dollars 204.1m) in the year ended September. Last
year's figure was DM245m.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, group chief executive, warned that
Metallgesellschaft would probably omit its dividend for 1992-93. This would
make the group one of several leading German companies to pass their payout
this year.
However, pessimism on the dividend was offset by the prediction that the
group would return to profit this year, reflecting extensive cost-cutting
and further disposals.
Mr Schimmelbusch defended his ambitious acquisition strategy - which
culminated in 1992 with the DM1.45bn purchase of the non-paper activities of
Feldmuhle Nobel - saying the impact of the downturn in Germany would have
been far more severe without the deals of recent years.
He said the disposals programme of the past year was not designed to correct
the earlier diversification. It was, rather, aimed at focusing on five,
well-defined business areas, ranging from metals trading to plant
construction and environment services.
Mr Schimmelbusch said sales of non-core businesses led to a book profit of
DM378m in 1992-93, and were set to bring in another DM600m this year.
The chief executive said he was confident of reducing costs by DM1.1bn in
the three years to 1995. Half of this will come by cutting more than 10,000
jobs. In the last two years, the group has cut 7,400 jobs, 12 per cent of
the workforce.
The reported loss for the year - achieved on group turnover unchanged at
DM25.5bn - included losses of DM290m on the Schiess machine-tools company
which has subsequently been sold.
Metallgesellschaft published for the first time a divisional breakdown of
profits and turnover.
Pre-tax profits from metals trading rose to DM147m from DM129m; at plant
construction they were DM45m, against DM21m; in metals and mining there was
a loss of DM174m after a DM65m deficit last time; environment services made
DM31m; industrial activities made DM111m against DM114m.

A final dividend of 3.25p is to be paid from reserves for a 5.375p (10.75p)

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BPP shares tumble after profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BPP yesterday plunged to their lowest level for almost three years
as the language and professional training company warned annual profits
would lower than expected due to increased rationalisation costs and a
substantial property write-down.
The market marked the shares down 90p to 215p, their lowest since February
1991, after the group announced it expected profits to be at least Pounds
6.3m before the write-down.
Analysts had expected profits, scheduled for March 21, of about Pounds 7.8m.
The group also said it expected to take a charge of about Pounds 5.3m
through the profit and loss to account for a Pounds 7.5m reduction in the
value of its properties. The rest would be charged against reserves.
BPP issued the warning following its decision to pull out of language
training in Belgium and Japan at a further cost of Pounds 300,000. This
followed the company's warning in August that it would incur Pounds 650,000
in charges for reducing its exposure to the depressed Japanese market.
Mr Richard Price, chairman, said yesterday trading had become particularly
tough both in Japan and continental Europe in the last three months.
The language division was expected to incur a loss of Pounds 400,000 '
against profits of Pounds 857,000 last year ' of which Pounds 200,000 was
attributable to the Belgian and Japanese businesses.
Mr Price said he expected trading in the language division to be difficult
through 1994, due to the increasingly depressed climate in France and
Germany.
However, he emphasised that profits continued to move ahead at the group's
three other divisions - publishing, and academic and professional training -
albeit less rapidly than expected in the first two cases.
He said confidence in these three businesses reinforced the decision to
forecast an increased final dividend of 5.8p (5.3p), for a total of 8.8p
(8p).

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scots are developing the power to invade
England - The current expansion plans of Scottish Power and Scottish
Hydro-Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opinions may differ on whether a line of new pylons through the hills of
southern Scotland near the A74 Glasgow-Carlisle road enhance the scenery.
They will certainly enhance the business of Scottish Power and Scottish
Hydro-Electric, the two Scottish electricity companies.
The recently-completed pylons are the upgraded interconnector, the
transmission line taking Scottish electricity exports to England.
Scottish Power, which reports its interim results today, gets the lion's
share of the 350MW increase in the interconnector's capacity, which is
rising to 1,200MW, though Hydro-Electric's export capacity will rise
slightly.
Total capacity should rise to 1,600MW by 1995, following improvements in the
English grid.
Last week Scottish Power received another boost when it concluded an
agreement with British Coal to take more than 2m tonnes of coal a year for
the next five years on terms similar to those reached by the two English
generators in the spring.
The deal involves a backdated reduction in the price which will cut the
company's fuel costs by Pounds 10m this year, and a more rapid drop in world
coal price levels than planned under the previous contract. Hydro-Electric,
which generates most of its electricity from gas and hydro power, will get
one sixth of the coal.
Unlike the regional electricity companies and the two English generators,
the Scottish companies are vertically integrated, both generating and
supplying electricity.
Apart from the Northern Ireland company they were the last to be floated and
the only ones where the government got the price about right, permitting a
small premium for investors but a sluggish aftermarket.
From the start in 1991 the two companies pursued different strategies.
Scottish Power, with a market capitalisation more than twice that of
Hydro-Electric, concentrated on its much bigger domestic market, while
exporting power to England via the interconnector. It also developed some
generating projects in England and studied the possibility of supplying
power to the Isle of Man, but none of these schemes materialised.
Hydro-Electric was nimbler in signing up to supply individual customers
south of the border. With Norweb it pushed ahead on a project to build a
680MW gas-fired power station at Keadby on the Humber.
Analysts considered Hydro-Electric more dynamic and the market established a
premium for its shares over Scottish Power.
However, in September Hydro-Electric dropped out of the FT-SE 100, and since
October has stood at a slight discount to Scottish Power, which is now
making a bigger effort to explain where it is going.
Mr Ian Preston, Scottish Power's chief executive, put achieving greater
efficiency as a primary objective. It is now bringing itself up to the
benchmark standards of the best US utilities, and has shed 30 per cent of
staff in its core business since privatisation.
Other aims are to make the most of its generating assets and 'to diversify
prudently in utility-related businesses'.
It has plans to build a 250MW interconnector to supply Northern Ireland. The
original route for the pylons across Ayrshire ran into opposition but the
company will seek planning consent for a revised line next year.
When that comes onstream towards the end of the decade, and taking into
account the interconnector upgrade to England, 30 per cent of Scottish
Power's output should be going outside its own territory at prices outside
the control of the regulator. The present level is 9 per cent.
In diversifying, Scottish Power has reorganised its retailing business,
which claims 30 per cent of the Scottish white goods market and is expanding
in northern England. It has a joint venture in gas with Utilicorp, named
Caledonian Gas, which already has 2,000 customers.
'It's a low risk business,' says Mr Preston. 'Caledonian gets the customers,
Utilicorp supplies the gas and British Gas delivers it.'
Like other gas suppliers he is urging the government to liberalise the gas
market to embrace most domestic customers. At present only consumers who
take 2,500 therms a year, giving an annual bill of more than Pounds 1,100,
can choose their supplier.
Scottish Power is also spending Pounds 7m on a fibre optic
telecommunications network between Glasgow and Edinburgh for use by other
companies.
For Hydro-Electric, with a much smaller domestic market and a share of the
interconnector that will only reach 490MW in 1995, the priority has been to
develop generating capacity south of the border.
That policy is now coming to fruition. The Keadby plant will begin operating
in January 1995, and last month it formed a joint venture with BNF called
Fellside to own a 157MW gas fired combined heat and power plant opening
early next year at Sellafield.
With the enhanced interconnector and a 7MW combined heat and power plant at
Dover, Hydro-Electric should be supplying 820MW of power in England by 1995.
The north of Scotland company recently formed Vector Gas, a joint venture in
gas with Marathon, which intends to market gas all over Britain under the HE
Energy label. Rather more than Scottish Power, Hydro-Electric has its sights
on becoming an all-purpose energy utility.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Goodhead falls Pounds 17m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goodhead Group, the printing and publishing company, yesterday announced a
Pounds 17m pre-tax loss for the year to end-May, a Pounds 5.8m placing and
open offer, and two disposals.
The deficit compared with a profit of Pounds 335,000 last time and included
a Pounds 10.3m adjustment for goodwill, a Pounds 4.34m net loss on the
disposal or closure of subsidiaries and Pounds 2.26m of other asset
write-downs.
Turnover fell from Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 37.4m, of which Pounds 7.77m
(Pounds 9.85m) was attributed to discontinued operations.
Losses per share came out at 101.4p (1.9p) and the single dividend is cut
from 0.5p to 0.05p.
Mr John Madejski, chairman and chief executive, said that the net assets of
the group had fallen substantially - from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 6.81m. The
purpose of the proposed fund-raising was to address that reduc-tion and cut
borrowings, he said.
The company is proposing to raise Pounds 5.8m net of expenses via a placing
and open offer of 24.2m new ordinary shares at 25p apiece on a 9-for-7 basis
and/or 1.8368 new ordinary for every two preference shares held.
Mr Madejski is to subscribe up to Pounds 5.5m. A further 2m shares are to
placed with 3i, subject to the entitlements of shareholders. Dealings in the
new shares are expected to commence on December 22.
The fund-raising is subject to shareholder approval. In particular, they are
being asked to approve the waive by the Takeover Panel of the possible
obligation on the chairman to make a general offer for Goodhead in the event
of his holding carrying more than 30 per cent of the voting rights in the
company.
In addition, in line with Goodhead's objective of refocusing the business,
it is proposed that all non-core activities are sold.
A number of disposals had already been completed, the chairman said, and the
company is now seeking shareholder approval for the sale of the leasehold
property at Portbury, Bristol, and for the sale to its management of Company
Publicity and its subsidiaries.
The shares closed up 6p at 23p.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: New trust has eyes set on European smaller
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Providence Capitol and James Capel are launching an indexed investment trust
specialising in European smaller companies.
The Fairbairn European Smaller Companies Index Trust has already raised
Pounds 47m and is seeking to increase this to up to Pounds 65m via an offer
for subscription.
The trust will track the James Capel European Smaller Companies Index, which
covers 17 countries from Austria to Turkey and includes 1,000 stocks.
Providence Capitol, as investment manager, will buy a portfolio of 350
securities selected by James Capel to replicate the performance of the
index. This is the first in a series of indexed investment trusts which
Providence Capitol hopes to launch.
The managers believe that this is a good time to buy European smaller
companies. In both the US and the UK, smaller company shares have recently
outperformed their larger brethren as economies have shown signs of
recovery.
In Europe, smaller companies have underperformed since the start of 1991 as
continental economies moved into recession. With interest rates falling,
European economies should recover and smaller company shares start to
outperform.
Shares are being offered at 100p, with a minimum investment of Pounds 2,000.
The trust will have a seven year life which can be extended at the
shareholder's option.
The trust qualifies for personal equity plan status although no specific
plan is linked to it.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Turnround at Osborne &amp; Little
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased margins and the lack of exceptional costs this time enabled
Osborne &amp; Little, the wallpaper and furnishing fabrics concern, to report a
turnround from losses of Pounds 802,000 to profits of Pounds 947,000 pre-tax
for the six months to the end of September.
Last year there was a charge of Pounds 1.2m relating to the sale of the
French offshoot.
Sir Peter Osborne, chairman, said the margins rise reflected continuing
emphasis on cost control and the effect of sterling's devaluation.
Group turnover rose 3 per cent to Pounds 9.13m, against Pounds 8.87m, which
included Pounds 1.83m from discontinued activities. Earnings per share,
helped by the purchase for cancellation of 300,000 shares, were 9.33p
(losses 13.48p).
The interim dividend is raised from 2p to 2.5p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of markets in which it operates remaining weak, Platignum, the
manufacturer of pens, stationery, furniture and housewares, returned sharply
higher profits for the six months to end-September.
At the pre-tax level they improved from Pounds 69,000 to Pounds 398,000 from
turnover, boosted by acquisitions, ahead 32 per cent at Pounds 10.7m.
Profits took account of higher interest charges of Pounds 146,000 (Pounds
78,000). However, there were no exceptional provisions this time compared
with Pounds 260,000 previously.
The interim dividend is lifted to 0.28p (0.25p) from earnings of 1.74p
(0.29p).
Gluetek and Housley International, both acquired earlier this year, made a
'positive' impact on the results.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: ML back in the black with Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML Holdings, the aerospace, defence and electronics group which launched a
Pounds 14.3m rescue rights issue in January, returned to the black in the
six months to September 30.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.1m, compared with losses of Pounds
1.5m.
Mr Howard Grant, chief executive, said the figures - 'the first meaningful
set of results since the rights issue' - confirmed the group's recovery. But
the board deferred a decision on a dividend until the end of the financial
year.
Turnover improved by 7 per cent, from Pounds 40.2m to Pounds 43.1m. The
group has cut almost 190 jobs compared with the previous half, so that sales
per employee were ahead 24 per cent.
Mr Grant said progress had been made in all three divisions. Aerospace and
marine boosted operating profits by 81 per cent to Pounds 1.41m on flat
turnover of Pounds 17.8m.
Group borrowings, at Pounds 14.9m, were marginally higher than at the year
end, reflecting the timing of some big contract payments, mainly for
aircraft.
The electronic component distribution division lifted operating profits 70
per cent to Pounds 1.18m, while the aircraft and cargo handling division
returned to the black with a contribution of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 157,000
loss).
Gearing stood at 60 per cent at the end of the half, compared with 125 per
cent.
Earnings per share were 1.1p (2.6p loss).

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Concentric ahead in spite of 'unusual
instability'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concentric, the diversified Midlands-based engineering group, lifted pre-tax
profits by 13 per cent in the year to September - a period which included
'unusual instability in every business in which we are involved.'
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.36m (Pounds 8.25m), achieved on turnover of
Pounds 116.4m (Pounds 113m), were at the lower end of market expectations.
'Month by month business and opportunities have been up and down,' said Mr
Tony Firth, chairman.
'General market conditions show no sign of improvement,' he added.
He said that the automotive market, which accounts for about half of
Concentric's sales, 'collapsed' last January.
The business in satellite dishes had been sluggish with considerable amounts
of stock on the market following technical changes in dish specifications in
the middle of the year.
By September, export sales accounted for 30 per cent of turnover, against 28
per cent in the first half; Mr Firth said, however, that continental
European customers had 'lost interest' as recession deepened.
Against the background of market difficulties, the rise in profits came from
winning market share, the exploitation of new business and improved margins,
Mr Firth said.
Following the rights issue in 1992, Concentric maintained a net cash
position, although capital expenditure nearly doubled to Pounds 8m. The
group has sought higher productivity through a restructuring which reduced
the size of the workforce from 2,000 to 1,900 a year ago.
Earnings per share rose from 11.63p to 12.03p. The final dividend is 4.09p,
making a total of 5.86p (5.59p adjusted for January's scrip issue).

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BMA strengthens SAS link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
British Midland Airways, the second largest UK carrier, is strengthening its
relationship with Scandinavian Airlines Systems by taking over a number of
SAS routes from the UK to Scandinavia as well as eight SAS Boeing 737-500
aircraft.
Sir Michael Bishop, BMA's chairman, also confirmed yesterday that SAS would
take up its option to acquire next July a further 5 per cent stake in
Airlines of Britain Holdings, BMA's parent company.
This would increase SAS's overall stake in the UK airline group to 40 per
cent.
Although SAS is currently reviewing its entire strategy following the
collapse this week of the proposed Alcazar merger between SAS, KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines, Sir Michael said the
Scandinavian carrier was planning next April to look at how to develop its
relationship with BMA.
But the two airlines had already agreed on two projects to reinforce their
co-operation, including agreement for BMA to take over SAS's
Glasgow-Copenhagen and London Heathrow-Bergen services as well as the eight
Boeing aircraft from the Scandinavian carrier.
The new aircraft are part of a sizeable fleet renewal and expansion
programme by BMA involving 17 jets worth Pounds 275m over the next four
years.
Apart from the new 737s, BMA will be the launch customer for the new Fokker
70 aircraft; it has also ordered the larger Fokker 100 aircraft.
Sir Michael said BMA expected to report higher pre-tax profits this year
than the Pounds 835,000 of last year. Although profits were still not at a
satisfactory level, Sir Michael said the airline had continued to make money
during the last three years of the worst post-war recession in the business.
Turnover was expected to total about Pounds 350m this year while turnover
for the entire Airlines of Britain group, including Manx Air and Loganair,
would total about Pounds 450m.
Reflecting the airline's steady international expansion, Sir Michael said
European services would account for about 55 per cent of turnover this year
compared with only 20 per cent five years ago. While SAS was now likely to
enter of phase of retrenchment, BMA was continuing to expand.
He stressed, however, that he considered SAS as a long term partner. 'We
felt SAS was the best partner for us and the relationship has been
outstandingly good. I am now 51 and I expect the partnership will continue
for the rest of my working life'.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle's rise beats forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record UK profit and currency gains helped Tate &amp; Lyle to increase annual
pre-tax profits by 17.4 per cent to Pounds 222.5m. That was above market
expectations, which had been revised downwards in September when the
sweeteners company warned of difficult trading conditions in the North
American sugar market.
The shares gained 9p to 395p. A final dividend of 8.7p is proposed, which
would raise the total from 12p to 13p, in line with Tate's policy of a
'progressive' dividend.
Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, said the outlook for the current year was
encouraging, with productivity gains and improved trading conditions
expected.
He emphasised that Tate is primarily a processor of agricultural products
and is exposed to influences such as the weather, crop sizes and government
regulation.
The group's main problems in the year were a bumper sugar beet crop in the
US, leading to lower prices and government imposed limits on sales, and a
glut of potato starch in Europe, hitting prices there. In each case,
conditions were expected to improve in 1994.
Mr Shaw said he was 'very pleased' by the approval given to the Nafta trade
agreement in the US.
Tate plans to expand its interests in Mexico, where it has a starch plant.
Tate is expanding in many developing countries, where the growth in
consumption of its products is concentrated.
In central Europe, it has set up a number of joint ventures, although it has
yet to earn a normal return on its investment.
Tate is now looking to establish joint ventures in China and south-east
Asia.
Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said cash-flow had been strong.
Net debt fell by Pounds 15m to Pounds 627m, although the weak pound meant
the translation of the group's debt, which is largely in US dollars, added
Pounds 94m to borrowings.
Gearing was 78 per cent at the year end, down from 89 per cent a year
earlier, in spite of a Pounds 20m write-down of UK property values.
Mr Lewis said with interest cover of 5.7 times, up from 5, and given that it
had written off Pounds 500m of goodwill over the years, the group was
comfortable with its balance sheet.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bombardier settles dispute with TML
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row between Bombardier, a Canadian supplier of trains for the Channel
tunnel, and Transmanche Link, the main contractor, over a CDollars 746m
(Pounds 379m) claim to cover cost overruns has been settled, the two sides
announced yesterday.
Details will not be announced until the settlement has been approved by the
boards of the two companies and Eurotunnel - operator of the cross-Channel
link - on December 3, but Canadian analysts estimated the agreement would be
worth CDollars 350m to Bombardier.
Bombardier lodged its claim against TML last summer to cover extra
manufacturing costs incurred due to late design changes ordered by TML. The
original contract, awarded in July 1989, was for the supply of 254 shuttle
rail cars costing CDollars 650m.
The agreement removes the threat of further delays to the start of
cross-Channel services next spring. The rail cars being built by Bombardier
will carry cars, coaches and their passengers between the terminals at
Folkestone and Calais.
More details will be released after formal approval has been given,
Bombardier said. It has already made special provisions totalling CDollars
225m to cover possible losses on the shuttle car contract.
If the agreement is approved early next month it will avoid the possibility
of the dispute going to court. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, Bombardier chairman, had
warned that legal action might become necessary if the dispute was not
settled by the year end.
Bombardier halted production of the rail cars being built by its Eurorail
subsidiary at its plant at Bruges, Belgium, in March, but resumed deliveries
in June.
Eurotunnel said yesterday that it had not been affected by the delays in
shipments of the rail cars, but it was concerned that problems could arise
if the dispute had continued. 'It was important for us to have something
done about it,' Eurotunnel commented.
Nearly 100 of the rail cars have been delivered to TML and are being
prepared for commissioning.
Shuttle services carrying trucks and cars under the Channel are due to start
next May, while passenger-only trains are due to start running between
London Waterloo, Brussels Midi and Paris Gare du Nord in June or July.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Exchange rates help Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tate &amp; Lyle's combination of swings and roundabouts was largely favourable
in the year to September 25, with profits before tax at Pounds 222.5m
against Pounds 189.5m, although profits were still below the record Pounds
230.8m achieved in 1991. The pre-tax figure was boosted by Pounds 19.1m from
exchange rate gains.
Group sales were 13.4 per cent higher at Pounds 3.82bn, and operating
profits rose by 13.6 per cent to Pounds 269.6m. Two of the five divisions
suffered profit falls at the pre-interest level.
In the North American sugar business profits fell from Pounds 39.6m to
Pounds 28m, with Domino - the cane business - largely to blame as lower
sugar prices and selling quotas hit margins. A strike at one plant cost
Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m). Profits from Western, the beet business, also fell,
with Dollars 7m of start-up costs from a new desugarisation plant, although
this is now trading profitably.
The other division which suffered lower profits was European cereal
sweeteners and starches, where the decline was from Pounds 54m to Pounds
51.4m. Lower prices were caused by a potato starch glut, after a record
crop, and as the problems of the paper industry meant it used less starch.
Outside North America, profits from sugar rose from Pounds 71.2m to Pounds
94.8m, including the UK up from Pounds 49.9m to Pounds 64.4m, with a Pounds
4.6m stock profit thanks to the green pound devaluation. Productivity
improved 10 per cent in the UK.
Profits from North American starch and sweeteners rose from Pounds 65.3m to
Pounds 84.7m, with Staley, a problem area in 1992, up from Dollars 118.7m to
Dollars 130m. In 1991 Staley made Dollars 172.5m. The partial recovery in
1993 was despite pricing pressures, a Dollars 12m rationalisation provision
and a lock-out at one plant.
Animal feeds and bulk storage profits rose from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds
25.1m. Sucralose, a sugar substitute Tate has developed, lost Pounds 5.8m
(Pounds 4m) and is not expected to make significant profits until it gains
approval in the big markets of the US and Europe. It has gained acceptance
in Canada, and has recently been approved in Australia and Russia.
Net interest charges fell from Pounds 47.9m to Pounds 47.1m. A settlement of
a tax dispute in the US cut the tax charge from 26.2 per cent in 1992 to
24.7 per cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 26.2p to 32.7p.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Premiums for three market newcomers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There were premiums for all three of yesterday's newcomers to the stock
market.
Shares in DFS Furniture, the specialist upholstery retailer, ended their
first day's trading at 271p, compared to the 260p issue price. Some 17m
shares were traded.
The rise increases the value of the 51.7 per cent stake retained by Mr
Graham Kirkham, chairman, by about Pounds 6m. He raised Pounds 129m by
selling 47.7 per cent of the group's shares in the flotation.
The public offer of 17.5m shares was 1.3 times subscribed, and allocations
were skewed towards smaller investors.
This may have created some demand for shares yesterday from larger investors
disappointed by the allotments.
Azlan Group, the networking products distributor which came to the market
this week, saw its shares close 11p up on the 230p offer price.
Some Pounds 6m, net of expenses, was raised in the flotation. The proceeds
will be used to increase its market share and expand internationally.
Shares of Hozelock, the garden equipment manufacturer, recovered from an
early low of 235p to close 1p above the issue price at 251p.
Analysts said trading had been buoyant, with good two-way business.
The group raised a net Pounds 18m through the placing of 11.2m ordinary
shares, half of which were subject to a clawback to meet retail demand
through intermediaries. The offer was 2.1 times subscribed.
The company will be using Pounds 5.4m of the proceeds to redeem existing
preference shares and Pounds 8.5m to repay bank and shareholder loans. The
balance will provide working capital.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Aim shares fall 30p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Aim Group, the maker of aircraft interior fittings, fell 30p to
143p yesterday following the company's warning on second half turnover and
profits.
It cited the recent announcement by Saab-Scania that certification of its
new Saab 2000 airliner had been delayed by a year until October 1994. The
supply of its interior is the group's largest contract.
Aim said that the aerospace market continued to weaken and although first
half profits should be in line with expectations, it was unlikely that
current full-year profits would exceed Pounds 2m. Profits for the year to
April 30 1993 amounted to Pounds 3.63m.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Merrett appoints new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrett Group yesterday appointed Mr Alan Cleary, the chairman of its loss
adjusting arm, as group chief executive in a move which indicated that it
may seek to restructure its business around its insurance services - rather
than Lloyd's agency - interests.
Efforts to salvage Merrett Underwriting Agency Management, whose prospects
have been brought into question by the difficulties of two of its largest
syndicates, are continuing. Both syndicates 418 and 1067 were hit by the
withdrawal last week of a plan by Travelers, the US insurance company, to
offer backing which would have helped compensate for a sharp fall in support
from members' agents.
Neither syndicate may have enough backing to continue underwriting in 1994,
leaving their Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - with
a potentially expensive 'run-off' (meeting claims on existing policies).
Mr Cleary joined Merrett in 1991 as chief executive of the services
division, which includes Miller Knight, the loss adjuster, BIS, an insurance
investigations business, Merrett Health Risk Management, and a run-off
company. He was recently appointed chairman of Miller Knight.
As group chief executive he replaces Mr Dennis Purkiss, who recently
resigned to join Zurich Re as chief operating officer. Mr Purkiss, who will
be joined at Zurich by two leading Merrett underwriters - Mr Stewart
Laderman and Mr Ken Barrett, takes over as chief executive officer at Zurich
next year.
Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Merrett Group, said of Mr Cleary 'nobody
is better equipped to see the Merrett Group through these difficult times'.

Optometrics, the USM-quoted optical systems group, reported increased
pre-tax profits of Dollars 98,000 (Pounds 65,770) for the six months to the
end of September, compared with Dollars 29,000.
Mr Frank Denton, chairman, said shipments were above the levels of last year
and the order book remained more than 30 per cent ahead.
Turnover was Dollars 1.88m (Dollars 1.76m). Earnings per share came out at

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Alba advances 36% amid encouraging trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alba, the consumer electronics group and UK market leader in home audio and
small screen colour television sales, yesterday reported a near-36 per cent
rise in interim profits and described pre-Christmas high street trading as
'very satisfactory.'
The rise, from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.63m pre-tax for the six months to
end-September, came on turnover 10.9 per cent higher at Pounds 50.1m. The
comparative profit figure included a Pounds 194,000 loss on the now
discontinued Greenwood Theatre television studios.
Mr John Harris, chairman, said: 'Trading in the UK has been good in the
period under review and, despite the weak trading conditions in France and
Germany, we have experienced reasonable levels of business in these
countries.' He added: 'Current business in the run up to Christmas is very
satisfactory.'
The chairman's comments on current UK trading were in sharp contrast to some
of Alba's competitors including Amstrad, whose chairman, Mr Alan Sugar,
warned last week that there was no evidence of a pre-Christmas high street
spending boom.
In addition to audio and domestic appliances, which Mr Harris said had sold
particularly well, the group has successfully entered the higher profile UK
satellite equipment and Nicam stereo TV markets.
Earnings per share increased to 2.63p (1.82p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 1p.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lowndes Lambert up 24% at Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in both the UK and the US helped Lowndes Lambert, the
insurance broker, increase pre-tax by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.2m for the six
months to end-September.
The interim dividend is lifted from 4.5p to 5p from fully diluted earnings
of 12.2p (10.9p). The shares rose 3p to 417p.
Mr Richard Shaw, chairman, expected further steady growth in the second
half. 'Conditions in our major markets remain difficult but . . . the advent
of new capital into Lloyd's and other sectors of the world market will
increase capacity in 1994.'
Unlike some of its competitors Lowndes Lambert received no benefit from the
strengthening of the dollar, with its conversion rate averaging Dollars 1.58
against sterling in the last two years.
Turnover rose from Pounds 24.9m to Pounds 30.2m while administrative
expenses increased from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 27.8m leaving broking profit
of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 1m).
Income from the UK rose by 14 per cent and from the group's international
division by 9 per cent.
Revenue from North American operations rose by 24 per cent. Of these amounts
Norex, a UK retail and London market broker acquired last year, contributed
Pounds 2.1m in turnover and Pounds 500,000 in broking profits.
Two associated undertakings - a 30 per cent stake in Datasure, and a 45 per
cent share in a French subsidiary, La Nouvelle Securite - brought in a
further Pounds 7m (Pounds 7.3m) in turnover and Pounds 1m in profits.
Profits last year included Pounds 500,000 earned from the sale of a 10 per
cent stake in a subsidiary of La Nouvelle.
Interest receivable was steady at Pounds 1.8m.
COMMENT
Since its flotation in 1991 Lowndes Lambert has steadily improved
productivity recording successive increases in broking profits. With premium
rates rising and prospects for the Lloyd's market - in which Lowndes places
about 25 per cent of its business - reasonably positive, the group seems on
course for full year 1993-94 profits of more than Pounds 13m and earnings
per share of some 30p. At yesterday's closing price of 417p that puts the
shares on a prospective multiple just under 14. Compared to a sector average
for the medium-sized brokers of between 14 and 16 the shares appear to
represent good value.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BSG Intl warns on profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of BSG International, the automotive components manufacturer, fell 12
1/4 p to 56 1/4 p yesterday following a warning from the company that a
further deterioration in continental European car production would adversely
affect full-year profits.
The directors estimated that for the year as a whole production would be 20
per cent lower than in 1992.
As a result, group pre-tax profits for 1993 were expected to fall from a
reported Pounds 12m (restated to Pounds 7.4m for FRS 3) to 'not less than'
Pounds 8.5m.
Should a sale and leaseback of two factories be completed before December 31
an exceptional profit of Pounds 2m would lift the year-end figure to Pounds
10.5m.

Pounds 5.06m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Wagon Industrial, the Telford-based materials handling,
engineering and automotive products group, fell from Pounds 8.52m to Pounds
5.06m in the half year to September 30 as the group absorbed the costs of
restructuring Forkardt, a German subsidiary dependent on the machine tool
market.
The result had been foreshadowed in June when Wagon said that the first half
would be lower than in 1992-93 and that the full-year result would be
similar to 1992-93, before meeting any costs at Forkardt.
Reducing the size of Forkardt cost Pounds 3m, shown as an exceptional item.
Operating profits were Pounds 7.42m against Pounds 8.1m, on improved
turnover of Pounds 132m (Pounds 114m).
Although poor levels of demand in Europe continued to drag down the group's
results, Mr John Hudson, chief executive, said 'the UK is definitely picking
up'.
Wagon, which has net cash balances of Pounds 8m, is looking for further UK
acquisitions. Last August it bought Salter Springs and Pressings for Pounds
2.9m in what looks like the first of a series of acquisitions.
Wagon holds to its June statement of full-year profits similar to those of
1992-93 but has added some gloss. Mr Paul Taylor, chairman, said the board
'feels a little bit more optimistic about prospects than was the case then.'
The interim dividend is maintained at 6.325p, payable from earnings per
share down from 14.62p to 4.52p.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti shareholders favour administration
if GEC bid fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disgruntled Ferranti Internat-ional shareholders are urging that the defence
electronics group should be placed in administration rather than
receivership if GEC's token 1p a share bid is reject-ed.
A court-appointed administrator's role is to try to secure the survival of
the company as a going concern, or achieve a more advantageous realisation
of the company's assets than available through a receiver's winding up of
the company.
Mr John Katz, chairman of the Ferranti Shareholders Support Association, has
challenged GEC and Ferranti and their financial advisers to explain why the
offer document fails to mention the possibility of administration if the bid
fails.
In a letter yesterday to SG Warburg, GEC's adviser, Mr Katz wrote: 'There
may be factual considerations which applied in the (Ferranti) board
preferring to propel the company to receivership if and when your offer is
voted down . . . instead of protecting through administration the banks,
creditors, employees, customers, contractors and shareholders of Ferranti.
'Or possibly, certain banks have denied a petition to allow administration.'
Mr Eugene Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, has told the group's 48,000
shareholders that if GEC's offer is not accepted by shareholders
representing at least 90 per cent of the group's 1bn outstanding shares on
December 8, the closing date for the offer, the banks will be asked to
appoint a receiver.
There are some important differences between receivership and
administration, according to Mr Robert Dow, an editor of PLC, the practical
law magazine for companies.
The main duty of a receiver, who is generally appointed by a secured
creditor such as a bank, is to protect the interest of the bank whereas an
administrator is appointed by the court and protects the interests of the
company and general body of creditors.
An administrator enjoys the benefit of a statutory freeze on enforcement of
creditors' rights and remedies, a benefit which is not available to a
receiver.
However, Mr Dow warned that administration was generally only advantageous
when a company was experiencing temporary cash flow problems, or where no
creditor was able or willing to appoint a receiver.
'If Ferranti's financial position is as bad as the company appears to say,
with no immediately foreseeable improvement, it is difficult to see how
shareholders could benefit from administration.'
In any event, secured creditors may be able to block an administration.
Under the Insolvency Act 1986, notice has to be given to anyone entitled to
appoint a receiver as soon as a petition for an administration order is
presented.
This means that if any of Ferranti's secured creditors, including the 15
banks which are owed some Pounds 100m, chooses to appoint a receiver under a
properly drafted charge, administration would not be an option anyway.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Aberforth Split to raise Pounds 51.5m via
share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aberforth Split Level Trust is seeking to more than double its size by
raising an addi-tional Pounds 51.5m after expenses. As with most recent
trust issues, the funds will be raised via an offer of C shares at 100p
each.
The investment trust, which invests in the shares of small companies, has a
split capital structure, with income shares, capital shares and units (a
combination of one capital and one income share).
In July 1994, the C shares will be convertible, either into a unit, or into
one capital and one income share, at the option of the holder.
Trusts use the C share structure so that the two pools of assets are kept
separ-ate until the money raised via an issue is fully invested. Conversion
then takes place at prices based on the asset values prevailing at the time.
Irrevocable undertakings have been received to apply for 47.5m C shares. The
balance of the offer, some 5.5m C shares, is available to the public.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Shares in Caledonia Investments rise 33p as
profits reach Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Caledonia Invest-ments, the holding company controlled by the
Cayzer family, rose 33p to close at 568p as a dull market welcomed its 27
per cent increase in net asset value per share at the half way stage and
interim pre-tax profits up almost 30 per cent.
Net asset value rose to 625p (491p) after the cumulative write off of some
40p per share in goodwill on acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits, which reached Pounds 25m (Pounds 19.3m) in the six months
to September 30, included a Pounds 3m profit on the sale of operations and
investments.
Mr Peter Buckley, deputy chairman and chief executive, conceded that Pounds
128m (Pounds 140m) in cash and near-cash was not ideal against a background
of low interest rates. He could envisage the company one day having gearing:
'We have received Pounds 427m since 1987 and we have been making selective
purchases with an emphasis on finding our way into more trading situations
since then.'
Profits from trading subsidiaries increased to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.4m),
reflecting an improvement in nearly all sectors. Income from associated
companies also rose strongly to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 5.9m) on the back of a
good performance by Bristow Helicopters and the inclusion of a full six
months profit from Exco, the money broker.
Income from investments fell by Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 6m because of a
one-off dividend related to the flotation of the Telegraph received in the
comparative period and a decision to book dividends at ex-dividend date
rather than at cash received.
Earnings per share rose to 18.9p (14p) and the dividend is lifted to 5.4p
(5p).
COMMENT
The company's recently-announced Dollars 44m (Pounds 29.5m) move into
leisure overseas via a joint venture with some old business partners looks
bold. But Caledonia's record for astute deals includes its sale of a
controlling stake in British and Commonwealth Holdings just before the share
price peaked and subsequent mopping up of some of B&amp;C's businesses from
administrators. The Cayzer caution means the net asset value per share is
probably still less than what could be realised. Mr Buckley, himself a
Cayzer, hopes there is more value in the unlisted associated companies which
posted good results this time. If so, shares are trading at a discount to a
net asset value which understates the worth of the company. Analysts
forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds 49m for the full year.

FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Kewill recovery continues with profits at
Pounds 1.76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery at Kewill Systems continued despite poor trading conditions and the
software supplier said it should return to the dividend list by the end of
the trading year.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.76m for the six months to September 30 compared
with losses of Pounds 172,000, restated for FRS 3.
Kewill had previously been expanding vigorously but high costs and
management problems at a German subsidiary resulted in several months of
reduced profits; the subsidiary has since been sold to its management.
Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, said yesterday's results revealed the group's
underlying strength.
The City, however, marked the shares down 7p to 253p.
Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 16m, compared with Pounds
14.2m.
Operating profit rose 29 per cent from Pounds 1.53m to Pounds 1.97m, while
earnings per share were 10.15p (losses of 3.58p).
Mr Overstall said the company had been successful in petitioning the High
Court to sanction a capital reduction to eliminate the deficit on
distributable reserves; in consequence the company should be in a position
to declare a dividend with its full year results.
He said prospects for the second half would be constrained by economic
conditions in the UK but that US operations, which doubled operating profits
in the first half of the year, were expected to grow strongly.

FT  25 NOV 93 / QVC wins removal of Paramount poison pill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of Paramount Communications was thrown wide open
yesterday as a Delaware court removed the main poison pill provision
designed to protect a friendly Dollars 9.6bn (Pounds 6.4bn) merger with
Viacom.
The Delaware chancery court backed a challenge by QVC Network to a Dollars
500m arrangement aimed at thwarting its hostile bid for Paramount. But the
court failed to overturn a separate Dollars 100m poison pill provision.
The embattled Paramount board, which has refused to enter discussions over
QVC's bid, attacked the court's decision and said it was launching an
immediate appeal in the Delaware supreme court. Viacom also said it was
appealing.
Yesterday's ruling tilted the takeover battle back towards Mr Barry Diller's
QVC. The home shopping channel had said that it would not proceed unless the
poison pills were removed. However, the contest is expected to be drawn out
for at least another two weeks as the case passes to the state supreme
court.
The arrangement overturned by yesterday's court ruling would have given
Viacom the right to buy nearly 24m Paramount shares at its original bid
price of around Dollars 69 a share, had it lost the battle for the film and
television production company. This is around Dollars 21 a share less than
the Dollars 90 a share in cash offered by QVC for 51 per cent of Paramount,
with the balance to be paid for in securities.
QVC failed in its second court application to overturn an agreement under
which Paramount would pay Viacom Dollars 100m if it fell to a higher bidder.
'This to some extent levels the playing field between the two sides,' said
Ms Margo Vignola of Salomon Brothers. 'It's being appealed, but the
sentiment of the court was pretty clear' that the main takeover barrier
should be removed, she said.
Viacom's offer for Paramount was due to expire at midnight last night, and
the company was expected to extend its bid pending the outcome of the
appeals.
Paramount's share price jumped by Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 80 1/8. QVC's
share price slipped by more than Dollars 3, to Dollars 45 3/4, reflecting
fears that a successful QVC bid would dilute the company's earnings, though
it later recovered to close at Dollars 47 3/4. Viacom's A shares climbed
Dollars 3 to Dollars 50 3/4.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle's 17% rise beats forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record UK profit and currency gains helped Tate &amp; Lyle to increase annual
pre-tax profits by 17.4 per cent to Pounds 222.5m. That was above market
expectations, which had been revised downwards in September when the
sweeteners company warned of difficult trading conditions in the North
American sugar market.
The shares gained 9p to 395p. A final dividend of 8.7p is proposed, which
would raise the total from 12p to 13p, in line with Tate's policy of a
'progressive' dividend.
Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, said the outlook for the current year was
encouraging, with productivity gains and improved trading conditions
expected.
He emphasised that Tate is primarily a processor of agricultural products
and is exposed to influences such as the weather, crop sizes and government
regulation. The group's main problems in the year were a bumper sugar beet
crop in the US, leading to lower prices and government imposed limits on
sales, and a glut of potato starch in Europe, hitting prices there. In each
case, conditions were expected to improve in 1994.
Mr Shaw said he was 'very pleased' by the approval given to the Nafta trade
agreement in the US. Tate plans to expand its interests in Mexico, where it
has a starch plant.
Tate is expanding in many developing countries, where the growth in
consumption of its products is concentrated. In central Europe, it has set
up a number of joint ventures, although it has yet to earn a normal return
on its investment. Tate is now looking to establish joint ventures in China
and south-east Asia.
Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said cash-flow had been strong. Net debt
fell by Pounds 15m to Pounds 627m, although the weak pound meant the
translation of the group's debt, which is largely in US dollars, added
Pounds 94m to borrowings.
Gearing was 78 per cent at the year end, down from 89 per cent a year
earlier, in spite of a Pounds 20m write-down of UK property values. Mr Lewis
said with interest cover of 5.7 times, up from 5, and given that it had
written off Pounds 500m of goodwill over the years, the group was
comfortable with its balance sheet.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Kwik Save says the going will get tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik Save, the UK's leading discount food retailer, yesterday unveiled a 14
per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.1m, but admitted the
supermarket price war would make it hard to maintain its sales and profits
growth of recent years.
Mr Graeme Bowler, Kwik Save's chief executive since June, said there had
been an 'unprecedented surge' in price competition as superstore chains had
woken up to the changing nature of the UK food market.
'I think the superstores have done a wonderful job for years of pulling the
wool over customers' eyes, and telling them it really doesn't matter how
much they spend on food,' he said.
That had opened the way for the discount sector - a problem which the
superstores were now addressing. 'It will be harder to maintain the rate of
growth in sales and profits we have experienced over the last five years,'
he conceded.
Mr Bowler vigorously countered City fears that Kwik Save had lost its edge
on price by extending its range. He said its wider range, including leading
brands at very low prices, set it apart from the 'limited offer of mainly
unknown brands' provided by newcomers to the UK discount market such as
Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto, and France's Ed.
Kwik Save's sales for the year to August 28 increased 14.4 per cent to
Pounds 2.86bn.
Some 8.4 percentage points of the increase came from existing stores, with
'no discernible inflation' in selling prices. That meant Kwik Save's sales
growth was ahead of the leading superstore chains, which have been seeing
negligible underlying growth in recent years.
New stores added 6.1 points, with a handful of store closures removing 0.1
points.
Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said gross margins were down slightly.
That resulted partly from rising sales of lower-margin liquor and tobacco,
but also from Kwik Save's policy of investing gross margin in lowering
prices to drive volumes. He added, however, that Kwik Save had been able to
pass some margin pressure on to its suppliers.
The operating margin fell from 4.2 per cent to 4 per cent.
Mr Pretty also emphasised the group's strong cash-flow, which enabled it to
spend Pounds 103.2m on 69 new stores, store refits and new systems, without
borrowing. Capital spending is expected to increase to Pounds 120m next
year, with up to 80 new stores to be added to the 814 trading at the year
end.
Income from concessions within Kwik Save stores selling fresh foods - an
important part of the Kwik Save formula - increased 23 per cent.
Earnings increased 15.1 per cent to 55.49p. The final dividend was 12.9p,
bringing the total for the year to 18.3p, up 14.4 per cent. The shares
closed down 9p at 573p.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Volvo shareholder deals blow to merger

Volvo's struggle to win approval for the planned merger of its car and truck
operations with France's Renault suffered a serious blow yesterday when the
first institutional shareholder to declare a final position said it would
vote against the deal.
Although the so-called Fifth Fund state pension fund holds only 1.3 per cent
of Volvo's voting capital, its rejection indicated that Volvo's intensive
effort to overcome objections by large Swedish shareholders had failed.
Meanwhile, Mr Louis Schwei-tzer, Renault chairman, told the FT that a
rejection of the planned merger would damage existing co-operation between
Volvo and Renault. 'The momentum would disappear,' he said. He added that
the disruption to the merger process had already destabilised efforts to
build a joint management organisation.
Mr Schweitzer stressed the industrial logic of the proposed merger. The cost
savings which would result through joint purchasing, research and
development and economies of scale would strengthen the two companies' car
and truck operations.
The outcome of a vote by Volvo shareholders on December 7 may now swing on a
decision expected today from another state pension group, the Fourth Fund.
It is Volvo's second-largest shareholder after Renault, with 7.5 per cent of
the voting capital against the French group's 10 per cent.
Mr Bert Ekstrom, chief executive of the Fifth Fund, said the fund rejected
the merger because of uncertainties over the values implied in the
agreement, which proposes a 35 per cent share for Volvo in the merged
company.
He said the fund - which is governed by trade union, local government and
state industry representatives - was also sceptical about French commitments
to privatise Renault, in spite of assurances from Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French prime minister, on the timing of the privatisation and on the golden
share that France intends to hold in the merged company.

FT  25 NOV 93 / PowerGen in move to cut pool prices: Profits rise 10% -
Shake-up suggestion comes before regulator's MMC decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen, the power company, yesterday floated the idea of a significant
change to price determination in England and Wales's electricity trading
pool as it revealed a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 108m.
The suggestion comes ahead of a decision later this year by Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, on whether to refer PowerGen
and National Power, the other large generator, to the Monopolies and Merger
Commission. His inquiries have been prompted by sharp pool price rises.
Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said there was a strong argument in
favour of the main determinant of the pool price being the average price of
all generating plant needed to run the system.
The main determinant of the existing system is the 'marginal' price, that is
the cost of the most expensive plant. Invariably the marginal plant is owned
by either National Power or PowerGen, who critics say have too much
influence.
Mr Wallis said moving to an average price system would overcome the
perception that two big players dominate the pool.
PowerGen's interim figures for the six months to October 3 showed the
company's turnover fell 3 per cent from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.27bn.
Earnings per share were up 13 per cent to 9.71p (from 8.58p) and the
dividend, already announced, rises 18 per cent from 3.35p to 3.95p.
Mr Wallis said market share fell marginally from 26.3 to 26.1 per cent and
predicted it would reduce to 22 per cent by 1998. This compares with 30 per
cent at privatisation three years ago.
The half year's performance was helped by a reduction of 200 in job numbers
to 5,770 and a fall in coal stocks from 15.5m tonnes to 14.25m.
The company expects to cut stocks to 5m tonnes by 1997-8, with most of the
reductions achieved in the next two years. In contrast to National Power,
PowerGen is not expecting significant closures of power stations by the end
of the decade. Mr Wallis said it was possible all 11 stations could survive
until the next century, although it was unlikely that two, High Marnham and
Drakelow, would survive much after that.
The company charged Pounds 12m to the profit and loss account, the same as
last year, but unlike National Power did not make adjustments for the
positive effects of a European Community ruling on pensions.
An adjustment of about Pounds 16m is likely for pensions at the year-end
results. Of the half-year charge of Pounds 12m, some Pounds 9m related to
liability and damage claims.
Sir Colin Southgate, announcing his first results as PowerGen chairman, said
performance this year had been up to expectations.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Poisoned apple within the magic kingdom: Euro Disney is
Disney's albatross
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, marked the occasion of his
signing of the agreement in 1987 to open the EuroDisneyland theme park in
France, by presenting Mr Jacques Chirac, then the French premier, with an
original slide from a Disney cartoon - the witch handing the poisoned apple
to Snow White.
This choice now seems eerily appropriate as Disney starts the painstaking
process of restructuring the finances of Euro Disney, which earlier this
month reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 600m) for the year ended
September. The US group must somehow coax, or bully, the 60 international
banks that own Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn debt to agree to a radical
refinancing.
Disney last week kicked off negotiations by convening a special meeting in
Paris with the banks, which are believed to include Banque Nationale de
Paris, Caisse des Depots and Indosuez of France, and Merrill Lynch of the
US. The banks are hurriedly assembling a steering committee (expected to be
led by Indosuez or BNP) to spearhead their discussions with Disney.
The banks are bracing themselves for a tense game of financial poker against
Disney which, under Mr Eisner (or 'Ice Man Mike' as he is known in the
Hollywood film industry) has become renowned as one of the toughest
companies in the US.
The crux of Euro Disney's problems is that it is crushed by its financial
structure. It cannot afford to service the FFr20.3bn net debt with which it
is burdened after exceeding its construction budget and the drain on
cash-flow resulting from its trading difficulties.
Euro Disney says it is still self-financing, but admits that it is likely to
run out of money early next year. Disney has agreed to bail it out, but has
stressed it will only do so for 'a limited period' to enable Euro Disney to
restructure its finances 'by spring 1994'.
The main aim of Disney and Euro Disney, advised respectively by Lazard in
New York and SG Warburg in London, is to reduce Euro Disney's debt to a
manageable level. Analysts suspect that they hope to halve the debt to
around FFr10bn. This could be achieved by a combination of a debt-for-equity
swap by the banks; by bringing in new equity partners on a deeply discounted
basis; and a rights issue for existing shareholders.
Disney's main negotiating weapon against the banks is to threaten to close
EuroDisneyland unless they agree to rescue it. In theory Disney could afford
to do so. Indeed it could argue that it cannot afford not to, given that
Disney's share of Euro Disney's losses dragged it into the red with a net
loss of Dollars 77.8m in the fourth quarter of its last financial year. Ms
Margo Vignola, analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, described Euro
Disney as an 'albatross' for its US parent.
If Disney did withdraw, the banks would have to write off their entire
exposure of FFr20.3bn to Euro Disney. The banks are gambling that Disney,
which until the present debacle was seen as one of the US's most successful
companies, would be loathe to tarnish its gilded reputation by admitting
defeat in Europe. They are expected to press Disney to play its part in
alleviating Euro Disney's financial plight.
Disney would be expected to participate fully in a rights issue but it is
highly unlikely that it would agree to provide further capital. If it raised
its stake above the present level of 49 per cent it would, under US
accounting regulations, have to consolidate Euro Disney's debt on to its own
balance sheet.
However the banks could try to force Disney to reduce its income from Euro
Disney. The US parent has already agreed to waive its 'management fee' of 3
per cent of Euro Disney's revenue until the company is profitable. The banks
might ask Disney to cut the 'royalty fee' of 10 per cent on admissions and 5
per cent of food and merchandise sales. This fee totalled FFr262m last year.
Meanwhile Disney hopes that the French government, anxious to protect the
more than 10,000 jobs created at EuroDisneyland, will 'encourage' the banks
to bail it out. One option would be for the Caisse des Depots, the
state-controlled financial institution, to reduce the 7.8 per cent interest
rate levied on its FFr4.8bn of Euro Disney's debt.
In the meantime Euro Disney's finances are deteriorating, as illustrated by
yesterday's 18.6 per cent fall in the share price to a new low of FFr27.20,
which could depress the potential proceeds from a rights issue. As the two
camps prepare for battle, the 'poisoned apple' is rotting away.

FT  25 NOV 93 / BT board agrees trial for 'video on demand' service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Telecommunications board has given the go-ahead for a
multi-million-pound market trial of its video-on-demand television service.
It is the first step in BT's ambitious plan to deliver feature films and
other television programmes to consumers' screens in more than 20m UK homes
through its telephone network.
If the initial experiment is a success BT will move on to a large scale
trial involving 250,000 homes and investment in the region of Pounds 50m.
BT has already demonstrated sending good quality television pictures down
ordinary telephone lines at the same time as the lines are being used for
ordinary telephone conversations.
The aim is to offer subscribers a wide range of entertainment and
information services from data bases for a fee.
About 2,500 homes in the Colchester area of Essex will be chosen for the
initial commercial trial which will get under way next year.
BT engineers believe as many as 90 per cent of the 23m homes connected to
its network would be able to receive the digitally compressed pictures.
According to potential programme suppliers to the BT service the BT board
decided to go ahead with the commercial experiment after a boardroom
demonstration of the technology earlier this month.
The Independent Television Commission said in September that its legal
advice suggested that true video-on-demand, where individual subscribers
choose their own programme or service from a database, would probably not
need a local delivery, or cable licence, because it was not a broadcast
service.
If video on demand, which requires a special digital box to receive the
pictures, were to take off it could pose competition for video shops and to
a lesser extent cable and satellite television.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Establish new Ulster assembly, Major told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ulster Unionist leader Mr James Molyneaux urged Mr John Major yesterday
to drop his search for a comprehensive constitutional settlement for
Northern Ireland in favour of a drive to establish a new Ulster assembly.
Mr Molyneaux, who holds an effective veto over the prime minister's efforts,
said the groundwork for all-party talks on devolved government could be
completed within two weeks.
Resumed talks should focus on the creation of the 85-seat legislative
assembly - the model for which was drawn up in abortive talks last year.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Molyneaux said there was 'a
fair chance' that Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, would be
able 'within a week or two' to identify common ground between the province's
political parties. That 'will enable us to start the process of restoring
accountable democracy for Northern Ireland'.
His comments came as Mr Major appeared to improve strained relations with
the Rev Ian Paisley by telling the leader of the hard-line Democratic
Unionist party that proposals for a political settlement leaked in Dublin
last week were totally unacceptable.
In spite of the latest setbacks, Downing Street signalled Mr Major's
determination to press on with efforts to find a settlement by announcing
that he had set up a group of senior ministers to oversee policy. Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, also sought to reassure unionist
politicians that fears about Dublin's intentions were groundless.
But Mr Molyneaux said the Major-Reynolds initiative was doomed. Dublin would
give up its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland only in return for
'something which has the same effect as the territorial claim'.
Asked if they should break off negotiations, he responded: 'Well, it's
futile, isn't it, because unless they could get agreement to something which
was as significant and acceptable to the IRA as joint authority leading on
to Irish unity, then it is not going to make any difference to the so-called
peace process.'
It made sense for the two leaders to meet regularly: 'But what I think they
ought to be realistic about is the fact that the two governments cannot
really influence the decisions of Mr Adams and his cohorts in the IRA.'
Mr Molyneaux said the Dublin proposals offer 'a structure that would bring
about the unification of the national territory'. The draft paper had 'all
the designs and a good many of the paragraphs' of the initiative launched by
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein. He described the Hume-Adams plan as a 'fiendishly
clever operation' to secure Irish unification.
Mr Major's search for a comprehensive agreement between London, Dublin and
the Northern Ireland parties had 'lost a great deal of its validity', he
said.
The IRA could be defeated only by tougher security measures, Mr Molyneaux
added. He backed the reintroduction of selective detention, or internment.

FT  25 NOV 93 / China seeks foreign financing for Pounds 81bn transport
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China plans to spend 700bn yuan (Pounds 81bn) by the year 2000 to overcome
chronic transport infrastructure problems restraining economic growth.
The official Xinhua news agency says China will pour funds into building
railways, highways, waterways, pipelines and civil aviation facilities.
Foreigners will be encouraged to invest in Chinese infrastructure as
partners in joint ventures or as sole operators. Hong Kong entrepreneurs are
already deeply engaged in infrastructure projects, including toll roads,
ports and power stations.
Reports by the World Bank and other institutions cite inadequate
transportation as one of the main barriers to faster and more orderly
economic development. The new infrastructure blueprint includes:
A plan to boost the total length of railways from 53,000km to 70,000km.
Rolling-stock capacity would be increased by 20 per cent to help meet demand
in an economy expected to grow by 8-9 per cent annually.
A road-building programme to add about 200,000km to the country's inadequate
network. Only 6,000km of the present 1.02m km are classified as highway,
properly paved and consisting of more than one lane each way.
Doubling the number of ports to 600. An estimated 50 per cent of ships
calling at China's cargo-clogged ports have to wait days before unloading.
Xinhua said 'bolder steps' would be taken to encourage foreigners to invest
in China's infrastructure. The agency did not specify what that meant, but
the Chinese authorities have been aggressively seeking outside help by
offering a range of incentives for build-operate-transfer projects.
'While continuing to use loans provided by the World Bank and foreign
governments, China will welcome foreign investors to run joint ventures or
solely owned ventures in the construction of railways, highways and civil
aviation facilities other than air control systems.'
China and South Korea agreed yesterday to build a 570km undersea
telecommunications fibre-optic cable to carry 15,000 telephone lines. The
agreement reflects growing trade links between the two countries.

FT  25 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tate &amp; Lyle's share price is now back to within spitting distance of where
it was when the company issued its profits warning in September. In the
light of worries elsewhere in the food sector that is a doubly commendable
performance, so there are grounds for wondering whether the warning was
necessary in the first place. Doubtless companies should not allow
expectations to stray too far out of line. But it also helps to massage
expectations. On that basis, incidentally, it is hard to see many being
willing to correct assumptions that are too low. The important thing is to
pre-empt disappointment on the day. Attention yesterday focused less on
Tate's mere 17 per cent increase in profits than on the thought that its
prospects are slowly improving.
Last year, currency movements accounted for nearly two thirds of the
increase in profits. This year the emphasis should be more on underlying
growth, with improvement in the US stemming both from higher sugar prices
and from cost cutting at Staley. There should also be some recovery of the
European sweetener market.
Together with Tate's strong cashflow and its own estimate that changes in
the last budget defer the onset of an ACT problem till 1996, this leaves
scope for continued dividend progression. Tate will doubtless hope that this
pushes its share price high enough to encourage conversion of its preference
shares. Interest cover of 5.7 times leaves little to fear in gearing of 78
per cent. A lower figure would provide more flexibility for expansion
nevertheless.

FT  25 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik Save's full year figures cast little light on what the future holds.
While European discount chains have long been a threat, the big guns of UK
food retailing started cutting prices only after the financial year end. The
performance of Kwik Save's shares reflects as much: holding up well to the
end of August but falling by 20 per cent since. More important than the 14
per cent rise in profits, then, is the message that sales growth is now
slowing as competition takes hold.
Having set out its stall as a discount chain, Kwik Save has little option
but to match J. Sainsbury and Tesco on price. Margins are being defended by
asking suppliers to fund price cuts. As a champion of branded goods, Kwik
Save holds strong cards in such negotiations. But manufacturers can only be
squeezed so far. Kwik Save has in the past sacrificed margin in favour of
volume growth and it would be strange if the company reacted differently to
this latest challenge. How far margins might have to fall to keep sales
moving is in the hands of the competition.
With a return on capital higher than its peers - and a store opening
programme funded entirely out of cashflow - Kwik Save can afford to keep
expanding even as the pressure builds. But new stores alone will not deliver
earnings growth if margins are falling elsewhere. If returns on new
investment turn out to be much lower than in the past, the argument for
spending less and distributing more to shareholders will be compelling.

FT  25 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: PowerGen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The heavy provisions which both PowerGen and National Power carry mean that
they look more like Swiss banks than electricity companies. PowerGen topped
up another Pounds 12m yesterday, offsetting the Pounds 11m it has spent in
the first half. The provision was to index the present value of long tail
liabilities, but the Pounds 300m total it has stashed away for a rainy day
looks excessive for such a well capitalised company. The latitude allowed
finance directors to interpret the blurred border between prudent accounting
and profit-smoothing is something the Accounting Standards Board could
usefully address.
Another of the generators' little nest eggs is also beginning to hatch.
PowerGen's coal stocks fell by 1.25m tonnes in the first half - releasing
Pounds 46m in cash. If its stocks decline to 5m tonnes over the next 2
years, working capital will be cut by a further Pounds 300m. With such a
cast iron balance sheet, the company is hoping that diversification will
make its capital work harder. If that induces a justifiable queasiness, at
least PowerGen has proved itself a good project manager on its mainstream
capital expenditure programme.
It will be difficult, however, to find sufficiently attractive projects to
put the company's financial power fully to work. If PowerGen is as prudent
as its accounting, shareholders may see some of their equity returned. That
will only increase the financial attractions should the generators avoid a
blind date with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

From the government which brought the nation the farcical ITV franchise
auctions comes another blockbuster of legislative muddle. For the second
time in as many years, the government is proposing to tamper with the
industry's structure, turning the quoted television sector into a
speculator's playground. The proposed relaxation of the franchise rules has
already resulted in stock market mayhem as investors anticipate a rash of
takeovers reducing the 14 ITV companies to just eight. A failure of bids to
materialise will produce some nasty crashes.
However, it would be surprising if Granada did not now tilt at LWT. It is
also a racing certainty that Carlton will bid for Central, although the OFT
may worry about its combined share of ITV advertising revenue. Both these
targets could, of course, make bids themselves to try to evade takeover. The
hypothetical bidding scenarios which could result are mind-boggling.
The change in the rules will throw up unmissable opportunities to grab a
bigger slice of the ITV network. It could still be tricky to make the
takeover sums work. Television companies are relatively transparent and
bidders will have a good idea of their target's current worth. But the ITC's
insistence on regional programming will prevent the wholesale
rationalisation of costs. Moreover, ITV companies will require rights issues
to fund acquisitions. Yet they will have to raise money in ignorance of the
future shape of the industry and with the fate of the BBC and the laws
governing cross-ownership of the media still hanging in the balance.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Personal View: A blueprint for quality quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF MULGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of quangos in the UK is increasing at a significant pace, taking
more and more power away from local government. The trend is at odds with
the renewed interest in local accountability, as manifested in the work of
the Local Government Commission and urban partnership projects such as City
Pride.
Health authorities, training and enterprise councils (Tecs), development
agencies and housing trusts are all quangos that operate at a local level
with substantial budgets and powers. But all are nationally appointed by the
relevant secretaries of state, and, as a consequence, have doubtful
credentials when it comes to accountability and legitimacy.
Few wish to see such bodies again run directly by local authorities. But
there is a widely recognised need for reforms to make such bodies more
accountable and more responsive to the main users. What is needed is better
accountability and more efficiency, both of which can be nurtured by more
'contestability'. It would involve two innovations: first a new approach to
appointment; second a new public power of dismissal.
Appointment of bodies such as health authorities would be the responsibility
of an 'appointment commission' representing the set of democratically
elected institutions with a legitimate interest in the make-up of the
relevant organisations. This could take the form of one-third national
government, one-third local government and one-third other stake-holder
interests agreed by both groups.
The appointment of a new board would be announced publicly, with a six-month
lead-in time. Their first budgets would also be made public, providing a
transparent framework for potential bidders. It would then be open to any
group to apply to become the board, just as a contractor would bid to run a
local service. These bidders might range from companies or groups of local
government officers to campaigning organisations. Bidders would be required
to set out their plans: the targets (if any) they aim to achieve; their
management approaches; their business plan; and how they would meet their
goals within the stated framework budget. The 'appointment commission' would
then, by successive rounds of elimination, choose a winner.
This model has several virtues. It would encourage creative 'coalition
building' - for example, between groups of doctors, administrators, health
activists and general practitioners. It would be difficult for a board to
represent only a narrow range of interests, and almost impossible for it to
be used as an arm of party patronage as is often the case at present. It
would encourage the evolution of more co-operative structures - strategic
alliances between different kinds of intermediate body would probably
result. And it would make criteria of evaluation transparent, since each
bidder would set out what it aimed to achieve and could be called to account
at a later date.
The second requirement is to inject a credible competitive threat: a
mechanism whereby a board can be removed if it under-performs. This could
work very simply. If a board is deemed to be acting against the public
interest, the relevant electorate would be able to petition for its removal.
Five per cent of the population covered by a particular body - whether a
Tec, health authority or urban development corporation - could sign a formal
petition to demand a referendum on whether to retain the current board
make-up. Ideally this would coincide with a local or national election. If
the referendum went against the incumbents, by a simple majority, the
appointments procedure would be set in motion to choose an alternative
group. The approach would mimic purer democratic forms, but would only need
to be used in extremis, given the difficulties involved in mobilising 5 per
cent of any population. Such a power of removal could dramatically influence
the behaviour of such boards.
The idea has an interesting parallel. The task for public policy makers in
monopolistic industries has been to replicate some of the effects of
competition by making market entry easier. In the utilities the regulator's
task is to ensure that, even without the reality of competition, the threat
 -termed contestability - of competition forces managers to behave more
efficiently.
In governance, too, there is now a need for more imaginative mechanisms
which can marry accountability and efficiency and an appropriate level of
public involvement. Contestability offers a good alternative to Whitehall
patronage on the one hand and Town Hall patronage on the other.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Leading Article: New moves in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International peace efforts in Bosnia, of which so many have come to grief,
are understandably greeted with increasing scepticism. But the latest
initiative of the European Union has the merit of once more directly
involving governments in the negotiations, instead of putting all the onus
on the two international negotiators, Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg. That
might just give the whole exercise more weight, particularly since US and
Soviet representatives have been asked to join the twelve in the talks due
to start in Geneva on Monday.
The proposal agreed by the EU foreign ministers this week seeks to adopt a
hard-headed approach, which is a far cry from the abortive Vance-Owen plan,
with its emphasis on an equitable division of the three ethnic communities
into provinces within a unitary Bosnian state. It offers a progressive
suspension of international sanctions against Serbia if Bosnia's Moslems are
given 3 to 4 per cent more land than they were offered in last September's
plan for the partition of the country into three ethnic mini-states.
That is a realistic proposition, at least in principle, since Bosnia's
Moslem-dominated parliament rejected the plan precisely because it fell
short by some 3 per cent of the Moslems' territorial demands. Yet it is
bound to be criticised by those who feel that the Bosnian Serbs have already
been amply 'rewarded' for their ethnic cleansing policies by retaining much
of the land that they have conquered by force of arms.
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, who has called a general
election next month, would undoubtedly greatly benefit from a lifting of
sanctions. These have caused immense hardship both in Serbia and its ally
Montenegro, provoking serious shortages of all kinds and unprecedented
levels of hyperinflation and unemployment.
Whether Mr Milosevic can deliver the Bosnian Serbs, however, is quite
another matter. Whereas he can probably twist the arm of Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, it will be much harder to bring
the military into line. The new plan has already been rejected by Gen Ratko
Mladic, the hardline commander-in-chief of the Bosnian Serb army, whose
contempt for agreements reached by political leaders appears to be a matter
of reflex.
This is a serious problem, since the military on all sides have a vital role
to play in guaranteeing the safe passage of United Nations relief convoys at
a time when harsh winter weather is threatening the lives of hundreds of
thousands more Bosnians.
Unless the talks make progress, this may be the last winter of UN
involvement in Bosnia. The main contributors to UN forces in the former
Yugoslavia, such as France and Britain, are now seriously thinking of
withdrawing their troops next year if the political stalemate continues.
Serbia would then face continued war, tougher sanctions and no prospect of
an end to its diplomatic isolation.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Faint signs of life among the ruins: Italy's old political
order has collapsed and a new one is struggling to be born
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The process of change in Italy has acquired a new and more chaotic rhythm.
Until last Sunday's local elections, the ruling parties looked capable of
either delaying or blocking genuine reform of the political system. But the
spectacular collapse of support for the Christian Democrats and their allies
has removed this possibility.
The system of political and economic power, constructed and refined over
four decades by the Christian Democrats and their henchmen, has begun to
implode. In parliament, where their four-party coalition notionally enjoys a
working majority, they account for no more than 15 per cent of the national
vote. Yet these discredited parties are meant to be the pillar of
parliamentary support for the government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
This raises worrying questions, not only for Italians, who initially reacted
with mindless shock to the new political geography, but also for Italy's
international partners, concerned about the country's governability, its
commitment to tackle public finances and press on with ambitious
privatisation plans.
The fears are genuine, reflected in the sharp falls on the stock market and
the decline in the value of the lira in the early part of the week. However,
they need not be exaggerated, provided Italians retain their fine sense of
self-preservation and choose not to shoot themselves in the collective foot
by backing away from reform.
'Throughout the period of change since the general elections (April 1992),
the political parties have always been brought face to face with reality by
the markets,' claimed one senior politician.
'In other words, when things get chaotic here, we are reminded of the
consequences by pressure on the lira and losses on the bourse. Equally,
Italy wants to be a responsible member of the international community and
there are limits as to how irresponsibly we can behave at home.'
The previous government of Mr Guiliano Amato cleverly exploited this
argument to the full in steering reforms and the budget through parliament
last year. Mr Ciampi, persuaded to leave the governorship of the Bank of
Italy to become prime minister in May, may lack the political background to
play this game of political balancing. Nevertheless his experience as a
central banker should give added weight to his insistence that Italy's
credibility now depends on quick approval of the 1994 budget.
He also managed to persuade Mr Achille Occhetto, the leader of the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), to come out on Tuesday with a
formal statement backing the budget. Mr Occhetto, fresh from the success of
his party in the municipal elections and a possible partner in a future
government, demonstrated he has every interest in appearing a responsible
figure. Behind the bellicose rhetoric of Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the
Northern League, a similar realism probably lies.
The budget envisages raising L32,000bn (Pounds 13bn) through extra taxes and
spending cuts to hold the public sector deficit to below 9 per cent of gross
domestic product. The bulk will come from sharp reductions in spending in
all ministries, as well as through a shake-up of the civil service.
Parliament has been quietly seeking to erode parts of the austerity package
and preserve the public administration from predatory cuts; thus there is a
sizeable element in both houses with an interest in altering the budget and
weakening both the fiscal side and the spending cuts.
However, the government is ready to resign if the budget fails to pass
before the end of the year - as it must by law. Were the government to leave
en masse, parliament would almost certainly be unable to approve legislation
altering electoral constituencies.
Further, the fall of the Ciampi government on the budget issue would leave
no alternative but to go to the polls immediately, without constituency
changes. This would make a mockery of the new first-past-the-post system
because electoral boundaries would not have been redrawn. Despite the
rumblings from some Christian Democrats and Socialists, it is therefore hard
to see the budget failing.
The parties' sense of realism will ride side by side with a ferocious battle
for political power, however. This has been all too evident as more and more
of the dying regime's dirty linen floats to the surface. In the past two
months the Italian public has been treated to stories of a rebellious
military preparing coups, and revelations about the misuse of secret service
funds to bankroll the private lives of politicians.
So much mud has been flying that some at least has stuck to every
institution, including the presidency. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was
obliged to go on television at short notice to deny reports that when he was
interior minister he knew about the misuse of secret service funds. This is
the one ministry the Christian Democrats have never relinquished since 1946,
and it has influenced some of the most sensitive aspects of national life.
It is widely believed to have sat on the truth about many poorly explained
events, including links between politicians and the mafia and the kidnap and
killing of former premier Aldo Moro.
As the old edifice crumbles, everyone is simultaneously quarrelling over the
inheritance and desperately laying down markers for a stake in the next
republic. The existence of so many latent scandals, to say nothing of the
ongoing corruption investigations, is a potent destabilising element. But
the collapse of the old parties reduces the relevance of such muck-raking
since it affects people and institutions on the way out.
The timescale in which the political parties have to regroup or recycle
themselves is very tight if elections are to be held in March, as expected.
The need to regroup explains why the Christian Democrats and their allies
will still do all they can to put back the date as late as possible.
Even during the summer, after an earlier round in June of poor municipal
election results, the Christian Democrats were still confident of remaining
the country's largest party. Having conceded hegemony in the north to Mr
Umberto Bossi's Northern League, the party had hoped to remain the dominant
force southwards from Rome, leaving central Italy, the old 'red belt', to
the PDS.
This scenario no longer applies. The league has established itself as the
dominant force in the north with one third of the vote; while the
neo-fascist MSI has emerged to take a similar share from Rome southwards.
The only party capable of a sizeable national presence is the former
communist PDS.
The rise of the MSI, which owes its inspiration to the corporatist state and
law and order policies of Mussolini, might seem perverse. But on closer
inspection it has captured those who have deserted the old ruling parties
and are reluctant to endorse the left. The new electoral laws for local
elections encourage a polarisation of politics - and the electorate has
simply opted for the few parties untainted by power or corruption.
The full impact of the MSI cannot be assessed until after the run-off in
mayoral elections, due on December 5. In Rome Mr Gianfranco Fini, the MSI
leader, is challenging Mr Francesco Rutelli, the Green candidate backed by
the PDS and a leftist alliance. In Naples, Ms Alessandra Mussolini,
grand-daughter of Il Duce, is in a run-off against the PDS and its allies.
If the PDS and its supporters fail to win both cities it would be a serious
blow and the political panorama would be even more confused. On present
form, it would mean that in the run-up to the next general election there
would be absolutely no clear alliance likely to form a stable government.
But at the moment, even one day is a long time in Italian politics.

A stockbroker offering to sell 20,000 shares when he meant to sell 2,000
might be considered unfortunate. But to try to sell 200m shares worth
Dollars 1bn - as Thai stockbroker Phatra Thanakit did the other day - is
mind-boggling, especially since the company in question, Ayudhya Investment
and Trust Co (Aitco), only had 25m shares in issue.
Rival Bangkok brokers spotted the error and started buying more of the
non-existent stock - adding to the problems of the well-connected Phatra,
which co-operates with SG Warburg in researching Thai companies.
Phatra's shares were suspended, much to the embarrassment of Phatra's
president, Viroj Nualkhair, who is also vice-president of the Stock Exchange
of Thailand. Luckily for him and his firm, the stock exchange cancelled the
relevant transactions, but not before more than 18m Aitco shares had been
bought.
A post-mortem is being conducted to find out how the extra five zeros crept
into the sell order from a sub-broker. But if it simply blames a faulty
computer, then the central issue will just have been ducked.
Did Phatra contravene the regulations, by allowing sub-brokers' orders to be
routed automatically through its computer system to the market?

Michael Heseltine, Britain's secretary of state for trade and industry,
proffered some advice to those gathered at the Institute of Directors'
dinner on Tuesday evening.
When he was in business he met his finance director every Friday afternoon
to talk about some, but not all, the creditors. As he put it: 'Sometimes in
life it's better not to know too much.'
He placed his creditors in three categories: those who had sent solicitors'
letters; those who had issued writs; and those whose writs were 14 days'
old. Heseltine's advice? Always pay off the third category.
An axiom which may well usefully inform the Department of Trade and
Industry's current investigation into ways of dealing with the problem of
late payments in business . . .

Meanwhile, another ex-chancellor, Lord Callaghan, also had a few tips for
Clarke when he presented him with his debating award. Callaghan, who
resigned after devaluing sterling in 1967, recounted that shortly after he
moved into the Treasury his attention was drawn to a short letter in The
Times. It noted that since the war Britain had had two types of chancellor.
Those who left in disgrace and those who got out in time.
However, the best line from the 81-year-old Lord Callaghan, was his tale of
a mix-up at a G7 meeting he organised in Downing Street. A bemused American
was perplexed by a wallmap full of red pins which he had found in his
temporary quarters at Number 10. 'We know the pins are not our nuclear bases
in Britain and as far as we know they are not yours,' said the Yank. Simple,
explained Callaghan, they represent the bishoprics of the Church of England.

<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke is but a few days away from his big test, his first Budget as
chancellor. Within that is contained yet another struggle: dare he risk the
wrath of Britain's newspaper barons by imposing value added tax on papers
and magazines?
Of course, no threats are openly heard. But Observer understands that the
chancellor has been receiving plenty of unsolicited advice. Viscount
Rothermere, whose Daily Mail is one of the government's staunchest
supporters, has had a two-hour private meeting with Clarke's boss; he can be
trusted to have put a persuasive case.
Meanwhile, The Spectator magazine, part of Conrad Black's empire, has tried
to get into Clarke's good books by letting him win one of its annual
parliamentary Oscars yesterday, its debater of the year prize.
However, if Clarke has read the memoirs of Lord Lawson, a former chancellor,
he will know that one of Lawson's biggest regrets was letting himself be
talked out of imposing VAT on newspapers in his 1984 Budget by Mrs Thatcher.
'Look Nigel,' she told Lawson, 'this is a wonderful Budget and you should
get a wonderful reception. You don't want to spoil that by putting VAT on
newspapers.' Lawson's advice is simple. A new chancellor has only one real
chance of slapping VAT on newspapers - in his first Budget.

The proposed changes to Independent Television ownership rules are a cause
for neither joy nor anguish. While a flurry of takeovers between the
regional groups should not harm viewers' interests, the timid liberalisation
announced yesterday will do little to enhance the competitiveness of UK
broadcasting.
The absurdity of stopping large ITV companies acquiring each other has been
rammed home by the fact that hostile bids will be allowed from elsewhere in
the European Union from next year. Viewers will be protected because
regional programming commitments are enshrined in the ITV franchises.
Concerns that mergers could reduce competition are best dealt with by the
standard competition authorities.
Nevertheless, the arguments used to justify the new takeover regime give
cause for concern. On the one hand, ministers decided to go for modest
rather than total deregulation out of fear that the system could be put
under 'unnecessary strain'. The danger with such talk is that the ITV
companies may think it OK to huddle together in defensive mergers. This
would merely perpetuate the weakness of groups which have grown up in a
monopolistic culture. The sooner the ITV companies realise they are
operating in the world of business, where strain and challenge are the daily
reality, the better.
On the other hand, the reason for allowing any mergers at all is a belief
that ITV companies are too small to be effective on the international scene.
The equation of size with effectiveness in world markets is suspect.
A sleepy erstwhile monopoly double its previous size will not necessarily be
any better at winning business overseas. The more likely consequence is that
it will waste shareholders' funds on foreign escapades, as has been the case
with some privatised utilities.
The future of UK broadcasting needs to be understood in a wider context.
Though the industry wishes to cling to its monopoly past, events are fast
moving out of its grasp. Changes in technology mean that broadcasting is not
governed by the need to share a limited supply of frequencies between ITV
companies and the BBC. Rivalry from satellite and cable TV is growing
rapidly. In future, digital broadcasting and the ability to pump TV pictures
down telephone lines will provide further sources of competition. There is
also a powerful, if rather unfocused, trend to integrate different media -
the so-called multi-media revolution.
At present, the UK media sector is hampered by a criss-cross of regulations,
of which the restriction on ITV takeovers is just one. It is moderately
encouraging that ministers yesterday promised to examine the rules
preventing newspaper groups owning ITV companies. But if Britain's full
broadcasting potential is to be unlocked, a strategic review rather than a
piecemeal approach will be needed.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement set the stage for
successful completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations. Unfortunately, events since then demonstrate how difficult it
will be to finish this play. With only three weeks left before the December
15 deadline, difficult issues need to be resolved right now. Not only is
this not happening, but the US is even introducing new problems at this very
late stage in the negotiations.
In his statement to the Trade Negotiations Committee in Geneva last week, Mr
Peter Sutherland, the Gatt's director-general, was even moderately
optimistic. Eighty-three participants have made offers on market access; the
principle of comprehensive 'tariffication' of non-tariff barriers has been
generally accepted; 85 participants have made initial offers on services;
and new revised texts on the multilateral trade organisation and dispute
settlement have also been produced.
Unhappily, there remains a host of unresolved old issues, to which new ones
have been added. Under market access, for example, Mr Sutherland lists
agriculture, textiles and clothing, tariff harmonisation, electronics, and
leather products and footwear. Proposals to eliminate tariffs on steel
products also remain critical if balance is to be achieved in the market
access package.
Meanwhile, the US has outraged other participants by introducing a proposal
to permit discriminatory taxation of foreign providers of financial
services. It is also planning to dump on these negotiations at this late
date new proposals aimed at making the scandalously protectionist
anti-dumping policy still more so. Equally disturbing is the agreement by Mr
Clinton to seek a 15-year phasing out of the multi-fibre arrangement, as
part of the price paid for Nafta. No wonder an exasperated Mr Sutherland
stated that 'now is the time for heads of delegation to put solutions rather
than problems on the table'.
Those solutions have to come from the negotiations between the US and the
EC, the two chief actors. They must soon reach the agreements that will
provide the basis for the final global package. Unfortunately, this week's
discussions between Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC's chief negotiator, seem to have done more to clarify their
disagreements than resolve them.
Next week's discussions in Brussels must achieve far more. To mollify the
French, for example, the two sides will need to agree an 'interpretation' of
the Blair House accord on farm trade as effective as the 'clarification' of
the Danish position under the Maastricht treaty. Similarly, they will have
to agree the outlines of a comprehensive market access agreement. Next
week's meeting offers almost their last chance. They are obliged to succeed.
They have no acceptable alternative.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Reasons for larger civil service not
hard to find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH SYMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader article 'Whitehall Farce' (November 6) falls well short of
the FT's usual rigorously analytical approach. The reasons why civil service
numbers have risen are not hard to find - higher unemployment needs more
civil servants to administer benefit; the unprecedented size of the prison
population does not keep itself behind bars; VAT on fuel will not collect
itself, and paying it back to those who cannot afford it - some 5m people -
will need thousands more civil servants to check and administer claims.
Mrs Thatcher cut 100,000 jobs from the civil service, but the taxpayer still
pays for the functions which were contracted out. The real cost of that
exercise are revealed now when contracts are re-negotiated at well beyond
the expected increases. But now there is no civil service alternative.
Contractors may complain about favour to in-house bids, but civil servants
complain about the government's dogmatic preference for the private sector
above value for money for the taxpayer - as, for example, with the Capita
vehicle licensing plates contract which costs Pounds 2m in the in-house bid.
Mr Waldegrave's explanation for this was that even where the taxpayer could
get work done more cheaply in the public sector 'it might be better done in
the private sector'. Without explanation, this remark seems to contradict
the claim that decisions are based on cost efficiency, and seems to have its
roots more in the philosophical prejudices of the 1970s than the 1990s.
The simple solution to this endless process of claim and counter-claim is to
involve the National Audit Office in assessing bids received not only as
regards costs, but also on value for money for quality of services provided.
As to the old chestnut of open advertisement for top civil service jobs, we
shall all be wiser when the Cabinet Office finally publishes the efficiency
unit report. But open competition in itself will not provide for a less
'secretive' system. Some recent appointments have demonstrated that
government ministers take decisions on appointments on the basis of
undisclosed criteria, and sometimes in opposition to the interview panel's
recommendation. Taxpayers end up footing the bill for enormously inflated
private sector salaries. The crux of the issue is that system must be based
on fair and open competition safeguarded by public scrutiny; it is therefore
unlikely to bear much comparison with the private sector.
The real issue about appointments at these levels is the threat of the
politicisation of these jobs. It goes to the heart of the maintainence of a
politically neutral civil service.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Variations on a corporate theme: Maggie Urry asks if
shareholders in Queens Moat Houses should have seen trouble ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Queens Moat Houses shareholders gather on Monday for the annual meeting
to discuss the parlous state of their company's affairs, they might reflect
on previous corporate horror stories that held clues for their own
predicament.
If they had cared to look, recent corporate history offers parallels. QMH
joins names such as Tiphook, also in talks with its bankers; Brent Walker,
Control Securities, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and WPP - which have gone to the brink
and been rescued; and Polly Peck, Maxwell Communication Corporation,
Coloroll and British &amp; Commonwealth - all of which have gone into
receivership or administration in the 1990s.
All these companies were, or are, run by an entrepreneurial boss, often
1980s stock market 'darlings'. They have been highly acquisitive, needing
repeated injections of cash from shareholders and banks. In the late 1980s
they usually demonstrated a better than average profit record, but found
themselves caught on a profit treadmill, constantly having to improve
results through fear of disappointing shareholders and bankers. The
treadmill became more exacting as recession bit. And many have over-borrowed
to invest in assets which have since fallen sharply in value.
QMH shareholders could have learned a lesson from the others. Judging by the
fall in QMH's shares in the year to March, when they were suspended, some
investors did indeed heed the warning signs:
The entrepreneurial boss
The 1980s economic expansion was a time when entrepreneurial zeal was easy
to convert into results that convinced bankers and financial markets. But
too frequently the performance could not be sustained when recession began.
One corporate financier with experience of restructurings says, of those who
came unstuck: 'They were able to demonstrate a record and the accounts
appeared to show asset and earnings growth.'
A director at a UK clearing bank, says: 'They all traded by reputation
rather than substance. There's the avuncular type, and the bullying type,
but they all relied on being powerful and were often secretive about the
business.' A common theme, as in QMH and Brent Walker, was a lack of proper
management accounts.
The entrepreneurial boss had often built the business from scratch. Mr John
Bairstow, former chairman at QMH opened his first hotel in his house, a
partly mock-tudor residence in Essex. Mr Robert Montague, chairman of
Tiphook, and Mr George Walker, ex-chairman of Brent Walker, also founded
their business empires.
Typically they have a great belief in their own abilities, bolstered by City
adulation. 'If you are told you have the Midas touch, you believe it,' the
banker explains. Many appear to regard the company as their own private
fiefdom. They are prepared 'to bet the business' - regarded by many
financiers as a sign of bad management; they take excessive risks - such as
hanging on to assets in the hope that values will rise. If things go wrong,
they blame bad luck.
'Good managers implement strategies appropriate to circumstances. In
recession they rationalise, retrench, consolidate. Good management is about
exercising options in a timely way and keeping exit routes open,' says one
lender.
It is rare to find in one person the combination of skills to manage a
business in both expansionary and recessionary phases. But, he says, it is
difficult for others to tell a company founder: 'Now we're in recession we
need different people.'
It is not surprising that rule one in the banker's manual, says a corporate
rescuer, is to get rid of the boss.
The acquisitive company
Doing deals is the entrepreneur's great love. But were companies that have
since failed building on sand? A corporate financier says: 'They were built
on doing transactions where there is no room for error. You must assume
continued economic growth because they can't take any downside.'
Deal making for its own sake can prove a recipe for disaster. 'The problem
with acquisitions is that synergies are not achieved,' says one banker whose
fingers have been burnt. 'You just get a bigger entity with bigger profits.
Just because you can ride a bike it doesn't mean you can fly a jumbo jet.'
An example of a 'deal too far' is Brent Walker's Pounds 685m purchase of
Grand Metropolitan's betting shops in 1989. The high price paid and debt
incurred proved to be the final straw for an already over-stretched company
as the economy moved into recession. With hindsight the company might have
acted differently - but critics say the signs were there at the time.
The profit treadmill
A succession of profit figures that seem to defy gravity is not all good
news. In the 1980s, the entrepreneur could often point to a phenomenal
profit record to justify more deals, borrowings and share issues. But in
recession, even keeping profits on a rising trend is difficult. And once on
the treadmill, the City can be unforgiving of companies that fall off.
'The boss would promise the City 20 per cent a year earnings per share
growth, and then tell the finance director to find it,' says one corporate
financier.
Rising asset values help since costs can be capitalised - taking them out of
the profit and loss account and including them in the balance sheet value.
'Say you buy a property for Pounds 100m and then revalue it at Pounds 150m.
That gives you scope to capitalise Pounds 50m of costs against it - like a
helicopter,' the financier suggests.
Another way of making use of rising asset values is to pass assets between
subsidiaries, crystallising gains and taking them into profits.
Other methods are to 'front-end' profits, taking profits which directors
expect but which have not yet been made. QMH, for instance, used its
incentive schemes, where hotel managers promised to meet certain financial
targets over the next year but could keep any excess. QMH simply included
the amounts promised in profits on day one.
The late Mr Robert Maxwell was notorious for padding out his profits with,
for instance, foreign exchange gains and profits on disposals.
Unsecured lending
During the 1980s banks were keen to lend in a drive for market share. The
corporate financier says banks were lending against assets without taking
security over them: 'The most junior analyst could see there was no
cashflow.' Without cashflow to pay the interest and with asset values
slumping in recession, the loans could not be serviced or repaid.
'I've been through two recessions. After the first I thought, 'we've learnt
our lesson, we won't do it again' but we did,' says a clearing banker.
He is cynical about the future, believing that banks will again succumb to
competitive pressures when the economy next starts to expand rapidly. 'The
mood of the moment will dominate,' he says. Another quotes the banker's
maxim: 'Lending money is easy. It's getting it back that's the problem.'
At QMH, the banks, which are together owed Pounds 1.2bn, are discussing a
financial restructuring of the company which should save at least part of
their money. The shareholders, who rank last in the list of creditors, could
be forgiven for asking how they were supposed to know the depths of QMH's
troubles. The answer is that they might not have been able to judge the full
extent of its difficulties; but there were enough warning bells ringing.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, British banks are changing the system by which they process and clear
cheques ('Banks set to process cheques for each other', November 15). Surely
they should be taking steps to reduce drastically the volume of cheques
handled.
This has been effectively accomplished in Switzerland. Every bill that I
receive is accompanied by a standard payment transfer form. At the end of
each month I group together all forms for payments due and sign a single
debit authorisation. I mail all of these to my bank (in an addressed
envelope which my bank provides for me) and within five working days I
receive from my bank an itemised list of the payments which have been made
on my behalf and confirmation that my account has been debited.
I have a cheque book but seldom, if ever, use it. T J Walsh,

The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature
By Matt Ridley
Viking Pounds 17.99, 404 pages
Sex is not only one of the wonders of life but also one of the two great
mysteries of evolutionary biology. The other is human intelligence. This
remarkable book draws together many of the latest strands of scientific
thinking, to create a coherent explanation both for sexual reproduction and
for the extraordinary explosion in human brainpower over the past million
years.
The first big question is why animals have been put to the trouble of
creating separate males and females to reproduce sexually, when asexual
reproduction requires much less time and effort. The answer produced 60
years ago - that sex helps a species adapt to changing circumstances by
sharing out genetic innovations - is unacceptable to the 'selfish gene'
school that dominates biology today.
Contemporary biologists believe the individual and its genes always come
first; evolution never operates directly for the benefit of the species.
Asexual individuals producing self-fertilised eggs should be able to swamp
sexual rivals, who can reproduce only at half their rate, before the
long-term advantages of sex make themselves felt.
The surprising answer, according to Ridley, is that sexual reproduction
evolved to beat disease. The mixing of genes through sex gives the offspring
a much better chance of withstanding the host of viruses, bacteria and other
parasites that plagued their parents. Asexual rivals, on the other hand, are
stuck with essentially the same disease-fighting genes as the previous
generation.
Ridley describes new evidence to show that sex is worthwhile because it
gives your children an immediate advantage in the fight against disease.
Some comes from the molecular biology of germs and genes, some from computer
modelling and some from experiments and observations of real animals. The
Mexican minnow, for example, can reproduce with or without sex. If there is
fungal disease in the pond, the sexual strains dominate; if not, they lose
out to their asexual rivals.
The Red Queen goes on to show how, once separate males and females existed,
genetic competition led to the growth of sexual adornments whose principal
purpose is to attract the best possible mate. One example is the peacock's
tail. Another is the human mind.
Ridley picks up the recent work of biologists such as Geoffrey Miller of the
University of Sussex in suggesting that the best explanation for human
intelligence is as a sexual adornment. They reject the traditional view that
brainpower started increasing rapidly among our ancestors because
intelligence was so useful for making tools, using fire, hunting animals and
gathering plants. Those challenges are essentially predictable, requiring
some intellect but not an ever increasing amount - and they would have
applied equally to other apes living on the African savannah.
The human brain, according to Miller, is 'largely a courtship device to
attract and retain sexual mates: its specific evolutionary function is to
stimulate and entertain other people, and to assess the stimulation attempts
of others'.
Brain size would originally have started to increase through chance
mutations in the genes controlling sexual selection. These would have spread
rapidly through the pre-human population, in what Ridley calls an 'arms race
between the sexes'.
This is the Red Queen effect, named after the character whom Alice meets in
Through the Looking Glass. However fast she runs, the world keeps pace with
her and she never gets anywhere. However intelligent we are, more
intelligence is always better for understanding, manipulating and seducing
other people with similar brain size.
As Ridley admits, the sexual evolution of the human mind is much the most
speculative theory discussed in his book. But it is as plausible as any
alternative explanation for human intelligence, and it accords with examples
of the Red Queen in action elsewhere in the animal kingdom, which have been
subjected to various experimental tests.
Many mammals and birds have developed elaborate colours, ornaments, displays
and songs, to persuade members of the opposite sex to mate with them. These
special attractions do not necessarily help individuals survive in the
natural environment - indeed they may hinder survival by wasting precious
energy or attracting the attention of predators - but no one dare opt out of
this race between the sexes.
The sexual pressure is greatest in polygamous species such as the peacock.
If all peahens go for males with the showiest tails, then a less
discriminating female who picks a relatively plain mate is likely to have
plain-looking sons. They will fail to attract other peahens and so her genes
will die out.
Ridley, a British science journalist and former zoology researcher, gives
only sparing personal information about his biologist heroes. Never mind -
the ideas in The Red Queen are so interesting that the excessive personal
detail found in American popular science writing would have been an
irritating distraction.
Illustrations, however, are a serious omission. Like many other science
books, The Red Queen suffers because the author and publisher have made no
effort to produce the graphics which could have illuminated the theories.
For example, computer models showing sexual and asexual animals competing
under different conditions would have been worth a thousand even of Ridley's
lucid words. In their absence, there are a few pleasantly genteel engravings
that might have graced a Victorian volume. Indeed, for a book about human
sexuality, it is curiously chaste in every way.
The Red Queen may link sex and intelligence on an intellectual plane but in
practice it leaves both as mysterious as ever.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Essentials to close yawning budget
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEVEN BELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's article, 'An Enigma Behind the UK Recovery' (November
22), asks the difficult question: exactly how much spare capacity is there
in the UK economy? The paradox in the Confederation of British Industry
survey of the decline of excess capacity combined with the anaemic gross
domestic product expansion is, however, not so difficult to resolve.
First, the CBI survey is dominated by companies engaged in manufacturing
whereas a much greater share of the recession in the 1990s has been taken by
the service sector. I would guess that retailers, bankers, building
societies and the media could all comfortably cope with an increase in
output of 10 per cent from current levels.
Second, excess capacity, particularly in manufacturing, does nor stand idle
forever. The conventional analysis of the output gap which extrapolates the
trend in GDP and subtracts this from actual GDP is based on the premise that
the capital stock is held largely intact during the cycle, unable to change
swiftly in response to the fluctuations in aggregate demand. In a recession
as long and deep as that at the beginning of the 1980s and 1990s, some spare
capacity will be scrapped. This will reduce but not eliminate the gap. A
similar argument applies to labour. The unemployed become progressively less
employable the longer they are idle.
The precise size of the output gap is not particularly relevant. It is clear
that there is a gap which is unlikely to be reversed for the next two years
at least if, as we at Morgan Grenfell expect, UK growth is held below 3 per
cent. Massive increases in taxation and/or reductions in public expenditure
are required to close a yawning budget deficit. This, combined with the
overhang of debt from the 1980s, will prevent demand from becoming too firm.
Further gradual monetary easing in the form of lower sterling and/or base
rates is justified.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Solution to league tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL MAVOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is amazing what you can do with statistics. Three years ago I
presented the head master's special prize at St John's College School,
Cambridge, to a boy who, according to the senior school for which he was
aiming, had scored high marks in his Latin common entrance papers. He had
not taken Latin at all.
The latest league tables from the Department for Education give the
impression - and impressions can be as important as facts - that only 85 per
cent of Rugby's GCSE candidates gained five or more A-C grades
('Independents remain at top in A-levels and GCSEs', November 17). Your
article refers rather disparagingly to the GCSE performance (my italics) at
Repton, Rugby and Haileybury, thus reinforcing the misleading statistics.
The cohort decided on by the DFE for these statistics in fact included,
among other anomalies (young sixth formers), 15 pupils who were not taking
their main group of GCSEs. Although we went through all of this shemozzle
last year I am sad that some newspapers continue to present such misleading
figures without sufficient explanation. In this age group, 94 of the 95
candidates at Rugby who took five or more subjects gained grades A-C; this
represents a figure of 98.9 per cent.
The best solution for next year - league tables are certainly here to stay -
is surely for the DFE to present statistics by year group rather than age,
or (if it sticks to the age group) to show the results of those who have
actually taken five or more subjects. If the DFE does not do this a very
special head master's prize will have to be invented for it.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Arts: A high price for Richter's big sound - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday Sviatoslav Richter played Bach in the Barbican, with Christoph
Eschenbach and the English Chamber Orchestra. It was only a pendant to his
solo recital in the Festival Hall on Sunday, but a costly one: Pounds 40 for
any seat in the stalls or the mid-front circle.
First, Eschenbach conducted a reasonably trim, moderately lively account of
Bach's Suite in D. Then, after the interval, Richter stalked on to play the
D major and G minor 'piano' concerti, the composer's own re-writes of his
unimprovable violin concerti in E and in A minor. (The keys had to be
lowered because the harpsichords of his day did not reach as far as the
violin's top E). Finally the conductor-pianist joined Richter for the C
minor, two-keyboard version of a concerto Bach probably wrote for violin and
oboe.
There were no disturbing signs of over-rehearsal, neither in the Suite nor
in the concerted pieces. Anyway, in the concerti Richter's and Eschenbach's
big Yamaha grands often rendered the ECO strings all but inaudible - they
might have been playing almost anything.
Though there are serious arguments for using the modern solo instrument that
Bach never knew, the musical imbalance here was discomfiting. Not least
because the ECO's continuo players had from the start included a
harpsichord, the very instrument for which Bach intended his concerto solos:
we could not help but notice how much happier the balance was between him
and his string colleagues than between them and the soloist.
Watching a brooding, tight-jawed Richter performance (he is 78 this year) is
always rather awe-inspiring. Presumably that justified the seat-prices, for
there was nothing greatly remarkable in his Bach interpretations. Eschewing
the expressive nuances available on the modern piano, he played everything
robustly, firmly and cleanly, without any special virtuosity in his solo
breaks. It seemed an exercise in heroically selfless restraint; and in the
two-keyboard concerto, Eschenbach matched him.
We might have been hearing domestic play-throughs - except in the 'Adagio e
piano sempre' of the solo concerto in D, where Richter drew out the lyrical
line to an elevated height. That was the redeeming passage of an otherwise
low-profile concert. I got home in time to watch a beady-eyed BBC-1
programme about overpaid, underskilled conductors, such as record companies
nowadays promote far beyond their half-formed merits. It was the most
intelligent and usefully mischievous TV study of the real-life classical
music business that I have seen, and we watched it free; it was at least
twice as interesting as the laid-back, low-cost but pricey Richter
exhibition.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Arts: Bravo Bartoli] - Recital

<TEXT>
For the second time in a fortnight the Royal Festival Hall has sold out for
a solo singer. At least it seems unlikely that the capacity audience on
Tuesday had turned up to hear Schubert's Fifth Symphony and Respighi's The
Pines of Rome, the remainder of the Philharmonia's programme.
The star was Cecilia Bartoli - still a recent arrival in the operatic
firmament, but her position there is undisputed. Her diary for this year and
next reads like an inventory of the world's top musical venues, though the
Royal Opera House is sadly not among them. As yet, the young Italian mezzo
has not appeared in opera in Britain, which makes her celebrity the more
remarkable. Such is the power of television and records.
This was the first time that I had heard her live, as on the previous
occasions she had cancelled. (Perhaps nobody told her I was coming.) Heard
in the flesh, the voice may not be large, but it is firm and agile, now
radiant, now impish, now witty, now defiant, a darting butterfly of a voice,
always on the point of metamorphosis to some new persona.
In Mozart's Exsultate, jubilate it was striking how Italian through and
through her singing is. This piece has become a favourite with light
sopranos who show off their scales in the outer portions and waft
disinterestedly through the slow central section. Bartoli's starting point
is the words (an exciting thrust on 'jublilate') and the changing emotions
were vividly dramatised. With an Italian upbringing music is always theatre.
Among Italian composers Rossini is her natural choice and she sang three
arias from his operas. Pamira's Prayer from Le Siege de Corinthe started
with the most affecting pure tone, set in relief beautifully in duet with a
solo harp. When the main theme returned, accompanied by the full orchestra,
she was only just loud enough in this hall, despite Giuseppe Sinopoli's
considerate conducting.
Then came the famous arias from La Cenerentola and Il barbiere di Siviglia,
each bubbling over with brilliance and personality. Bartoli sings her own
decorations, which is wholly in character. Nothing this singer does is a
mere echo of anybody else. With luck she will persuade opera managements to
put on rare Rossini revivals for her in the future - perhaps with period
orchestras, which would best match her scale.

Outside the ranks of FT readers (and perhaps even within) there is a
weariness with the economy. At budget time financial journalists get very
excited about the PSBR, the Crawling Peg, M7 or whatever the latest craze
may be, but the public sighs and asks 'Is wine' (or beer or books) 'going to
be more expensive or much more expensive?' To jolly us up and make us see
the event's significance BBC2 will screen a programme each evening between
now and Budget Day in which six members of the public try to decide what the
chancellor could do about Britain's Pounds 50bn deficit. In The Red begins
at 8.00.
The majority of viewers will opt instead for the second episode of David
Attenborough's Life In The Freezer (BBC1, 8.00). He strides about the
Antarctic, looking like Dr Who in dazzling foul weather kit, delivering his
lines in the familiar crouched position from behind various examples of
captivating wildlife. Irresistible stuff.
Judging from the opening episode last week, Goodnight Sweetheart (BBC1,
8.30) could be another hit for writers Marks and Gran.

RUBY IN PARADISE (15) Victor Nunez
HARD TARGET (18) John Woo
AMONGST FRIENDS (18) Rob Weiss
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT (18) Jonathan Heap
IP5 (15) Jean-Jacques Beineix
Which part of America should you live in for maximum safety and comfort? In
Long Island you risk falling foul of the Jewish Mafia (Amongst Friends). In
Arizona (Benefit Of The Doubt) you might be stalked across baking deserts by
barking Donald Sutherland (ex-convict, psychopath). And in the Deep South of
Hard Target you could well get lost like Cajun drifter Jean-Claude Van
Damme, harried through the Louisiana swamps by neo-Nazi manhunters.
The best place, surely, must be Florida's gulf coast as depicted in Victor
Nunez' travelogue-of-the-soul Ruby In Paradise. Here the only menace is
invading tourists. Seasonally they clatter through the resort gift-shop in
Panama City where the heroine works (Ashley Judd), a young girl hoping to
find herself after fleeing unhappy adolescence in her native Tennessee.
No better state in the US for self-discovery. Surrounded by hideous
souvenirs - the figurines made from coloured shells, the dayglo T-shirts -
Ruby must search deep in herself for truth and authenticity. 'I don't know
what I'm doing here' she confides to her voice-over diary. But soon she is
self-assured enough to find work, play and a sense of identity, and to
juggle the two predators who want to get her into bed: raunchy employer's
son Rick (Bentley Mitchum, grandson of Robert) and holier-than-thou
environmentalist Mike (Todd Field).
Writer-director Nunez, who five years ago finger-painted a fine debut movie
about the South Gal Young Un, gives us a film in two halves. Put simply, the
first half is good, the second half self-destructs. For the opening hour we
are enthralled by newcomer Ashley Judd's performance, with its hints of a
secret life behind the slanting eyes, baby cheeks and self-defensive
Southern drawl. And we purr with pleasure at the workings of the
film-maker's own built-in junk detector. This goes 'bleep' not just at the
rows of rubbish in the gift-shops but at the dubious shelf life of the
people Ruby meets: notably Rick (male chauvinism plus mother's-boy
spinelessness) and Mike (fine until he reveals a weakness for God-slot
television).
Part one is kept alive by a sense of danger and by our suspicion that there
are picturesquely disturbed corners in Ruby's own mind. Too much doodling in
that diary, for a start. But part two starts in soon - too soon - on the
process of doubt-allayment. Lost jobs are regained, treacherous boyfriends
unmasked and stern employers revealed as gooey benefactors. The happy ending
stomps towards us like a too-early dawn, dispersing all the interesting
shadows.
Hollywood has many mad science laboratories, but the maddest of all is the
one with the signplate 'Cultural Crossbreeding'. Here men with white coats
and smoking brains dream up projects such as Hard Target. What would happen
(they muse) if we team a Belgian footboxing star with a Hong Kong action
director and set them both down in French-American Louisiana?
Jean-Claude Van Damme is our hero-hulk with the trailing curls and legs as
lethal and many-angled as compasses. John Woo of The Killer and Hard Boiled
is called in to produce further evidence that he is the world's most
gymnastic action director. And as for the plot - anyone got a plot? Oh yes,
how about the old one about racist psychopaths going manhunting in the Deep
South. That will do: so long as we are insured against plagiarism suits from
Betrayed and Southern Comfort.
So the insane day begins; and the dreadful glory of a movie that is both
delinquent and virtuosic. Shotgun in one hand, girl in the other (Yancy
Butler, searching for a Dad we saw manhunted to death in scene one), Mr Van
Damme serpentines through the bayous hunting - and being hunted by - Lance
Henriksen's sneering villain and his pay-by-the-hour client army. Snakes;
petrol bombs; exploding cars; grenades down the trousers; and Mr VD coming
through it all like a mixture of Schwarzenegger and Nureyev. He dives
swallow-like through the flames one moment, biffs the daylights out of the
baddies the next.
I was appalled by the amount of careless laughter issuing from my area of
the cinema, until I realised that much of it was coming from me. But then
how does one react to a movie that resembles a Jackson Pollock painting in
which the coloured smears are real people? Giggles seem as appropriate as
shocked gasps. For this film has nothing to do with real life or real
violence (that tends to hurt): rather it is a near-abstract riot of
dering-do in which visible injury is set firmly aside for visible ingenuity.
For a truly numbskulled use of violence we must turn to Rob Weiss's Amongst
Friends. Here the leisured classes of Long Island preside over a second
generation of hoodlums-through-boredom. Andy, Billy and Trevor are scions of
Kosher Nostra: Jewish dynasties surrounded by ill-gotten heirlooms and by
only-begotten heirs who want all that and more. Do not be fooled by the
yachts, the lace tablecloths and all that money spent on their education.
These boys want out of Millionaire's Row and into Scorsese's mean streets.
We, somehow, are supposed to care. Weiss has a funny idea of the things that
might constitute a plausible, empathy-prone source for a life of crime.
(Jaded youngsters turning silver spoons into revolvers is not one.) And he
has a funnier idea of character and structure. We dribble on through ten
years of crime and punishment, feud and counter-feud, with no signs of
ageing, no sense of psychological development, and certainly no increase in
either wisdom or excitement.
But the week's Wooden Spoon for an American movie must be held back for
Benefit Of The Doubt. This finds Donald Sutherland released from a 22-year
jail sentence for wife-murder and going in search of daughter Amy Irving,
who testified against him. 'Daddy won't forget this . . .' he had told her
outside court. So soon we are thrown sizzling into the silliest plot of
1993. Murder, incest, boat chases and wild, wild Arizona scenery; plus a
handful of good actors struggling to be more than plastic counters shoved
around a giant high-speed board-game.
Things are little better on this side of the Atlantic. A 'successful'
European film used to be one that earned festival prizes and critical
plaudits and then sent out ripples of innovation and aesthetic challenge to
Hollywood. Today a successful European film is one so Hollywoodish already
that America buys it up for a remake: Cousins, Three Men And A Baby, Nikita
. . .
Jean-Jacques Beineix's IP5 has all the schmaltzy plot gimmicks in place to
bait the Tinseltown hook. Two semi-delinquent street boys on the run, one
black, one white. (This should secure the cross-racial youth audience.) The
wistful, dying old man they meet on the road and from whom they learn
lessons in love, wisdom and the everyday-miraculous. (He is Yves Montand:
add a few million older moviegoers who grew up with Z and L'Aveu.) And - for
what is a high-concept film without a 'quest'? - an ensuing zigzag across
France in pursuit of long-lost girlfriends (Montand), long-sought father
figures (the boys) and other glib emotional pay-offs.
Beineix, who made Diva and Betty Blue, specialises in a grandiloquent
glossiness that masquerades as art. He begins the movie - almost promisingly
 -as if it is a hip-hop musical. The black boy dances and sings along a
midnight city street as his mate makes merry with the graffiti paint. The
scene is so catchy, so surreal that we wish it had set the tone for the
rest. 'Les Spraycans De Cherbourg' we could have taken, but not Beineix's
ensuing attempt to pass off maudlin fable-spinning as Deep Thoughts about
the homeless child in each of us.
As for the UK print's transatlantic subtitles - 'Chill out', 'F*** me, what
a babe]' - they add to the feeling that in Gallic movies today the trademark
'Made in France' is being slowly obliterated by 'Made for Hollywood.'

FT  25 NOV 93 / Arts: A Rooster on top of the pops - Why Britain's flagship
modern dance company is being sent to the breakers' yard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looking at London Contemporary Dance Theatre on Tuesday night at the
beginning of its autumn season, I saw again what I have been seeing for 20
years: a superlative dance ensemble. When the company came into being at the
end of the 1960s it was sometimes raw but always eager, always intensely
committed. Across the next decade standards of physical attainment -
stunning skill; whole-hearted and whole-spirited energy - were testimony to
the guiding presence of Robert Cohan and the spiritual concern of Robin
Howard, who had made the enterprise possible. After ten years the company
was a world-beater.
Since then it has, astonishingly, improved, in matter of physical finesse,
and adaptability to the demands of many choreographers. (Works by Martha
Graham and Paul Taylor most honourably done; Cohan's choreographies
perfectly shown; pieces by Richard Alston, Siobhan Davies, and others - all
products of the organisation - given transcendent execution.)
Now, for reasons which are not as clear and straightforward as
press-releases and apologists would have us believe, the troupe is to be
reduced in size. Britain's flag-ship modern dance troupe is to be sent to
the breakers' yard, to be replaced by a smaller ensemble under Richard
Alston, as part of a 'National Centre for Contemporary Dance'.
Alston's appointment is good news. It is more curious that the Rambert Dance
Company (from which Alston was summarily removed last December) is to be
expanded to 25 dancers, with an orchestra, and is reportedly to become a
'neo-classic' group adapted to the work of its forthcoming director
Christopher Bruce, and also supposed to be capable of playing a Balanchinian
repertory. (Hmm]) The dismantling of a superlative company, the fruit of an
unrivalled school, in favour of a new unproved ensemble, is policy gone mad.
The Luddites are in charge.
It is even more ironic that the greatest success LCDT has on its hands (and
ebullient feet) at the moment is Christopher Bruce's Rooster. First made for
the Geneva Ballet, it takes as its text awful songs by the Rolling Stones,
but explores them in dances of whizzing vitality which LCDT bring off in
fire-cracker style. It came as a wonderful end to a programme in which the
dancers rescued two less than convincing pieces. Aletta Collins' Shoes is
indeed about shoes - multi-coloured, clunky, better off than on. There is a
score of abrasive minimalism by Steve Martland (well played by a group under
Nicholas Mojsejenko) and stylish design by Tom Cairns. The cast are in
street clothes; the theme  - I suppose - suggests that shoes are conformist,
and that we are better off bare-foot. It is all rather flaccid, and
terminally long. But when Miss Collins lets her cast dance, the steps fly,
and we see how amazingly gifted the troupe is - elegant in means, formidable
in prowess, absolute and loving servants of their text. They make the piece
exhilarating.
Nothing, no-one, can make the other novelty, a ripe piece of Euro-trash,
bearable. It is entitled Sand Skin (no explanation given, though an addled
programme note talks about 'mutations necessary for the survival of a
species'), and it is by the French-based Angelin Preljocaj. Fourteen dancers
are hideously garbed. (Caroline Antenski has concocted what look like failed
unisex underclothes in funereal black; tights that are more hole than
fabric; black shoes) and behave morosely. They may be in quest of a cure for
the steps, or merely exercising their psyches. They do their grand best, but
look very sad indeed, and I do not blame them.
Fortunately Rooster restores them to life. This is given with glorious
vitality, a throw-away bravura and a muscular sophistication - the
impossible made not only easy but witty - that explains exactly why this
great company (and I use the words advisedly) should not be sacrificed to
policy. There have been mis-routings in recent years with LCDT - failures in
artistic direction - but the troupe is a national treasure. We do not have
anything comparable. There is nothing comparable in Europe. To sacrifice it
on the altar of expediency and a chimeric re-organisation is criminal.
Policy can be altered. To alter the company will be to deny its history -
LCDT and its School made possible the whole modern dance movement in this
country - its splendid present, and its potential for the future of dance in
Britain.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Technology: People still required - Safety in Travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even with the best air safety technology in the world, human skills will
remain at a premium. Powerful number-crunching computer systems will take
much of the complicated routine out of navigation and air traffic control
and make it easier to deal with unexpected and risky incidents, but highly
trained people will still be needed to fly and control the aircraft.
Computers and sophisticated electronics cannot do everything, however much
they can simplify the business of taking off, flying and landing. They
cannot, for example, deal with sudden and unexplained, engine or fuselage
failures which need human ability to land crippled aircraft and save lives.
Nor can they be a comforting substitute in passengers' minds for the
physical presence of a crew, even if all is well.
'Airline passengers are unlikely in the foreseeable future to trust
themselves to a fully automatic aircraft,' Charles Billings, a US safety
expert, told a recent conference in London. 'Would you?'
Billings, from the cognitive systems engineering laboratory at Ohio State
University, said thousands of people each day placed their faith in urban,
rapid transit systems. However, these run under much tighter constraints
than are possible in aviation.
'You cannot simply stop the airplane when something goes wrong in flight.'
Also, pilots and air traffic controllers were responsible by law for flight
safety. 'This responsibility cannot be abrogated, even though automated
devices may remove some of the authority formerly possessed by these human
operators.'
Thus he added: 'We believe that if pilots and controllers are to be held
responsible for system safety, they must retain the authority necessary to
command and control the system.' That is what the pilots think, too.
Broadly, pilots support the introduction of sophisticated navigation systems
such as automatic dependent surveillance (ADS), says James Gaskell,
vice-chairman of the air traffic services study group at the British Airline
Pilots Association (Balpa).
But they are wary of too rapid a reduction of the present separation limits
such as those applying over the busy North Atlantic, where more than 200
aircraft are in the air at peak times. Both Balpa and the international
pilots' federation want a co-ordinated introduction in accordance with
proper rules.
'It is surprising how busy the Atlantic is at times,' adds Gaskell. 'You can
sit at night and see the lights of other aircraft above and below. It (ADS)
does need to be treated very carefully.' Thus Balpa would like to see ADS
used initially at the current separation levels, with these then gradually
being decreased as the system proves its worth.
Because aircraft are already so reliable and automated, some 75 per cent of
accidents have a human cause, Phil Hogge, British Airways' general manager
for flight operational services, told the conference which was organised by
the UK's parliamentary advisory council for transport safety.
These days, errors tend to stem from incorrect loading of navigational
information into the on-board computer rather than wrong calculations, he
said. 'Therefore, the subject that requires most attention is this whole
area of why people make mistakes.'
Apart from the work of psychologists, government agencies and manufacturers
in designing effective warning systems and controls, BA also relies on its
own intensive analysis of incidents - including use of its computerised
Basis (BA safety information system) database - and the human factors
involved. The airline uses this information to help training and improve
procedures.
Much of the automation that pilots and controllers have become used to, said
Billings, 'is too often brittle instead of resilient, clumsy instead of
facile and, above all, complex instead of simple.'
But the new systems, he noted, were now starting to provide more help and
information where it was most needed - such as after engine failures by
compensating for uneven power thrust - and not just during routine flight.
'The means for at least semi-automatic air traffic control, as well as
flight, are at hand.'
But Billings added: 'It is the human operators, not the computers, that
remain responsible for safety.'

FT  25 NOV 93 / Technology: Aviation safety soars to new heights - Safety in
Travel / In a new series on advances in transport technology, Andrew Fisher
examines developments in air navigation systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you're strapped into your seat 30,000ft in the air, waiting for the
hours to pass on an intercontinental flight, it might be reassuring to know
that the aircraft's exact position is known to those on the ground. For much
of its route, however, this is not the case, whether you are flying over
land masses such as the Indian subcontinent or large tracts of water like
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Radar stations cannot be planted all over
Asia or across the seas and radio contact is limited and unreliable over
vast distances.
For much of their journeys across the Atlantic, aircraft are out of contact
as they fly between the radar stations on the Scottish and Canadian coasts.
Pilots report their position by radio, but this can take time. Thus aircraft
have to be kept far enough apart - 60 miles each side, 2,000ft vertically
and 10 minutes' flying time behind each other - to ensure maximum safety.
But two things are happening which promise to change the world aviation
picture: air traffic is expected to grow at around 6 per cent a year up to
2000, with aircraft movements set to double in Europe by 2010; and
technology has advanced to the stage where computers and satellites can be
used to pinpoint aircraft positions so accurately that separation levels
could eventually be halved and more flights safely accommodated on the same
routes.
Although the technology is available, this will not happen quickly.
Governments, airlines and regulatory bodies have to agree on how and when it
will be phased in - there is broad agreement on its desirability - and the
air traffic management (ATM) systems have to be tested thoroughly. Airlines
also have to decide the investment is worthwhile.
Aviation experts stress that the new satellite-based technology of automatic
dependent surveillance (ADS), in which a stream of data is fed back
automatically from the aircraft to the ground, is not aimed at increasing
safety but at maintaining it, as more flights are allowed into the available
airspace.
Flying is one of the safest forms of travel, although the spectacular nature
of air disasters makes them especially frightening: the worst was a
collision at Tenerife airport in the Canary Islands in 1977 which killed 582
people.
'The objective is to improve the efficiency of the airspace with no
reduction in safety,' says David Featherstone, air traffic services
development manager at Inmarsat, the international satellite organisation.
'Safety is not at issue,' agrees Michael Parry-Evans, ATM marketing
executive at Siemens Plessey Systems, part of the Siemens electronics group.
'There would be delays rather than any imperilling of passengers if air
traffic control systems proved inadequate. The aim is to put in place a very
viable transport infrastructure.'
Today's infrastructure works, but is stretched and needs updating. Large
areas of the world, such as India, Africa and parts of southern and eastern
Europe, are poorly equipped with radar. In northern Europe, congestion can
cause lengthy delays. Now, the development of high-powered computer systems,
allied to the satellite network, has made it possible to plan for a new
generation of equipment.
Ten years ago, the International Civil Aviation Organisation set up a
committee on Future Air Navigation Systems (Fans) to look into the
navigational needs of the next 20 years. It is under the auspices of Fans
that ADS is being developed.
The satellites needed for ADS are in place. They cover four global regions
and will - once ADS is introduced towards the end of the century - enable
data to be sent digitally via satellite to a ground station and then into
air traffic control centres. Those on the ground could follow an aircraft's
track and direction based on the data - sometimes called 'pseudo-radar' -
being sent back. 'It will make the controller's job a lot easier,' says
Featherstone.
Pilots, too, should benefit. Based on the satellite data, they could be
given new flight paths to avoid bad weather or save fuel by keeping away
from strong winds. Engine data could also be monitored.
ADS is basically a development of the in-flight telephone systems that
airlines are introducing for passengers. Since the latest generation of
ground-air communications allows telephone and data services to be combined,
the instalment cost per new aircraft of up to Dollars 500,000 (Pounds
340,000) for each ADS unit and cabin equipment could be paid for by call
charges.
That is what British Airways and its competitors hope. 'We believe that to
make satellite navigation successful and cost-effective for the airlines,
we've got to bring a number of applications together,' says Gerry Selves,
BA's manager for flight technical projects. This means a combination of ADS,
telephones and data transmission for passengers and airline use, and
facsimile machines.
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has taken an early lead in studying the
value of ADS. Using a Boeing 747-400 from BA, it carried out extensive tests
on a flight from Osaka, Japan, to London's Heathrow airport. Reports were
sent back from the aircraft via satellite every 10 seconds, but the CAA
expects the typical reporting period for North Atlantic flights to be every
five minutes.
'The CAA has taken the initiative on this programme,' says Leo Gallagher,
commercial director of Racal Avionics which has co-operated with Honeywell
of the US on Satcom, the leading aeronautical satellite communications
system. 'It is the first aviation authority in the world to grasp the nettle
of ADS.'
Other airlines such as United Airlines and Qantas are also studying ADS, in
which Rockwell-Collins of the US is also a player, but all are cautious
about investing at a time of economic uncertainty and stiff competition.
They want to be sure of the savings ADS can bring by allowing them to fly
the quickest routes and to avoid poor weather.
It is not only airlines which are under pressure to spend more money.
Airport and traffic control authorities, too, are investing in
high-performance systems to streamline the complex task of aircraft
approaches, landings, takeoffs and manoeuvrings on the ground. 'The drive in
the short- to medium-term is for increasing sophistication of air traffic
systems,' says Siemens' Parry-Evans.
With more powerful, integrated systems, air traffic controllers should be
able to concentrate more on difficult and potentially disastrous incidents
by having much of the routine taken away from them. On Siemens' latest air
traffic management system, each aircraft is identified with a marker and
information about its height, direction and speed is attached. The picture
can be blown up, viewed on more than one screen and be overlaid with weather
data. There is a built-in conflict alert to show if two aircraft are
dangerously close.
In competition with companies such as IBM, Raytheon and Hughes of the US,
Thomson of France and Alenia of Italy, Siemens is keen to move deeper into
the ATM market, worth more than Dollars 2bn a year.
The European part of that is valued at some Dollars 500m. As efforts by
Eurocontrol (the European agency for air navigation safety) to harmonise and
upgrade different national ATM systems - many of them dating from the 1960s
 -bear fruit, investment will be substantial. Among the new technologies
being introduced are systems which use microwaves for quicker and safer

FT  25 NOV 93 / People: Leigh Interests Bowden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shaun Bowden, right, has been appointed chief executive at Leigh Interests,
the waste management group, moving on from AH Marks, a private company
specialising in crop protection products and organic chemicals.
Bowden, 46, had been chosen by Malcolm Wood, chairman and chief executive,
who intended splitting the roles following the growth of Leigh Interests.
Wood, however, barely had time to usher Bowden into the company before dying
from a heart attack, aged 62, on October 29.
Paddy Custis, non-executive deputy chairman of Leigh Interests since 1982,
is taking over as non-executive chairman. Custis says that since Bowden had
the imprimatur of Wood the company has every confidence that the transition
will be smooth; Bowden is starting work at Leigh on December 13.
Bowden is a director of the British Agrochemicals Association and was
formerly a director of the Bradford &amp; district training and enterprise
council.
He has an MBA from Manchester Business School.

FT  25 NOV 93 / People: City teams shuffle packs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith New Court's Mike Unsworth, 44, who claims to be the longest-serving
head of research of a major City broker, is moving into the firm's corporate
finance team and handing his research baton over to Bruce Davidson.
Davidson, 38, has been following the conglomerate sector and, like Unsworth,
joined SNC at the time of Smith Brothers' merger with the much smaller
broker, Scott Goff.
The reshuffle coincides with another high-level defection from one of the
City's most aggressive stockbrokers.
Alistair Buchanan, SNC's number one rated electrical utility analyst, has
left to join BZW along with colleagues Tim Ancher and Daniel Martin.
It is understood that Buchanan had been offered the job of joint deputy head
of research at SNC along with Richard Dale.
The departure of Buchanan and his team is a blow for SNC which is corporate
broker to several well known utilities.
However, the firm has had little difficulty replacing other star analysts
who have been poached by rival firms and expects to fill the gap left by
Buchanan's departure.
Meanwhile, Ken Taylor, currently head of sales at SNC's agency operations,
has been promoted to deputy managing director of UK agency and will have
overall responsibility for the business when Paul Roy, managing director UK
agency, is away.
Michael Davids has been appointed deputy managing director UK agency and
will be primarily responsible for closer integration between the overseas
and UK agency business.
Rennie McConnochie takes over as head of UK sales and Mark Pumfrey will be
deputy head.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Loud cries of
protest - As a new mother, Rachel Johnson reacts against the hard-sell
tactics of the baby products manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most mothers-to-be in the UK, the marketing campaign starts at 12 weeks,
peaks shortly after delivery and then never seems to end.
On the National Health Service, women book into a hospital when they are
about three months' pregnant. After blood tests and consultation with a
midwife they are given a red plastic folder containing two items: a card
detailing further appointments and a 'Bounty Pregnancy Guide'.
No less than a third of the pages of this glossy booklet, which declares it
is written with the help and advice of members of the Royal College of
Midwives, feature the sort of sickly advertisements that could only be found
in a specialist publication.
Take the first few. 'No job's too big for Baby Fresh,' says the baby-wipes
manufacturer; 'Come on, push, push, push, push, push,' runs the text
accompanying a picture of a Mothercare buggy. 'I want to be the best mum in
the whole world,' says the Prudential in its drive to sell products to make
baby more financially secure in the future.
Months later, the newly-delivered mother lies in her hospital bed snatching
a few moments of rest between visiting hours. A trolley laden with large
sealed gift bags, pushed by one of 260 distributors from Bounty, the
Diss-based publishing and services company that charges mother-and-baby
companies a fee for joining its syndicated sampling service, is making the
rounds.
If the woman accepts the assortment of Pampers nappies, Drapolene nappy
cream, baby bath and other goodies without filling in a card saying she does
not want to receive 'further free samples and product information', she goes
on a list.
For Bounty is at liberty under the Data Protection Act to put her name on
its database, to sell on to the large number of companies hungry to tap into
the baby products market - worth Pounds 1.5bn in 1990. Paul D'Inverno,
publications director of Bounty, claims his company is the only one with a
nationwide spread; neither competitor he mentions, Newborn or Lifecycle
Marketing, has contracts with hospitals.
Everyone is subjected to advertising from cradle to grave, not just pregnant
women and new mothers. But advertisers do seem to reserve a peculiar
intensity for these groups. 'Heinz carefully markets its baby food to
parents to make sure they get the information they need and want,' said a
Heinz spokesman.
And Bounty's business, advertising mother and baby products, is perfectly
legal - though some might say that women are exhausted and distracted by the
free samples at the one opportunity they are granted to avoid an avalanche
of direct mail over the coming months.
Even so, many expectant or recent mothers will agree with Cathy Irons, the
business manager of maternity services at St Mary's Hospital in London. She
says that such women are particularly 'vulnerable to advertising from all
sides'.
There are at least two reasons for this. First is the natural urge to be the
perfect mother, exactly the button the Prudential pushed in its financial
services advertisement. At the same time, first-time mothers have little
idea which of the myriad products manufacturers insist they need buy to
strive towards this perfection are useful, and which are expensive extras.
In the past, for instance, objections were raised because the Bounty pack
included sweet, syrupy drinks which could lead to tooth decay.
Philippa Need of the National Childbirth Trust says: 'You are made to feel
everything is so essential. But a baby bath, for example, is a complete
irrelevance.'
According to the Health Visitors' Association, women spent on average Pounds
1,050 in 1990 on clothes and equipment in the first year. At the same time,
one in four of these had been means tested to receive the Pounds 100 state
maternity grant.
Christine Gowdridge of the Maternity Alliance, which provides advice on
maternity care and state benefits, says it is not uncommon for a woman to
spend heavily on a new pushchair or steam steriliser to find she cannot
afford the basic nappies and babyclothes. 'It's all too easy to succumb to
well-targeted adverts,' she says.
BT is just one of the 100 companies that bought Bounty's list of new mothers
earlier this year. I was on it. In April, Bounty sent me - on behalf of BT -
a glossy leaflet promoting mobile telephones and answering machines. 'Now
that you're a new mum, you can't drop everything every time the 'phone
rings, can you?' it wheedled, next to a picture of a dressing-gowned woman
cradling a rosy-cheeked baby. I binned it with a practised flick.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A mixture of
messages - A survey of agencies reveals optimism and uncertainty about the
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The events of one day last month summed up the currently mixed messages
coming from UK advertising agencies about prospects for business.
Abbott Mead Vickers reported a slight drop in its pre-tax profits for the
first half of the year, although chairman David Abbott said he saw signs
that 'widespread cutbacks in client spending seem to be a thing of the
past'. The group felt 'considerable optimism' as it looked forward to 1994,
he added.
A few London streets away and on the same day, agency Gold Greenlees Trott
issued a warning that profit forecasts by the City for the year ending next
April were over-optimistic. This was because the recovery in both
advertising and sales promotion had been slower than anticipated. The result
had been the deferral and reduction of spending by a number of clients, said
GGT.
The same mixed messages come from the latest annual survey by accountants
Touche Ross of advertising agency profitability in 1992.*
The past year has been one of 'uncertainty, tentative optimism and
ultimately disappointment,' finds the survey. At the same time, there
appears to have been an encouraging halt in the long-term decline of
operating margins and operating profits are beginning to increase.
The firm's latest annual survey is based on the results of the top 50 agency
groups by billings. The combined pre-tax profits of the groups were wiped
out by Saatchi and Saatchi's Pounds 600m write-off of goodwill, following
the group's decision to acknowledge there had been a 'permanent diminution'
in the value of goodwill on earlier acquisitions. Ignoring Saatchi's
write-off, average profits fell 2 per cent on the previous year.
For the first time, the survey includes some international comparisons for
the largest quoted groups. By most measures, the US-controlled groups
outperform their European competitors. For example, operating profit margins
of UK-based quoted companies averaged 6.7 per cent last year, compared with
a 13.8 per cent average for the US companies.
The UK average, dominated as it is by the poor margins of Saatchi and
Saatchi and WPP, masks the sound performances of Abbott Mead Vickers (15.5
per cent) and Gold Greenlees Trott (12.4 per cent), points out Touche Ross.
An analysis of sources of profit from the published accounts of the largest
quoted UK groups also shows that it has been more difficult in the past year
to make profits in the home market than abroad.
While there was no real growth in the UK in 1992, markets in Germany,
Austria, Portugal, Belgium and Greece grew by between 8 per cent and 40 per
cent.
Profits from US operations outshone those for the rest of the world.
Redundancy and reorganisation have again been a feature of the year, finds
the survey.
The top 50 agency groups have reduced the number of staff they employ by 5
per cent over the 12 months. An examination of those agencies which have
retrenched shows that, overall, 'biting the bullet can and does work. It is
not, as many think, the beginning of a downward spiral', finds the study.
While the recession may have been the catalyst that has created the crisis
for agencies, in many areas of activity it has merely focused attention on
problems that have existed for some time.
Concludes Touche Ross: 'The indications are that agencies have begun at last
to tackle many of these problems. The many job losses and massive
rationalisation costs testify that this has not been without pain.'

FT  25 NOV 93 / People: BPB Industries anoints Cuny as future group chief
executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plasterboard manufacturer BPB Industries, which parted company with its
chief executive John Maxwell in September, has now promoted Jean-Pierre Cuny
to the position of group deputy chief executive, as well as chairman of the
gypsum division. He is expected to become group chief executive in due
course.
In considerable contrast to Maxwell, who had no experience in the industry
before joining the company in the spring of 1992, 53-year-old Cuny, who is a
French citizen, has been with the group since 1977.
Cuny joined the main board in 1988 and has most recently been deputy
chairman of the gypsum division, running gypsum interests in continental
Europe, from his Paris base.
An engineering graduate of the Ecole Centrale de Paris and metallurgy
post-graduate from MIT, Cuny now moves to London.
There his immediate task is to sort out the gypsum division as a whole and
organise the succession, according to Alan Turner, BPB's chairman and chief
executive.
'His promotion to deputy chief executive is intended to signal his stepwise
progression. When he has got gypsum sorted out, he can raise his head and
become chief executive,' says Turner.
Turner declined to comment as to why Cuny was not deemed a suitable
candidate for the chief executive seat before Maxwell was appointed.

FT  25 NOV 93 / People: Whitbread stacks up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Worrall, Sainsbury's director of grocery and non-foods buying, is to
retire next July after 40 years of service with the company, during which it
has grown from a chain of high street grocers to the UK's biggest superstore
group.
He will be replaced by Robin Whitbread, currently marketing director, while
Whitbread's place will be filled by Ivor Hunt, departmental director
responsible for marketing services.
Worrall, 56, joined Sainsbury's statistical department in 1953 and held
various positions in the trading departments before becoming departmental
director for dairy and frozen food buying in 1986. He took over his present
position in 1986.
Sainsbury's said there would be a phased handover before next July from
Worrall to Whitbread.
Whitbread joined Sainsbury's in 1969 and rose to become departmental
director responsible for marketing in 1983.
Four years later he was appointed to the board of Shaw's Supermarkets,
Sainsbury's US supermarket chain. He was appointed to Sainsbury's board as
marketing director in 1990.
Ivor Hunt, who will join Sainsbury's board next March, worked for Hawker
Siddeley Aviation, and as statistical manager for AGB research, before
joining Sainsbury's in 1971 as head of statistical services. He became
departmental director for marketing services in 1987.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Guinness's
stout-hearted revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years after its launch, canned Draught Guinness is firmly established
as the most successful new product introduced in the UK beer industry for
more than a decade.
More than 250m cans - fitted with the widget that gives the stout a taste
and appearance close to that of a bar-room pint - have been sold since 1989.
This month, Sweden became the 51st country to import the product. It is a
bestseller in markets from the US to Hong Kong.
In the UK, Guinness's innovation has not only been good for the company, it
has revolutionised the take-home beer market.
The difficulty of replicating the characteristics of draught ale and stout
in bottles or cans helped lager achieve even greater dominance of the
take-home sector - where it accounts for nearly two-thirds of volume - than
of pub beer sales.
The Guinness in-can system, which won a Queen's Award for Technology in
1991, has changed that. Work on the project began in the mid-1980s when the
company revived the image of its draught stout to make it more appealing to
younger pub-goers.
'We thought how wonderful it would be if we could also make it more
appealing to take-home drinkers,' says Brendan O'Neill, managing director of
Guinness Brewing Worldwide. 'Being a brewer which does not own pubs is a
great incentive to innovation.'
More than 100 methods were tested. The researchers even tried pouring the
beer through nylon stockings and from a can with a spout lined with
sandpaper. Five years and Pounds 5m later, they found the answer: a plastic
chamber, with a minute hole, fixed at the bottom of the can.
During filling, some beer is forced into the chamber under pressure. When
the can is opened the beer surges out, creating the bubbles that form the
creamy head.
Guinness discovered that the system worked equally well in a can of ale  -
and promptly launched its own brand of canned draught bitter.
Other national brewers rushed to develop their versions of the Guinness
widget. Whitbread, having failed to persuade Guinness to license its system,
developed its own system for canned Boddington's bitter and Murphy's Irish
Stout. It has recently been extended to Flowers and Castle Eden ales and to
Marston's Pedigree bitter. Courage has launched its variation on the theme
in canned draught John Smith's bitter, backing it with a Pounds 6m campaign.
Carlsberg-Tetley has now launched canned Tetley bitter in the north of
England.
The new canned beers - priced at least 20 per cent above the original
packaged products - have given a further fillip to the take-home trade,
already growing fast as drinking habits change under such influences as the
drink-driving laws, ageing population and increasing home entertainment
facilities.
Whitbread estimates the new draught-in-can stout and ale brands now account
for 14 per cent per cent of take-home beer sales by volume and 22 per cent
by value. Their share of the sector is expected to double by 1966.
Guinness has demonstrated its confidence in the growth of the market for its
stout by investing Pounds 30m in canning lines at Dundalk, Ireland and
Runcorn, near Liverpool, where the facilities will be capable of producing
2m cans daily.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Accountancy Column: Standards setters try to hammer out
differences - Encouraging signs of a move towards harmonisation of financial
reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE ATCHLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The third annual meeting earlier this month of standards setters from around
the world highlighted some important lessons in the changing attitudes of
international accounting across borders.
Representatives from 16 developed countries as well as the International
Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), the EU and the European Accounting
Federation (FEE) gathered in London following previous meetings in Brussels
and New Jersey.
Harmonisation of standards was not formally on the agenda, but one
underlying purpose was to curb further diversity in financial reporting.
David Tweedie, chairman of the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the
conference host, suggested that the IASC conceptual framework would provide
a useful basis for analysing accounting issues.
However, he implied that some countries were seeking 'ideal standards' and
greater convergence in reporting might emerge by these countries taking the
lead and influencing others.
This reflects Tweedie's belief that good accounting will be achieved by
clear-thinking pioneers of new practices. It represents a challenge to the
IASC, which has traditionally been represented by senior members in
professional bodies and has been tied by the need for consensus.
The discussion and presentations, which took place over two days in London,
displayed just how wide are the differences in the objectives of financial
reporting around the world. While the function of accounting is perceived as
serving different needs in different social and economic environments,
agreement on individual issues is hard to secure and harmonisation remains
an uncertain goal.
Nevertheless, the atmosphere is changing. Compared even with last year's
gathering, sponsored by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB),
the mood was subtly different. Only the delegates from FASB itself seemed
entirely at ease with the debate format, but most participants were more
relaxed and showed a surprising willingness to drop their defences and
discuss issues on a conceptual basis, sometimes in sharp contrast to the
principles adopted in their own jurisdictions.
The agenda contributed to the emphasis on concepts. Most of the first day
was taken up considering a number of simple case studies appended to a
substantial paper on Accounting for Future Events. Introducing the paper,
Jim Leisenring, FASB deputy chairman, said that his organisation, and the
standards setters in Australia, Canada, Britain and the IASC all shared very
similar conceptual frameworks but none the less entered into 'some heated
debates' over the issues involved.
One case study was of a retail store which paid out Dollars 30,000 on a
single injury claim from a customer in three years and had decided, on the
basis of past experience, to charge Dollars 10,000 each year as a
'self-insurance' expense, recognising that a corresponding liability would
grow while no claims arose.
Participants were asked to consider whether this store should recognise this
'self-insurance' liability in its accounts. Seven argued that it was a
general business risk and should be accounted for only as and when the
expense arose. Five were adamant that there was a liability and it should be
recognised.
Geoffrey Whittington, academic adviser to the ASB, said accounts were
supposed to state the position at a point in time and the liability should
be recognised only when a risk had occurred. Herman Marseille from the
Netherlands, and Karel van Hulle, head of accounting at the European
Commission, agreed, adding that there would be a liability only if there
were a legal duty to insure.
Atle Johnsen from Norway and Heinz Kleempker from Germany argued that the
risk could be assessed and quantified by insurers, whether or not the store
paid for insurance - so it was a liability and should be recognised.
Interestingly, Dietz Mertin from the German Institute of Accountants
disagreed with his countryman and argued that the compensation payments were
a general business risk for which there should therefore be no recognition.
Such disagreements are more common in the US. On the second day, Jim
Leisenring told delegates that FASB wants to revise the rules for
consolidated accounts, but cannot get agreement on a new definition of a
subsidiary. Its board cannot reach the necessary 5-2 majority on any
definition that goes beyond the traditional ownership of 50 per cent plus
one of the voting shares.
A session on accounting for goodwill on acquisitions proved contentious:
international practice varies widely and, as Leisenring said at the end of
the debate: 'I don't think it fits in with any of our conceptual thinking.
We ought to work harder at it than we already have.'
A position paper was presented by Dominique Ledouble of the Conseil National
de la Comptabilite who said there was pressure in France for flexible rules
on intangibles, to match those of the UK. Three years ago France had moved
to allow goodwill to be carried, but amortised. However, 'numerous kinds of
new intangibles' - such as brands, patents, lists etc - were emerging and
these were more and more difficult to measure and, in most cases, were not
depreciated materially.
Allan Cook, ASB technical director, emphasised the importance of the issue
in the UK. In the early 1980s the proportion of goodwill in the accounts of
acquiring companies amounted to 6-7 per cent. By mid-1987 this had risen to
44 per cent. Cook called for all intangibles to be treated in the same way.
Tweedie ended this debate on goodwill with a plea that the standards setters
should listen to what industry was saying. The problem in the UK was with
service companies, he said. They argued that the value of goodwill was
rising, so why should they amortise? 'A lot of industrialists simply don't
understand what we are trying to do with goodwill - 93 per cent of industry
respondees said 'rubbish' to a 20-year write-off,' said Tweedie.
Meanwhile, internally generated intangibles tended not to get on to the
balance sheet because such assets frequently fail reliability/recognition
tests. 'So we must look at it again, from scratch,' said Tweedie.
Warren McGregor, executive director of the Australian standards setting
body, gave a presentation on accounting for leases. He argued that the
leasing standards that involved capitalisation of finance leases were
fundamentally flawed. The correct approach was to capitalise all leases,
subject only to a materiality threshold.
Van Hulle said that some European countries had difficulty in accepting that
the same asset might appear in several balance sheets at the same time.
There were different legal frameworks in different countries and reporting
rules for financial institutions in particular made lease accounting a
highly problematic issue. He added that to put economic benefits on the
balance sheet as an asset was to open up a 'Pandora's box'.
Tweedie emphasised the inadequacy of the present arrangements, saying there
were airlines flying round the world with no aircraft on their balance
sheets. Leisenring argued that the key question for the standard setter was
whether the accounting captured the economic reality.
The conference showed, beyond doubt, that what constitutes economic reality
depends upon where you live: is it the tax collector's reality, the stock
market's reality or that of the creditors?

FT  25 NOV 93 / Carsberg investigates food prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading is investigating allegations that some
supermarkets have colluded with food manufacturers to keep prices high by
deterring price discounting.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, said his office might
also look into allegations that Dixons, the electrical retailer, was trying
to stop consumer electronics goods being supplied to warehouse clubs such as
Costco.
Earlier this month the OFT ruled against Dixons' complaint that it was
facing unfair competition from regional electricity companies.
Combined with the OFT's decision this week to investigate the net book
agreement, which allows publishers to fix book prices, these two initiatives
are aspects of a widespread assault on restrictive retailing practices
launched by Sir Bryan since he took up his post last year. He believes such
practices inflate the prices paid by consumers.
'We need to be vigilant about things that reduce competition at the retail
level,' he said in an interview this week.
Sir Bryan made it clear that he would not be deflected by this month's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the perfume industry from his
determination to root out restrictive retailing practices.
The commission, which was asked by Sir Bryan to investigate the industry,
gave a green light to the selective distribution practices blamed for
keeping scent prices artificially high.
Sir Bryan is pressing ahead with other cases. 'I continue to feel selective
distribution schemes need challenging,' he said.
He denied that the report on the perfume industry set a precedent. 'I
certainly would not accept that the adverse decision in this case has any
implication for other cases . . . It doesn't mean that anything goes with
selective distribution arrangements.'
Sir Bryan is also undaunted by the increasing extent to which UK competition
policy is being affected by decisions taken in Brussels. In the case of
perfumes this was highlighted by the fact that the European Commission had
already approved the industry's selective distribution practices.
He said he did not view greater European Commission involvement with alarm
because he was confident about its pro-competitive stance. He pointed out
that the consequence of more European decisions was that the OFT, which sat
on the European commission's advisory committee on competition, had
influence over events in the rest of Europe.
Nevertheless, Sir Bryan did not try to hide his disagreement with the
Monopolies Commission's report on perfume. He also said he was 'very
disappointed' that the government had not included in last week's Queen's
Speech a long-promised bill to increase his powers to combat restrictive
practices.
Under planned legislation the director-general of fair trading would be able
to agree legally binding changes to company behaviour without the need to
involve the Monopolies Commission.
Sir Bryan is attacking restrictive retailing practices because he believes
that they harm consumers. His view is strengthened by widespread complaints
that retail prices in the UK are generally much higher than in the US.
Four of his referrals to the Monopolies Commission in the past year have
involved selective or exclusive distribution arrangements. In addition to
the perfume industry, he has referred newspaper, film and ice-cream
distribution practices. He has also launched his own investigation into
links between holiday companies and travel agents.
The number of retailing industry practices in which Sir Bryan has publicly
taken an interest is mounting. In some cases, such as perfume and electrical
goods, the concern is that manufacturers are not willing to supply discount
retailers. In others, such as holidays operators, the concern is that
suppliers are not able to get access to retail outlets linked to larger
rivals.
But Sir Bryan's belief that restrictive distribution arrangements need to be
challenged on grounds of competition is disputed by economists, lawyers and
other professionals. Professor John Kay, chairman of London Economics, the
economics consultancy, says that Sir Bryan's approach is 'very
old-fashioned' because it does not take into account developments in
economic theory over the past 20 years.
Prof Kay says that such practices are often essential if manufacturers are
to add value to their products.
That was the view taken by the Monopolies Commission in the case of the
perfume industry. Although Sir Bryan shows no sign of giving up his campaign
to reform UK retailing practices, he will find it more difficult if the
Monopolies Commission takes a similar view in other cases.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Judicial review of M25 plan refused
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday refused Surrey County Council permission to seek
judicial review of the government's plan to widen the M25 London orbital
motorway in stages.
The council argued that the 'piecemeal approach' to the overall project was
unlawful and prevented a balanced appraisal of environmental impact. Mr
Justice Macpherson said the application was premature. He said a public
inquiry was due to examine the first phase of widening.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Durham coalfield's last pit to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday proposed the closure of Wearmouth Colliery in
Sunderland, the last pit in the Durham coalfield, because of the lack of a
market for its power station coal, Chris Tighe writes.
Wearmouth is one of seven pits British Coal has named for closure before
Christmas.
Mr Davy Guy, north-east president of the National Union of Mineworkers, said
Wearmouth had more than 100m tonnes of reserves. He said British Coal wanted
to shut it by December 10. It seems unlikely that miners will oppose the
closure.
The 720 workers at the Frickley pit near Pontefract, West Yorkshire,
yesterday voted on plans to close the pit tomorrow. The result will be
announced today.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Former Tory council chiefs 'delayed' probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused two former Conservative leaders of Westminster city
council of delaying an independent report to limit the impact in next year's
London local elections.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said in two Commons motions
that a report being compiled by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, had
been delayed seven times.
The motions say that some Conservative councillors have followed a
'deliberate strategy' of causing 'as much hindrance to the district auditor
as they can'.
They accuse Dame Shirley Porter and Mr David Weeks, both former leaders of
the council, of trying to delay the report long enough to avoid discussion
of the contents before the May elections.
Dame Shirley and Mr Weeks are said to have sought to force the district
auditor 'to use his formal powers' and to have used 'other delaying
tactics'.
Mr Magill is investigating Labour claims, repeated in the motions, that the
council sold housing estates with the intention of 'gerrymandering the
electoral composition of key marginal wards'.
Mr Weeks said the delays were a matter for the auditor. 'I categorically
deny that any of the delays have been caused by anything that I have done,'
he said. Dame Shirley was not available for comment.
Labour says that an influx of homeowners helped the Conservatives to win 45
of the council's 60 seats in the last elections in 1990, compared with the
32 they held in 1989.
The report, expected to contain about 14,000 pages of evidence, is set to be
published next year, about 10 months after the original scheduled
publication date.
Labour believes, however, that the most politically damaging developments
for the Conservatives will come in a series of hearings which will follow
publication.
The respondents' right to legal representation means that hearings are
unlikely to start until several months after the report appears.
Mr Straw did not criticise Mr Magill but he called for a firm date for
publication to prevent further delays.
Mr Peter Bradley, Westminster council's deputy Labour leader, said the
government would not have tolerated such delays during an investigation into
a Labour council.
Mr Bradley also accused the council of withholding information from Labour
councils. 'Westminster city council is a law unto itself,' he said.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Drug tests offer new Aids hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A possible new approach to Aids treatment has emerged from laboratory tests
at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, of a drug being developed to treat
cancer.
Scotia, a UK pharmaceutical company, said yesterday that its anti-cancer
compound EF13 killed white blood cells infected with HIV. The compound did
not harm uninfected cells, and made them more resistant to HIV infection.
The next stage will be to hold clinical trials for EF13 as an Aids drug,
which could take several years to com-plete.
The drug is the lithium salt of a fatty acid extract from evening primrose
oil. It is believed to kill infected cells by generating lethal levels of
free radicals.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Sheehy in bid for National Lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, has put together a
consortium to plan a formal bid for the licence to run the National Lottery.
The company, called Rainbow, brings to eight the total of identified
consortia committed to launching a bid or seriously considering one.
Apart from Sir Patrick, Rainbow's members include Mr Richard Wheatley,
chairman of Leo Burnett, the marketing and advertising company; Mr Trevor
Thatcher, former managing director of Vernons Pools; Mr Peter Borer, until
recently managing director of BR Telecommunications; and Mr Barry Skipper,
former chief executive of Booker's food distribution division.
Rainbow said that if it decided to go ahead it would have the backing of a
number of blue-chip companies. The aim, it said, was to put together a
management team capable of running the lottery.
In spite of Sir Patrick's chairmanship of BAT, it is unlikely that the
company will provide financial backing.
Leo Burnett will be closely involved in planning the bid. It has appropriate
marketing experience from its involvement in helping to launch the
successful lottery in New Zealand.
Sir Patrick, acting as chief executive of Rainbow, said the group was
evaluating the draft invitation to apply.
'In the event that we decide to proceed with a formal application, I am
pleased to say that we can rely on the financial support of very major
blue-chip organisations,' he said.
The announced bidders for the National Lottery include: The Great British
Lottery Company, including Granada and Carlton; Camelot, backed by Cadbury
Schweppes and Racal; and a joint venture between NM Rothschild and
Tattersalls of Australia.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Tax 'threat' to recovery: Public-sector borrowing not an
urgent problem, says institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was yesterday urged to leave fiscal and
monetary policy broadly unchanged in next week's Budget.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research says substantial tax
increases on top of those already enacted could upset the recovery.
The institute concludes that the problem of the growing public sector
borrowing requirement is 'not an urgent one' as, according to its
calculations, the ratio of gross debt to gross domestic product will settle
towards the end of the decade at a much lower level than that of the 1970s.
It adds that tax increases now to allow for pre-election tax cuts later
would not fool the electorate.
'The electorate would see through the ploy, and would not thank the
government for several years of taxation higher than it need have been,'
says the insti-tute's quarterly economic review.
The review also recommends that the government steers clear of substantial
monetary easing as another cut in interest rates now of one or two
percentage points 'followed as it may well be by underlying inflation moving
outside the announced target range', could undermine attempts to rebuild
trust in the pronouncements of the Treasury or the Bank of England.
The institute's growth forecasts have changed little since the previous
quarter's review. The prediction for gross domestic product growth this year
remains unchanged at 2 per cent, while the forecast for next year is
slightly up at 2.8 per cent.
It is considerably less bullish on manufacturing output, for 1993 at least,
than three months ago. The forecast for growth in 1993 has been revised down
to 2 per cent from the August forecast of 4.1 per cent. But for next year it
forecasts growth of 3 per cent, rather than 2.4 per cent predicted in the
last review.
Forecasts for inflation have also been revised down in the wake of an
encouraging slowdown in growth of the retail prices index. This year the
institute expects underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments - to reach 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared
with the same period a year earlier. Only next year will it breach the upper
limit of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range, ending the
year at around 4.2 per cent.
The institute is also slightly more optimistic than the government about the
state of public-sector finances. It leaves the deficit forecast for the
current year unchanged at Pounds 46bn, compared with the Treasury's forecast
of Pounds 50bn, but puts the deficit at Pounds 35bn for 1994-95 compared
with the Treasury forecast of Pounds 44bn.
The institute expects unemployment to continue falling gradually next year,
albeit with rises in some months.
The review urges Mr Clarke to restate medium-term financial strategy, which
is not comprehensive enough. 'The financial framework must be seen as part
of a complete economic strategy which is designed to achieve the wider goal
of economic prosperity, defined to include growth of output and employment
as well as stability of prices,' it says.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Doubts on south Wales initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of the initiative launched by the government in 1988 to regenerate
the south Wales valleys is cast into doubt by a report published yesterday
by the Government Statistical Service.
It shows that manufacturing employment in the area has fallen faster than in
Wales as a whole, and that for every factory opened almost two have closed.
The first five years of the Programme for the Valleys saw Pounds 770m of
funding from the government and European Community. A second five-year
programme was launched in April with grants increased to Pounds 350m a year.
About 700,000 people live in the area and the initial programme aimed to
repair environmental damage caused by the coal industry, strengthen the
social fabric and build a new economy.
However the report says that manufacturing employment decreased by nearly
6,400 between 1988 and 1992, a fall of 11 per cent, compared with 7 per cent
in Wales as a whole.
The report says that although 12,000 jobs were created between 73 new plants
and 203 growing plants, 'all of these new jobs have now been more than
offset by job losses'. It adds: '138 plants employing 8,600 people in 1988
have subsequently closed and 205 plants, though still in production, have
lost 9,800 jobs.'
The biggest losses have been in electrical and electronic engineering, with
4,300 jobs lost. About 40 per cent of manufacturing employment is by
foreign-owned companies, up from 31 per cent in 1988.
There has been only a small improvement in overall unemployment relative to
the rest of the principality. The jobless rate in the valleys was 14.8 per
cent in March 1988, 3.6 percentage points above that for Wales as a whole.
By June this year the local unemployment rate was 13.2 per cent, still 3.3
percentage points higher.
The Welsh Office yesterday defended the initiative. 'The Programme for the
Valleys is an ambitious attempt to end decades of decline and nobody thought
it could be done within a few years,' it said.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said in October that the first programme
had drawn in Pounds 700m of extra private-sector investment, 2.6m sq ft of
industrial floorspace had been provided, over 2,000 acres of derelict land
cleared and more than 7,000 homes improved.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Banker 'admitted' multi-million fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A merchant banker confessed to a colleague that he carried out a
multi-million pound fraud stretching back years for the 'wonderful chaps' he
worked with, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.
Mr Michael Hamilton told the court that his partner Mr Wallace Smith owned
up to what he had done
two days before Wallace Smith Trust Company finally folded in April 1991
with a Pounds 100m 'hole' in its finances. However, Mr Smith had denied
syphoning off huge amounts for himself, Mr Hamilton said.
Mr Hamilton told the jury the admission followed a confrontation with Mr
Smith the previous day.
On that occasion he had accused Mr Smith of channelling clients' assets
through overseas trusts before feeding them back into the bank to cover
salaries and expenses.
Mr Hamilton said he asked Smith if he had set up the trusts to carry out the
fraud. 'He said he had not . . . He said it just happened; it started, then
it grew.'
Mr Smith, the 59-year-old founder of Wallace Smith Trust Company, denies
fraudulent trading, false accounting, obtaining property by deception and
theft.
The Crown claimed the once high-living banker 'masterminded' the 'massive
and sophisticated' fraud after weaving a bogus web of overseas wealth.
Mr Timothy Barnes QC, prosecuting, alleged Smith committed his crimes under
the noses of the Bank of England, his auditors and fellow direct-ors.
The trial was adjourned until today.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Gas monopolists with an eye on the regions: Industry views
on the type of break-up the government should favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES

<TEXT>
As the government approaches a decision whether to abolish British Gas's
monopoly of household gas supplies, it has to consider what sort of market
might be put in its place.
In its report last August the Monopolies and Mergers Commission did not
offer a blueprint for the new market except to say that its success would
depend on the break-up of British Gas. The details could be left to Ofgas,
the regulator.
British Gas's potential competitors are now trying to promote their own
ideas to the Department of Trade and Industry.
There are two basic issues. One is whether the market should be thrown open
to competition as a single entity, or chopped up into regions, as is the
case in electricity and water.
If various regions are formed it has to be decided whether they should be
monopolies, at least initially, as is also the case in electricity and
water, or whether they should be opened up to several competitors at once.
A number of independent gas companies have teamed up to promote the idea of
a single, competitive market. A leading member of this group is United Gas.
Its chairman, Mr Peter Bryant, said: 'Chopping the country up into regions
is nonsense. You don't license Tesco to serve just the Manchester area.'
But other independents are calling for a regional approach. Mr Alan
Marshall, managing director of Agas, which is part-owned by Elf, the French
oil group, is sounding the alarm about the dangers of a 'free for all' in
which the interests of domestic consumers could get trampled underfoot.
Instead, he is proposing a series of regional franchises. Each would be the
territory of a single company which would have the right to supply gas to
consumers, but would also have to accept obligations to ensure that
everybody who wanted gas got it.
The issue is not just one of geography. Mr Marshall's concern is that a
free-for-all would enable new entrants to go for the most desirable markets,
and leave the rest either with British Gas or without gas at all. He
believes the more vulnerable consumers might be disadvantaged by
de-regulation.
'The government is in danger of creating unregulated monopolies which can
cherry-pick their customers and dump costs on British Gas,' he told a
conference earlier this month. 'This sort of free-market purism cannot be in
the best interest of consumers at large.'
Mr Bryant dismisses these fears. Under his group's plan, gas companies would
have to be licensed as public gas suppliers. They could select their own
territory, but would have to be approved by the regulator and they would be
obliged to serve everybody in it.
A variation of the regional franchise idea has been put forward by Mr
Jonathan Stern, a consultant with Gas Strategies. He proposes breaking the
country up into defined geographical areas - as many as 100 of them based on
British Gas's districts.
The regulator would award franchises to new suppliers in each area on the
basis of competitive tender, taking into account their ability to meet a set
of conditions. Franchises would be for five years, or long enough to
underpin contracts with gas producers. Franchisees would be required to
advertise their terms and accept any customer who came forward.
Gas companies could apply for as many areas as they wanted, although the
number of successful bidders in any single area might have to be limited.
Mr Stern agrees there is a danger that nobody might bid for some areas, in
which case British Gas would be left to supply them. But he says British Gas
would be compensated for the cost of this by having its monopoly phased out
rather than abruptly terminated.
Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers Council, said yesterday that
members would be opposed to regional franchises if they contained any
suggestion of regional monopolies for any length of time.
He said, however, that the council might accept some geographical system if
it was a necessary step to a free market, provided that consumers were not
denied choice.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Builders see signs of fragile upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence of a faltering recovery in Britain's construction industry emerged
yesterday with the announcement that orders for new work were up 10 per cent
in the three months to the end of September compared with the corresponding
three months last year.
Department of the Environment figures show orders in the first nine months
up 7.5 per cent compared with the first three quarters of 1992. Most of the
rises have been in public and private housing work and other public
construction.
The industry fears that these sectors may be hit badly in next week's
Budget. Most vulnerable is thought to be government spending on housing
associations, which the chancellor is expected to trim by at least a further
Pounds 300m in 1994-95.
Orders for housing associations and other public housing jumped by 45 per
cent in the first nine months of this year. Private housebuilding orders
rose 8.8 per cent over the same period.
Housebuilders said that the fragile recovery in private housing would be
undermined if the chancellor decided to announce further cuts in mortgage
tax relief in the Budget.
Private investment in factories, warehouses, shops and offices has remained
at a low ebb, with industrial orders rising only 1.8 per cent and private
commercial orders at about the same level as in the first nine months of
last year.
Private industrial and commercial orders, however, rose sharply in the three
months to the end of September - both rose by 11 per cent compared with the
corresponding period last year.
Mr Christopher Vickers, construction spokesman for the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors, said: 'The latest figures are encouraging but
surprising given the present mood of the industry.'
He added: 'New-order figures over the last year have been extremely erratic.
A sustained improvement in workload is necessary before we can be sure
recovery is really under way. The construction industry waits with bated
breath for the chancellor's Budget.'
About 150,000 new home starts are expected to be registered with the
National House Building Council this year, about 19 per cent up on last year
and the best level for three years, the NHBC said yesterday.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Politician whiskey fetches Pounds 11,462 at Christie's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fourteen bottles of Scotch whisky, part of the cargo of the SS Politician,
which ran aground in the Outer Hebrides in 1941, sold for Pounds 11,462 at
Christie's in Glasgow yesterday. Six went to a Glasgow restaurateur. The
wreck inspired Sir Compton Mackenzie's novel Whisky Galore. The 1949 film,
starring Gordon Jackson (left) and James Robertson Justice, immortalised the
story of thirsty islanders who plundered the wreck and thwarted officialdom.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Edington may pay over 90p in pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors and creditors of Edington, the Manchester merchant bank which went
into administration in April 1991, are likely to get more than 90 per cent
of their money back.
Mr Philip Ramsbottom, joint administrator and head of corporate recovery at
KPMG Peat Marwick's Manchester office, will pay another 11p in the pound
before the end of this month. The distribution, worth Pounds 3.1m, is the
fourth, and brings the total paid so far to Pounds 24.2m, or 85p in the
pound.
Mr Ramsbottom expects another 5p to be distributed next year, in line with
his prediction two years ago. However, much of Manchester's financial
community now expects the distribution to exceed 5p, or to be followed by
another payment.
Edington - the merchant-banking arm of Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester
stockbroking and financial services group - was forced into administration
after some local authorities declined to put funds of Pounds 15m back on
deposit after withdrawing them to balance year-end accounts.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Stock Exchange sees rise in individuals' share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual investors have increased their participation on the London Stock
Exchange for the first time since 1989, figures released yesterday by the
exchange show.
The Stock Exchange's Quality of Markets Review for autumn shows that in the
first nine months of this year individuals' share of turnover, by volume,
rose to 16 per cent from 14 per cent a year ago.
This comes when overall turnover has been particularly strong. In the third
quarter of 1993 the total value of transactions on the London and Irish
stock exchanges was a record Pounds 146.7bn, up 2.7 per cent from the third
quarter of 1987, the previous quarterly record.
But the data suggest that the increased activity is more likely to be the
result of individuals selling shares rather than buying them. In bargains of
up to Pounds 50,000 in size, where small investors are likely to be the
predominant executors, sales of securities marginally outweighed purchases.
However, in bargains of Pounds 50,000 or over purchases outweighed sales,
particularly for transactions of Pounds 1m or more.
Meanwhile, the exchange found that the 'touch' - the average difference
between the best buy offer and the best sell offer for a given share -
narrowed to its lowest level since the stock market crash of 1987.
The average touch has narrowed from 1.2 per cent of share price in January
1992 to 0.7 per cent at the end of September 1993.
Some 80 per cent of bargains of Pounds 2,000 or less - likely to have been
struck on behalf of individual investors - were conducted at the touch.
A narrowing of the touch suggests greater liquidity.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Pensions option may be tempting to Clarke - The
industry expects to be hit but, as Norma Cohen writes, which tax breaks will
be curbed is unknown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The temptation for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise badly needed
government revenues from the pensions sector must be very great.
Government estimates are that tax reliefs associated with pensions are
between Pounds 14bn and Pounds 15bn a year. Numbers like that catch the eye
in a year when the government will have to borrow Pounds 50bn to meet its
own expenses.
The pensions industry now expects that there will be curbs on tax breaks for
the sector. But what form they will take is a subject of some debate.
Mr Andrew Evans, partner in the executive benefits group at accountancy firm
Price Waterhouse, said a tax on pensions could be a relatively attractive
political option in spite of the government's avowed policy to encourage
individuals to make more provision for themselves.
He said: 'It's easier to raise revenues from pensions because it is
difficult to explain the consequences from this action. It's a step removed
from most people's day-to-day expenditure.'
Certainly that was how it turned out last March when Mr Norman Lamont, then
chancellor, cut the amount of recoverable advance corporation tax paid on
corporate dividends that pension schemes could claim from 25 per cent to 20
per cent of the dividend's value. For weeks the industry barely murmured its
objections, although the effect of the change was to deprive schemes of 6
1/4 per cent of their annual cashflow earned on UK shares.
Finally, the industry trade body, the National Association of Pension Funds,
succeeded in extracting a promise that further reductions in recoverable ACT
were not planned. But experts remain uneasy that the promise will be kept.
Mr Andrew Wilson, partner at consulting actuaries R Watson and Sons, said
that further reductions in recoverable ACT would reap the government far
less than it believed. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said a reduction
to 10 per cent will raise Pounds 3bn a year.
'But the net figure is closer to Pounds 500m,' Mr Wilson said. That is
because the resulting loss in cashflow will force companies to contribute an
additional Pounds 3.5bn a year to their pension schemes, thus reducing the
amount of ACT paid to government in the first place.
Mr Evans noted that tax advantages occurred at three stages in the pension
cycle, when a contribution was made, while investment income was earned and,
through the availability of a tax-free lump sum on final benefits, tax
relief on withdrawals. 'It would be very dangerous to tax pensions at all
three points,' he said.
There is a growing consensus that the tax-free lump sum is an anomalous tax
break and should be phased out. The institute has said the government could
raise an additional Pounds 1bn a year by eliminating it.
When this change was last seriously proposed by Mr Nigel Lawson, now Lord
Lawson, in 1988, it sparked one of the loudest public outcries of his term,
according to his memoirs.
The mood may have changed, however. The government's own Pension Law Review
Committee wrote in a report that was published in September: 'We received a
considerable amount of evidence from institutions suggesting that in return
for simplicity of administration the right to receive a tax-free lump sum
might be conceded.'
Mr Evans pointed out that such a change could only be phased in over time,
but that the government might not wish to wait so long to see an improvement
in its finances.
Other possible tax changes include the suggestion of Mr John Maples, the
former Treasury minister, that the tax relief afforded on contributions be
abolished in favour of tax-free pensions. This would raise Pounds 7bn
immediately while cutting revenues in the future.
There would be significant difficulties, however, and officials have
recently indicated that the proposal will not be adopted.
Mr Paul Johnson, researcher at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was
more likely that the chancellor would seek to restrict the level of tax
relief on contributions to the basic rate of 25 per cent or even to reduce
it to 20 per cent. The first measure would raise between Pounds 500m and
Pounds 1bn while the second could add Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn to the public
coffers.

FT  25 NOV 93 / London rails over Tube snarl-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As crowds of commuters flowed to work yesterday on foot, the words of TS
Eliot's The Waste Land came alive on London's streets.
But this time it was not death but a power cut on the Underground that had
undone so many under the brown fog of a winter dawn.
Even by the standards Londoners are used to enduring, yesterday's snarl-up
was remarkable. Across the capital hundreds of thousands of commuters found
their local Tube station barricaded and bus-stops swamped by restless
passengers.
Ms Janet Brown, a civil servant, was due at a conference in Westminster at
9.15am. But at 7.50am, the Central, Circle and District lines at Notting
Hill Tube station had been closed.
Crowds of people milled at the station's four exits and in the busy west
London street, hoping for a bus or taxi to come to their rescue. But many
wore the resigned expression of those who knew, from bitter experience, that
when the Tubes are down the buses will be packed and the chance of a empty
taxi is less than a snowball's in hell.
After an hour's walking - with fellow commuters three abreast - Ms Brown
picked up a bus at Marble Arch only to sit for a further hour as the bus
inched down Oxford Street. She reached Westminster two hours late. She had
not seen a single cab with its for hire sign illuminated.
But yesterday's real victims spent much of the morning in tunnels underneath
central London, reading and rereading their newspapers.
Just past Queensway passengers on one Central Line train sat stoically
waiting for information, never a word passing between them.
As the eye-rolling and paper-rustling reached fever pitch a determined
supply-teacher strode from the back of the train and headed for the driver's
cabin.
A class of eight-year olds was waiting for her, she said. Why aren't we
moving?
The driver couldn't say. Not good enough, said the teacher, with nods of
support from a decidedly chattier carriage. The driver disappeared. The
train did not budge. It was there for almost an hour - but at least by then
the inmates of the carriage were busy swapping their life stories.

FT  25 NOV 93 / DTI tries to end fears on deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday attempted to
reassure the Commons that the government's new deregulation measures would
not ride rough-shod over parliament's traditional authority.
His comments were made against a backdrop of ministerial concern that the
bill could run into difficulties in the House of Lords.
The Department of Trade and Industry seeks sweeping powers to enable
government departments to repeal hundreds of regulatory measures without
primary legislation.
Mr Heseltine said the bill would have specific deregulation measures as well
as the means to deregulate in the future. In an attempt to defuse a
potential row over the powers to enable him to scrap rules, he said the
process would still be subject to parliamentary procedure.
The government's concern about getting the measures though the Lords has
been highlighted by a leaked government document showing that it is already
looking at options in case the bill runs into difficulties.
One involves replacing a general power to scrap regulations with a power to
delegate functions specified in the bill. Another involves establishing a
parliamentary scrutiny procedure.
The DTI said it was examining all options before introducing the bill. It
said there were no plans to 'avoid public scrutiny' through the use of
orders in crown procedures.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, asked why the government
wanted to give itself special powers to axe regulations in what he described
as a 'pathetic and mean-spirited' bill. 'Deregulation is offered to this
session of parliament as a sort of grotesque parody of an industrial
strategy,' he said.
The government was backed by Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the
Institute of Directors, who told Mr Heseltine at his group's annual dinner
on Tuesday that he wanted the DTI to gain powers to get rid of regulations
that were a burden on business.
The bill's details will be unknown until next month.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister of corporate affairs, who heads the deregulation
initiative, has said that the DTI wants powers to repeal by order many
statutory instruments, allowing ministers to make regulations without the
specific order of parliament.
Mr Hamilton yesterday denied that the bill would compromise safety
standards. He said that the government's purpose was to update and improve
regulation though 'careful pruning'.
A Labour amendment attacking the government's industrial record was defeated
by 319 to 276 votes.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Glasgow's health board chief resigns after row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday accepted the resignation of Mr
Bill Fyfe, chairman of Greater Glasgow Health Board, Britain's largest
health authority, James Buxton writes.
Mr Fyfe's position became increasingly difficult following a board decision
which he instigated to dismiss Mr Laurence Peterken, the board's general
manager.
Shortly after Mr Peterken was dismissed he was appointed to the newly
created post of director of special projects by Mr Gerald Scaife, the chief
executive of the National Health Service in Scotland.
Mr Scaife then investigated circumstances of Mr Peterken's dismissal while
MPs put down questions to ministers in parliament. Mr Fyfe appeared to be
losing the support of Scottish Office ministers.
Yesterday five members of the Greater Glasgow Health Board issued a
statement saying: 'In the light of information now available we believe the
correct procedure was not followed in the dismissal of Laurence Peterken.
'We have no confidence in the chairman and we call on him to resign
forthwith.'
Mr Fyfe took over the chairmanship of the health board earlier this year. He
had previously won ministerial approval as chairman of Ayrshire and Arran
Health Board, where he stood up to trade unions, made savings and encouraged
the formation of one of the first trust hospitals in Scotland.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Individuals' share deals show rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual investors have increased their participation on the London Stock
Exchange for the first time since 1989, figures released yesterday by the
exchange show.
The Stock Exchange's Quality of Markets Review for Autumn 1993 shows that in
the first nine months of this year individuals' share of turnover, by
volume, rose to 16 per cent from 14 per cent a year ago.
This comes at a time when overall turnover has been particularly strong. In
the third quarter of 1993 the total value of transactions on the London and
Irish stock exchanges was a record Pounds 146.7bn, up 2.7 per cent from the
third quarter of 1987, the previous quarterly record.
However, the data suggest that the increased activity is more likely to be
the result of individuals selling shares rather than buying them. In
bargains of up to Pounds 50,000 in size, where small investors are likely to
be the predominant executors, sales of securities marginally outweighed
purchases.
However, in bargains of Pounds 50,000 or over purchases outweighed sales,
particularly for transactions of Pounds 1m or more.
Participation by small investors on the exchange has been falling almost
steadily since 1980, when by volume it accounted for about 37 per cent of
all bargains traded there.
Meanwhile, the exchange found that the 'touch' - the average difference
between the best buy offer and the best sell offer for a given share -
narrowed to its lowest level since the stock market crash of October 1987.
This trend started at the beginning of January 1992, when the average touch
was 1.2 per cent of share price.
By the end of September 1993 that had narrowed to 0.7 per cent.
'The touch represents a real transaction cost to investors, especially
private clients,' the exchange's bulletin says.
Some 80 per cent of bargains of Pounds 2,000 or less - likely to have been
struck on behalf of individual investors - were conducted at the touch.
A narrowing of the touch suggests greater liquidity in the markets.
The exchange noted that the narrowing has not only not been limited to the
largest and most liquid stocks but in fact has been even more pronounced in
the case of less liquid stocks.
Among these the average touch was just over 10 per cent at the start of 1992
but has now fallen to 6 per cent of stock prices.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He has not slammed the door quite shut. But the operative word in that
sentence is 'quite'. Mr James Molyneaux, the 73-year old MP for Lagan Valley
and leader of the Ulster Unionists, holds a veto over Mr John Major's
efforts to broker a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland.
This week he added his voice to those predicting that efforts to secure a
constitutional agreement - let alone a voluntary cessation of IRA violence -
are probably doomed.
When Mr Major talks of the consent of the majority as the precondition for
any new agreement he is talking about the Ulster Unionists. In the words of
one cabinet minister, Mr Molyneaux's veto is 'absolute'. Mr Major knows well
that without the backing of Mr Molyneaux he could never claim that vital
'consent' for any political settlement with Dublin. Nor could he carry with
him his own Conservative and Unionist party.
For the past several weeks Mr Molyneaux had been watching from the sidelines
the intense diplomacy between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. He let the
Rev Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionist party make the running with
its depressingly ritualistic condemnations of the threatened Whitehall
'sell-out' of the Protestant majority.
But this week Mr Molyneaux moved centre-stage. After the leak last week of
draft proposals from the Dublin government for a successor to the 1985
Anglo-Irish agreement he joined the unionist critics of the Major-Reynolds
initiative.
Mr Molyneaux is not a politician who speaks in short, sharp, sound-bites. He
is disparaging of those who fail to understand the complexities of Northern
Ireland. But in a 45-minute interview with the Financial Times yesterday his
meaning was clear.
Take a few sentences from that interview. He was pressed at the outset on
whether Mr Major and Mr Reynolds should break off their search for a new
intergovernmental agreement. The response: 'Well, its futile, isn't it?'
The voters in the republic would agree to renounce its constitutional claim
only in return for 'something which has the same effect as the territorial
claim plus the enforcement of the territorial claim'.
Mr Molyneaux is careful not to criticise Mr Major directly. But he is
scathing about the British government's willingness to allow the Hume-Adams
'peace initiative' to become entangled with political negotiations. The
strategy drawn up by Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party
leader, and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, was 'a fiendishly clever operation,
totally lacking in principle'. The aim was the 'phased integration' of North
and South, imposed by British troops over a 14-year period. The media had
been tricked into presenting Mr Adams as a man of peace.
After 25 years of miserable violence Mr Major is going for the big prize of
a global accord acceptable both to the Protestant and Catholic communities
in the province and to Dublin. He is determined to explore the possibility
that the IRA has tired of violence.
But Mr Molyneaux's fundamental point is that the leaked Irish proposals have
shown there is no possibility of squaring Dublin's commitment to a united
Ireland with the wishes of the majority in the province. The
'three-stranded' approach to a settlement had lost its validity. The notion
behind it - that 'nothing could be agreed until everything is agreed' - was
'completely daft'. It was better then to restart talks on devolved
government in Ulster.
Here Mr Molyneaux's words will cause some surprise. He has always been
known, in the jargon of Ulster unionism, as an integrationist - a supporter
not of a devolved assembly but of tying the government of the province much
more closely to the political process at Westminster. Now he is arguing for
the focus to switch to all-party talks on a new power-sharing assembly.
Ulster needed 'close-contact' government before it could begin to explore
new relationships with the Republic. If Mr Hume was willing to return to the
table, then progress could be rapid.
That view is shared neither in London nor among the constitutional
nationalists in the north. Without a comprehensive settlement it is hard to
see the SDLP agreeing terms for an assembly.
Mr Major's aides understandably were searching for a positive gloss. Mr
Molyneaux had not said the prime minister should break off talks with Mr
Reynolds. It was to be expected that the Ulster Unionists would harden their
position from time to time to avoid being outflanked by the DUP. As in all
negotiations, it was inevitable that all those around the table would not
offer public concessions.
So as long as Mr Molyneaux leaves the door ajar Mr Major will soldier on.
Nothing is lost until everything is lost. True enough perhaps. But hardly
encouraging.

FT  25 NOV 93 / CBI urges more Bank autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday urged the government to take
further steps towards giving the Bank of England more independence.
The day after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced that the Bank
would in future decide the precise timing of changes in borrowing rates, the
CBI's ruling council unanimously approved a policy paper arguing the case
for greater independence of the central bank.
It also expressed the hope that a further cut in interest rates of around
half a point might be considered in the near future.
The chancellor hinted at the recent CBI conference that he was lukewarm
about the idea of more independence for the Bank, even though two of his
predecessors - Lord Lawson and Mr Norman Lamont - supported the idea.
Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI director of economic affairs, said the UK had the
opportunity to break out of its historic pattern of high inflation and high
interest rates. He added: 'Now is the time to make the institutional changes
which will safeguard against a future resurgence of inflation by developing
the more independent role that the Bank of England has begun to assume.'
The CBI has already welcomed the steps taken last autumn to make economic
policy-making and the conduct of monetary policy more open to outside
scrutiny.
But the organisation is arguing that the changes implemented so far are not
extensive enough. It said yesterday that countries with independent central
banks had a generally better record of combining growth with low inflation.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Rightwing Tory MPs set to retain their influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rightwing Conservative 92 Group is set to retain a substantial role in
running the party in spite of efforts by the newly formed Mainstream group
to reduce its influence.
Mainstream, based on the pro-European Union Positive Europe group and the
leftwing Lollards, has decided to try to widen its appeal by backing four of
the nine rightwingers on the executive of the 1922 committee of Tory
backbenchers in today's elections. The decision is in line with attempts by
Mainstream organisers to portray the group as a coalition representing a
range of opinion, rather than a centre-left faction.
Mainstream was formed to combat the success of the 92 Group, led by Sir
George Gardiner, the Thatcherite MP for Reigate, which took nine of the 12
executive seats last year.
Mainstream's leaders, who include Mr Cranley Onslow, a former 1922 committee
chairman, say they hope to prompt a display of loyalty to Mr John Major, the
prime minister. They accuse the right of disloyalty over Europe, and of
misrepresenting backbench opinion about the balance between public-spending
cuts and tax increases in next week's Budget.
However, Mainstream has included three 92 group members - Mrs Marion Roe, Mr
Bob Dunn, and Mr Michael Neubert - and one former member - Sir Anthony
Durant - in its slate of candidates. The line-up also includes two sitting
members with links to the right - Sir Anthony Grant and Sir Terence Higgins.
All except Sir Anthony Durant also appear on the 92 group slate, virtually
guaranteeing their election. Sir Anthony is replaced by Mr David Evans, the
rightwinger. Both groups are backing Sir Donald Thompson, an unaligned
former junior minister.
The crucial battle will be for the remaining five seats, for which the 92
group is putting up Sir George Gardiner, Sir Ivan Lawrence, Mr James Pawsey,
Mr John Townend, and Sir Rhodes Boyson - all sitting members regarded by
Mainstream as hard line rightwingers. Mainstream has made these MPs its main
targets, and will regard the election as a defeat if it fails to unseat most
of them.
The Mainstream slate includes Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, Mr David Sumberg,
Mr Peter Butler and Mr Nigel Forman. In a separate election, Sir Geoffrey is
being challenged by Mr Dunn for one of the committee's two
vice-chairmanships.
The Labour left suffered a blow last night when Mr Peter Hain, the MP for
Neath, lost his position as secretary of the soft-left Tribune Group.
Mr Hain, who has used the secretaryship to try and restore Tribune's
reputation as a forum for vigorous policy debate, was edged out by Ms Janet
Anderson, the Labour MP for Rossendale and Darwen.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Spending of secret services open to scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week's Budget will for the first time include details of the spending
incurred by the UK's intelligence and security services, the government
announced yesterday.
This was disclosed with the publication of the intelligence services bill
containing measures to open the secret services to scrutiny by a committee
of six parliamentarians.
Sir Colin McColl, the head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), said in
his first appearance at a press conference that he welcomed greater openness
about the service's work in gathering intelligence overseas. It was
important for his staff and for people who helped them to know that the
government remained committed to the service after the cold war.
Sir Colin said, however, that he would prefer not to take a higher public
profile, or have his photograph published in the same way as Mrs Stella
Rimington, head of the Security Service (MI5) which is responsible for
counter-intelligence work inside the UK.
'Secrecy is our absolute stock in trade,' he said. 'It is important to the
people who work for us and risk their lives that we remain a secret service.
'When the Central Intelligence Agency went open in the 1970s it worried a
lot of their people. I want to send our people a signal that we are not
going to open everything up.'
Sir Colin confirmed that, like all previous heads of MI6, he was known as
'C' after Captain Sir Mansfield Cumming, the first head of the service. He
admitted to continuing the tradition of writing his memos in green ink.
Also making his first public appearance was Sir John Adye, head of the
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the electronic eavesdropping
organisation based at Cheltenham.
Sir John said that the new legislation would provide public assurance of
GCHQ's commitment to work within the law, without risking the secrecy it
needed for success.
Public expenditure plans for the next three years will include estimates of
the aggregate budget for MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. Separate figures will not be
published for each service in case this alerts opponents to shifts in
emphasis.
For the first time, the services' budget will be open to scrutiny by Sir
John Bourn, the head of the National Audit Office.
The new Intelligence and Security Committee will be appointed by the prime
minister from among MPs and peers, following consultation with the leader of
the opposition. It will examine the expenditure, administration and policy
of the services, but not operational matters.
The committee will present an annual report to the prime minister which will
be laid before parliament.
All three services will be subject to similar requirements for obtaining
warrants to enter or interfere with property or intercept communications.
A new commissioner will review warrants and authorisations and report
annually to parliament. A tribunal will be set up to investigate complaints
against MI6 and GCHQ. The Security Service Tribunal already performs a
similar function for MI5.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Iraq arms sales 'did not have high priority'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The senior government official responsible for Britain's export controls
before the Gulf war admitted yesterday that at the time he was more
concerned with the antiques trade than equipment used to build up Iraq's
military regime.
Asked at the Scott inquiry on arms to Iraq why he had not spent more time on
the day-to-day running of the department Mr Eric Beston, head of the
Department of Trade and Industry's export control branch from 1985 to 1990,
said he had greater priorities than exports to Iraq. Much more of his time
was spent on antiques and heritage issues involving 'large expensive things
owned by rich and powerful people'.
He said: 'Throughout this period there were what, at the time, seemed much
bigger issues.' While maintaining that in some cases his view had not
changed, he said that if he had had any indication 'that events in Iraq were
going to move in the way that they did or that the Warsaw Pact was going to
collapse, I might have had a different set of priorities'.
Earlier the hearing was told that officials who could have intervened to
stop machine-tool exports to Iraq were barred from seeing vital intelligence
material because of delays in security vetting.
In one case, according to Mr Beston, it took seven months to carry out
positive vetting on a senior officer.
Asked why he had not seen intelligence documents outlining the munitions use
of three proposed machine-tool exports for Iraq, although he had security
clearance, Mr Beston said: 'I cannot account for it.'
Mr Beston was unable to shed light on a central area of the inquiry - why
the DTI did not act on MI6 intelligence sent out in November 1987
identifying the military uses of proposed machine tool exports to Iraq. Just
who saw the report and when it arrived at the DTI has been a focus of the
inquiry because, at the time the intelligence was compiled, the DTI had not
committed itself to approving a series of machine-tool export licence
applications for Iraq. The hearing was told at a previous session that a
copy sent to the Foreign Office was locked in a cupboard over Christmas.
Mr Beston said not all of his officials would have been able to see the
report. He said one senior officer, Mr Tony Steadman, would not have had
access since his positive vetting was not completed until January 1988 - he
joined the department in May 1987.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Weapons bound for Ulster seized
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A bid by Ulster loyalists 'preparing for war' in Northern Ireland to boost
their arsenal with a shipment of arms and explosives was foiled yesterday.
The outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force admitted that the shipment - which
included 300 assault rifles and two tonnes of explosives - had been destined
for it. The group added that the seizure was a 'logistical setback' but
pledged that they would make efforts to find new weaponry.
Customs officers, who described the find as the biggest ever arms seizure in
Britain, swooped at Teesport, Cleveland, on a container ship from Poland
carrying the cache after a tip-off from MI6.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, congratulated British customs
and security authorities on the find.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the operation was a
good example of the continuing successes in the fight against terrorist evil
by law enforcement agencies in the UK and elsewhere.
Mr Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader to whose east
Belfast constituency the arms were headed, said he thought loyalist
paramilitaries were arming themselves in the event of the British and Irish
governments doing a deal with the IRA.
Mr Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour party security spokesman and
deputy leader, said the seizure was 'clear evidence that loyalist
paramilitaries are intent on pursuing their campaign of violence, rather
than pursuing a lasting and peaceful settlement'.

The former chief executive of the collapsed Farr Group construction company
was jailed for two years yesterday for stealing Pounds 2m from the company's
pension fund, in spite of promising to repay the missing money within three
years, John Mason writes.
Mr Gerald Smith had been repaying the missing funds from a loan and his
earnings as a business consultant, Southwark Crown Court was told. His jail
sentence means he will not be able to make any further repayments, leaving
the pension fund severely depleted.
Passing sentence Judge Laurie said he had to balance the individual
interests of pension fund members against the public interest in ensuring
dishonest company directors who stole pension fund assets were properly
punished.
He had decided that the public interest was more important in this case.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Benefit fraud 'costs at least Pounds 1bn a year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fraud is costing the social security system at least Pounds 1bn a year, the
Commons public accounts committee said in a report yesterday.
Although the number of staff countering crime in the system has increased,
the committee says some cases are not being detected and pursued early
enough.
Criminals engaged in social security fraud make multiple claims for benefit,
use false or stolen identity documents, counterfeit them, and break into
Post Offices to steal documents. Fraudulent encashment of missing order
books alone amounted to Pounds 85m last year.
The Department of Social Security calculates that fraud costs the benefits
system at least Pounds 1bn a year, while other estimates put the loss at
Pounds 2bn or more.
But individual fraud by claimants misrepresenting their circumstances
accounts for the greater part of the loss.
Over the past six years staff fighting organised fraud have increased from
78 to 250. The committee was concerned that, although the cost-effectiveness
of the staff could be demonstrated, no further increase was proposed. It
urged the department to 'consider the degree of priority they are giving to
this work'.
The committee said fraud prevention measures had been delayed by
difficulties in co-ordinating the large number of social security branches.
Mr Michael Bichard, chief executive of the Benefits Agency, said its
measures against fraud had saved Pounds 558m last year and led to the

FT  25 NOV 93 / Row grows over Labour regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's ruling National Executive Committee yesterday defied a threat by
the party's northern region to break away, and insisted that it would press
ahead with plans to merge the party's north of England and Yorkshire
regions.
The merger plans have prompted opposition in the northern region - which
covers Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Durham, Cleveland and Cumbria - where
officials are to ballot the 30,000 members on whether to declare
independence from the rest of the party.
The NEC said that the decision to merge the regions had been taken by last
month's party conference - as part of cost cuts - and could not be
rescinded. But some in the region dispute this view, and the NEC also agreed
to summon northern region officials to London to try to persuade them to
abandon the ballot.
Northern region officials believe the merger would rob them of their
identity.
Mr Nick Anderson, northern region chairman of the Labour party, said: 'We
are determined the NEC should be made aware not just of the views of the
northern region executive but of the entire Labour party northern region, on
the basis of one-member-one-vote.'
Mr Anderson, who is also northern region secretary of the GMB general union,
added: 'We hope when they have the ballot results they will take them into
account.'
The GMB, the area's biggest union, said members were incensed at the
insensitivity of the merger proposals. It said the NEC had failed to
understand what the party's northern region had done in the last 14 years to
create regional structures to help withstand the rundown of manufacturing
industry and promote a regional identity.
The results of the ballot are expected to be announced at a delegate
conference in the new year, probably in February.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Minister admits to Sinn Fein meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night admitted to meetings between ministers and Sinn
Fein representatives and said it periodically received intelligence from
individuals who may have been in touch with the IRA's political wing.
In the government's most detailed summary of its contacts with Sinn Fein, Mr
Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, said the meetings were with
council delegations including a Sinn Fein councillor. They had been to
discuss local constituency matters.
Responding to a parliamentary written question by Mr Jeremy Corbyn, Labour
MP for Islington North, Mr Ancram said the government's main sources of
information about Sinn Fein's views were 'public ones such as written
documents and reports of interviews'.
The question of the government's contacts with Sinn Fein became an issue
earlier this month after Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the
party had been in 'protracted contact and dialogue' with the government.

FT  25 NOV 93 / DTI had 'greater priorities' than exports to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE senior government official responsible for Britain's export controls
prior to the Gulf War admitted yesterday that at the time he was more
concerned with the antiques trade than equipment used to build up Iraq's
military regime.
Asked at the Scott inquiry on arms to Iraq why he had not spent more time on
the day-to-day running of the department Mr Eric Beston, head of the
Department of Trade and Industry's export control branch from 1985 to 1990,
said he had greater priorities than exports to Iraq. Much more of his time
was spent on antiques and heritage issues involving 'large expensive things
owned by rich and powerful people'.
He said: 'Throughout this period there were what, at the time, seemed much
bigger issues.' While maintaining that in some cases his view had not
changed, he said that if he had had any indication 'that events in Iraq were
going to move in the way that they did or that the Warsaw Pact was going to
collapse, I might have had a different set of priorities'.
Earlier the hearing was told that officials who could have intervened to
stop machine-tool exports to Iraq were barred from seeing vital intelligence
material because of delays in security vetting.
In one case, according to Mr Beston, it took seven months to carry out
positive vetting on a senior officer.
Asked why he had not seen intelligence documents outlining the munitions use
of three proposed machine-tool exports for Iraq, although he had security
clearance, Mr Beston said: 'I cannot account for it.'
The speed at which vetting was carried out 'depends who is pushing', he
said, agreeing with Lord Justice Scott, who said that in some cases vetting
could take days rather than weeks.
Mr Beston was unable to shed light on a central area of the inquiry - why
the DTI did not act on MI6 intelligence sent out in November 1987
identifying the military uses of proposed machine tool exports to Iraq.
Just who saw the report and when it arrived at the DTI has been a focus of
the inquiry because, at the time the intelligence was compiled, the DTI had
not committed itself to approving a series of machine-tool export licence
applications for Iraq. The hearing was told at a previous session that a
copy sent to the Foreign Office was locked in a cupboard over Christmas.
Mr Beston said not all of his officials would have been able to see the
report. He said one senior officer, Mr Tony Steadman, would not have had
access since his positive vetting was not completed until January 1988 - he
joined the department in May 1987.
Lord Justice Scott suggested that, given that export licence applications
for Iraq had been in the system since May 1987, it was not clear to him that
the intelligence report would have caused alarm in the DTI.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Pension thief gets two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former chief executive of the collapsed Farr Group construction company
was jailed for two years yesterday for stealing Pounds 2m from the company's
pension fund - in spite of promising to repay the missing money within three
years.
Mr Gerald Smith had been repaying the missing funds from a loan and his
earnings as a business consultant, Southwark Crown Court was told. His jail
sentence means he will not be able to make any further repayments, leaving
the pension fund severely depleted, the court heard.
Passing sentence, Judge Laurie said he had to balance the individual
interests of pension fund members against the public interest in ensuring
dishonest company directors who stole pension fund assets were properly
punished.
He had decided 'with a heavy heart' that the public interest was more
important in this case. Mr Smith had deceived trustees of the pension fund
'right, left and centre' when he removed assets in a failed attempt to prop
up the ailing company, the judge said.
Mr Smith started repaying the missing money soon after the collapse of the
Westbury-based company in December 1990. By the time of his conviction last
month he owed a further Pounds 1m. He had agreed to repay this at Pounds
30,000 a month.
Mr Cedric Clapp, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young and an independent trustee of
the Farr Group pension plan, had told the judge that a prison sentence would
effectively wipe out the prospects of Mr Smith making any further payments.
Of the 150 fund members, the 12 who have retired will have their benefits
paid in full, Mr Clapp said afterwards.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Retaliatory measures expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress is expected to press ahead next year with legislation
authorising retaliatory trade measures in the financial services sector,
even if the immediate need for the bill as a negotiating weapon in the Gatt
talks has gone by then.
The Treasury had hoped the progress of the 'Fair Trade in Financial
Services' bill through Congress would increase their leverage to persuade
countries such as Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brazil
to improve their offers to increase access to their financial markets as the
Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations draws to a close. The bill would allow
the Treasury to restrict the expansion of banks and securities companies
from countries which do not offer equal access to American businesses.
Treasury officials say they made some headway in recent visits to some of
these countries, but are wary of predicting the outcome of the talks on
financial services, which remains, from the US perspective, one of the
biggest stumbling blocks to an overall Gatt agreement.
Although the Senate banking committee's attempt to agree on the bill's
language was held up by an unrelated dispute on legislation to allow US
banks to open branches outside their home states, in the House of
Representatives the subcommittee on international development, finance and
trade completed work on a draft.
The House has in the past been the most difficult obstacle to passage of
similar retaliatory legislation, largely because of differences of opinion
between the banking, energy and commerce and ways and means committees.
Congressional aides expect, however, that this time these divergences will
be smoothed out, enabling the bill to pass early next year.
These aides say that whether or not the Gatt talks are completed by the US
deadline of December 15, the legislation will be needed.
In the event of a successful Gatt deal, it would be required to enforce the
two-tier approach US negotiators want to apply in the financial services
area, discriminating against 'free riders' which have not opened their
markets.
Other aides caution, however, that the language of the bill, which has been
carefully wrought to exclude the European Union from any retaliation threat,
is so closely tied to the Gatt talks that it would need to be completely
reworked in the event of a breakdown, or if the US fails to win the
exemption it is seeking in the financial services sector from the obligation
to apply the most favoured nation principle.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brittan hopeful on Blair House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's chief trade negotiator, raised hopes
yesterday that the US would agree to revisions in the Blair House farm
accord to unblock progress toward an agreement in the Gatt world trade
talks.
After two days of meetings in Washington with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, Sir Leon said the US and Europe were discussing differences
over agriculture 'in a positive manner'. He declined to go into detail.
Top trade negotiators from the US and EU will resume their Gatt talks in
Brussels next Wednesday after their meeting in Washington this week 'defined
the issues' and 'discussed viable alternatives'.
Although little concrete progress was evident after Tuesday's meeting, Sir
Leon said the simple fact that his US counterpart was travelling to Europe
next week indicated that the talks were still alive. 'He's a busy man and
wouldn't come if there wasn't something worthwhile to discuss,' Sir Leon
said in Paris.
France has threatened to veto a Gatt deal unless it obtains satisfaction
through changes in the 1992 Blair House agreement.
An EU official portrayed the high-level talks in Washington positively, but
emphasised that 'considerable obstacles remain' ahead of the mutually agreed
December 15 deadline for a deal among the 111 governments that are party to
the talks.
For his part, Sir Leon had made clear that the EU would insist on specific
demands being met in the area of agriculture, the audiovisual industry and
aeronautics - a reference to US objections to European subsidies for Airbus
Industrie. He repeated the message in a brief meeting at the White House
with President Bill Clinton.
The Brussels official said both sides had instructed their senior
negotiators in Geneva to seek a preliminary agreement on all dossiers in
time for Mr Kantor's next visit to Brussels, probably on December 1. That
would let a draft EU-US agreement be submitted to a meeting of European
foreign ministers on December 2.
'Sir Leon made clear that it (Gatt) should not be a last-minute deal,' the
official said. The Washington talks covered all main sectors, including a
broad market access package, the creation of a Multilateral Trade
Organisation to replace Gatt, and agriculture.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Negotiators down in the dumps over US
draft - Washington set to take on the world in clash over anti-dumping
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
America's Thanksgiving gift to trade negotiators in Geneva is expected to be
an unwelcome set of proposals to reform rules disciplining international
dumping.
A clash over anti-dumping rules has long been anticipated by negotiators in
the Uruguay round of talks on global trade liberalisation. Five separate
texts have been presented in six years, and all have been rejected. The
draft imposed at the end of 1991 was an arbitrated text, never agreed.
At the heart of the conflict has been a fundamental difference between the
US - as a principal user of dumping laws and a fierce defender of its
national prerogatives in this area - and the rest of the world, which at one
time or another has felt victimised by what is seen as arbitrary use of
unfair rules which lead with near-certainty to the conclusion that dumping
has occurred.
But in the calm before the storm that is expected to erupt when the US list
of amendments lands on desks across Geneva, officials recognise that
something will have to be done to accommodate US concerns that the present
text unreasonably weakens its power to act: 'I pray it will be the minimum,'
one said.
From January this year, the US flagged its intention to challenge the
existing draft text, in the teeth of near-universal opposition from the
other 114 countries negotiating the Uruguay round.
'The danger is great,' one negotiator said. 'The US appears quite prepared
to pull the plug on this issue. This would pull down the agreement we have
on subsidies, which in turn would pull down our agreement on farm trade. The
pack of cards would collapse.'
Most countries see the growing use of anti-dumping laws - duties and fines
against imports that are alleged to be sold at prices below those charged in
a domestic market - as creeping protectionism.
As customs barriers have fallen over the past decades, so dumping actions
appear to have become the protectionist's weapon of first resort.
According to a recent World Bank study, average tariffs in the US
manufactured goods sector would be 23 per cent today, compared with a
nominal level of less than 6 per cent, if they were adjusted to account for
the impact of dumping duties on imported steel, textiles and cars - the
industries most affected.
As the number of dumping actions initiated has risen steeply since 1988, so
an increasing number of countries have introduced their own anti-dumping
laws - and have proven willing to use them. India and Japan initiated
actions in 1992 for the first time.
Developing countries, which until 1985 had never initiated dumping action,
have initiated around 40 a year for the past three years. Significantly, the
US was the target of 20 dumping actions in the year to June 1993 -
overtaking Japan (the target of just 13 actions), which is so often seen by
the US as a leading 'dumper'.
In January this year, Mrs Carla Hills, the outgoing US trade representative,
asked the International Trade Commission to study the net impact of dumping
actions on US industry.
Her successor, Mr Mickey Kantor, has since reversed the request, but not
without prompting questions on whether the higher import costs arising from
dumping duties damage the competitivenes of US companies.
This has not prevented supporters of domestic anti-dumping policy from
mounting a fierce defence of the existing regime, and an effective campaign
pressing the US administration to lengthen its list of proposed changes to
the intended Uruguay Round agreement.
In the House Ways and Means committee three weeks ago, Mr Eric Garfinkel, a
leading Bush administration negotiator on the Uruguay round anti-dumping
text, attacked the draft as 'highly political', and 'not a balanced or
well-reasoned document'.
He detailed the need for various amendments, which seem likely to appear in
the list presented to negotiators today. These include:
Scope and standard of review: the US fears the draft will allow Gatt panels
to revisit the facts presented in a domestic dumping inquiry, rather than
examine whether laws had been fairly applied.
Circumvention: the US says the draft will allow offending countries to
side-step dumping duties by shifting production to other countries. It wants
the power to put duties on 'like goods' being exported to the US from third
countries without fresh investigation.
Sunset: the proposed draft says a dumping duty will expire after five years
unless a review shows dumping is still occurring. The US objects to the need
for fresh proof of dumping. Over 30 of the 268 dumping duties currently in
effect in the US have been in place for more than 20 years.
Start-up: particularly relevent to high-technology industries, the US
objects to rules which would allow companies to charge prices that are below
true production cost during the start-up period before full economies of
scale have been achieved. It wants the length of start-up to be defined
De minimis: the Uruguay round draft would block dumping inquiries if the
effective dumping margin were less than 2 per cent, or if the volume of
dumped product - and injury to domestic competitors - is 'negligible',
defined as less than 1 per cent of the domestic market.
Standing: only governments are entitled to bring a dispute to Gatt under the
present draft. The US wants non-government bodies to be able to bring
actions - notably trade unions or environmental groups.
The list of proposed amendments was promised for last Wednesday. Successive
postponements have frustrated other negotiators, and added to the prickly
array of outstanding issues that must be resolved by December 15 if a
Uruguay round package is to be completed successfully.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: French PM frustrated in farm talks -  'We
got nothing we wanted in Washington' - Balladur

<TEXT>
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday told a meeting of more than
400 of his conservative government's backbench MPs that 'we have obtained
nothing. . . of what we have asked' from this week's Washington talks on
Gatt.
He spoke after his trade minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, was briefed on the
outcome of the Washington talks by Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's Gatt
negotiator, who on his return from the US yesterday stopped over at Paris
airport.
Taking a robust line in front of his parliamentary majority, Mr Balladur
said he would not respond to American calls that he should show 'leadership'
in the Gatt talks if that meant abandoning French national interests. The
prime minister's pessimism was echoed yesterday by the French Foreign
Ministry which said, that 'at this stage, there is no sign of progress' on
the main Gatt issues dividing the US and the European Union.
Equally, however, there was no suggestion from Paris that accommodation with
the US on Gatt was doomed. Mr Longuet noted that Sir Leon had left some of
his officials behind in Washington to continue talks, and that France's
concern was to stay in permanent contact with the negotiators.
In the end-game under way in the Uruguay Round, France is increasingly
frustrated at not being able to play a direct part on such issues as
agriculture and audiovisual broadcasting, where it has taken a particularly
tough line. Officials say they are confident Sir Leon will advise them and
other EU governments on the state of play, but complained that Mr Longuet
did not get this from the European commissioner yesterday.
In view of the December 15 deadline which France now implicitly accepts, Mr
Balladur said yesterday he would want to know 'the state of things in the
first days of December' so he could consult his ministers, his coalition and
European partners. Gatt will top the agenda at next week's Franco-German
summit in Bonn, which will precede a EU foreign ministers' meeting.

FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan to offer rice compromise
</HEADLINE>

Japan is likely to present its official proposal to open its rice markets
after the US and the EU manage to reach an accord on agriculture on the
Uruguay Round.
A senior Japanese government official told Japanese reporters yesterday:
'Japan is involved in negotiations to prepare a plan it deems acceptable.'
Until now, the government has been reluctant to reveal that it was under
talks over the lifting of its rice ban.
Japan is likely to put forward officially a compromise plan under which it
will accept rice imports of 4 to 8 per cent of its domestic consumption for
six years, and reach a decision over tarification of its rice market in
1999.
The government wants to appease domestic opposition to opening the rice
market by leaving a decision up in the air, and it is unclear whether such a
proposal would be acceptable to its trade partners.

Germany and Britain are concerned that failure to meet the December 15
deadline for the Uruguay Round of international trade talks will let the US
distance itself further from Europe, diplomats said yesterday. Speaking on
the eve of the annual Anglo-German summit, which will take place in Bonn,
officials said the collapse of the Uruguay Round, whose deadline is December
15, would be 'catastrophic'.
'Germany and Britain are so dependent on exports. It would be very damaging
if there was no agreement,' a British official said. But a senior German
official went further in highlighting what it would mean for Europe as a
whole.
'The case of Nafta, and the talks in Seattle with Asian countries last week,
was the first time in which Europe was not involved. This is a signal.
Despite what is said in public to the media, the US and Canada are focusing
on Asia, and shifting away from Europe.'
The official added that while the Uruguay Round will be 'very much top on
the agenda' in the one-day summit between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany
and Mr John Major, British prime minister, parallel talks between trade,
defence and foreign ministers will focus on social, bilateral and security
issues. These include:
Ways to tackle unemployment in the European Union. British officials implied
the Delors white paper on reducing unemployment was 'too Keynesian', adding
that they would prefer to seek more emphasis on training, flexibility and
innovation;
Steel subsidies. German officials are angry about Britain's continuing
opposition to proposed federal subsidies for Ekostahl, eastern Germany's
largest steel mill on the grounds that the modernisation of the mill will
contribute to over-capacity in the steel sector. Security, particularly ways
in which to bring the countries of eastern Europe - and Russia - closer to
Nato. German officials yesterday said there is still disagreement in Bonn
about how to define, let alone extend security guarantees to eastern Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government is to reform the federal labour law in an effort to
increase worker productivity.
The new law would scrap the seniority clause that restricts the ability of
some companies to promote workers. It would also speed resolution of
disputes between management and unions by replacing the current labour
conciliation and arbitration panel with more streamlined tribunals.
The president has also sent Congress new laws to allow foreigners to operate
trucks and buses in Mexico, and would permit foreign investment in maritime
transport. The law also extends the maximum concession for private toll
roads to 50 years.
'What we are seeing are the internal changes that are necessary to compete
under the North American Free Trade Agreement,' says Mr Mario Dehesa, an
economist with Grupo Financiero Serfin. 'We cannot compete with our hands
tied behind our backs.'
The labour reform proposals are likely to be sent to Congress by December
15.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Washington life takes its toll of Clinton's team: Two aides
who will be staying home after Thanksgiving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thanksgiving is the ultimate American holiday because far more than any
other, including Christmas, it reunites families. The Wednesday before and
the Sunday after it are the year's busiest travel days. For 96 hours, the
country pretty much shuts down.
Even the hyperactive President Bill Clinton and his family are ensconced for
today's holiday in Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains he is said not to like very much. Before leaving he
shared the traditional turkey at a Washington church hall providing free
dinners for those without homes or families to go to.
There is a particular poignancy at this Thanksgiving for Mr Clinton and
those who sweat loyally for him. For he has just lost two senior members of
his team - Mr Howard Paster, White House head of congressional liaison, and
Mr Roy Neel, deputy chief of the White House staff - who have declared that
they want to spend more time with their families than one turkey dinner
might allow.
It might seem odd that they should go after the great Nafta triumph for
which both, with Mr Paster particularly visible, worked so hard. But for
once this classic political excuse may be valid and no one in Washington, an
eternally suspicious town, was seriously questioning it this week.
Mr Paster put it best. 'There are no recesses or weekends. The beeper and
the phone respect no private time. And we have added a new standard of
intensity.' For those with children and, as in his case, a spouse with her
own career, balancing the priorities of life can get skewed, as the suicide
of Vincent Foster, Mr Clinton's old friend and legal counsel, horribly
demonstrated this summer.
Mr Clinton, like President Jimmy Carter before him, has publicly urged his
staff to take more time off, but he takes little himself - 10 days on Cape
Cod this summer and regular games of golf notwithstanding - and nor does his
highly professional wife, Hillary. They both reckon they have a lot to do
and not much time to do it in.
Similar motivation inspires the White House staff, many very young and more
than willing, given the chance of a lifetime, to put in the seven-day weeks,
15-hour days, that have become routine. Most of their favourite bars and
cafes are those that stay open very late and their attendance at private
dinner parties around town can never be guaranteed.
Mr Paster and Mr Neel, both Washington veterans, knew what they were letting
themselves in for and ultimately got out, without apparent regrets. Yet they
will be replaced by people of comparable experience, like Mr Harold Ickes,
the experienced New York operator whose own political lineage includes a
father who was FDR's interior secretary.

FT  25 NOV 93 / US factory orders up in October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of a sharp rise in factory orders yesterday provided further
confirmation that the pace of US economic growth is accelerating.
The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose 2 per cent
last month and 8.7 per cent in the year to October. This was broadly in line
with analysts' projections and followed reports of a big rise in the
Purchasing Managers' Index.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, noted that orders rose in eight out of 10
leading industrial sectors, indicating the recovery in manufacturing was
broadly based. Increases in orders for capital goods indicated the economy's
productive capacity was rising in line with higher consumer demand.
The rise in orders occurred in spite of an 11.6 per cent fall in defence
orders last month, reflecting continuing budget retrenchment at the
Pentagon.
Much of the strength in the civilian economy was concentrated in the
volatile transport sector, where orders rose 5.5 per cent between September
and October. Aircraft orders rose an erratic 48 per cent.
However, excluding both defence and transport, orders rose a respectable 2
per cent last month - a sign that recent falls in long-term interest rates
have increased demand for durable goods.
Orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft - seen as a guide
to civilian investment trends - rose 1.5 per cent in October, the eighth
increase in nine months.
Many forecasters are predicting growth at an annual rate of 4 per cent or
higher in the current quarter. But the growth rate is widely expected to
moderate early next year because consumer spending has run ahead of personal
incomes.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Clinton meets Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Salman Rushdie, the British author, yesterday met President Bill Clinton
in what the White House described as a clear expression of US support for
'someone who has been the victim of a government-legitimised death threat',
Jurek Martin writes from Washington.
The meeting, according to US officials, was at the request of Mr Rushdie,
who is under a 'fatwah' issued by the late Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran over
his book The Satanic Verses - considered blasphemous by Islamic
fundamentalists. Afterwards Mr Rushdie said he was 'touched and impressed by
his (Mr Clinton's) expressions of support and friendship.'
The White House said he spent about 10 minutes with the president, after
longer conversations with Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and
Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser.
US policy under Mr Clinton has been increasingly critical of the regime in
Tehran, not least because of its alleged sponsorship of terrorism.
Reuter adds: The State Department, in advice issued through the US embassy
in Wellington, New Zealand, has warned US citizens abroad to be on the alert
for 'terrorist or mob action' following President Clinton's meeting with Mr
Rushdie.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Senate passes handgun bill as Republicans yield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Republican Party's filibuster against gun control broke down yesterday
afternoon and the US Senate promptly passed the Brady bill, requiring a
five-day waiting period before purchasers can take possession of handguns.
The tortuous saga ended, as such congressional disputes often do, in a
compromise. In return for getting a simple voice vote on the bill, the
Democrat leadership allowed for additional consideration in the session
starting in January of Republican modifications to it.
Nevertheless the Senate action does mean that, with both houses now
concurring, the measure can be sent to the White House for President Bill
Clinton's signature. The Republican intention next year is to reduce the
five-year life of the bill to four years, with the government retaining the
option of renewal for an additional year.
In effect Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, bowed to growing public
heat for some kind of action on gun control in the face of the frightening
escalation in violent crime. Senator George Mitchell, his Democratic
counterpart, had threatened to call the Senate back into session next week
if the filibuster were not broken. Most senators have already left town for
the recess.
Passage of the bill constitutes a notable victory after seven long years for
Mr James Brady, the White House press secretary severely wounded and left
partly paralysed in the attempt on President Ronald Reagan's life in 1981.
It also represents a rare defeat for the National Rifle Association, the
leading lobby against gun control.
However the limited nature of the bill, requiring that purchasers pass
background checks before taking possession of their weapons, does not mean
that the NRA has been stripped of its underpinnings. Further initiatives can
be expected next year from the administration and others, providing a more
serious test of the willingness of Congress to tackle the whole issue.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Manley leads Cuba talks for C&amp;W: Castro regime relaxing
stance on investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Manley, the former Jamaican prime minister, has been recruited by
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, to lead negotiations with
the Cuban government about possible C&amp;W involvement in modernising Cuba's
telephone network.
The talks signal a further relaxation by the Castro regime in its attitude
to foreign investment. Earlier this year it went some way towards legalising
use of the dollar in Cuba, and has promised further currency liberalisation.
The Cuban government is believed to be talking to at least two other
telecommunications operators besides C&amp;W, including Telefonica, the Spanish
state operator which has significant interests in Latin America. No US
telecoms company appears to be involved.
C&amp;W, whose interests centre on the UK and past and present UK dependencies,
operates in 18 territories across the Caribbean region. It owns 80 per cent
of Telecommunications of Jamaica, and has significant operations in
Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago.
Mr Manley, who resigned his premiership in March 1992, said he had already
visited Cuba on C&amp;W's behalf and had met President Fidel Castro and other
leading government officials. He said he told them that C&amp;W had invested
heavily in Jamaica to improve the island's telecommunications, concentrating
on building networks in rural areas.
Mr John Carrington, C&amp;W's Caribbean director, said talks were at a 'very
preliminary' stage, but the company was 'very keen' to operate in Cuba if it
could be arranged without offending US sensibilities.
Cuba's state telecommunications company already has a joint venture with a
private Mexican company to operate a cellular mobile network. However, the
antiquated fixed-line network is a state monopoly, offering lines to only a
tiny fraction of the 11m population.
In July the US State Department relaxed restrictions on telecommunications
companies seeking to provide phone links to Cuba, letting Cuba receive half
of future telephone revenues for international calls.
Demand for telephone links among the Cuban exile community in the US is
high. Even before the limited AT&amp;T microwave link with Cuba was destroyed by
a hurricane last year, AT&amp;T was able to connect only around 500,000 calls
out of 60m attempted each year.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Brazilian finance minister set to quit race for presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, has signalled his
withdrawal as a possible candidate in next year's presidential elections by
promising to remain as a minister instead.
Finance ministry officials say Mr Cardoso has written to President Itamar
Franco saying he will not run in presidential, senatorial or gubernatorial
elections next October.
Technically, Mr Cardoso could change his mind before April 2, the deadline
for candidates to announce they will run. But analysts said such a reversal
would be politically damaging and provide an easy target for opponents.
Mr Cardoso's term as a senator runs out next year and he had been widely
seen as a presidential hopeful. As a former academic and foreign minister,
he has strong support from foreign investors. However, his intellectualism
was seen as a barrier to winning popular support. In opinion polls released
at the weekend Mr Cardoso had only 7 per cent support.
His withdrawal from the presidential race should improve the now slight
chances of a successful economic reform package being approved before the
elections. The government needs congressional support for its 1994 budget,
due to be announced later this week, and other structural changes aimed at
tackling inflation of close to 2,000 per cent a year. But some important
political groups had been opposed to the measures because they feared a
successful economic reform would boost Mr Cardoso's election chances.
Mr Cardoso's letter suggests he needs more time to implement the reform
measures, which involve spending cuts and are therefore likely to be
difficult to implement in an election year.
According to the polls, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing
Workers Party (PT) is the presidential favourite with 31 per cent, while his
nearest probable rival is the right-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, Mr Paulo Maluf,
with 12 per cent. However, analysts said these ratings could change
considerably over the next 11 months.

The panels are heavily influenced by the government, which can generally
resolve high profile labour disputes as it wishes.
The proposed reforms to the labour law will be sent to Congress before
December 15, a senior government official said. They were welcomed by
Mexico's business community, which sees the complicated and detailed
regulations as an obstacle to productivity. Labour unions are believed to be
opposed to some of the changes.

FT  25 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (3):
Banking enjoys a shake-up - The balance is shifting from the public to the
private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 26th November 1993) appended to this article.
Few Turkish industries have welcomed the government's commitment to Europe
quite as readily as the banks. A new decree, passed with the effect of law
in September, brought Turkey into line with its European competitors in a
number of important areas and marked a further deepening of the financial
sector.
The confidence is readily apparent. On the Istanbul stock exchange the banks
listed are among the most profitable and heavily traded stocks. For the
first time a Turkish bank has floated shares internationally, with Garanti
Bankasi selling Dollars 103m worth of stock through an American Depositary
Receipt in November.
With growing frequency, the private sector banks are able to tap
international debt markets. A whole host of banks have successfully ventured
into the markets including Korfez, Turkey's most profitable bank, which
raised Dollars 25m in a one-year loan arranged by Bank of New York. In
November Akbank, Turkey's largest family-owned bank, was due to conclude its
first-ever foreign syndication - a Dollars 100m one-year borrowing. Mr Erol
Sabanci, the bank's chief executive, said that at point 85 over London Inter
Bank Offered Rate, the deal underscored Akbank's standing as the best rated
bank in Turkey.
The Turkish banking industry is still dominated by the state with the five
state banks accounting for close to half the total assets, which at the end
of 1992 were around Dollars 67bn. The largest private sector banks are run
by family holdings, including Sabanci's Akbank, Cukurova's Yapi Kredi,
Pamukbank and Interbank or the Dogus Holding's Garanti.
But the new law should help shift the balance in favour of the private
sector. For the state banks, like others, are being forced to improve their
capital ratios. With the government reluctant to inject new capital into the
state banks, the only way to meet the targets is to run down their equity
participations and reduce their loan book.
Troubled banks can be forced into liquidation, where before they were
absorbed by a state bank. 'It's a long overdue signal that depositors will
have to take the risk of a bank into account,' says Mr Ibrahim Betil of
Expresbank.
In the case of a failed state bank, the government will continue to step in.
Last year, the government announced that Tobank, the teachers' bank, was to
be merged with the Halk Bankasi and Denizcilik Bankasi, the maritime bank,
was merged with Emlak, the state housing bank.
The wholesale privatisation of the big state banks, such as Ziraat and
Emlak, may be some way off. Ziraat is more like an arm of the treasury,
dispensing credits to farmers and using its extensive branch network to pay
civil servants and other government employees in rural areas.
But on a smaller scale, the banking operations of Sumerbank, the textile
manufacturing and general retailing outfit, have been offered for sale.
Similar moves have been made to allow for the disposal of the banking side
of Etibank, the minerals concern.
A more promising prospect is the government's planned sale of its 12 per
cent stake in Turkiye Is Bankasi, the country's largest commercial bank.
The shake-up in the state sector is mirrored by a rapid restructuring among
private banks. Banks are closing branches and laying off staff while
enhancing electronic banking. In less than a decade, Turkey has moved from a
relative lack of sophistication to become a modern industry. But for most
Turks, the plastic card is not so much an instrument of credit as a way to
obtain cash.
Most transactions are still done on a cash basis. The main thrust for
introducing automatic teller machines (ATMs) was 'to keep the customers out
of the bank,' says Mr Akin Ongor of Garanti. His bank is leading the way in
computerisation, with all 201 Garanti branches now using real time clearing
systems.
The development of electronic banking has also forced banks to improve their
credit supervision. 'Today you can go to 10 different banks and get a card
from each one and no one will know,' says Mr Ongor. The foreign card
companies like Visa are said to be concerned by the growing number of
defaults.
In parallel with these moves, many banks are boosting their consumer lending
business, still a fairly small share of most banks' asset books. Garanti
says consumer credit currently accounts for around 4 per cent of its total
loans - corporate loans making up the lion's share. But as interest margins
on corporate lending have narrowed, banks are turning to consumer loans.
Garanti says it intends to increase its operations. Consumer credit is
particularly attractive for the banks with links with big corporations,
which can then offer customers hire purchase financing. Koc, the largest
holding company, is boosting its banking services, in part to take advantage
of the booming car sales and sales of consumer durables, two sectors where
it has a dominant position. Akbank is developing its consumer credit
facilities to finance Toyota's joint venture with its parent, Sabanci
Holding.
In 1992 the government liberalised the rules on the issue of asset-backed
securities. The securitisation of various debt instruments such as car and
housing loans has been a popular practice in recent months, providing banks
with a cheaper source of funds. By shifting the risk of default to new
investors, it also reduces the onerous capital adequacy requirements set
under the new law.
But the broader economic impact is potentially more dangerous. 'The banks
have now been given an incentive to lend to customers for consumption,' says
a foreign economist.
In a related issue, in October a number of banks applied to the Capital
Markets Board to be allowed to issue commercial paper. Again, like
securitised loans, this is seen as a cheap funding for banks as it would not
incur liquidity requirements set by the central bank.
However, under the current rules only investment banks, which are restricted
from taking deposits, municipalities, corporations and state enterprises are
allowed to issue commercial paper. No decision has been made to allow banks
to issue commercial paper. Nonetheless, the issue has thrown into relief the
tension between the need to deepen the financial markets and the perhaps
more pressing concern of the banking authorities to keep a hold on money
supply.
Currently for every 100 lira put on time deposit with a bank, on average 46
lira has to be held as reserve or liquidity requirements - in effect, it is
a tax on the banking system.
Call deposits are a slightly cheaper way to raise funds. As a result, the
intermediation costs - the spread between deposits and credits - keep
interest rates high. Another result is that rates between different banks
can vary as much as 15 per cent. 'Nowhere in the world are interest rates
quite as free as in Turkey,' says Mr Erol Sabanci, disapprovingly.
Inflation continues to make it difficult to assess bank performance. IBCA,
the London-based rating agency, estimates that most major banks in Turkey
saw a negative return on equity in 1992.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, has pledged to reduce banks costs in a
bid to bring down interest rates. However, there is little possibility of
that while the government deficit continues to grow.
The sector has other more urgent problems. The banking authorities are
watching closely the foreign exchange exposure of many private sector banks
as they seek to fund their lira business by borrowing offshore. Given high
real interest rates offered in lira deposits, the attractions of borrowing
offshore are enormous. Garanti estimates that currently 27 per cent of its
profits result from trading on its short positions.
Garanti was the most profitable of the large privately owned banks in 1992.
The bank, however, remains cautious. 'We have a policy that the open
position should not exceed the equity of the bank,' says Mr Aclan Acar, a
director. 'That means the shareholders take the risk, not the depositors.
We've suggested to the central bank that they should make this rule
applicable to all banks.'
But the danger, particularly with the government indicating that it favours
a more rapid depreciation of the lira, is that it could result in a massive
one-way currency flow as banks seek to close on their foreign exchange
positions.
CORRECTION
Equity capitalisation on the Istanbul Stock Exchange is currently estimated
at just under Dollars 30bn. The figure given in an article in the Financial
Times survey on Turkish finance and industry, published on November 25, was
incorrect.

FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Dutch paper group falls to Fl 9m
loss in third term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The continued weakness of European economies pushed KNP BT, the Dutch paper
and packaging group, into a net loss of Fl 9m (Dollars 4.7m) before
extraordinary items in the third quarter of 1993, compared with a net profit
of Fl 7m the previous year.
The figures took results for the first nine months to a net loss before
extraordinaries of Fl 25m, compared with a net profit of Fl 168m the year
before.
KNP BT, which was formed from a three-way domestic merger in the Netherlands
earlier this year, has already said that it plans to take a Fl 300m charge
in 1993 to cover a restructuring.
The company said that market conditions were similar to those of the first
two quarters. The paper sector continued to suffer from overcapacity and
price pressure, while the graphic systems sector was still feeling the
effects of reduced demand in southern Europe.
However, the company said that there were some signs of a hesitant
improvement in business conditions.
The figures, which were slightly better than analysts had forecast, were
released after the close of trading in Amsterdam.
Last week, the company's shares fell after a Belgian newspaper said that KNP
BT's single biggest shareholder, Macmillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based
forest products group, wanted to sell its 16 per cent stake.
Macmillan Bloedel said yesterday that it would sell its stake 'when the
price is right'. Mr Glen Ferguson, Macmillan Bloedel's vice-president and
treasurer, said the sale of the KNP stake would depend mainly on market
value and 'it may be quite a way down the road'.
In September, the Canadian company took up its share of a KNP BT rights
offer, for CDollars 55m (USDollars 41.5m) to maintain its 16 per cent stake.

The Treasury is moving its Savings Bonds Division into the Bureau of Public
Debt and is eliminating several political appointments from the US Mint, Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday, AP-DJ adds.
The restructuring steps are aimed at cutting bureaucracy and improving
customer service, Mr Bentsen said in a press release.
'In both cases, we looked at the environment we're operating in and we said
it's time to change. What made sense a long time ago doesn't make sense
now.'
Incorporating the Savings Bonds division into the Bureau of Public Debt will
help improve the marketing strategy for bonds, he said.

A senior Russian air transport official yesterday urged the government to

break-up, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Mr Valery Kosyanenko, deputy chief of the transport ministry's aviation
department, said that 160 airlines had emerged from Aeroflot, once the
monopoly airline of the former Soviet Union, and that 161 new ones had been
set up from scratch.
Almost every town with an airport in Russia has its own airline. Mr
Kosyanenko suggested one solution would be to create holding companies
consolidating several 'airlines' and airports.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Fears grow of Russian energy shortages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The supply of energy to industry and homes in Russia over the winter is at
risk - under the twin pressures of cuts in the budget and threatened
mineworkers strikes.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister and acting head of the
government in the absence on holiday of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
has warned of shortages by early next year unless billions of roubles are
provided to energy producing industries. At a government meeting yesterday,
Mr Soskovets lambasted the Ministry of Finance for 'behaving like an
ostrich' in the provision of credits to the industry and said it had
provided only half of a planned Rbs610bn to the energy sector.
Mr Soskovets said that Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, should be
made personally responsible for the supply of finance to the energy sector.
Temperatures plunging to -20 per cent below zero throughout Russia have
hugely increased energy consumption, while supplies have been cut in some
areas down to 30 per cent of normal levels, according to Mr Soskovets.
Mutual debts of enterprises in, or heavily dependent on, the energy sector
are put at Rbs 8,000bn - a situation which is causing progressive paralysis,
particularly in the coal sector.
The flashpoint is the Vorkuta coalfield, where miners have threatened an
all-out strike from December 1 if they do not get back payments for the last
three months. A report in the daily Izvestiya said Rbs100bn had been set
aside for pay arrears - on the eve of a planned visit to Vorkuta tomorrow by
Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and leader of Russia's Choice
political group.
The Fuel and Energy Ministry said yesterday 'an explosive socio-economic
situation has developed in the coal regions' and said miners were due
Rbs400bn in back pay.
The miners have been the main industrial support for President Boris Yeltsin
and reformers in the government. Their 1991 strikes fatally weakened the
tottering Soviet government, and strikes in 1989 signalled the first
widescale dissatisfaction with the policies of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, then
Soviet president.
In an interview with Izvestiya, Mr Yuri Malyshev, head of the Rusugol coal
enterprise, said a plan to shut 42 of Russia 236 pits which had run out of
viable reserves would be put into effect between now and the end of the
century.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Euro Disney loses a sixth of its stock market value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group desperately trying to negotiate a
financial rescue, lost a sixth of its stock market value yesterday.
In heavy trading, its shares closed FFr6.20 lower at FFr27.20 in Paris and
fell 62p to 318p in London. The decline may complicate efforts by the
company to restructure financially.
In Paris, the shares slid after heavy selling from convertible preference
holders. More than 4.14m Euro Disney shares, or 2.4 per cent of its equity,
had changed hands by the end of the day. The Paris stock market authorities
were forced three times to suspend the shares when the price breached the
official trading limit.
Ms Rebecca Winnington- Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in
London, said: 'It's pure panic. Investors are now very, very nervous about
this company.'
Yesterday's decline followed steady selling since Euro Disney, which is
burdened by heavy debt, disclosed an unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn
(Dollars 900m) for the year to September 30.
The latest fall in the share price, which peaked at FFr160 in April 1992 and
was FFr43.70 before the announcement of last year's loss, comes at a
sensitive time.
Euro Disney, with Walt Disney, the US group that owns 49 per cent of its
equity, began negotiations last week over the restructuring with the 60
international banks that own its FFr20.3bn net debt. Further share falls may
limit the scope to raise capital through a rights issue. The Disney camp is
believed to hope to reduce Euro Disney's net debt to FFr10bn.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Volvo shareholder deals blow to plan for Renault merger:
Intensive effort fails to dispel widespread Swedish doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo's struggle to win approval for the planned merger of its car and truck
operations with France's Renault suffered a serious blow yesterday when the
first institutional shareholder to declare a final position said it would
vote against the deal.
Although the so-called Fifth Fund state pension fund holds only 1.3 per cent
of Volvo's voting capital, its rejection indicated that an intensive effort
mounted by Volvo to overcome objections by significant Swedish shareholders
had failed to dispel widespread doubts about the merger proposal.
The outcome of a shareholder vote on December 7, already rescheduled from
early this month, may now swing on a decision expected today from another
state pension group, the Fourth Fund. It is Volvo's second largest
shareholder after Renault, holding 7.5 per cent of the voting capital to the
French group's 10 per cent.
The board of the Fourth Fund includes senior representatives from industry
and the trade unions, including both supporters of Volvo and merger
sceptics. If the Fourth Fund rejects the deal, the prospect of Volvo winning
majority shareholder support will be sharply diminished.
Mr Bert Ekstrom, chief executive of the Fifth Fund, said the fund rejected
the merger because of uncertainties over the values implied in the
agreement, which proposes a 35 per cent share for Volvo in the merged
company.
He said the fund, governed by trade union, local government and state
industry representatives, was also sceptical about French commitments to
privatise Renault, despite written assurances from Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French prime minister, that his government intended to complete
privatisation by the end of next year.
Volvo this week secured Mr Balladur's assurances, contained in a letter to
Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, and a promise that a golden share
the state intends to keep in the merged company will not be used to dilute
Volvo's 35 per cent holding.
These two issues have been the focus of criticism by Volvo shareholder
institutions. However shareholders have also expressed dissatisfaction with
the lack of detail published on the valuation of the respective Volvo and
Renault assets in the merged company.
In an interview with the FT on Tuesday, Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault
chairman, warned that a rejection of the planned merger would damage
existing co-operation between Volvo and Renault.
'The momentum would disappear' said Mr Schweitzer. He added that the
disruption to the merger process in recent weeks had already slowed and
destabilised efforts to build a joint management organisation.
Mr Schweitzer went on to stress the industrial logic of the proposed merger.
The cost savings which would result through joint purchasing, research and
development and economies of scale would strengthen the two companies' car
and truck operations.
He also pointed out that European car markets showed signs of bottoming out,
he forecast a modest recovery in demand from mid-1994. He said he was
confident that Renault would remain profitable despite the protracted
downturn in car and truck markets.

Volkswagen, the German motor group, is expected to finalise revised

Skoda said it would visit Volkswagen headquarters in Germany within the next
few days to finalise the package. A public announcement was expected soon
after the completion of the plan.
VW said in September it would restructure its financial package for Skoda,
after abruptly cancelling an Dollars 870m loan. Volkswagen took a 31 per
cent share in Skoda when the Czech carmaker was privatised in 1991. VW said
then it planned up to DM9bn (Dollars 5.33bn) in capital expansion by the
turn of the century, while increasing its stake in Skoda to 70 per cent.

<TEXT>
The Portuguese government appears ready to decide in the next few weeks on
merging the country's three telecommunications operators into one, leading
to partial privatisation.
The sale, provisionally scheduled for some time between December next year
and May 1995, would increase to three the number of telecommunications
privatisations likely in Europe in the next 18 months. Denmark and the
Netherlands plan to float part of their state operators next year.
Portugal is likely to seek bids for a 'strategic partner' for the unified
company.
Its telecommunications are currently managed by Telefones de Lisboa e Porto
(TLP), which covers communications in Lisbon and Oporto, Telecom Portugal,
which handles calls in the rest of the country and connections with Europe,
and Marconi Compania Portuguesa de Radio, which deals with intercontinental
telecommunications. The state owns 100 per cent of the first two and 51 per
cent of the third.
As a prelude to the rationalisation, the government earlier this year formed
Comunicacoes Nacionais (CN), a holding company to manage the state's
interests in the three companies. CN will first merge TLP and Telecom and
then begin negotiations with the private shareholders of Marconi.
Initially, privatisation is expected to be limited to a stake of 30 per cent
or less. 'We will hope for as much national investment as possible,' said
one source, 'but we will not put up any barriers to international
participation in the privatisation operation.'
In a second stage, it is expected that up to 49 per cent will be privatised.
Although Portugal has barely 30 exchange lines per 100 people, financial
necessity is not believed to be a driving force. Officials claim that
Portugal's telecommunication companies will be 'fully capable' of generating
the Es150bn-Es200bn (Dollars 862m-Dollars 1.15bn) a year needed to bring the
Portuguese network up to the standard of those in the more advanced European
Union states.

Mr Abel Matutes, outgoing European commissioner for energy, said yesterday
he supported Norway's request for a protocol attachment to the country's EU
accession agreement that would clearly state Norway could continue to have
sovereign rights over its oil and gas reserves, should it become a member of
the Union.
Following two days of energy negotiations in Oslo with Mr Jens Stoltenberg,
Norway's industry and energy minister, Mr Matutes said he would recommend
Norway's request be approved by the European Council of Ministers.
Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer and one of its largest
suppliers, is concerned that a draft energy agreement, due to be adopted at
a meeting of EU energy ministers on December 10, would force it to
relinquish sovereignty over petroleum resources.
'On energy we have made a lot of progress and I have agreed to seek to add a
protocol to Norway's membership application which will recognise Norway's
full sovereign rights over (oil and gas) resources,' Mr Matutes said, adding
that he would recommend the protocol be accepted by Mr Hans Van den Broek,
EU commissioner in charge of accession negotiations.
One other leading issue discussed by the two energy officials included that
of Statoil's future role and status should Norway become an EU member and
the management by Statoil of the state's direct financial interests in oil
and gas licences.
'We discussed different models combining Norwegian interests in having
strong, effective control but at the same time taking care of equal
treatment of all oil companies,' Mr Stoltenberg said.
Norway fears that once the EU's energy directive is adapted, and it becomes
an EC member, it would have to change Statoil's structure and the way it is
currently managed.
Statoil is automatically given a certain percentage in all oil and gas
licences and the state also takes a direct shareholding, which Statoil
manages on its behalf. Usually the combined shareholding can reach 50 per
cent and often exceeds that amount.
Both men said important progress on energy issues had been made during their
talks, but that technical details needed to be agreed before these issues
could be resolved. 'We have discussed ways to find technical solutions to
political problems,' Mr Stoltenberg said.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Kiev faces sanctions in nuclear row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government may cut off gas supplies to Ukraine and impose other
economic sanctions to force it to destroy or return the nuclear weapons on
its territory to Russia.
Officials in the Russian capital say the pressure will be used 'reluctantly'
but add they are determined to use it if Ukraine does not carry out its
obligations to return the missiles. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign
minister, said at the weekend that Ukraine was becoming a 'new nuclear
power'.
Ukraine's parliament in Kiev ratified the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(Start I) treaty last week but, in doing so, proclaimed itself a nuclear
state and defined the treaty as applying to only about one-third of the
1,600 missiles it holds.
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said on Monday that 'Ukraine
wants to and will destroy its nuclear weapons'.
At the centre of the issue is Ukraine's demand for money from the west to
pay for the destruction of the nuclear stockpile.
The US has proposed Dollars 175m to assist, which Ukraine says is not
enough.
Mr Vladimir Kryzhanovsky, the Ukrainian ambassador to Moscow, said yesterday
that 'our requests for compensation cause nothing but surprise on Russia's
part' and said that the destruction or transfer of the weapons could 'not be
speeded up'.
Mr Anton Buteiko, the Ukrainian president's foreign policy adviser, said on
Monday that 'the status of Ukraine is unique. This is a new situation -
Ukraine is not a nuclear state but owns nuclear weapons.'
Ukraine is, however, highly vulnerable to Russian pressure.
The Ukrainians depend heavily on their neighbour for oil and gas supplies
and are already deeply in debt for their extensive energy needs.
An accord between Mr Kravchuk and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
on the handing over of nuclear weapons and of Ukraine's half of the Black
Sea Fleet to Russia reached earlier this year in the Crimea now seems to be
a dead letter.
This has prompted charges from Russia of bad faith on the part of Ukraine.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Gaidar urges more government protection for Russian industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, yesterday called on the
government to apply 'sensible protectionism' to the country's industrialists
and entrepreneurs.
Mr Gaidar who led the country's move towards a free market two years ago,
said that since prices had been liberalised and the economy opened to
imports, Russian companies' demands for protection against foreign
competition showed they had adjusted to market conditions.
He denied that he had changed his ultra-liberal views over the past two
years to win votes in next month's parliamentary elections. Protection for
business has been a popular theme in the election campaign.
'When we freed prices we needed imports because we did not even have any
domestic markets', he said yesterday. Russia's circumstances have changed.
Now, the government was happy to respond to pleas from its farmers for an
end to grain imports, and from other producers who now realised they had a
market to defend.
Import tariffs, which the government has steadily increased since opening up
the economy in January last year, were also a useful source of budget
revenues, he said: 'We believe that domestic markets should be protected and
we can use these tariffs to raise some additional revenues.'
He did not say which imports should be taxed, but added they should not be
punitive ones, simply fees to support domestic industry.
At the same time he vowed to resist demands to protect Russian monopoly
producers which had no domestic competition. Nor would he isolate the
Russian economy from world markets, he said, claiming that Russia's speedy
entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would help the country
stay its course as an open economy, with access to other markets.
In the past two years, Russian consumers have been flooded with western
advertising and goods ranging from chocolate to cars, while Russian
producers of similar, if lower quality, goods have been deep in crisis.
While many Russians have welcomed an increased choice of goods - that is
those who can afford them - many are offended by the impression that their
country is no longer a great industrial power.
The main parties competing with Russia's Choice, the electoral bloc headed
by Mr Gaidar, are promising increased support for national producers and
protection from western competition to give them time to adjust to market
conditions.
The day after Mr Gaidar met leading Russian bankers, President Boris Yeltsin
issued a decree limiting the activities of foreign banks in Russia.
Yesterday a new list of increased import tariffs was published.

FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome saw its share price fall 7 to 623p on
turnover of 4.2m, with securities house UBS active in two-way business.
UBS is a buyer of the shares, arguing that they are the cheapest in the
pharmaceuticals sector. However, dealers said it also took some sizeable
sell orders.
There was little fundamental impetus in the market to sell the shares, but
some analysts pointed to an article in the trade press on a rival to
Wellcome's anti-Aids treatment Retrovir.
News of the decision to launch an inquiry into the Net Book Agreement hit J.
Menzies hard, sending the shares down 13 to 559p. WH Smith 'A' recovered
from an initial fall, closing just 2 down at 457p. Pentos slipped 3 to 36p.
Dixons, ahead 3 1/2 at 270p, and MFI, up 3 at 140p, were said to be the main
rate cut beneficiaries.
Results from Allied-Lyons came in line with expectations and the shares
drifted away slightly to close 3 down at 568p. Brewing was again shown to be
tough, with the various participants locked in a struggle for market share.
Pressure on Allied may prove beneficial to Bass, up 2 at 471p, and Scottish
&amp; Newcastle, 3 easier at 469p.
Leisure analysts said the main beneficiary of the base rate cut appeared to
be First Leisure, the nightclub and tenpin bowling company. The stock
climbed 11 to 245p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing reiterating its buy
recommendation.
A sell note from Robert Fleming Securities, focusing on worries about BT's
ability to grow the dividend, saw the company's shares sharply underperform
the FT-SE 100 Index, closing 5 down at 457 1/2 p after above average
turnover of 8.1m. The partly-paid settled the same amount off at 205 1/2 p
on turnover of 6.9m.
Dealers said the market had absorbed bouts of selling pressure late on
Monday thought to have been triggered by suggestions of a bearish broker
note. Most of the selling in the market occurred early yesterday, they
added, as institutions took on board Fleming's views that BT's dividend
growth looks set to slow over the next three years and that from 1996/97
onwards the probability is that BT's dividend growth will be in low single
digits, around 2.5 per cent, with unchanged dividends in poor years.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, Fleming telecoms analyst, pointed out that the recent
dividend warning from Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, had caused a slight
reduction in market expectations for BT's dividend growth but warned clients
that 'we take it more seriously'.
Interim figures from Vodafone, the UK's leading cellular telecoms group,
were by no means in excess of general market expectations but were
accompanied by a half-point reduction in UK interest rates, a move which
transformed the rest of the UK equity market.
Vodafone shares fell back from on overnight 520p to touch 516p at the outset
of trading, before embarking on a strong upwards move after the rate cut and
the profits and dividend news. They ended 7 ahead at 527p.
Profits of Pounds 74.5m were at the high end of market expectations, while
the interim dividend of 4.12p, a rise of 20 per cent, was at the very top of
the range and was given a warm reception across the board.
The oil and gas sector was in much better shape yesterday as the market
responded to the cut in UK interest rates, which drove the market higher,
and hopes that the Opec meeting in Vienna, that commenced yesterday, will
see member states agree on a 0.5m barrels a day reduction in overall output
to the 24m b/d level.
An agreement on such a reduction is by no means clear cut, but has to be
done to stabilise oil prices, said one UK-based oil specialist, who added
that the cuts would be achieved 'in bits and pieces across the board'.
Shell Transport attracted keen support, closing 5 up at 686p, ahead of the
important presentation to UK oil analysts today. The company addressed US
oil analysts last Friday and will face a meeting of Dutch-based specialists
on December 2. British Petroleum rose 4 1/2 more to 343 1/2 p as fears of
the imminent sale of the Kuwait Investment Office's 9.9 per cent stake
continued to subside. Enterprise added 6 at 454p.
International conglomerate Hanson failed to benefit from yesterday's
interest rate cut, although the stock is often bought for its yield
attractions. The shares held at 277p.
Textiles conglomerate Bodycote International fell 23 to 256p, with dealers
saying that Smith New Court had cut its forecasts. Smith was unavailable for
comment but Kleinwort Benson Securities said it was also preparing to reduce
its earnings estimates.
Exhibitions organiser Blenheim dropped 19 to 323p on critical comment after
the group announced a management reshuffle on Monday.

A gloomy message from Northern Foods, accompanying otherwise acceptable
results, sent the shares scurrying downwards, although they rallied towards
the end of a turbulent session. They closed 4 off at 225p in busy trade of
2.7m.
Food manufacturing analysts said the cautious statement was in keeping with
a downbeat post-results meeting, in which the company said that tough price
pressures from the first half increased in the second. Downgrades quickly
followed, with the market range some 10 per cent lower at Pounds 155m to
Pounds 162m.

FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn fails to please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointment over the dividend payout at Thorn EMI sent the shares
tumbling and prompted a series of downgrades and some cautious
pronouncements from leisure sector analysts.
First-half results were at the lower end of market forecasts, although there
were some bright spots, particularly in the music division. However, the
impressive, albeit patchy, results were accompanied by an unchanged
dividend, prompting worries over the short term outlook for the stock. One
analyst commented: 'The company has sent a very confusing message to
investors - reasonable results and a disappointing dividend. People are
worried about the near term news flow.'
This includes official inquiries into compact disc prices in the UK and US,
potentially harmful legislation in the US over Thorn's rental business and
continuing losses at its unwanted defence business.
'Thorn is next year's story,' said Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court, who
cited flat full year earnings and the looming uncertainties as reasons for
marking the shares a hold. They closed a hefty 35 down at 914p, although
analysts pointed out that the stock had had a good run. Market forecasts for
the year came back to a range of Pounds 338m to Pounds 348m.

FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate cut catches traders
wrong-footed - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market was caught on the wrong foot yesterday morning by the 1/2
percentage point cut to 5.5 per cent in the Bank of England minimum lending
rate.
Share prices, which had opened lower in the face of a further setback on
Wall Street overnight, spent the rest of the session trading through a range
of 40 points on the FT-SE 100 Index, which ended the day not far from its
overnight level.
While the overall reception for the interest rate cut, which was swiftly
followed by the lending banks, stock market traders admitted to a 'very
difficult session.' Genuine retail investors often found problems in trying
to deal at wildly fluctuating share quotations as market makers traded
between equities and an equally exciteable stock index sector.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,069.3, down 1.3. The Index was
down to 3,050.6 ahead of the interest rate announcement, then soared to
3,090 before falling closing nervously after Wall Street made a poor start
to the new session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 3.8 up at 3,439.2,
reversing an early fall.
The uncertain response on the trading screens, which inspired a leap in Seaq
volume to 667.1m shares from Monday's 455.2m, contrasted with the more
positive reception accorded by market strategists to the base rate cut. On
Monday, retail business fell below Pounds 1bn, effectively for the first
daily session for several months.
While caught out by the timing of the move, which appeared to have been
prompted by trends in London money markets, analysts acclaimed the decision
both as a favourable indicator of Budget plans and as confirmation that
further reductions in base rates are likely.
'It indicates that London markets have decoupled from the New York Treasury
markets,' said Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. He sees UK interest rates
at 5 per cent by the year-end. At Kleinwort Benson Securities, Mr Trevor
Laugharne was equally positive, believing that although the next half point
cut might not come until early January, rates could be down to 4 per next
later next year.
By the close of trading, international stocks, including ICI, Glaxo and BAT
Industries were not far from overnight levels, but reacting with caution to
a Wall Street market then in the process of reversing its opening gain. Oil
stocks edged higher, however.
But the domestic, interest-related, stocks traded a more uncertain path.
Bank shares, which respond readily to base rate optimism because it lightens
their bad debt burdens, moved sharply before closing with mixed changes.
Store and retail issues tried to move ahead but failed to hold their best
levels.
The favourable attitudes from market analysts were slow to work through to
the equity trading desks, where dealers remained unsettled by the outlook
for both the Japanese and US stock markets. Throughout the session, UK
equities were led by the December contract on the Footsie, and the setback
suffered late in the afternoon came when the future fell to a discount.
Yesterday, London had to cope with the absence of a lead from Tokyo
overnight and the prospect of a New York market slowing down for the
Thanksgiving Day holiday.
Traders said there was a general unwillingness to take on stock positions in
the international blue chips which might prove difficult to unravel until
next week.

FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence that the Bank of England and UK chancellor caught London's markets
unawares when they announced a cut in base rates was provided by the
derivatives markets yesterday, writes Peter John.
The futures contract on the FT-SE 100, which expires on December 17, saw
exceptionally heavy turnover of more than 22,000 contracts as dealers raced
to adjust their books.
The rush to get back into the market via the futures saw a turnaround of
some 60 points between the high and low points of the day.
Worries that US investors were poised to repatriate funds had led to a
Europe-wide stock market slide. Dealers expected further weakness yesterday
and when the December future opened it traded down more than 20 points to
3,046.
When the half-point cut in base rates was announced, December futures turned
round to hit 3,104. Then, profit-taking in the afternoon saw the contract
tick back to 3,067 by the official close - exactly where it started in the
first place.
At that level it was at a discount to the cash market in contrast to the
estimated fair value premium of some 6 points. Although fair value premium
takes account of interest rates it will not change as it is calculated on
three-month money rather than actual base rates.
Options saw slightly reduced turnover of 47,700 lots, against 50,700 on
Monday, with hedge buying of FT-SE puts contributing heavily to turnover of
the Footsie options. Land Securities was the most actively traded stock
option (2,832 lots) folllowed by Thames Water (2,128).

Wall Street
Supported by a rally in the beleaguered bond market, most US share prices
ended the day slightly firmer, although secondary stocks bounced back
strongly from recent lows, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.92 better at 3,674.17. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 1.90 to 461.03, the American SE
composite was up 0.16 at 461.04 and the Nasdaq composite recouped 8.69 at
746.82. New York SE trading volume was 261.6m shares.
The stage was set for a positive opening on US stock markets when bond
prices rallied in early trading. The benchmark 30-year bond eventually rose
more than a point, and its yield dropped to 6.30 per cent. The bond market
rally was sparked by several factors, including news of a surprise interest
rate cut in the UK by the Bank of England.
Financial markets across the globe have been concerned about rising interest
rates, and the BoE's move helped to allay some of those concerns, if only
temporarily. With bonds rising and interest rates in Europe declining, US
equity investors were in more upbeat mood. Although there was some buying,
traders said that business was light, primarily because the markets were
already winding down ahead of the long Thanksgiving weekend holiday.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, dropped Dollars 3 to Dollars 65 1/8 on
news that the carrier's flight attendants had ended their strike after both
sides were pressured by President Clinton to seek a government-mediated
settlement.
Investors reacted badly to the news because they feared that the government
mediator would force American to dilute its package of cost-cutting measures
which analysts had hoped would put the carrier back on the road to long-term
profitability.
Other airline issues fell along with AMR, which was also hit by a ratings
downgrade from broking houses Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch. Delta weakened
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 1/2 , UAL Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 136 1/2 and
USAir Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 3/8 .
Paramount Communications fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 76 1/2 as investors
bet that Viacom, in spite of its lower offer, will defeat QVC Network in the
battle to take over the entertainment group. On the American Stock Exchange,
Viacom 'A' shares were up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 and the 'B' stock
Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 41 3/4 , while QVC was down Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 48 7/8 on the Nasdaq market.
News of the UK interest rate cut helped ADRs of British companies, notably
British Petroleum, which rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 in heavy
volume.
Leading Nasdaq technology stocks were mostly firmer. Intel added Dollars 1
3/8 at Dollars 58 7/8 , Microsoft Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 77 3/8 , Borland
International Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 16 5/8 and Apple Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 33.
Canada
Toronto put on a mixed performance in fairly active trading. The TSE 300
index rallied 15.1 to finish at 4,215.3, but declines led rises by 429 to
356 after volume of 61.7m shares valued at CDollars 709m. The pipelines
group rose 1.2 per cent.

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Divided picture from European chemicals
 -Shares have risen against a background of poor earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the performance of European chemicals stocks this year has
been impressive. Since the beginning of January, BASF's shares have risen 30
per cent, Bayer's 22 per cent and Hoechst's 12 per cent. In the Netherlands,
DSM is up 35 per cent. Akzo was up 42 per cent until it announced its merger
with Nobel, of Sweden, this month. Even Solvay, of Belgium, is 24 per cent
ahead.
But although all chemicals stocks have increased in value this year, most
have underperformed their respective local markets. Ms Jackie Ashurst,
chemicals analyst at James Capel, reckons it has been the third worst
performing sector in Europe this year. Hoechst has underperformed the market
by 17 per cent this year, for example. Nevertheless, the chemical sector's
underperformance has not been as great as it might have been, given its
present predicament.
The continuing rise of chemicals stocks sits oddly with the piteous state of
the European chemicals market. While share prices have risen, quarterly
results have been progressively more disappointing.
The outlook for next year remains grim. This week, Mr Jurgen Strube, BASF
chairman, said his group was likely to cut its dividend again this year and
he expected business to remain weak before turning up in 1995.
The reasons for the dire financial performance of Continental chemicals
groups are not hard to find. Commodity chemicals are having a rough time.
Weakening demand growth and overcapacity have hit prices and undermined
margins. Few petrochemicals makers, for example, are making money at the
moment.
At the same time, those companies with large pharmaceuticals divisions -
normally a good hedge against wickedly cyclical commodity chemicals - have
been hit by health care reform in most of Europe's largest countries.
The German market, Europe's largest, has registered a 10 per cent drop over
the first nine months of this year, while the Italian sector has suffered a
3 per cent fall.
Such was their decline that the European drugs market recorded no growth
during the nine months to September, probably the first time the sector has
ever gone ex-growth. Groups such as Hoechst and BASF have warned that their
dividends may have to be cut.
The apparently resilient stock market performance of the chemicals groups
has been driven partly by fund managers choosing to invest in countries
rather than sectors.
Given that the large chemicals groups are so liquid, investors in Germany
are likely to build their positions in BASF, Bayer and Hoechst, while those
wanting to put money into the Dutch or Belgian markets are likely to pick
DSM, Akzo or Solvay.
Fundamentals are also driving the sector. The US recovery, a strong US
dollar and falling interest rates have added to its attractions. The stocks'
yields also remain high compared with long-term bonds.
The possibility of improved earnings in the medium term is also holding up
share prices. At every industry conference and every results meeting,
chemicals groups have been warning about the need for restructuring. This is
not new. But there seems to be a greater sense of urgency than for many
years.
This week, Enichem, the Italian state-owned group, announced 10,000 job
losses over the next four years. Earlier this month, BASF announced 3,000
job cuts by the end of 1995. Plant closures are also in the pipeline, aimed
at reducing costs as well as capacity. Any improvement in companies'
cost-base should fall through to the bottom line, and any cut in capacity
should help prices.
Even though corporate results are likely to make grim reading over the next
12 months, the downside to the chemicals market is likely to be limited,
says Ms Ashurst. The dangers of missing out on a pre-recovery rally of
chemicals stocks are simply too great.

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Interest rate outlook
takes its toll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over the potential effect of higher US interest rates on the
liquidity in Pacific Rim markets remained a dominant theme in the region.
Tokyo was closed for a holiday yesterday.
HONG KONG recorded a sixth consecutive loss amid concern over the direction
of US rates. The Hang Seng index fell 134.62 or 1.47 per cent to 9,036.02,
having been 247 points lower earlier in the day. The market has fallen by
8.0 per cent since its peak of 8,825.50 points established on Monday last
week.
HSBC fell 50 cents to HKDollars 85.00, Henderson Land lost HKDollars 1.75 to
HKDollars 33.00 and Jardine Matheson dipped HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars
67.50.
China-linked shares were also weak. Shanghai Petrochemical fell 12.5 cents
to HKDollars 2.50 while China Overseas shed 17.5 cents to HKDollars 2.20 and
Maanshan Iron was down 7.5 cents to HKDollars 3.90.
SEOUL tumbled on across-the-board profit-taking with demand for
export-oriented issues failing to halt the retreat. The composite index lost
16.68 to 817.90 with 403 of the 755 losing stocks going limit down.
However, analysts noted that underlying market sentiment remained positive,
reinforced by optimism over the prospects of economic recovery with
provisional Bank of Korea figures showed third quarter GNP grew a higher
than expected 6.5 per cent from 3.3 per cent a year earlier.
AUSTRALIA fell steeply on arbitrage in the futures market which drove the
December contract down to a discount. The All Ordinaries index lost 39.7 to
2,009.6 in turnover of ADollars 436.6m.
Among the fallers News Corp lost 31 cents to ADollars 9.52, its lowest close
since late August. BHP shed 16 cents to ADollars 16.90, Coles Myer lost 12
cents to ADollars 5.12, and Western Mining dropped 21 cents to ADollars
5.50.
SINGAPORE was dragged lower by profit-taking and the Straits Times
Industrials index lost 20.03 to 2,076.69 in relatively thin volume of
177.43m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR fell over a broad front leaving the composite index, which
breached the psychological 1,000-point level on Monday, down 22.52 or 2.3
per cent, at 966.88.
Losers included the utility giants Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia
which fell 30 and 80 cents respectively to MDollars 15.60 and MDollars 18.50
ringgit. They both account for around 40 percent of the composite index's
weighting.
But Lien Hoe rose 26 cents to MDollars 3.80 on takeover rumours in heavy
volume of 12.6m shares.
MANILA saw further profit-taking leave the composite index down 29.33 points
at 2,388.80. Turnover was to 1.95bn pesos.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone lost 15 pesos to 1,790 pesos and
Philippine National Bank shed 10 pesos to 435.
TAIWAN resisted the trend elsewhere in the region but the mood remained
cautious ahead of Saturday's local government elections. The weighted index
closed 17.81 higher at 4,234.75 in turnover of TDollars 22.6bn.
The electronics sector continued to attract buyers, with Acer finishing up
40 cents at TDollars 32.10.
NEW ZEALAND was broadly lower, while Air New Zealand went against the trend
on data showing a rise in October tourist figures, rising 3 cents to
NZDollars 2.97. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 28.53 to 2,044.80 in turnover
of some NZDollars 54m.
JAKARTA rebounded slightly in late trading but still finished lower overall
following falls in blue chip stocks. The composite index fell 13.15 to
523.314.
Barito Pacific Timber, the wood processor and Jakarta's largest stock, ended
down Rp900 to Rp12,700 reflecting a sharp fall in plywood prices since
August.
BANGKOK recovered slightly in afternoon trading helped by strength in banks.
The SET index ended down 4.89 at 1,305.24, after a day's low of 1,271.70, in
turnover of Bt12.25bn.

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Poland gives priority to public offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's new centre left government will be giving 'top priority' to public
share offerings to boost the development of the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE),
writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Mr Marek Borowski, deputy premier in charge of the economy, told a
conference on 'How to become a publicly quoted company' that the 22
companies quoted on the WSE had better results than state-owned or private
companies.
The high turn-out at the conference reflects growing domestic interest in
share offers as a way of raising capital in the wake of a continuing
10-month boom on the WSE. This has lifted share prices eight-fold,
capitalising the market at around Dollars 1.8bn. WSE regulators estimate
that one-third of the trading is done by foreigners, who own 20 per cent of
the shares. The WIG indicator rose 5.2 per cent yesterday to 8,680.

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan falls 2.7 per cent
despite late recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of separate issues coloured trading yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MILAN was again under pressure early in the session as the lira fell to an
all-time low against the D-mark, but the mood subsequently improved after
the head of the Democratic Party of the Left reassured investors that
turmoil in the financial markets was unjustified after the weekend local
elections.
The Comit index finished 14.12 or 2.7 per cent lower at 512.44, reflecing an
improvement from the day's lowest levels after Mr Achille Occhetto pledged
to back the government until the budget had been approved. Investors were
heartened that he also stressed the importance of protecting savings,
pushing through privatisations and keeping up the battle against inflation.
Earlier in London, Mr Oliver Kamm and Mr William Cowan of James Capel
commented that the equity market had been discounting investor concerns
about political instability over the past few weeks and in the short term,
investors might focus on the risk to the pace of administrative reform and
fiscal consolidation posed by the decline of the centre parties.
However, the macroeconomic and corporate earnings outlook for 1994 appeared
favourable, while the support gained by the parties of the far left and far
right was unlikely to be replicated in elections for a national government,
they said.
The telecommunications stocks were again marked down. Sip fell L56 to L2961
in volume of 27.7m shares and Stet was L9 lower at L3,419 in volume of 14m
shares.
FRANKFURT saw a day of contrasts with the DAX index moving between a high of
2,041 and a low of 2,015, before settling off 2.59 at 2,027.41.
Some analysts commented that the market was now waiting for inflation data,
due out either today or tomorrow before deciding its next direction.
Mannesmann, which is due to release nine month data today, was down DM1.70
at DM359.00.
Wella went against the trend, rising DM7 to DM835, after it reported a 5 per
cent gain in pre-tax profits for the year to September.
PARIS was upset by the profits warning from Elf Aquitaine and the shares of
the oil group fell FFr15.80 or 3.5 per cent to FFr416.70.
The CAC-40 index lost 11.14 to 2,071.47, after a high of 2,094 and a low of
2,059, on the last day of the account.
The oil group, which is slated for privatisation next year, said that it
expected 1993 profits to fall to around FFr1bn after FFr6.2bn in 1992.
Its Elf Sanofi division went in the opposite direction, rising FFr3 to
FFr928, in spite of also reducing its estimates for the full year.
AMSTERDAM remained interested in KLM, the shares rising 30 cents to Fl
37.50, following the collapse of the Alcazar talks and news that the airline
would continue to search for ways of reducing costs.
The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.1 to 133.5, after a high of 134.3 and a low
of 132.1.
KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, was 20 cents higher at Fl 40.50 ahead
of today's results.
ZURICH edged higher, taking its lead from firmer Nestle and Roche shares,
and the SMI index added 5.6 to 2,702.1.
Nestle, SFr13 higher at SFr1,170, topped the active list ahead of its autumn
news conference today. Alusuisse, with a presentation to analysts this
morning, was SFr7 easier at SFr522.
Roche rose SFr40 to SFr5,930 in active trade, recouping some of Monday's
SFr140 slide. BBC closed SFr7 lower at SFr1,017 after ABB Asea Brown Boveri
said it expected 1993 profits after financial items at the same level as in
1992.
Holderbank eased SFr1 to SFr820 as it sold 200,000 shares to Union Bank,
which announced a warrant bond on Holderbank shares with an exercise price
of SFr823.
STOCKHOLM was lower in nervous trade amid concern over higher debt market
yields and a weaker crown. The Affarsvarlden index fell 11.3 to 1326.1. in
turnover of SKr1.98bn.
Asea did better than the overall bourse, its B share falling SKr3 to SKr549
on its nine-month results which proved in line with expectations.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Lira dives, pound firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe once again captured the currency market's limelight, with the Italian
lira plunging to a new historical low against the D-Mark while sterling
rallied on the Bank of England's surprise rate cut, writes Conner
Middelmann.
Early in the day, the Bank of England surprised markets by announcing that
it was setting its minimum lending rate at 5.5 per cent, signalling a
half-point cut in British base lending rates from 6.0 per cent. While the
size of the reduction had been largely discounted, the timing came as a
surprise, with most expecting a rate cut along with or just after the
November 30 Budget.
After the announcement, sterling jumped to a high of DM2.5285 on relief that
the cut did not exceed the widely discounted 50 basis points and on hopes
that the move would help boost the country's economic recovery. Sterling
closed at DM2.5275, up from DM2.5125 on Tuesday.
Few traders expect another reduction around Budget Day, especially since the
Treasury press release accompanying the move stated that the cut had taken
full account of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's budgetary measures.
However, many market participants still expect another  1/2 percentage point
base rate cut in the next few months in view of encouraging inflation
developments and sterling strength following continental European easing.
'Continental European interest rates have substantially further to fall than
rates here, and that will continue to lend support to sterling,' said Mr
Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank in London. He is calling for
another half-point cut in the base rate in December or early January, and
expects sterling to trade in a DM2.50 to DM2.55 range over the next few
weeks, 'with a bias to the upside'.
The short sterling December futures contract rose 0.04 point to 94.60.
The Italian lira put on a dramatic performance, slumping to a new record low
against the D-Mark on heavy selling at the opening and clawing back some of
its losses during the afternoon session.
It hit a low of L1,005 early in the day but recovered in the course of the
session on short-covering to finish at L994.5, down from Monday's close of
L987.7.
Sunday's municipal elections, where the ruling Christian Democratic party
suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of right and left-wing parties,
fuelled investor fears over the passage of Italy's 1994 budget and the
political outlook ahead of next year's national elections. That prompted a
rash of foreign selling, sending bonds, stocks and the currency into a
downward spiral.
But some observers said the sell-off has been overdone and should be used as
a buying opportunity.
'The markets have lost sight of the structural improvements in the economy,
and with Italian assets now cheap, positions should be established in
anticipation of outperformance in coming months,' said Mr Keith Edmonds,
chief analyst at IBJ International.
Around L1,000, the currency is 'clearly undervalued', he added. Mr Edmonds
expects the currency to recover on the back of economic growth against the
background of recession-bound Europe and said further gains are likely as
investors adjust to the new political groupings.
The D-Mark remained relatively well supported by tightness in the money
market and Monday's higher than expected M3 money supply numbers which
dampened some traders' hopes for near-term German rate cuts.
In the domestic money market, the rate for overnight interbank funds firmed
further as monthly tax outflows continued to drain liquidity and banks'
reserves at the Bundesbank dropped again. Some traders also pointed out that
continued buying of D-Marks by the Bank of France to shore up its foreign
currency reserves was keeping the German money market tight.
By midday, the call rate had firmed to around 6.45 per cent, up from
Monday's 6.40 per cent, although the Bundesbank rolled over the Paragraph 17
funds that it had injected on Monday.
The funds - government monies on deposit with the Bundesbank that it can
lend to the market to ease liquidity bottlenecks - were offered at a rate of
6.40 per cent, and traders estimated some DM8bn to DM10bn of the funds to be
in the system.
Dealers hope that today's allocation of 14-day securities repurchase
agreements at a fixed 6.25 per cent will alleviate the shortage, though they
caution that large liquidity inflows next week - including public sector
salaries bloated by Christmas bonus payments - may mean the Bundesbank will
err on the tight side, preferring to rely on Paragraph 17 injections where
necessary.
Meanwhile, the dollar drifted lower, testing the downside of its recent
range against the D-Mark. Trade is expected to remain thin and erratic ahead
of tomorrow's Thanksgiving holiday, with most US traders expected to leave
their offices around Wednesday's European close. The dollar closed at

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (7): Important group / Profile
of Mondragon Co-operative movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD

<TEXT>
There can be little stronger evidence of the spirit of co-operation which
infuses Basque industry and finance than the manufacturing groups of the
Mondragon Co-operative Corporation.
The MCC has its roots in the work of Father Jose Maria Arizmendiarrietta,
the Basque priest who inspired the development of the first of Mondragon's
co-operatives, Ulgor, in 1956.
Tucked away high in the mountains of the Guipuzcoa district, the MCC has
grown in the past 37 years from being a single manufacturer of white goods
into a leading diversified group employing a total of 25,322 people, with
total turnover in 1992 of almost Pta4bn.
The MCC, now the most important business group in the Basque Country and
ranking 15th in the whole of Spain, boasts some 90 separate companies,
according to Mr Javier Mongelos, president of the MCC's general council, its
governing body.
Of its three divisions - financial, industrial and distributive - the
industrial arm is by far the most important. Its manufacturing base includes
machine tools, automotive components, electronics, construction parts and
domestic appliances of all kinds.
In 1992 the industrial division achieved a turnover of more than Pta2bn,
25.5 per cent of which was in exports, an increase of just 1 per cent over
1991. Given that industrial output was down by 1.7 per cent in Spain
overall, and by 4.1 per cent in the Basque Country in 1992 against 1991 - as
a result of the international recession - that performance must be seen as
impressive.
In Spain overall, the machine tool sector saw a 20 per cent drop in
production in 1992, compared with 1991. Yet MCC machine tool exports
actually increased by 1.6 per cent in 1992, compared with a 14 per cent drop
in this export market for Spanish machine tool manufacturers generally.
But Mr Mongelos hopes that the recession may be passing its peak. He
believes 1993 may see the industrial division's exports grow by an average
of 15 per cent compared with 1992, while its production overall will be
about 3 per cent greater than in 1992. He thinks total turnover for the
whole corporation could reach Pta5bn for 1993.
Mr Mongelos says that the organisation has gone through a lengthy and
continuing process of 'reconstruction and elaboration of its future
strategy.'
Spain's EU membership has meant that the previously protected market for
much of the MCC's products has disappeared.
'The competition is no longer with other Spanish manufacturers but with
Siemens-Bosch, Electrolux and so on; companies which are perfectly capable
of operating in a global market,' says Mr Mongelos.
The immediate difficulty, not just for the MCC but for Spain in general,
according to Mr Mongelos, is one of catching up with the past.
'It's impossible for a country or an industry which was isolated for 50
years from international competition to adapt itself to complete world
competition in 6 1/2 years. This metamorphosis, done in such a short time,
has also not been accompanied by other transformations which are necessary
for a truly competitive environment.
'Of course, here in the Basque Country we have certain advantages,
particularly in the Mondragon Corporation, because the benefits or otherwise
of productivity go directly to the person who works; the owner of the
company is the same as the person who has to work there.'
In other words, the Mondragon enterprises have the advantage of flexibility,
of being able to change according to the needs and pressures of the markets,
without having to engage the massive bureaucracies of Spain's employment
laws and trades union opposition.
According to Mr Mongelos, the MCC's co-operative nature means that people
behave reasonably because they are all kept well informed about the ups and
downs of their own enterprise.
'We don't have strikes, for example. When there is a problem then a general
assembly is organised to sort it out.'
At the same time, unemployment within the MCC is almost non-existent.
Unemployment is defined as more than 100 hours a month without work - a
working month has 170 hours - and the unemployment figure within the
corporation is now about 200 people.
'The Basque Country is a poor country, without its own natural resources. We
have to import everything. It's also a country which traditionally has seen
a lot of emigration, to other parts of Spain and other countries. Life has
normally been very hard for the people who live here, and the only way they
could get out of that hardship has been to work. The co-operatives grew out
of this culture of poverty, of difficulty,' explains Mr Mongelos.
'The future for the corporation must be one of further adaptation to this
new world of international competition; one in which all the protective
measures which existed either have disappeared or are disappearing. One of
the implications of that is that the small and medium companies, which have
worked well here in the past, will not do so in the future in Europe. They
don't have the financial, or research and development capacities to compete.
'But it is also necessary to alter our customs, our management practices and
our attitudes - and that's a very complicated business,' adds Mr Mongelos.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (5): 'Complicated' recovery
forecast - The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economically speaking, what is good for Spain is better for the Basque
Country and the reverse is just as true. With the Spanish economy now
entering its second year of recession, the Basque economic indicators look
worse than they do elsewhere in the country.
The third-quarter 1993 report issued by Bilbao's business think tank, the
Circulo de Empresarios Vascos, sombrely notes that there is no sign of any
brakes to arrest the falling industrial demand and, much less, of recession
bottoming out. It concludes that recovery in the Basque Country will be
'more complicated' than in other areas of Spain.
The industrial activity index for the Basque Country in May, the latest
available statistic, fell by 4.7 per cent which was in line with the
negative growth recorded for the past two years and the year-on-year fall in
industrial activity stood at the end of that month at 10.1 per cent.
A breakdown of the Basque Country's recession data gives worrying
statistics. The steel sector, which accounts for 44 per cent of the area's
industrial activity, fell by 10.9 per cent in May to give a 12-month drop of
16.3 per cent. Bilbao's estuary, once the pulsating hub of heavy Spanish
industry, is now an industrial wasteland, arguably darker and more satanic
than anywhere in the developed world.
'Before people used to talk about profits and investments and now when you
get two businessmen together they will swap stories about how they are
reducing their payroll,' says Mr Jose Miguel de la Rica, chairman of the
Circulo think tank. Profits, when they exist at all, are uniformly down and
the investment is ploughed into paying off redundancies.
The labour shakeout is aimed principally at containing losses and not at
improving productivity. Companies are offering early retirement to those
aged 55 and they are sacking those under 30 who are mostly employed under
temporary contracts and are cheaper to dismiss.
Unemployment stood at 23.2 per cent of the Basque Country's active working
population in the second term of this year, according to the Madrid-based
Statistics Institute's labour survey. This figure, which gave a jobless
total for the area of 201,240, was marginally above the national average; it
was a shocking set of data for what was once, scarcely 20 years ago, a full
employment area.
The Basque Country's economy is the victim of deceptive successes in the
past when it used to draw cheap labour from the rest of Spain to transform
steel and to manufacture ships and capital goods for the protected Spanish
market. It caught pneumonia when it was blasted by the cold winds of
competition.
'We were stripped naked when we entered the European Community,' says Mr
Jose Maria Gorordo, a former mayor of Bilbao and now the chief executive of
the city's Chamber of Commerce. 'We would have been better off if we had
been left with our old clothes.'
The Basque Country's problem was that its old clothes, its obsolete heavy
industry built around the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya steel plant, was exactly
what Brussels had no use for.
Cut-backs imposed by Europe were exacerbated by domestic difficulties,
chiefly the over-valued peseta of the 1980s and the high interest rates that
kept the currency high. These factors, coupled to industrial disputes and
soaring wage rises, turned meaningful restructuring and diversification into
an endless obstacle course for the top Basque companies.
Small companies, the area's pride and joy, have scarcely fared better.
Specific sectors, such as car components, are flat and overall they face the
toughest competition possible. 'We are on the frontline of the south-east
Asia challenge,' Mr de la Rica observes with a shrug.
There are examples of the challenge being met. Employees of a local plant
that manufactures sewing machines and was being undercut by a Taiwan rival
were faced with the stark choice of earning less or producing more. They
chose to work a six-day week. A recurring positive theme in all
presentations of the local economy is that the Basques constitute one of the
most industrious labour forces around.
The second asset is the drive of its business community. When a 40-strong
team of Basque entrepreneurs went to Cuba recently one of them travelled
with pots of paint and a fistful of brushes which he personally used to
spruce up a hairpin-producing plant that he had opened a year earlier in
Havana.
'That's the mettle we are made of,' says Mr Marcos Vizcaya, an official of
the ruling PNV party who has known the hairpin manufacturer since childhood.
Such enterprise can, however, stumble over the absence of capitalisation.
Because of terrorism, as well as the often violent industrial relations
environment, foreign investment has mostly given the Basque Country a wide
berth and there has been an equivalent shortage of Spain-based funds.
As a result, capital raising has often to be done within the Basque
community and the Basque Country is fortunate to have in its midst
far-seeing venture backers in the local savings banks and in Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya which has an umbrella industrial holding, the IBV corporation, which
it shares with the electrical utility Iberdrola.
Despite the recession and the internal problems, the presence of such
financial resources means there are a number of brights lights pointing to
an economic future for the Basque Country.
CAF, a railway rolling stock manufacturer that has its main plant in
Beasain, broke even in 1991 after many years of losses and turned in net
profits of Pta1.5bn last year which it put aside for reserves. The company,
which is 25 per cent owned by the three Basque savings banks, currently has
an order book worth Pta77.7bn - 35 per cent of which has been earned outside
Spain.
A second clear example that all is far from lost in the Basque Country is
Gamesa, a Vitoria-based weapons producer that has branched out into new
materials, microelectronics and environmental engineering, now earns 50 per
cent of its revenues outside Spain and is one of the most successful
ventures backed by IBV.
Even in the steel industry, the foundation of the Basque Country's past
wealth, there are companies that have specialised intelligently, have begun
to export aggressively and are making money. The top trio in this
all-important sector are Aristrain which makes long products, Guivart which
produces steel bars, and Tubos Reunidos which manufactures seamless pipes.
It will nevertheless take a while yet before the once finely-tuned engine of
the Basque economy begins to climb into the higher gears.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (6): High-tech glimpse of the
future - Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD

<TEXT>
About eight miles outside Bilbao and just a stone's throw from the city's
airport lies the Zamudio technology park, occupying 320 acres of beautiful
countryside. 'But the technology park is not just a collection of nice
decorations, pretty furniture and pleasant fields,' says Mr Juan Martin, one
of the park's senior managers, 'Its soul is the 'software'; the quality of
the people who work here.'
In many respects, industry in the Basque Country is in a transitory phase,
with the Zamudio park and other high-tech developments indicating what the
future could be like; a shift from the old traditional metal-bashing
industries to electronics, bio-technology, and communications.
Zamudio's 37 companies are mostly small-scale, 25 of them employing fewer
than 20 people each. But there is every chance that from these acorns some
strong oaks will grow.
The reason for that confidence is the unique strain of proud Basque
self-identity which in commercial spheres becomes interfused with an
attitude of mutual co-operation.
The Basque Country's former predominance in industrial production within
Spain overall is vulnerable as a result of recession and overseas
competition. But it still accounts for 6.2 per cent of Spain's gross
domestic product and 10.7 per cent of Spanish exports, although the region
has just 5.4 per cent of the Spanish population.
Another factor which benefits Basque industry is the massive level of
government subsidy and services support. The creation of an office of
strategic investments in the Basque government in November 1992, with a
determination to generate more than 8,000 jobs through targeted investments
totalling Pta33bn, under the so-called Garapen Plan, is a clear indication
of Basque government determination to shelter local industry against the
worst excesses of international competition and recession.
That extends to stepping in where the banking system is reluctant or unable
to tread. SPRI (Sociedad para la Promocion y Reconversion Industrial, or the
society for industrial promotion and reconversion) is the Basque Country's
development agency, created in 1991 and 91.4 per cent owned by the Basque
government's economy ministry.
SPRI provides loans at 4 or 5 per cent interest - several points lower than
present bank rates in Spain - for up to 70 per cent of total investment.
According to the president of SPRI, Mr Jon Azua, industrial production fell
by 4.5 per cent in 1992 compared with 1991, with the loss of 20,000 jobs.
Production of industrial plant goods fell by 10.8 per cent.
SPRI's role is to try to staunch that kind of haemorrhage by providing a
plethora of action plans, investments, studies, subsidies and cheap loans in
an attempt to strengthen regional business and also attract foreign
companies to set up in the Basque Country. SPRI will provide up to Pta1.2m
per job created in subsidy to participating companies which guarantee the
creation of a minimum of 50 jobs and invest at least Pta500m of their own.
For companies which create between 50 and 500 jobs, with investments of
between Pta500m and Pta4bn, it will subsidise up to 40 per cent of the
investment.
SPRI can also arrange tax exemptions for up to 45 per cent of new
investments for existing companies and up to 100 per cent of corporation tax
for new companies for a period of 10 years. It will subsidise up to 58 per
cent of qualifying research and development programmes and up to 100 per
cent of training plans. And to encourage foreign investment, SPRI has set up
outposts in nine other nations, including the US and Japan.
But the spirit of mutual assistance does not stop with government support.
Elkargi, founded in 1980 and with 639 member companies in 1981, is now an
association of more than 6,000 Basque companies. Elkargi's main purpose is
to take financial risks which large commercial banks are unhappy with, by
acting as a guarantor of loans made by the banks to small and medium sized
companies.
From guaranteed loans of Pta633m in 1981, the association in 1992 provided
guarantees for Pta9.8bn, with a bad debt rate of 1.45 per cent of all
guarantees made.
What of the immediate future? For Mr Jose Urchegui, general secretary of
Adegi, the employers' association of the Gipuizcoa, with 1,600 member
companies representing 60,000 employees, the urgent need is to increase
within the Basque country's companies a sense of the importance of thinking
not just nationally but globally - and to ensure that tomorrow's employees
have received the best training possible.
To that end Adegi has been instrumental in a highly innovative
educational-training scheme called the Machine-Tool Institute, sited at
Elgoibar, some 55 kilometres from Bilbao. The institute - funded entirely by
local companies - takes school-leavers from throughout Spain and provides
them with a sophisticated apprenticeship in advanced machine-tool
technology, as well as language courses and business administration
training. It has some 400 students but by running courses of different
lengths it reckons on about 1,000 students - full time and day release -
passing through its doors each year.
The institute's core aim is to ensure that the students receive hands-on
training on the very latest equipment, thus maintaining the Basque Country's
traditional strengths in machine-tools. Fifty per cent of Spain's machine
tool production is exported, two-thirds of that to industrially developed
countries such as the US, France and Germany, according to Mr Alberto
Ortueta, general manager of the Spanish machine tool manufacturers'
association. 'We don't have much in the way of natural resources in the
Basque Country - we don't have minerals or mining. Our basic asset here is
the human being,' says Mr Urchegui.
'What we are doing here is to try to make sure that professional training is
not just a matter for the schoolroom but is also something which companies
occupy themselves with.
The Machine-Tool Institute is an experiment, the result of an agreement
between the business sector and the Basque government. There are companies
here which need particular types of trained staff yet cannot find them
amongst school-leavers.'

 -Politics

<TEXT>
The Basque Country needs restful political consensus and then a restorative
sense of common political purpose like an all-night reveller needs 12 hours
sleep and a strong pick-me-up. Unfortunately it has neither such balms.
Politics in the Basque Country are criss-crossed by demarcation lines that
have historically fractured the area's political framework and created a
plethora of tribal groupings. Superimposed on the classic division between
left and right is the confrontation between the nationalists and the
non-nationalists.
The nationalist camp itself is divided between those who support violence
and those who oppose it and the latter are themselves split between those
who settle for home-rule autonomy and those whose final aim is independence.
The area's two main political parties, the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV),
and Partido Socialista de Euskadi (PSE), the Basque subsidiary of prime
minister Felipe Gonzalez's ruling socialist party in Madrid, share just
under 50 per cent of the Basque vote between them and form a PNV-led
coalition government in which mutual suspicions abound.
Were the PNV and the PSE marriage partners, each would sue the other for
divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty for they could hardly be less
suited as a couple. The PNV is nationalist, sentimentally rural,
conservative and Roman Catholic; the PSE derides ethnic politics, prides
itself on its trade union origins in Bilbao's industrial belt and styles
itself as modern, progressive and emphatically secular.
Mr Ramon Jauregui, the Basque socialist leader, admits that 'a certain
amount of expectation' envelops the local political scene. When, in Madrid
recently, Mr Gonzalez opened talks with the main national opposition party,
the centre-right Partido Popular (PP), the PNV behaved as if it were a
scorned bride. Do the socialists think, asked the nationalist leader Mr
Xavier Arzallus, that the PNV is 'a concubine who can be trifled with?'
The PNV, which holds 10 portfolios in the 16-member Basque government
including that of chief executive, is to a great extent in a quandary of its
own making. It was invited by Mr Gonzalez to join the national government in
Madrid as a junior coalition partner after the general elections last June
left the prime minister short of an absolute majority. But it rejected the
invitation and now it appears to wish it had not done so.
Somewhere between the invitation and its rejection, the PNV seemed to have
peered over its nationalist shoulder and lost its nerve; the very idea of
propping up a Madrid government filled it with dread. It was fearful of
losing its nationalist credentials to the radical Herri Batasuna (HB), the
coalition which supports Eta and, more plausibly, of handing over votes to
Euska Alkartasuna (EA), a minority party lead by former, and more
uncompromisingly nationalist, PNV members.
The PNV's hesitancy had a lot to do with the staging of local Basque
elections which are due in October next year. Unlike the PSE, which appeals
basically to non-nationalists, Mr Arzallus' PNV has to contend with splinter
groups such as EA and with solid formations, such as HB - the third-biggest
political party in the Basque Country - that dispute the strictly
nationalist constituency.
Negotiations to join Mr Gonzalez's government broke down when the PNV tabled
a long agenda - the final list totalled 54 separate chapters - of home rule
prerogatives that it demanded be urgently transferred from the Madrid
administration to the Basque government. That was the price that the
nationalists set for co-operation with Madrid and Mr Gonzalez judged it far
too expensive.
Certain PNV home rule demands - which deal, for example, with jurisdiction
over vocational training - can be granted immediately, because the Basque
government already runs its own education department. Others, including
transfer to the Basque Country of responsibility for health and social
security and for unemployment benefits, involve costly and complex
administrative adjustments.
A third chapter of devolutionary demands that seek to establish local
control over airports and harbours in the Basque Country fall into a grey
area in which it is not constitutionally clear where the prerogatives of
Madrid end and those of the autonomous governments begin.
A final shot of self-rule ambitions came in the form of a demand for a
Basque central bank, a monetary institution that would supervise and
regulate the local financial sector and which would clearly undermine the
responsibilities of the Bank of Spain. The adamant opposition of the PSE to
this pretension has further soured the relationship between the coalition
partners.
In the delicate negotiating process that followed the June 6 general
elections and which led to the ultimate formation of a minority government
by Mr Gonzalez, the PNV played for high stakes and it lost. Now it is in the
uncomfortable position of being stuck with the socialists in the autonomous
Basque government and being unable to play any meaningful role in the
socialist-run central government.
for the mainstream Basque nationalists because the Catalan nationalists, who
are the PNV's clone party on the periphery of Spanish politics, proved
themselves infinitely better negotiators. The Catalans also rejected
overtures to join Mr Gonzalez's government but they have cunningly supported
the Madrid government's draft budget, influenced much of the blueprint's
proposals and, as a result, ensured fiscal benefits for their Catalonia
stamping ground.
The PNV's obduracy earns it a bad press in Madrid whereas the suave Catalan
practise of the art of the possible is hailed as statesmanlike. The problems
facing Mr Arzallus' PNV are not, however, at all easy.
The Basque Country's mainstream nationalists do not have the ascendancy in
their home base that their Catalan counterparts enjoy and, unlike Catalonia,
the Basque Country has a federal-type administration in which power is
shared between the Basque government and the county councils of the three
provinces that make up the Basque Autonomous Community.
Consensus politics has never been the PNV's strong point but its
brinkmanship tactics have failed and its options are now running out.
Concessions have to take the place of confrontations and the wintery
realities of economic recession should cool nationalist ardours and shelve
devolution agendas for the time being.
The likelihood is that elections next year to the 75-member Basque
parliament will once more return the PNV and the PSE as the main parties but
will again leave the two of them well short of a majority, thus forcing them
into a renewed coalition. What the Basque Country cannot risk is a
continuation of the present suspicion-fraught alliance.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (4): Problem has become an
internal issue - Eta political violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What sets the Basque Country apart from any other corner of the European
Union except Northern Ireland is that it has a terrorist problem.
Eta, an acronym for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, Basque fatherland and liberty,
has been shooting, bombing and kidnapping for the better part of 25 years
and is directly responsible for more than 800 deaths.
Political violence in the Basque Country is on a lesser scale than it is in
Northern Ireland and there are no troops patrolling the streets of Bilbao in
order to keep warring terrorists, as in Belfast, apart from each other.
Basque violence is not sectarian; moderate Basques, who constitute a large
political majority, find common cause with the security services against the
radicals and the gunmen.
The qualitative difference is, however, of little comfort to those who work
and invest in the Basque Country. Businessmen employ private security guards
as a matter of course and they live in dread of an extortion racket known as
the revolutionary tax.
Political violence has deterred investment and prompted plants to close and
transfer their business out of the Basque Country.
There are two main, and interconnected, points to be made about the violence
factor:
it is on the wane although it remains lethal and will continue to exist for
the foreseeable future;
it has become an internal Basque problem as opposed to one between Madrid
and the Basque Country.
'The situation is better than it used to be and the Basque government is
making an enormous effort to give the impression that this is all being
normalised,' says Mr Jose Miguel de la Rica, president of the the business
pressure group Circulo de Empresarios Vascos. 'But then you get a murder or
a kidnap and then everything goes to the devil.'
In June, seven military officers were killed by a car bomb in Madrid and in
October two Eta gunmen shot an air force general dead outside his Madrid
home. A sure sign of Eta's continued muscle came with the release last month
of a Basque businessman who had been kidnapped in July, following the
alleged payment of a Pta300m ransom.
The violence continues despite suggestions that the police are gaining the
upper hand. In recent months revolutionary tax rings have been broken up,
gunmen arrested and arms caches seized. Although Eta is regularly reported
to be out for the count - some 500 of its members, including more than a
dozen of the group's more notorious leaders, are in prison - it appears,
time and again, to pick itself off the canvas.
'The strategy is the right one but the process is long and slow,' says Mr
Ramon Jauregui, the Basque Country's socialist leader who has a long
experience of the terrorist issue. 'We have to be very careful in order to
maintain the initiative.'
The initiative was nearly lost in September when the deaths of two Eta
suspects while in police custody served to bring underlying tensions to the
surface and prompted wide-scale rioting.
Few fault the Madrid government, the local Basque government and the police
forces of the two administrations over the way they go about their business.
The strategy involves close co-operation between them and also with the
French government and its security services. France has been acting
energetically for some years now against refugee gunmen across the Spanish
border and the one-time Eta safe havens in south-west France had been
effectively neutralised.
The prison policy is an intelligent one. Under a new strategy, Eta members
have been transferred from two maximum security jails where the hardliners
ran highly regimented communes. Thery have been dispersed among more than 20
prisons where they share cells with common criminals.
The key consequence of the dispersal policy is that jailed terrorists who
have no stomach left for the fight and are relieved of the commune pressures
are able to apply for individual pardons. 'We can only afford to give such
amnesties drop by drop,' warns Mr Jauregui.
The main reassuring feature of the strategy is that a grassroots movement is
gathering force in the Basque Country that publicly rejects Eta's violence.
That Basques are now willing to stand up and be counted reflects the
groundswell of opinion that sees continued violence as futile as well as
profoundly damaging to the local economy.
This grassroots rejection was boosted by the long kidnap endured by Mr Julio
Iglesias Zamora, whose family-owned San Sebastian engineering company had
failed to pay the gunmen's revolutionary tax. Thousands of Basques wore blue
ribbons to show their support for Eta's victim and numerous well-attended
rallies were staged to demand his release.
The protest movement was quite unprecedented but it fell short of its
objectives: Mr Iglesias Zamora was released last month only after Eta had
extracted the ransom and the police failed dismally to trap the kidnappers.
Moderate Basques feel, however, that it was not in vain.
'A short while ago nobody talked out against Eta and now they do,' said an
official in the ruling Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV). One sign of changed
times is the manner that members of Herri Batasuna (HB), Eta's political
front organisation, have been forced to stop going to a restaurant they used
to patronise near their Bilbao headquarters.
At the height of the kidnap saga and of the blue ribbon movement, the
restaurant's management decided to stop serving the radicals after other
clients began to go elsewhere. In the tight world of Basque politics, where
everybody knows everybody else, the restaurant boycott was hailed as a
victory over the tyranny of violence and the story of HB stalwarts sending
out for sandwiches is gleefully retold.
In the final analysis, Basques seem to have woken up to the fact that Eta is
their problem and that its solution lies with them. It is no longer a side
show involving headstrong members of their community and the Madrid security
forces.
The lesson is sinking in that the endemic political violence is making the
burden of recession in the Basque Country much harder to bear. Eta's
revolutionary rhetoric is out of touch with the times and its
Freedom-for-the-Basque-Country platform is at odds with the area's now
well-consolidated home rule.
Throughout the Basque Country, Madrid-based security forces are being
withdrawn and their place taken by the Ertzaina, the police force that is
recruited, trained and paid for by the local Basque government.
Increasingly, it is the Ertzaina which is leading the baton charges to break
up pro-Eta rioters and which is claiming counter-terrorist breakthroughs,
particularly on Eta's extortion racket.
Mr Juan Maria Atutxa, the Basque government minister who is responsible for
security and the chief of the Ertzaina, has taken a tough line against the
radicals. This has made him the most popular politician for the majority of
the Basque population and also the target of an HB hate campaign.
Posters and graffiti that term Mr Atutxa 'traitor' have replaced those that
used to accuse Madrid's Interior minister of 'genocide'.
In itself this is a telling development that underlines how Eta violence has
become an internal Basque issue which the Basque government is determined to
address. Mr Atutxa, who is a member of the PNV, is as Basque as it is
possible to be - he was born in a rural hamlet, spoke Euskera, the Basque
language, from birth and has been an ardent nationalist all his life.
No less indicative of the new climate is the manner in which members of Mr
Atutxa's Ertzaina who are posted to strong pro-Eta areas, particularly in
San Sebastian's Guipuzcoa province, have been known to suffer the same
hostility and pressures that the Madrid-based Civil Guard used to endure:
their car tyres are punctured, their wives are refused service by
radical-minded shopkeepers and their children are abused in the local
schools.
The polarisation of Basque society over Eta is an uncomfortable step but it
is nonetheless one in the right direction. Eta will only be curbed when its
supporters realise that they are not taking on Spaniards and Madrid but
their own neighbours in their own backyard.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (2): EU membership takes toll -
The fishing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fishing is much more than an industry or pastime in the Basque Country. And
consuming fish is much more than a means of satisfying hunger.
For a Basque, catching a fish is more of a historical right, an assertion of
culture. To prepare and eat a fish is more the culinary equivalent of high
art than mere cooking.
But, as with many other aspects of Basque life, the impact of Spain's
membership of the European Union is being felt in this most traditional of
Basque activities. The region's fishing industry has been forced to curtail
its operations, as has the fishing industry in the rest of Spain. But for
the Basque Country, with unemployment levels officially approaching the 30
per cent mark, any contraction of such a traditional industry is bound to
have serious economic and social consequences.
Spaniards on average eat 43kg of fish annually; more than the citizens of
most other EU member states. In overall terms, the fishing industry has
historically diminished in its importance to the Basque Country's economy to
the point where it now contributes not more than 1 per cent of gross
domestic product.
'However, there are coastal areas where the population depends almost
entirely on fishing, populations where if fishing disappeared then so too
would the population,' says Mr Jose Ignacio Espell, deputy director of
fishing in the Basque regional government, based in Vitoria. 'They are
places where fishing contributes more than 25 per cent of the local GDP.'
The most immediately visible impact of the EU on the Basque Country's
fishing industry has been the reduction in the number of fishing vessels;
down from 748 in 1984 to about 560 now. Basque fishing boats represent about
3 per cent of the total Spanish fishing fleet. The diminution is a direct
result of EU-imposed quotas.
'In the 1970s, there were 200 fishing vessels from the port of Pasajes alone
that fished in EU waters. Today, there remain just 38. The cod fishing fleet
of Pasajes, which fishes in Canadian waters, had 100 ships. Now there are
24. So the EU decisions about quotas and shipping numbers were, for us, very
bad,' says Mr Espell.
Spain overall had 19,451 fishing vessels, the largest such fleet in the EU,
at the end of January 1992.
But besides the limits imposed on the number of vessels, the EU implemented
other restrictions too; on what types of fish the vessels could catch and on
where they might seek shoals of fish.
'They (Brussels) put us in a corset,' says Mr Espell. 'But at least we have
one good thing: fishermen - people who know how to fish] Basque fishermen
have managed to find jobs elsewhere, for example in the French fleets.'
Mr Espell is critical of the way in which the EU has handled his country's
fishing fleet, but at the same time he exudes the kind of Basque pragmatism
that has sustained the region through many difficult political and economic
times.
'I always say the same thing. We have been very pressured, with enormous
restrictions placed on us. I say that we do not ask for advantages, but nor
do we want to be discriminated against. And I think the EU has understood
that, because it now speaks of a single-speed European fishing policy.
'Right now there has been a two-speed policy: that of the other 10, and that
of the two, Spain and Portugal. From 1996 there will be a single-speed
policy, for all,' says Mr Espell.
From 1996 what Mr Espell describes as the EU's 'discrimination' against
Spain and Portugal will disappear, 'because once Norway enters the EU it
will be absurd for there to be three different fishing policies: a third one
for Norway.'
Despite his objections to EU policy so far, Mr Espell nevertheless believes
that it is far better to be inside the EU than outside, since non-EU members
will, he believes, progressively find their own fish exports more
discriminated against in the future.
The EU is re-writing the regulations for Spanish and Portuguese fishing, and
is due to produce a new policy for the two countries by January 1 1994 to be
implemented two years later.
According to Mr Espell, the new policy will 'mean that the two can fish on
the same basis as the other 10 EU members.'
But that will not mean growth in the Basque Country's fishing industry, or
that of Spain as a whole, thinks Mr Espell. 'At the moment the fishing
policy of the EU says that it is necessary to adapt the fleet to the fish
resources. We are all conscious of the need to do that, and so there is no
way we will increase the size of our fishing fleet. What it does mean,
however, is that we will be able to renovate our old fleets and improve
them, though not increase their size. We will just be able to fish on equal
terms with the rest of the EU.'
There still remains the problem of imports to the EU from non-EU members.
'This has done a great deal of damage to all the EU fleets, including ours,'
says Mr Espell. 'For me it represents a kind of social dumping. Under EU
regulations we must pay minimum salaries and guarantee other kinds of
benefits, but certain non-EU countries don't have those kinds of rules. That
allows them to sell their fish at a fifth of the price.
'I want to compete, but I cannot compete on that basis.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (1): Cross-roads opportunity -
The Basque Country is at a cross-roads politically, socially and
economically. It faces the challenge of recognising its own pluralism and of
diversifying its economy - and it has the opportunity to establish an
efficient dialogue with Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Basque Country has some of the worst slums and some of the most
unspoilt, richly forested valleys in western Europe. It embraces wholly
obsolete industrial plants and greenfield sites devoted to technological
innovation. It has been hit harder by recession than anywhere else in Spain
and yet it is the home of an energetic business community and the
headquarters of top national corporations.
Politically, the Basque Country suggests just as many contrasts and
contradictions as it does socially and economically. It is governed by a
coalition formed by two rival parties who have agreed on a joint programme.
The partnership is, nevertheless, an uneasy one and the political climate
swings from confrontation to consensus with extraordinary ease.
Broadly speaking, the Basques are wholly integrated because they are
legendary 'joiners'; they group together in a myriad institutions, from
sporting clubs to dining societies and associations of mushroom pickers. But
terrorist violence has cast a long shadow over Basque society and deeply
divides it.
Out of a population of just over 2m, some 500 members of the Basque
separatist organisation Eta are presently in prison. Probably twice as many
associates of the terrorist organisation live abroad, and the number of
Basques who over the years have been detained or jailed in connection with
terrorism must run into five figures.
Everybody in the Basque Country has first-hand knowledge of Eta; many live
in threat of its racketeering. While there is a fearful, silent majority,
increasing numbers are speaking out against the terrorists.
Many Basques support Eta's violent struggle for independence, however. Herri
Batasuna, (People's Unity), the radical coalition which backs the gunmen,
gained 174,000 votes in June's general elections; some 50,000 more than in
the 1989 poll, although its share of the total vote slipped from 17 per cent
to 15 per cent. Political stability in the Basque Country ultimately depends
on a negotiated solution to the Eta problem.
Politically, socially and economically the Basque Country is at a
cross-roads. Obsessively rooted in its Basque identity, an exclusive, ethnic
identity in its more extreme manifestations, and excessively dependent on
its steel-manufacturing sector, it now faces the challenge of recognising
its own pluralism and of diversifying its economy.
The deep love and respect for the Basque Country's special nature; for its
language, its culture and its traditions, which so many in the area share,
should not become a tribal battle call to arms that sets off one section of
the community against the other.
Blessed with excellent communications, the best cuisine in Spain and, in San
Sebastian, arguably the finest seaside resort city in Europe, the Basque
Country has much to gain from opening itself out to others, not least to
foreign tourists.
With its industrial tradition and its highly-skilled labour force, the area
has even more to gain from outside investment - investment that at the turn
of the century formed the core of the Basque Country's industrial muscle.
But there will be no meaningful foreign takers for the local opportunities
while the often irascible and sometimes violent Basque nationalist climate
persists.
The Basque Country's arrival at a cross-roads is timely in as much as Spain
itself, on the political and economic level, faces a watershed of its own.
The general elections last June left Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister,
short of an overall majority and his minority government has been forced to
seek alliances with nationalist parties, notably with the Basques.
The economic recession has, meanwhile, prompted the government into
overhauling the labour market rigidities that have in no small way
contributed to the decreasing competitiveness of Basque industry
The twin issues of a new political arrangement, involving a form of
cohabitation with the nationalists, and of deregulation, involving a loss of
trade union power, can - if they are properly addressed - help the Basque
Country a great deal as it seeks a sure route towards recovery.
Initial negotiations between the Basque Nationalist Party, which leads the
Basque government, and Mr Gonzalez's socialists in the Madrid central
government have not been encouraging. The Basques played too strong a hand
as they hurriedly sought to extract home rule prerogatives in return for
supporting Mr Gonzalez, and they were turned down.
Despite the early misunderstandings and the ill-tempered exchanges that
accompanied them, the talks have not been broken off. Mr Gonzalez is still
seeking a stable pact - ideally with nationalists, both Basque and Catalans,
in his cabinet - that will ensure the survival of his government.
There are, therefore, grounds to expect that home-rule wrinkles will be
ironed out, and with them the aggrieved and irritable rhetoric which has
traditionally characterised the mainstream Basque nationalists.
A spell as junior partners in a Madrid coalition government will certainly
help the Basque Nationalist Party to shake off its narrow localism. It
should also aid Spaniards to lose the suspicions they harbour about the
Basques as a whole as a consequence of Eta terrorism.
The planned overhaul of labour market rigidities by the Madrid government
meanwhile appears tailor-made for the Basque Country's recession-hit
industry. With its numerous small plants, employing up to 25 workers, the
Basque Country urgently needs flexible labour practices that allow for
functional mobility and labour force adjustments.
Current legislation, which applies to the Basque Country as it does
everywhere else in Spain, is weighted towards fixed employment and makes
dismissals costly. This legislation has been arguably the most important
factor in deterring investment, in raising unit labour costs and, in the
final analysis, fuelling the rise of joblessness in Spain.
Unemployment levels in the Basque Country are higher than the national
average.
The Basque government should also be able to use the lead given by Madrid
with its decision to impose wage restraint and, in particular, to freeze
public sector salaries next year in order to reduce the spiralling public
deficit.
In one of the least satisfactory aspects of autonomous governments in
action, civil servants in the Basque government, including teachers and
members of the Basque security forces, earn far higher salaries than do
their Madrid central administration counter-parts.
ELA-STV, the Basque trade union which wields strong power in the white
collar sector, is sticking out for exactly what the Basque economy does not
need: 6 per cent wage rises, more public sector jobs and shorter working
hours.
At present the Basque Country cannot afford the luxury of inflationary union
deals any more than it can waste time on the finer points of home rule
prerogatives.
It must take the route which establishes an efficient dialogue with Madrid.
That will help restore competitiveness to its economy and in so doing solve
the tension-ridden contradictions of its community.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Full in-tray greets Norwegian
minister - The challenging questions facing Jens Stoltenberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jens Stoltenberg, 34, Norway's new oil industry minister, faces a busy
opening period in his four-year term of office. Oil companies have no less
than 25 field development plans on the drawing board, for 15 of which they
intend to lodge development and operation plans this year and next.
According to the Norwegian Oil Review - a domestic trade journal published
by Mr Hans Henrik Ramm, a former Conservative government state secretary -
development concepts for 25 oil and gas fields are being evaluated by oil
companies with oil fields containing recoverable reserves of between 2m
tonnes and 70m tonnes and gas fields ranging from 3bn to 10bn cubic metres.
A recent report warned that precious few of these fields would be profitable
under Norway's current tax regime if they used conventional technology and
oil prices remained low.
The government recently disclosed that it was drafting changes to the
petroleum tax regime that could increase the financial burden of foreign and
domestic oil companies. The oil industry has expressed strong disapproval of
the plans, saying they would have a negative impact on the industry and
damage the government's credibility. Oil companies point out that investment
decisions have already been made in the expectation that the 1992 reforms of
the fiscal regime would prevail for longer than one year.
Last year's reforms created a loophole for foreign oil companies, allowing
them to repatriate funds to parent companies at considerable loss of revenue
 -several hundred million kroner annually - to state coffers.
Mr Stoltenberg does not foresee other major changes to oil industry policy
during his term but says emphasis is likely to shift to gas from oil.
'We have to develop our land-based industries to be competitive without them
being dependent on oil revenue to provide state subsidies,' he says.
One of Mr Stoltenberg's first achievements as minister was to forge closer
ties with the former Soviet state of Kazakhstan.
He recently travelled there and signed a memorandum of understanding to
establish an energy forum. He also promised five educational scholarships to
Kazakhs under Norway's Petrad programme, which aims to enhance the expertise
of the participants in the fields of petroleum management and
administration.
A former state secretary of environment and an environmental activist in his
youth, Mr Stoltenberg does not believe he should be forced to choose between
petroleum and the environment.
'The moment you choose, you lose,' he says. 'The message of the Brundtland
Commission's report to the United Nations on the environment is sustainable
development, and this is what we intend to accomplish but not at the expense
of the environment.'
Mr Stoltenberg concedes that in the long-term, Norway's production policy
could be open for discussion. 'How much oil should we really be taking out
of the North Sea?' he asks. 'Environmentally speaking, it's easy to defend
our depletion policy because part of our production is natural gas - and gas
is an environmentally friendly replacement to other fuels.'
Norway's natural gas supply to Europe is the most concrete and important
contribution the country can make to sustainable development, he says. 'It's
good business and it's our way of helping to reduce Europe's harmful
emissions.'
Norway has about 40 years of crude oil production left at current levels and
80 years of gas at a rate of 60bn cu m annually - more than twice the
current rate - which is expected to be achieved by the turn of the century.
'We're not just pumping oil and consuming it. . . we are investing in
Norway's future with petroleum revenue in a responsible way. Norway is
nearly debt free and by 1994 it is possible we will succeed in further
reducing our foreign debt, thanks to petroleum revenue.'
In true social democratic style, Mr Stoltenberg argues that 'it's not a
question of eating up Norway's petroleum oil wealth, but more an issue of
distribution of wealth to the benefit of society'.

<TEXT>
Caribbean sugar producers are seeking compensation from the European Union
for losses which they say they will incur because of a European Commission
proposal that the EU's existing sugar regime be extended for two years to
June, 1995. The Sugar Association of the Caribbean, a producers' lobby, said
this week that the region's exports, and those of others in the African,
Caribbean and Pacific group, which has a trade treaty with the EU, would be
'damaged' by the two-year postponement of the sugar marketing protocol.
Producers should be compensated through the sugar protocol, in the way that
EU's beet sugar producers are compensated for declines in their income, the
association said.
ACP producers have a guaranteed market for 1.3m tonnes (raw value) per year,
with their earnings linked to the intervention price paid by the EU to its
domestic sugar producers.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc prices forecast to rise
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts being made by European zinc producers to co-ordinate capacity cuts
would result in one or two smelters closing by the end of next year and this
would almost certainly cause a fast price rise to about 60 cents a lb, more
than one third above today's level, according to Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier,
chairman of Union Miniere, the Belgian group that is the world's biggest
zinc producer.
He was speaking at a symposium organised by the Belgian Non-Ferrous Metals
Federation where another speaker, Mr Philip Crowson, chief economist at the
RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, was highly critical of
the so-called zinc smelter 'shut down' proposals.
European producers decided early this month to press ahead rapidly with the
scheme, which aims to eliminate substantial over-capacity by the permanent
closure of one or two smelters, the cost of which would be paid for by the
industry as a whole.
Mr Crowson hit out against the scheme by suggesting: 'Agreements to close
down European smelters, always assuming any are concluded, will have but a
limited impact if they are not accompanied by a standstill on offsetting
investments elsewhere.
Mr Rodier agreed that market forces would eventually curb overcapacity, but
that would take time and have brutal social consequences. 'And it might not
be the worst zinc smelters that close - just those where the shareholders
are fed up with investing in zinc.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Back to square one for Opec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night conceded that
it would have to go back to square one in its quest to end the decline in
oil prices.
In a speech which will add to pressure on the oil ministers meeting in
Vienna to make cuts in the present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a
day, Mr Jean Ping, the energy minister of Gabon and Opec president, gave a
gloomy assessment of market conditions.
He noted that the price of the Opec basket of six crude oils was Dollars
14.70 yesterday, the level before Opec's September meeting in Geneva at
which it set the ceiling in an effort push prices closer to the Opec target
of Dollars 21 a barrel.
That ceiling has been largely observed, according Mr Ping, with output in
October of 24.85m b/d. The bulk of the over-production occurred in Iraq,
which is barred from exporting by United Nations sanctions. Ministers will
focus over the next few days on possible further production cuts. Analysts
say it could take at least a 3 per cent immediate reduction in the ceiling
to counter bearish market psychology, especially as Opec calls for producers
outside the organisation to curb their output are unlikely to lead to any

FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum metals fall in
'overreaction'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp falls in prices for sister metals platinum and palladium yesterday
afternoon were a 'wild overreaction' to an announcement of a new motor
emission control system, according to Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at
stockbroker T. Hoare and Company.
The January platinum futures price fell by 2.3 per cent and the palladium
December price by 2.75 per cent at the New York Mercantile Exchange after
Engelhard Corporation said it had developed technology that trapped
hydrocarbon emissions during the first two minutes of vehicle operation that
a catalytic converter took to become activated.
Ms O'Connell suggested this might result in an add-on to conventional
emission control systems but did not appear to threaten the autocatalyst
markets for the two metals.
Mr Gordon Bassett, general manager for precious metals marketing at Johnson
Matthey North America, agreed. 'This is not something that would effect
palladium or platinum use,' he told the Reuter news agency. And an Engelhard
representative confirmed that the company's hydrocarbon trap would be used
in addition to, rather than in place of, traditional catalytic converters
using platinum group metals.
Prices for both metal recovered somewhat near the close. In late trading,
Nymex's January platinum position was quoted Dollars 1.90 off the day's low
at Dollars 374 a troy ounce, still Dollars 6.90 down on the day, while
December palladium had edged up by 50 cents to Dollars 126 an ounce, down
Dollars 3.05.
'Platinum was looking pretty weak on fundamental grounds irrespectively,' Mr
George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers, told Reuter.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scottish farm union challenges
penalties for cereals overshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF Scotland's farmers are to press the UK government in London today
to fight penalties imposed on them by the European Commission for apparently
exceeding their cereal production ceiling.
The House of Commons is also holding an adjournment debate to discuss the
penalties, which the National Farmers' Union of Scotland says will cost
Scottish agriculture Pounds 20m.
The NFU accuses the commission of 'blatant discrimination' for offering a
scheme to allow a gradual phasing in of penalties against farmers in eastern
Germany who apparently overshot their production limit, but failing to offer
a comparable solution to Scottish farmers.
The problem has arisen from a discrepancy between the 'base area' used by
the UK government to calculate what Scotland's cereal production should be
under the European Union's reformed common agricultural policy, and the
actual arable area for which farmers have claimed compensation from Brussels
for cuts in support prices.
Because the farmers' claims have exceeded the base area by 5.4 per cent,
Brussels is reducing their compensation payments by the equivalent - Pounds
4.5m - this year.
It is also requiring them to set aside an extra 5.4 per cent of their
cereal-growing land next year without any compensation, in addition to the
15 per cent set-aside for which they are paid under the CAP reforms.
The Scottish NFU says the base area was calculated using unreliable census
figures from 1989-91 and that the farmers' claims, worked out using maps and
precise measurements of land, are far more accurate. 'Farmers have taken a
great deal of care when filling these forms in because their livelihoods
depend on it,' said Mr Tom Brady, deputy chief executive.
'All the evidence we have suggests there hasn't been an overshoot at all.'
He pointed out that the Scottish Office had found statistical errors in its
census figures that had already forced it to ask Brussels to reduce the
apparent overshoot from 16 per cent to 5.4 per cent.
The farmers feel the penalties are particularly unfair given the estimated
20 per cent fall in this year's Scottish cereal output to about 2.3m tonnes,
due both to set-aside and to bad weather at harvest time. 'Common sense has
been stood on its head,' said Mr Brady. 'Scotland has made the biggest
percentage contribution to reducing cereals oversupply in Europe, but still
we are the only area of Europe to have substantial increases in set-aside
announced.'
The NFU wants the Scottish 'overshoot' to be balanced against a shortfall in
compensation claims by English cereal farmers to give an overall UK figure
in line with target output.
But the Scottish Office, which points out that farm incomes have been
boosted this year by the devaluation of sterling, is standing by its
figures. 'The 5.4 per cent overshoot is being confirmed by provisional
census returns coming in now,' said an official.
Mr David Douglas, agricultural manager for Clydesdale Bank, expressed
concern about the impact of the penalties on farm profits. He added: 'If
this does come off, a lot of people will start to question whether they
continue with set-aside or go back to farming without subsidies. It starts
to defeat the object of the whole exercise.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Jobs: Working in a worrying wonderland - Readers'
explanations of practical skills range from life after death to pulses in
the brainbox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Curiouser and curiouser,' cried Alice in wonderland. More curious still is
that the Jobs column seems to have joined her without doing anything unusual
such as following rabbits down holes or drinking strange potions (other than
those prescribed for the Beijing flu).
All I did was ask you readers a practical question about the most everyday
of topics: to wit, how do you do your work?
That was 10 weeks ago, and 128 of you have kindly replied from 14 countries,
citing experience in a great variety of jobs. The snag is that the answers
often just deepen the mystery my question was meant to clear up. Indeed,
some of your explanations of how skilled work is done are literally out of
this world. An example is the reply from Switzerland saying: 'The key to
this phenomenon is reincarnation.'
The question certainly seemed down-to-earth on the day it was asked, even
though the work you readers do is of a complex mental kind. Ironically, I
was expecting most of you to confirm that the way you actually use your
mental skills is less complicated than we are led to suppose by a notion
evidently underpinning the bulk of conventional education. And while the
fact that you've largely done the opposite may serve me right for being
presumptuous, I do wish you hadn't. In that case, what follows would have
been plain sailing - just a summary of your practical explanations,
contrasting them with the said educational notion.
But now you have brought reincarnation and the like into the act, some
philosophy is unavoidable. So let's start with the proposition that there
are different kinds of knowledge, of which two in particular form the main
focus of academic curricula.
One kind is factual: knowing that something is so. The other is the
explanatory sort: knowing why something is so. For ease of reference, both
the know-that kind and the know-why sort can be lumped together as
know-about - which brings us back to the educational notion.
It is that operations requiring mental ability consist of two separate
stages. First, we think out what to do, using know-about to form an
intellectual plan of the actions that need to be taken. Second, having drawn
up the plan in our heads, we carry it out in practice.
Now that is clearly far from always the case. For example, we all know that
it is possible to ride a bicycle, so being more clued-up than Dr Johnson who
apparently refused to believe it. Moreover those of us who also know why it
is possible would be better equipped than his contemporaries to persuade him
he was wrong to see it as the equivalent of lifting oneself up in a bucket.
But possession of both the know-that and the know-why would not be enough to
enable someone to ride a bicycle. That requires know-how, which is
different. It strikes me that what applies to bike-riding applies to most
kinds of skilled work. And the same view happens to be shared by about 70
per cent of you who replied. The trouble is that you differ radically in
your beliefs about know-how's nature, being split into three main camps.
One is the pure intuitionists for whom know-how ranges from indefinably
intricate to plumb mysterious. While few go as far as the Swiss
reincarnationist, a good many come close, especially in their account of
creative skill. To them, its essential source is not in any individual head
or body, but in a universal, supra-human, invisible intelligence. In
support, one camp member has sent proofs from a book to be published next
year by Blackwell, which cites a study of the use of intuition by 1,312
managers in nine different countries.
At the other pole are the grey materialists, who see know-how as rooted in
the pulses of the flesh, particularly the bit in the brainbox. Although less
expansive than the intuitionists' accounts, their views are more testable.
What's more, they have the broad backing of an authority in the field,
neuropsychologist Tim Shallice of London University.
He says the latest scanning techniques have already traced the networks of
brain cells responsible for numerous 'sub-components' of mental action, such
as ability to recall short lists of words. Some of the processes, however,
are intelligent without being conscious. An example is 'blindsight', by
which certain people partly blinded by illness can not only detect but
precisely locate a purely visual stimulus they cannot physically see.
Professor Shallice expects that in 20 years or so we will have a brain map
of all the main mental functions. But even if we do, it won't solve the
ultimate question of why they operate intelligently.
Hence there would seem to be still room for incorporeal if not unearthly
influences of the sort favoured by pure intuitionists. To which my response,
as perhaps befits a scared sexagenarian, is agnostic. After all, though such
postulations seem improbable, there is no conclusive evidence to hand that
disproves them.
The only one of the camps I feel able to refute is the smallest: 37 readers
who think know-how essentially the same as the know-about taught in schools.
The sole reason why our practical skill often seems intuitive, they say, is
that we have so deeply absorbed the know-thats and know-whys which compose
it as to have forgotten we ever learned them.
My disagreement is on two grounds: real-life experience and an observation
made a century ago by the American pragmatist philosopher William James. It
is that a distinction between two kinds of knowledge is recognised by
several languages other than English. One sort is intellectual know-about -
wissen in German, for instance. The other is kennen: direct knowledge as
exemplified in knowing another person.
The related experience came in August when with Pam, my wife, and our
34-year-old son Jon, I was sailing our Holman sloop Malaguana from Dartmouth
to the Exe. The wind was moderate but tricky and the tide unfavourable, if
anything worsening with time.
I've done a fair deal of sailing, and helmed for the first hour. At the end
we'd gone 3 1/2 miles, but 20 degrees off the ideal course.
The second hour was steered by Jon, who has thousands of sea miles behind
him, hundreds of them in Malaguana. He too firmly grasped the stout wooden
tiller, though with a lighter hand than mine, and managed 4 miles no more
than 10 degrees off line.
He then persuaded Pam to take over, which she resisted because she has done
hardly any helming except on a previous sail alone with Jon. Nor has she any
time for, let alone knowledge of, the theory of sailing. Instead of grasping
the tiller, she just rested one finger on it . . . and achieved 4 1/2 miles
dead on course.
'Isn't it sickening?' Jon said. 'She out-sailed me last time too.' Asked how
she did it, she said: 'I can feel with my finger when the boat's going at
her best. So if she falls off, I just nudge her gently about till she's
happy again.'
That is plainly a case of James's direct knowing. What's more, on
reflection, I find the same provides a more fitting explanation than
know-about of my way of writing. The salient difference is that, whereas Pam
'feels' the boat, I 'hear' the English language. So it may be that the main
root of know-how is unusually sharpened senses.
True, there is not much hard evidence to support my theory either. But at
least it's simpler than reincarnation.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Gilt prices volatile after surprise cut in
base rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The timing of yesterday's half-point cut in the base rate from 6 per cent to
5.5 per cent took the UK government bond market by surprise and sparked a
sharp initial rally in the cash and futures markets.
After a volatile day, gilt prices ended between  1/8 and  1/2 point higher,
with long-dated issues seeing the biggest gains, helped by the prospects of
continued low inflation.
Dealers reported keen buying interest in the cash and futures markets after
the rate cut announcement but prices later fell back. 'Investors liked the
news, but then they appeared to be pausing for breath as they tried to make
up their minds about the longer-term implications and the Budget,' said one
dealer.
Expectations of a rate cut at the time of the Budget had been priced into
the short end of the gilt market, although dealers said the cut had been
expected slightly closer to the November 30 Budget.
Mr John Kendall, UK economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, noted there was 'a
lot of yield curve play - a lot of people are borrowing at the short end and
buying the long end' of the gilt market because the gilt yield curve is
positively sloped.
German government bonds closed lower, with dealers blaming the gloomy
international background rather than any domestic features.
Monday's disappointing October money supply figures, which showed M3 growing
by a higher than expected 6.8 per cent, pushed back expectations of a
Bundesbank easing.
However, dealers said hopes of a cut in key rates could be revived if the
November cost of living data for the regions (due this week) lead to a
decline in the west German October's figure of 3.9 per cent. Some economists
are predicting a November figure of 3.7 per cent.
Dealers noted some extension trades, from medium to long-dated bunds, but
despite the switches the long end of the market still underperformed the
five-year area.
Italian government bonds suffered another substantial fall on panic selling
by foreigners in the wake of the weekend municipal election results.
Following Monday's tumble of nearly two points, Italian debt prices lost a
further two points yesterday but clawed back some of the losses to end about
a point lower on the day, with dealers arguing that the market had been
oversold.
The local elections dealt a blow to Italy's established political parties,
and raised questions about the possible impact on the 1994 budget. However,
yesterday the finance minister told reporters nothing had changed regarding
the 1994 budget.
Italy's ex-communist opposition yesterday guaranteed approval of the 1994
austerity budget by the end of the year, adding that the turmoil on
financial markets after the weekend local polls was completely unjustified.
The BTP futures contract settled at 112.64 on Monday. It opened at 112.03
yesterday and dropped as low as 110.50 as investors rushed to sell their
bond holdings, but later recovered to trade at around 111.50 by late
afternoon.
Italian 10-year yield spreads over German bunds have widened to about 400
basis points, from around 300 basis points just over a week ago.
Spanish government bonds were dragged lower by the combination of turmoil in
Italy, general weakness in the European bond markets, and threats of a
general strike by some Spanish trade unions in protest at the government's
proposed labour market reforms.
Hopes of a  1/4 point cut in Spanish interest rates were disappointed at the
repo.
Longer-dated US Treasury securities jumped sharply yesterday as short
sellers were forced by rising prices to buy large amounts of bonds to cover
their positions.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up 1 1/16 at 99 5/32 ,
yielding 6.308 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/8 at
100 1/16 , to yield 4.201 per cent.
After Monday's losses, dealers were not surprised when the market staged a
rally from the opening yesterday. Technical buying related to the price of
the December Treasury bond futures contract was one reason for the early
gains.
Prices remained firm until midday and then climbed sharply in mid-afternoon
as short-covering began in earnest. The activity was mainly restricted to
dealers and speculators who had sold bonds short in anticipation of further
losses.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Debut Eurodollar deal for Cable &amp;
Wireless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group which last week reported a
30 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 509m (Dollars
750m), raised Dollars 400m yesterday through its first Eurodollar offering.
Demand was such that the unrated borrower achieved a yield spread of 73
basis points over US Treasuries on its 10-year Eurobonds, at the tighter end
of the indicated range of 73 - 75 basis points.
The spread compared favourably with current spreads on other 10-year
Eurodollar offerings launched recently by double A-rated UK companies.
Traders said that the yield spread on National Power's Dollars 300m offering
of 10-year Eurobonds, which was launched last week, stood at 70 basis points
yesterday while the spread on the Dollars 500m offering of 10-year Eurobonds
issued by BAT Industries on November 9 stood at 80 basis points.
Mr Richard Wainright-Lee, director of corporate finance at C&amp;W, said the
company was taking advantage of favourable market conditions. The proceeds
of the offering would be used to finance the development of the company's
business activities in eastern Asia, Europe and the Caribbean.
However, he indicated that C&amp;W was unlikely to return quickly to the
Eurobond market because it was not under pressure to raise funds. 'There is
no heavy need to borrow,' he said.
Lead manager JP Morgan said around 20 per cent of the bonds were placed in
Asia, 15 per cent in the Middle East, 15 per cent with US offshore accounts,
30 per cent in continental Europe and 20 per cent in the UK.
Elsewhere, Treasury Corp of Victoria injected badly-needed liquidity into
the Australian dollar sector of the Eurobond market with its ADollars 500m
issue of global five-year bonds, its second Australian dollar global bond
offering this year.
The bonds were priced to yield 12 basis points below the 12 per cent State
Electricity Commission of Victoria's domestic bond due 1998. When they were
freed to trade the spread remained intact.
Lead manager Merrill Lynch said that 60 per cent of the bonds were placed
with US investors.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Nigerian par bonds rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigerian par bonds rallied strongly yesterday, regaining most of the ground
they lost following last week's coup, despite growing concern over Nigeria's
overall debt position.
The bonds rallied from 39 cents in the dollar at the start of the year to a
high of 63 cents in October. Prices have held up surprisingly well in the
face of renewed political turmoil and rebounded several points to 58 1/4
cents yesterday, on news of the appointment of a provisional ruling council.
'Given the uncertainty, the price does seem rather high, and the market
could prove vulnerable to further shocks to confidence,' said Mr Mark Evans
of ING Bank. However, traders point out that the bonds cost Nigeria only
Dollars 110m a year to service - only two days of its oil revenues.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Emerging market investment
rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International institutional investment in emerging stock markets has risen
to 13 per cent of international funds this year from 10 per cent last year,
according to a survey* published yesterday. This compares with only 2 per
cent in 1989.
The survey also showed investor attention had shifted from leading Latin
American and Pacific Rim markets to lesser-known markets in Africa, the
Middle East and Europe. In 1990, only 7 per cent of respondents had holdings
in Africa and the Middle East but this figure is now 50 per cent. Markets in
southern and central Europe are now part of 85 per cent of portfolios, an
increase of 20 per cent.
Thirty per cent of survey respondents have committed funds to Poland and 14
per cent have invested in Zimbabwe, the Czech Republic and Morocco. A
handful of investors have entered Ghana, Botswana, Ecuador and Panama. They
have also taken direct equity stakes in local companies in Papua New Guinea,
which does not have a stock market as yet.
Survey respondents said that although investing in emerging markets had
become 'fashionable', several areas of practical concern remained in these
high risk-high reward markets.
These included inadequate custody and settlement, bureaucratic regulatory
environments and the lack of quality information. Venezuela, China, India
and the Czech Republic were cited as the main markets where investors
encountered these problems.
More than 40 institutional investors and several large pension fund advisers
from North America, Europe and Japan took part in the survey.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: American Airlines recovers from
strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Airlines yesterday said it was encouraged by its recovery from a
five-day strike by flight attendants, which ended on Monday after the
unexpected intervention of President Bill Clinton.
The airline said it would return to a full schedule of flights by Thursday -
Thanksgiving Day. The announcement eased concern over the possibility of
widespread disruption of the country's air transport system during the busy
holiday period.
However, industry observers say the walk-out, which appeared to have been
much more successful than American had anticipated, will have an immediate
financial impact on AMR, the airline's parent, and could complicate its
efforts to reduce its cost structure in the longer term.
In New York, the stock fell sharply after two Wall Street securities houses
 -Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns - downgraded their ratings. At the close,
AMR was Dollars 3 lower at Dollars 65 1/8 in heavy trading.
As part of a back-to-work deal brokered by the White House, the airline
agreed to re-open bargaining with 21,000 members of the Association of
Professional Flight Attendants and submit to a final contract ruling by a
federal arbitrator.
American yesterday said contract negotiations would begin in about six

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mediobanca implicated in claims
against Ferruzzi

<TEXT>
Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank guiding the restructuring of Italy's
troubled Ferruzzi group, allegedly knew of severe financial difficulties and
malpractices at the company well ahead of their revelation this year.
The claim, made in Italy's authoritative Sole 24 Ore business newspaper, is
based on leaked documents from the former administrative director of the
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company.
The documents include a letter giving details of the off-balance-sheet loans
taken out by obscure Ferfin subsidiaries to cover up heavy trading losses by
the group.
The letter outlines the complex financial transactions involving loans taken
out by offshore shell companies on the instructions of one of the Ferruzzi
family's most trusted financial advisers based in Lausanne, Switzerland.
It is addressed directly to Mr Gerardo Braggiotti, the senior Mediobanca
executive responsible for Ferruzzi.
Milan magistrates last week issued an arrest warrant against Mr Braggiotti's
father, Enrico, a former chairman of Italy's big Banca Commerciale Italiana,
regarding an alleged Dollars 50m payment to secure BCI's good offices during
his period as chairman.
Separately, lawyers for Montedison, the big industrial company which is
Ferfin's main operating subsidiary, indicated yesterday that the legal
action against former executives could soon be extended. This follows
information unearthed by the magistrates investigating financial
irregularities and political corruption.

Kayser-Roth

<TEXT>
Grupo Synkro, the leading Mexican leg-wear company, and its principal
investors, have agreed to buy the US tights maker Kayser-Roth for Dollars
233m, making the new group the world's second largest producer of hosiery.
The transaction is believed to be the third largest Mexican purchase of a US
company, following Vitro's acquisition of Anchor Glass in 1989, and Mr
Carlos Cabal Peniche's takeover of Del Monte Fresh Produce last year.
It marks a drive by leading Mexican companies to expand abroad as they grow
out of their own markets, and face increasingly intense global competition.
The transaction, which would have gone ahead without the North American Free
Trade Agreement, is expected to benefit from reduction of tariffs and
increased flow of trade generated by the pact.
Synkro is Latin America's leading hosiery company, with expected sales this
year of about Dollars 200m. It has more than 50 per cent market share in
Mexico, and about 10 per cent in Argentina, where it owns a manufacturer and
distributor of tights. Mr Bernie Jacob, vice-president of Chase Manhattan,
which advised on the transaction, said the company was looking for other
acquisitions.
Kayser-Roth has annual sales of about Dollars 400m and is owned by Collins &amp;
Aikman Group. Synkro said they would keep the same management, and would not
export jobs to Mexico, only Kayser-Roth's brand names.

Carter Hawley Hale, the US department store operator which emerged from

For the three months to October 30, Carter Hawley posted a net loss of
Dollars 25.1m, or 54 cents a share. In the corresponding period of 1992, it
reported earnings of Dollars 1.16bn, but the result included a one-time gain
of Dollars 892m related to the company's reorganisation, plus a special
Dollars 304.4m gain on debt retirement.
Without the extraordinary items, the company would have posted a net loss of

Shares in Paramount Communications tumbled yesterday as it emerged that far
more investors had tendered their shares in support of the Viacom bid for
the company than the competing, higher one from QVC, writes Richard Waters
in New York.
Both bids have been extended by two days, pending a court decision on a
legal challenge mounted by QVC.
Viacom said 12.3m shares in Paramount had been tendered in support of its
bid, equivalent to 10.5 per cent of the company. QVC, on the other hand,
said 209,829 shares had been tendered for its offer, equal to 0.2 per cent
of Paramount's shares.
On Wall Street, Paramount closed Dollars 2 1/2 lower at Dollars 76 1/2 .
Paramount Communications and AT&amp;T announced plans yesterday to develop pilot
interactive television programmes for broadcast in the US.
Paramount will use AT&amp;T software to put together interactive versions of two
popular US television programmes, one on entertainment and the other on
sports, which can be delivered over cable TV systems, telephone lines or

Sail, a state-controlled enterprise in which the government has sold a 10.52
per cent stake to private shareholders, stands out as among the most

Gaz de France is injecting CDollars 100m (USDollars 75.2m) into Noverco, the
holding company that controls Quebec's regulated natural gas distributor and
several non-regulated businesses.
This gives the French utility 24 per cent of Noverco, which has been looking
for a strategic partner for some time.
It becomes a partner in Noverco with Soquip, a Quebec government energy
agency (38 per cent), the Caisse de Depot (30 per cent), and Levesque
Beaubien (8 per cent).
Noverco and Soquip control gas production in western Canada and the gas
pipeline between Montreal and Quebec City. The Caisse de Depot, with assets
of nearly CDollars 45bn, manages the Quebec public sector pension funds.
Gaz de France said its investment was part of its international expansion.
The two groups have had technical partnerships for some time.
Noverco's gas distribution unit, Gaz Metropolitain, has a pipeline network
covering more than 5,000 miles (8,000km) in Quebec and Vermont. It bought
New England Gas last year and plans to become a significant force in the
north-eastern US. Its long-term strategy includes using the St Lawrence
Valley as a distribution hub with direct pipeline connection to the Boston
area.
For the year ended September 30, Gaz Metro had sales of more than CDollars
1bn and profit of CDollars 111.4m.

Foschini, the South African retail clothing and jewellery group, overcame
difficult trading conditions to record a 19.5 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to R88.3m (Dollars 26.2m) in the six months to September, from
R73.9m a year ago.
High productivity levels helped profit growth outstrip the 17.8 per cent
increase in turnover compared to 1992 (no turnover figure supplied).
Attributable income rose 37.4 per cent to R53.3m.
The company paid a R52.4m interim scrip dividend. Based on a share price of
R68, shareholders will receive an allotment of one new ordinary 5 cents
share for every 59 held.
With signs of an economic upturn, Mr Stanley Lewis, chairman, forecast
'satisfactory profits and earnings growth' for the full year.
Mr Clive Hirschson, managing director, said all trading divisions had been
satisfactory. The rate of store expansion has been stepped up with 15 new
stores opened in October alone compared to 12 during the reporting period.
Jewellery group Sterns, purchased in April, had been repositioned and was
now well placed to make a profit contribution in the second half.
During the period two Foschini directors were appointed to the board of UK
clothing retailer Etam, 36.4 per cent owned by Foschini associate, Oceana
Investment Corporation.

Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based institution in which Hill Samuel holds a
minority stake, yesterday reported profits after tax of ADollars 31.2m
(USDollars 20.6m) in the six months to end-September, a 17.4 per cent
improvement over the same period of 1992.
Mr Allan Moss, managing director, said the performance of all the group's
main activities had been 'above budget'. Macquarie does not break down
results by division, but the bank added that about one-third of group
earnings came from fees, a similar amount from trading activities, and the
final third from interest margins.
The bank, whose structure is closer to that of an investment bank, said that
its equities division had a particularly buoyant first half, 'well
exceeding' the same six months in 1992. Macquarie Equities claimed the
number one position in terms of market share on the Australian Stock
Exchange in September and October, and the group's underwriting business
also benefited from the surge in new issues.
Non-accrual loans were ADollars 44m or 2.6 per cent of loan assets, compared
to ADollars 28.1m, while net losses on bad and doubtful loans totalled just
ADollars 0.58m, compared to ADollars 1.03m. Total assets at the half-year
were ADollars 3.67bn, up by 15.9 per cent and the total capital adequacy
ratio was 12.94 per cent. St George Bank, an Australian regional bank,
yesterday reported an operating profit of ADollars 82.8m (USDollars 54.7m)
after tax and abnormal or unusual items for the 16 months to September 30,
AP-DJ reports from Sydney. St George said it would pay a dividend of 20
cents a share for the six months to end-September, making a total of 50
cents for the 16 months.

<TEXT>
The Australian senate's joint statutory committee on corporations and
securities has called on the Australian Stock Exchange to extend the
deadline for submissions on differential voting rights until the end of
February.
The issue has arisen in the context of a controversial plan by Mr Rupert
Murdoch to issue News Corp shares with 'super voting rights' on a pro rata
basis to existing shareholders.
The ASX has asked the investment community to submit views on the principles
underlying the scheme by November 29, and has indicated that it will make a
decision on the issue before Christmas. However, Senator Michael Beahan, who
chairs the committee as well as a recently-announced inquiry into the role
of institutional investors, said the ASX procedure on the super shares
matter was 'not acceptable to the committee', and called for the longer
timetable.

<TEXT>
Mr Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive of Sotheby's Holdings, is
to leave the US-owned fine art saleroom in January. He will be succeeded by
Mrs Diana Brooks, president and chief executive of Sotheby's worldwide
auction business.
Mr Ainslie, 50, joined Sotheby's in 1984 from the American National Trust.
He said yesterday that he had always planned to stay for 10 years. He had
told Sotheby's chairman and chief shareholder, Mr Alfred Taubman, last
January that he wished to resign, and in April Mrs Brooks, 43, took over the
day-to-day running of the company.
Under Mr Ainslie, Sotheby's consolidated its position as an international
auction house and the largest in its field. However, it was hit badly by the
recession and this month announced a net loss for the first nine months of
1993 of Dollars 1.3m, although that was a slight improvement over 1992.
Mr Ainslie, a large shareholder in Sotheby's, will remain a director but
expects to take another job. Mrs Brooks' executive role will be shared
between three or four colleagues.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Powerful position for Hopewell -
A flotation offering exposure to Chinese electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and infrastructure conglomerate
controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday brought its electric power assets to
the Hong Kong stock market in a capital raising initially worth nearly
HKDollars 11bn (USDollars 1.4bn).
The deal offers investors the chance to participate in China's expanding
electricity industry. For Hopewell, it means a profit of nearly HKDollars
1.2bn on its investments in electric power, and the transfer of about
HKDollars 390m of debt from its balance sheet to that of Consolidated
Electric Power Asia (CEPA), the subsidiary to be floated.
Today, Hopewell offers Hong Kong investors 93.6m CEPA shares at HKDollars
12.50 each. The company's financial advisers, Peregrine Capital and Wardley,
said yesterday that 381.4m shares at HKDollars 12.50 each had been placed
with international investors. In total, Hopewell will raise some HKDollars
6bn through the flotation and placements.
In the words of one of CEPA's advisers, the float is 'not the most
straightforward of offerings'. Hopewell has subscribed to 475m shares in
CEPA at HKDollars 10 a share, and is selling these to investors at HKDollars
12.50 each.
Hopewell will also subscribe to 800m shares at HKDollars 10 each. Half of
this is payable now and the remainder in two equal instalments on successive
anniversaries of CEPA's December 6 listing. On full payment of the partly
paid shares, Hopewell's interest will rise to 62.8 per cent.
CEPA comes to market with one of the most demanding valuations ever seen in
the colony. The offer price represents a prospective price to earnings ratio
of about 40 times forecast 1994 earnings of HKDollars 208m, and a 32.4 per
cent premium over net tangible assets of HKDollars 9.44 a share.
However, analysts said the small size of the public offering combined with
demand for CEPA shares should ensure that its shares perform well initially.
In the longer term, the company's fortunes will depend on the extent to
which Mr Wu can replicate past successes in building and operating power
stations in China and the Philippines.
Indeed, CEPA is almost a pure 'concept' stock and a gamble not only on Mr
Wu's business skills but on China's future. As Mr Eamonn McManus, director
of corporate finance at Wardley, one of the company's financial advisers,
said yesterday: 'People are investing in an energy fund; they are buying
Gordon Wu's expertise and track record.'
Valuing the company is difficult and highly subjective, said Mr Archie Hart,
director of research at Crosby Securities, a local brokerage. 'The value of
this company is in a lot of deals yet to be made. What is the real value of
this company? I don't know.'
The balance investors have to strike is between China and, more broadly,
Asia's demand for electric power and the likelihood that 'letters of intent'
and 'preliminary discussions' which CEPA has with provincial mainland
authorities will materialise into contracts.
China's demand for power and its desire to develop rapidly its generating
capacity is a matter of record. Annual electricity consumption per head was
just 562kW in 1991, against 4,418kW in Hong Kong and 11,333kW in the US.
China wants to add between 10,000 and 15,000 megawatts of capacity each year
until the end of the century.
CEPA believes it is well placed to build some of this extra capacity.
According to its prospectus, CEPA has a 'preliminary agreement' to install
1,320MW of power generating capacity in Guangxi province; 'letters of
intent' to install 6,600MW of power in Jiangsu, Henan and Shandong
provinces; and has had 'preliminary discussions' with two localities to
install up to 3,900MW of capacity.
Mr Stewart Elliot, CEPA chief executive, indicated yesterday that up to 14
other deals on the Chinese mainland were being discussed when he said that
CEPA has 20 letters of intent from various provinces. But he agreed that
investors were buying CEPA on the basis of its future prospects.
He said, however, there was 'absolutely no doubt' in his mind that the
projects referred to in the company's prospectus would materialise. After
the CEPA float, 'negotiations to formal contracts will come very shortly,'
Mr Elliot said.
Hopewell has demonstrated its ability to build large power stations below
budget and ahead of schedule. Currently under construction are Shajiao-C in
Guangdong - a 3x600MW coal-fired station - and Pagbilao in the Philippines,
which is a 2x367.5MW unit. Together with other projects in the Philippines
and China, these constitute the company's assets.
When they are constructed, CEPA will have generating capacity of 4,000MW,
making it one-and-a-half times the size of Hongkong Electric and two-thirds
the size of China Light &amp; Power. Mr Elliot says the company's strategic aim
is to become the 'principal independent supplier of power in Asia for the
foreseeable future.'
Part of this entails becoming a retailer of off-the-shelf power stations.
CEPA, Mr Elliot claims, is close to achieving what every first world power
utility would like to do: standardise its product. Savings from
standardisation would amount to between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the
cost of generation equipment, he said.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Indian steel group ahead 18%
after six months

<TEXT>
The Steel Authority of India (Sail), the country's largest steel producer,
lifted net profit 18 per cent to Rs630m (Dollars 20m) for the six months to
the end of September due to increased sales and cost-cutting.
Sail's performance contrasts sharply with that of Tata Iron and Steel, the
country's second largest steelmaker, which recently reported a sharp fall in
profit.
Sail, a state-controlled enterprise in which the government has sold a 10.52
per cent stake to private shareholders, stands out as among the most
efficient of India's large state-owned industrial enterprises. Its managers
have taken advantages of the changes brought about by the liberalisation of
India's economy in the past two years, whereas Tata Steel's financial
performance has suffered from management upheavals and from the cost of a
large modernisation programme.
Sail's turnover in the period rose 12 per cent to Rs50.63bn. Production of
steel rose 6 per cent to 4m tonnes in the half-year.
Mr M. R. R. Nair, chairman, said the product mix had been changed to suit
market conditions. The improved performance came in spite of the stagnation
in the market, and was attributed by Mr Nair to 'all-round improvement in
productivity and reduction in costs. The energy consumption per tonne of
steel produced has been brought down significantly.'
Exports rose almost fourfold to Rs3.21bn.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: ABB posts flat profits at
Dollars 215m in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, reported
flat profits of Dollars 215m before tax and non-recurring items for the
third quarter.
Incoming orders tumbled 24.3 per cent to Dollars 5.3bn in the quarter,
although much of the decline was attributable to currency effects.
The group said only Asian markets were strong. Demand in continental Europe
was still weakening and the economic recovery in North America was having
only a small positive impact on order intake.
Exports from Scandinavia were increasing and the UK market seemed 'poised
for some growth'. Last month, a UK subsidiary of ABB won a Pounds 150m
(Dollars 224m) contract to build and lease rolling stock to Network
SouthEast, part of the UK rail network.
ABB is maintaining its forecast that profits before tax and non-recurring
items in the full year will be at about last year's level of Dollars 1.11bn.
However, it signalled that net income would be lower, largely because of a
Dollars 500m restructuring provision announced in August and the resultant
higher tax rate.
Non-recurring items ballooned in the third quarter to Dollars 151m from
Dollars 30m, as about 30 per cent of the provision was booked.
Third-quarter revenues were down 7.5 per cent to Dollars 6.7bn, but
operating earnings jumped 33.5 per cent to Dollars 482m. ABB adjusts
revenues upwards and financial income downwards as a way of attributing to
its divisions the interest earned from cash advances from customers.
When, as in the third quarter, this process makes operating profits grow
more quickly than pre-tax profits, it means that invoicing on projects from
which the group has cash advances has been brisk.
For the nine months, profits before taxes and non-recurring items were down
1 per cent to Dollars 722m, but up 15 per cent in local currencies. The
power plant, financial services and transportation segments improved
earnings.
Revenues were down 6 per cent to Dollars 19.8bn, but up 4 per cent in local
currencies. Order intake, down 15 per cent to Dollars 20.3bn, was down only
6 per cent in local currencies.
Holderbank, the Swiss cement group, said it had placed 200,000 bearer shares
from its treasury with Union Bank of Switzerland.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal continues
record run
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Montreal, Canada's third biggest bank, has posted its fourth
consecutive year of record earnings, thanks to a 7 per cent rise in interest
income, and growth in fee-based services and securities trading. Kicking off
the Canadian banks' annual earnings season yesterday, it said net income
rose to CDollars 709m (USDollars 545m), or CDollars 2.59 a share, in the
fiscal year to October 31, from CDollars 640m, or CDollars 2.38 a year
earlier. Fourth-quarter earnings climbed to CDollars 201m, or 74 cents, from
CDollars 160m, or 59 cents.
Return on equity for the year was unchanged at 14.1 per cent, but rose in
the fourth quarter to 15.4 per cent from 13.4 per cent.
Revenues benefited from the receipt of CDollars 106m in overdue interest
from Brazil during the year, including CDollars 30m in the fourth quarter.
The bank also ascribed the rise in interest income to strong growth in
residential mortgages and loans to smaller businesses.
Year-end assets grew by 7.2 per cent to CDollars 116.9m. The fourth-quarter
return on assets improved to 0.70 per cent from 0.59 per cent. Non-interest
income advanced by 20 per cent in the fourth quarter, including a 53 per
cent jump in earnings from investment and securities business.
The bank said the quality of its assets was essentially stable. Bad-debt
provisions totalled CDollars 675m last year, against CDollars 550m in 1992.
The latter figure includes a CDollars 244m reverse of the general country
risk provision.
Non-performing loans amounted to 2.9 per cent of total loans and acceptances
on October 31, down from 3.1 per cent a year earlier.
The ratio of total capital to assets improved to 10.3 per cent (11.1 per
cent based on US rules) from 8.9 per cent last year. This is well above
guidelines set by the Bank for International Settlements.
BMO this year unveiled plans to capitalise more aggressively on its presence
in the US, through Harris Bankcorp, its Chicago-based subsidiary.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: GM sells three more component
plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors continued its disposal of automotive component businesses
with the sale of three plants to a newly-formed company in which it will
hold a 20 per cent interest.
The plants to be sold make starter motors and generators and employ 2,200
workers.
Transportation Systems, a company whose investors include Citicorp Venture
Capital and Mr Harold Sperlich, former Chrysler president, will take 80 per
cent of the joint venture company set up to acquire the business.
The disposal, the value of which was not disclosed, marks the latest step in
GM's divestment of component businesses.
It has now sold six of the 14 businesses that it last year said were for
sale.
The businesses that are being sold are part of GM's Delco Remy division,
which the company said would continue to produce a wide range of components
as part of the group.
In September, GM agreed to sell an 80 per cent stake in its wiper systems
and actuators business to a venture formed with ITT's automotive unit for
Dollars 400m.
That month it also said it would sell its rear-drive axle drive shaft and
related forging operations to American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, a new company
formed by former Chrysler executives.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: US banks renew assault on
Germany - A driving force in this second invasion is Goldman Sachs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1970s and early 1980s a wave of US commercial banks invaded Germany
amid a fanfare of publicity. Many left again soon afterwards having failed
to penetrate the German banking market, leaving German businessmen
unimpressed by the American 'talk first, action later' style of banking.
This time, the invaders are the US investment banks, eager to capitalise on
the perceived sleepiness of the German financial services sector. But this
time, the investment banks argue, they are here to stay.
'We have extraordinarily long-time horizons,' says Mr Phil Murphy, one of
the two Frankfurt-based partners in Goldman Sachs. 'We are in this for 50 to
100 years.'
Goldman is the most aggressive and newest of the arrivals in Germany. Since
it established its Frankfurt office in 1990 - until then it serviced its
German clients out of London - staff have gone from zero to 120, doubling in
the past year alone.
The firm has recently taken a second floor in the Messeturm skyscraper and
has won high-profile mandates. For example, advising Daimler-Benz on its
mould-breaking listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 'We were late on the
ground, but now we have our foot on the gas pedal more than anyone else,' Mr
Murphy says.
The London office - founded in 1968 and employing 1,300 people - remains
Goldman's European headquarters. But Frankfurt is one of the firm's two
fastest growing offices in the world, the other being Hong Kong.
'Our experience here shows you do not need GDP growth of 10 per cent a year
(as in the thriving Hong Kong/south China region, in contrast to the
recession-struck German economy) to run a successful investment banking
operation,' Mr Murphy enthuses.
'We are extremely bullish about this market, across all divisions.'
The bullishness, shared by other US investment banks who set up German
operations in the mid to late 1980s, reflects several fundamental factors:
An increased willingness on the part of German companies to appoint
financial advisers, and foreign ones at that.
'The facts of life have changed for German corporates,' says Mr Murphy.
'The severity of the downturn is confronting them with new problems . . .
people are seeking out new ideas and solutions.'
Investment banks have advised on high-profile transactions - CS First
Boston, for example, advised Krupp on its hostile acquisition of steel-rival
Hoesch last year. Morgan Stanley advised Schering on the sale of its
industrial chemicals operations to Witco of the US.
A host of foreign advisers was involved in the complex transaction whereby
Credit Lyonnais of France acquired control of the BfG Bank from the Aachener
und Munchener Beteiligungs insurance group.
The capital markets are opening up.
Foreign, largely US investment banks are winning mandates once the preserve
of the big German banks. This is true for corporate cash-raising exercises -
foreign banks muscled in as co-lead managers to big issues from Veba and
Allianz this year - and for governments and para-statal organisations in the
international bond markets.
Salomon Brothers was co-lead manager to the World Bank's first D-Mark global
bond. US investment banks have sole or joint lead managers of recent D-Mark
Eurobonds from Belgium, Sweden and Argentina. Goldman was sole lead manager
to a DM1bn (Dollars 588m) Eurobond issue from the Sudwestdeutsche
Landesbank, the state bank for the Land of Baden-Wurttemberg.
This opening up - on the domestic side at least - is driven by growing
competition for capital in Germany.
The costs of reunification have ensured that Germany has swung from being an
exporter to an importer of capital. With the bulk of domestic savings due to
be absorbed by government borrowings, the source of capital at the margin is
the foreign investor. However, mighty institutions such as Deutsche and
Dresdner Bank are in the domestic market but they do not have the placing
power of the international investment banks.
Germany has taken convincing, albeit belated steps to enhance the
attractions of Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre.
One example is the second Financial Markets Promotion Law, approved by the
German cabinet this month and to be enacted next year. This will make
insider dealing illegal and create a regulatory framework for securities
dealing.
'The move to outlaw insider dealing was a clear signal that Germany was
serious about the development of its equity markets,' said Mr Murphy.
Frankfurt has worked hard on developing dealing and settlement technology
which makes securities trading more congenial for international investment
banks.
If technology and regulatory reform have helped woo the US investment
banking community to Frankfurt, the buoyancy of German securities and
currency markets has provided them with more tangible rewards.
The bund market has risen spectacularly since the summer of 1992. The DAX
index of 30 leading shares is up by nearly 30 per cent since the beginning
of the year and currency and derivatives markets are in a frenzy. All of
which has provided banks in Germany with bumper trading profits this year.
Sceptics ask whether Goldman's commitment to the market place will falter
once sluggish turnover levels return. Scepticism is compounded by Goldman's
aggressive approach which some argue is a symptom of cultural differences
between the Anglo-American approach to business and the consensus-oriented
way in which corporate Germany operates.
Criticism focuses on Daimler's full listing in the US, on which Goldman
advised. The move shattered the consensus under which German companies
agreed among themselves not to give into the Security &amp; Exchange
Commission's requirement for greater financial disclosure.
Daimler and Goldman are adamant other German companies will follow suit, but
as yet there is no evidence of this.
Volkswagen has pointedly chosen to raise money in the US via the US
corporate bond market, saying it was not willing to make the disclosure
associated with a full SEC-approved listing for its shares.
'Every country has its unwritten ground rules, and you can't ignore them,'
comments the chief executive of a publicity-shy investment bank.
The remark was directed at Goldman Sachs, but Mr Murphy is adamant that the
bank is in Germany to stay - and that the rules of the game have changed.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Elf-Aquitaine wipes slate clean
 -Asset sales are central to plans for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four months after taking his seat at the head of Elf-Aquitaine, and with
privatisation looming, Mr Philippe Jaffre yesterday gave his prognosis.
France's largest industrial group will, he said, see net profits fall by
about 80 per cent, to just over FFr1bn (Dollars 170m), this year. Recovery
next year is likely to be slower than expected by most observers, as a
result of the continued downturn in European markets, the weak oil price and
the depressed chemicals sector.
In response, he outlined a strategy of cost-cutting, disposals and strict
limits on capital expenditure.
Mr Jaffre's statement indicate a clean-up rather than a crisis. 'He is
providing for risks and preparing the group for privatisation,' says Mr
Vincent Bazi, head of research at Barings Securities in France. The
government is due to sell its 50.8 per cent stake in the oil group early
next year, and Mr Jaffre wants to be ready.
Yesterday's warnings show he is treading a familiar path. Both Banque
Nationale de Paris, which was privatised last month, and Rhone-Poulenc,
which is in the final stages of its sale, issued profits warnings before
being offered to the public, and took steps to cleanse their operations.
Part of the the reason, say analysts, is to constrain the share price ahead
of the pricing of the issue.
At the operating level, Elf continues to perform reasonably well, given the
recession in Europe and the weakness of the oil price. Operating income is
expected to fall 20 per cent for the year as a whole, after a fall of 34 per
cent in the first six months. Cash-flow, the most important indicator for
oil companies, is expected to be about FFr24bn for the year, roughly the
same level as last year.
Debt, however, is perceived as a problem. 'What concerns me is the growth of
financial charges,' said Mr Jaffre, emphasising that his priority was to
stabilise the group's debt-equity ratio by the middle of next year, and
reduce it thereafter. At the end of June, gearing stood at about 37 per
cent. It is forecast to rise to between 45 and 50 per cent by the end of the
year.
The rise in borrowings is the legacy of his predecessors, notably Mr Lok le
Floch-Prigent, who pursued an ambitious policy of acquisitions and
investments. At the end of June, group borrowings stood at FFr39.8bn.
'It has become a heavy burden,' said Mr Jaffre. 'At a time when our
competitors are taking steps to reduce borrowings, so should we.'
The target is to keep the debt-equity ratio below 50 per cent.
This is where the clean-up comes in. Elf plans to reduce its borrowings
through a series of asset sales. This will involve the unravelling of many
of the group's financial holdings in other businesses.
Mr Jaffre offered no specifics regarding the sales. However, he has plenty
to choose from.
The company has an estimated FFr15bn tied up in numerous shareholdings in
other groups, including Bidermann, the textiles group, Compagnie Financiere
de Suez, and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the construction and
communications group.
More immediate candidates for sale, however, are likely to be the FFr5bn or
so of investments in non-listed companies accumulated over the past 20
years.
The sale of assets is not expected to affect the group's core businesses.
This would appear to include Yves Saint Laurent, the cosmetics and luxury
goods group, acquired controversially by Mr le Floch-Prigent. 'I think it is
still group strategy to build up its health and beauty business,' said one
analyst in Paris.
As for broader strategy, a stronger balance sheet should enable Elf to play
its part in the government's privatisation programme.
Mr Jaffre described as 'strategic' his company's relations with Union des
Assurances de Paris, the insurance group, and Renault. His comments hinted
at a new set of cross-share-holdings when the two companies follow Elf to
the auction block.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: VME Group expects return to the
black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VME Group, the big construction equipment producer owned by Volvo of Sweden
and Clark Equipment of the US, will move back into profit this year after
losing Dollars 94m in 1992, said Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief
executive.
Mr Johannesson attributed the recovery partly to the devaluation of the
Swedish krone, but mainly to the restructuring of the group, which has
reduced the workforce by 4,500 to just 6,500 over the past two years.
He was speaking on the eve of an announcement by VME and Japan's Hitachi
Construction Machinery on an agreement to establish a joint venture in the
rigid dumptruck business.
The two companies said in March they had signed a letter of intent to form
the venture, which they see as a vehicle to strengthen their strategic
positions in the construction and mining industries.
Today's announcement will disclose that VME will transfer its rigid
dumptruck business to a new US-based company, Euclid-Hitachi Heavy
Equipment.
Hitachi will take a 'substantial minority stake' in the new company in two
steps, starting with a 19.5 per cent holding to be implemented on December
31, a day before the new venture becomes operational.
The agreement goes further than was at first suggested. Hitachi will also
distribute VME's Volvo BM articulated dumptrucks and large wheel loaders in
Japan. However, Mr Johannesson stressed that Hitachi and VME remained
separate and were co-operating only in specific areas.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: La Rinascente share price slide

<TEXT>
La Rinascente, the Italian stores group being sold indirectly by Fiat to the
Ifil holding company, yesterday saw another sharp fall in its shares on the
Milan stock market, accentuating Monday's 15 per cent drop.
Ifil shares slipped by almost 2 per cent, to L7,385, as more investors
reacted to the news that Ifil's public tender offer for Rinascente stock had
been three times subscribed.
Ifil, which is active in food production but has no retailing activities,
announced in September it would bid for Rinascente, Italy's biggest stores
group. The step came just as Fiat unveiled a big financial restructuring,
including a rights issue and an offer to sell its 46.8 per cent stake in
Rinascente to Fiat shareholders at L9,500 a share.
Fiat's proposal received only a lukewarm response from shareholders, who
bought only about 40 per cent of the stock on offer.
The remainder of Fiat's stake in Rinascente's ordinary share capital went to
the banks underwriting the transaction.
By contrast, Ifil's subsequent offer to buy Rinascente shares at L12,500
each provoked a massive response. However, the terms were deliberately
limited to 33 per cent of the retailer's ordinary shares to avoid triggering
a full takeover bid under Italian stock market rules.
As a result, surplus stock in Rinascente has been flooding the market,
coming either from the banks which underwrote Fiat's sale or disgruntled
private investors seeking to get the best price for their shares.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Delta puts plans for Asia route
expansion on hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delta Air Lines has put on hold earlier plans to launch a big expansion of
its Asia-Pacific operations. Mr Ron Allen, chairman, said yesterday the
airline wanted to concentrate on returning sustained profits.
Delta - the third-largest carrier in the US - is now consolidating its route
structure and considering setting up a low-cost domestic subsidiary.
It moved out of the red with a net profit of Dollars 60.4m for its first
quarter, ended September. However, the latest results, while encouraging,
were still 'not adequate', Mr Allen said.
The airline is in the middle of a four-year cost-cutting plan. 'We are
looking at every route very critically, Mr Allen said. 'We will reallocate
equipment and resources.'
He said the first phase of this process would involve the airline's North
American operations.
The second phase could involve setting up a lower-cost domestic US airline
operation to compete with smaller low-cost carriers. United Airlines is also
considering a similar move.
Mr Allen said Delta was continuing to seek partnerships with other
international carriers to reinforce its worldwide network. Delta holds cross
equity links with Swissair and Singapore Airlines, and is understood to be
in discussions with Virgin Atlantic.
However, its prospects on the highly-competitive transatlantic routes also
hinged on the US securing a new open skies agreement with the UK.
The UK and US are locked in controversy over negotiations on a new agreement
between the two countries. The UK last week threatened to limit the number
of US airline services to London's Heathrow airport in retaliation to US
efforts to curtail British Airways' rights in the US market.
Mr Allen said the US government would consider refusing BA an extension of
its ticket code-sharing agreement with USAir when it runs out on March 15,
unless the UK showed 'more openness' towards US carriers.
'Most US carriers believe in open skies, but we can't keep giving away code
sharing without getting reciprocal rights in the UK,' he said.
He complained that Delta suffered a bigger disadvantage than its two US
rivals, American Airlines and United, because it had no rights to fly to
Heathrow and continued to be restricted to London's Gatwick airport.
'We have no rights to fly from the UK to other European points; no authority
at Heathrow; we can't serve New York; and our capacity is controlled,' he
said.
The collapse this week of the Alcazar merger attempt between Swissair, KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian
Airlines, over the choice of a US partner airline had not weakened Delta's
relationship with Swissair.
Mr Allen said he had been encouraged that Swissair had insisted that Delta
be chosen as the US partner for the thwarted Alcazar project.
After the improvement in its first fiscal quarter, Mr Allen said the second
quarter was likely to be more difficult. Results would also be affected by a
Dollars 100m charge to cover the cost of an early retirement programme
designed to produce annual savings of between Dollars 68m and Dollars 70m.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo awaits shareholder's
decision on Renault merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first of Volvo's major shareholders is expected to decide today whether
it will back the Swedish group's controversial plans to merge its car and
truck operations with state-owned Renault of France.
The so-called Fifth Fund state pension group holds only 1.3 per cent of the
voting capital in Volvo. However, a decision by its board is seen as a key
indicator of whether new information published by Volvo on Monday has swung
opinion among sceptical institutional shareholders in favour of the deal.
A decision is also expected tomorrow by the Fourth Fund state pension group
which, with 7.5 per cent of the voting capital, is the second-largest
shareholder in Volvo after Renault, which holds 10 per cent.
The pension funds are regarded by Volvo as core shareholders which must be
won over if a secure majority is to be gained for the merger at the
rescheduled shareholders meeting on December 7.
On Monday, Volvo said the French state had undertaken not to use a golden
share it plans to hold in the merged Renault-Volvo company to force down
Volvo's proposed 35 per cent holding in the new group.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has also set a target of
privatising Renault by the end of next year. Both issues are central to
Swedish concerns about the merger.
Renault is also hosting a meeting of major Volvo shareholders in Paris
today, in a further bid to win support for the deal.
Meanwhile, Volvo said yesterday a motion had been tabled by a single,
unnamed shareholder for the December 7 meeting calling for the immediate
sacking of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, if the merger is voted
down.
General Electric of the US has pulled out of the bidding for Gota Bank, a
state-owned Swedish bank which the government plans to sell off by the end
of the year, officials said yesterday.
GE was the only foreign bidder for the bank.

FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: US drugs group to take Dollars
468m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer products group,
yesterday announced a Dollars 468m restructuring charge for the latest of a
series of rationalisations in the pharmaceuticals industry.
The company, the US's 14th largest drugs group, blamed the need for the
charge on the profound changes in the pharmaceuticals market place. It
mentioned in particular the growth of managed care in the US, the partial
loss of tax credits from manufacturing in Puerto Rico, and healthcare
reforms in Europe.
The group is using the charge to close seven manufacturing sites, streamline
its salesforce of 1,300 people, and restructure Parke Davis, its
pharmaceuticals division. It said resources would be focused on its new
Alzheimer's drug Cognex. The restructuring would reduce the workforce by
about 2,800 over the coming years.
Mr Melvin Goodes, chief executive, said the company would continue to
strengthen its consumer operations through productivity improvements. The
charge of Dollars 468m is on a pre-tax basis. On a post-tax basis it amounts
to Dollars 327m, or Dollars 2.43 a share. It will be taken against
fourth-quarter earnings.
Research and development spending in the pharmaceuticals division is
currently running at about 20 per cent of sales, as the group struggles to
bring new products to market.
The drugs operations, generating sales of about Dollars 2bn a year, have
been suffering from the expiry in January of the US patents of Lopid, its
top-selling cholesterol-lowering drug which generated sales last year of
Dollars 556m. Revenues from Cognex were held up by the drug's late US
approval in September.
Warner-Lambert also lost Dollars 150m worth of sales this year because it
was forced to shut down six manufacturing plants in the US following
concerns by the Food and Drug Administration.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Applied Holographics picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Applied Holographics, the USM-quoted producer of holographic products for
security and packaging uses, yesterday reported its first operating profit
since it was founded in 1983.
However, losses of Pounds 71,209 (Pounds 57,033) on CFC AH, a US joint
venture, resulted in pre-tax losses of Pounds 60,115 for the six months to
end-September. Losses last time were Pounds 622,383.
Turnover was Pounds 3.04m (Pounds 2.37m), generating operating profits of
Pounds 53,116, compared with losses of Pounds 522,317.
Holographic product sales increased by 54 per cent, but the manufacture of
hot stamping foils declined by 28 per cent as production was progressively
transferred to Whiley Foils under a deal announced in May.
The company said the second half had opened with a slightly lower level of
holographic base business, but there were prospects of a number of
potentially significant con-tracts.
In addition, the new Chicago facilities of CFC AH were now virtually
completed and should be in production for the last quarter.
Mr David Mahony, chairman, said the company's business had now been
stabilised.
Its deficit now stood at Pounds 17.3m.
Losses per share were reduced from 3.1p to 0.29p.
The shares closed 6p lower at 65p.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BTR disposes of US offshoot - Sale
continues strategy of concentrating on core activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, is selling Summers Group, a Texas-based
electrical wholesale business, for up to Dollars 120m (Pounds 80.5m) to
Willcox &amp; Gibbs, the US distribution and manufacturing group.
Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'We are very pleased to have
concluded this divestment which represents a further important step in
reducing our involvement in wholesale distribution.
'It complements our recent divestment of the Newey &amp; Eyre electrical
distribution business in the UK and our stated intention to float the Graham
builders' merchant business in 1994'.
The disposals are in line with BTR's strategy of concentrating resources on
the development of its core industrial manufacturing businesses, which Mr
Jackson has adopted since he became chief executive in 1991.
Summers, based in Dallas, has more than 80 branches in the southern US and
about 1,100 employees. Last year it had sales of Dollars 395m and post-tax
profits of about Dollars 6m. Net assets being sold amount to Dollars 66m.
BTR will receive an initial Dollars 85m and further profit-related payments
of up to Dollars 35m.
In September BTR agreed to sell Newey &amp; Eyre Group, a Birmingham-based
electrical distribution group, for up to Pounds 165m to Hagemeyer, the
Netherlands-based international trading house.
Last month BTR said it would spin off the Graham group of builders'
merchants and other businesses through a stock market flotation in the first
half of next year. The flotation is expected to value the Graham group at
about Pounds 200m.
BTR has won the inaugural British Quality of Management Award, sponsored by
Mori, the market research organisation, and Sundridge Park, the corporate
and executive development organisation. Mori asked financial institutions,
leaders of industry and financial editors of national papers to nominate
companies they believed had quality management.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Litigation costs put Rodime Dollars 2.14m
in red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As foreshadowed at the interim stage, Rodime, the Glasgow-based disk drive
technology licensing company, fell into the red for the year to September
30. It blamed increased litigation spending and lower licensing income.
The pre-tax loss was Dollars 2.14m (Pounds 1.4m) against profits of Dollars
1.69m. Losses per share came out at 1.7 cents, against earnings of 0.8
cents.
The company is still in litigation over patent infringements with three US
disk drive manufacturers - Seagate Technology, Maxtor and Quantum. During
the year the company completed agreements with Samsung Electronics and Sony.
Mr Malcolm McIver, chairman, said that no significant agreements had been
reached in the second half as other companies deferred or delayed
negotiations until the outcome of the three cases was known.
Operating income fell from Dollars 8.69m to Dollars 4.18m.
Bank debts were cut over the year to Dollars 2.7m. The company has, however,
negotiated with the Bank of Scotland an Dollars 8m increase in its Dollars
3m revolving credit facility.
Mr McIver said that would provide sufficient resources to complete its
patent infringement strategy through litigation or negotiation.
The company produced the first 3.5 inch disk drive in the early 1980s. It
has since ceased production and is concentrating on gaining income from
licensing. During the year it completed the disposal of assets of its
subsidiaries and the renegotiation of some obligations of its offshoots
which Rodime had guaranteed.

1992 the group turned in an operating profit of Pounds 2.21m (Pounds

Nesco Investments is selling 70 per cent of its Nigerian interests to its
chairman and managing director and is to concentrate on its software side.
The name is to be changed to DCS Group.
It has also announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds 222,313 to Pounds
231,406 for the year to June 30. The results of its Nigerian offshoot were
excluded on the grounds that the recent political unrest meant that Nesco
had diminished control.
The consideration is Pounds 180,000 cash. Nesco also has an option to sell
the remaining 30 per cent for Pounds 90,000 within five years.
In the year to May 31 the Nigerian company showed a pre-tax profit of N2.85m
(Pounds 55,000). The book value at June 30 was Pounds 152,517.
The sale will realise about Pounds 115,000 for working capital.
Turnover for the year was Pounds 5.55m, against Pounds 5.31m, which included
Pounds 425,000 from the Nigerian side. Earnings per share were 2.92p
(2.45p).

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Stratagem up at Pounds 1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of Stratagem rose from Pounds 386,000 to Pounds 1.2m pre-tax for the
year to August 31. The figures reflected a period of strategic change and
development for the company.
The group has evolved from an investment company into a group with interests
in the manufacturing, distribution and service sectors.
Turnover totalled Pounds 10.5m (nil) and earnings per share worked through
at 9.5p (2.7p). A recommended final dividend of 3.25p makes a same-again
4.75p total.
The directors said they were confident that the various parts of the
enlarged group would benefit from the management and financial changes which
the acquisition of Harrison Industries and the recent Pounds 8m capital
raising had facilitated.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help Readicut advance 12% to
Pounds 6.73m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A continuing cost reduction and investment programme helped Readicut
International lift interim profits by 12 per cent in spite of difficult
markets.
The household textile, carpeting and yarn company reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 6.73m for the half year to September 30, compared with a previous
Pounds 6.01m. The latest figure included a currency benefit of Pounds
212,000.
Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, described market conditions during the
half year as 'far from ideal'.
In the US recovery was proving sluggish, continental Europe was still in
recession, and there were only irregular signs of recovery in the UK.
Profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 6.84m to Pounds 7.39m.
Last time's pre-tax figure included Pounds 517,000 from discontinued
operations, reflecting the group's sale of Russells Rubber in February.
Turnover increased to Pounds 113.4m compared with Pounds 106.7m last time,
when there was a Pounds 5m contribution from discontinued operations. About
Pounds 3.1m of the rise in turnover reflected currency exchange benefits.
Turnover improved in all four divisions. But operating profits were down
from Pounds 1.67m to Pounds 1.5m in the furnishings and household textiles
division, reflecting a fall in sales of car carpeting, and from Pounds 2.23m
to Pounds 1.79m in the yarns and fibres division, reflecting lower sales to
the Middle East of fibre making machinery.
Profits were ahead in all three of the carpet companies, which contributed
Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 1.62m). The industrial products and services division
boosted profits from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 2.02m on the back of a big rise
at Hoyland Fox, which makes umbrella frames.
The group had continued to cut costs and invest. It had shed 79 jobs in the
half year at a cost of Pounds 459,000. Capital expenditure was Pounds 6.8m,
compared with depreciation at Pounds 4.4m.
Net interest payable fell by just over 50 per cent to Pounds 665,000 (Pounds
1.35m). Net borrowings were Pounds 14m at the end of September, giving
gearing of 18 per cent. The comparable figures last time were Pounds 22.3m
and 33 per cent respectively.
Earnings per share rose from 2.12p to 2.36p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 0.63p.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hanson sells US office arm for Pounds 110m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, announced the second disposal of a
US subsidiary in two days yesterday when it said it had agreed to sell
Hanson Office Products for Pounds 110m. It follows Monday's agreed sale of
Axelson for Pounds 56m.
The business is the third largest contract stationer and forms management
company in the US.
The buyer is Corporate Express, a private contract stationer, backed by four
investors, K-Mart, JP Morgan Investment, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, and
InterWest Partners.
Hanson said it was a further part of its drive to reduce debt following its
Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) acquisition of Quantum Chemical Corporation in
the summer.
Hanson Office Products made an operating profit in the year to end-September
of Pounds 9.3m on sales of Pounds 253.7m.
Net book value is Pounds 33m, and with Pounds 66m of goodwill written off on
acquisition, Hanson will show an exceptional gain of about Pounds 10m on the
sale.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: More changes proposed to FT-SE
classifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee has published its
second list of changes to the proposed new classification system which is
due to come into effect on January 4 next year.
The changes follow a second adjudication meeting of the committee which is
part of the consultative process following the publication of initial
proposals in October. A third adjudication meeting will be held next Monday.
The committee has now completed its review of the sectors and sub-sectors,
and has taken decisions on two thirds of the representations made about
individual companies.
It is taking the companies in sector order, so has not yet reached Inchcape,
the international trading and motors group, which has made strong
representations about its classification as a motor distributor.
Yesterday's announce-ment included changes to the insurance sectors and a
further 57 moves of companies to different sub-sectors.
Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, chairman of the committee, said the committee
recognised 'that some companies may be disappointed' but once in operation
classifications would be reviewed quarterly.
One company thought to be disappointed is Wickes, which wanted to move from
builders' merchants to retailers but has stayed put.
The originally proposed Insurance, Composite sector, which had only one
sub-sector also called Insurance, Composite, is to be broadened and renamed
Insurance.
As well as the composite insurers, it will include Insurance, Brokers,
formerly a sub-sector in the Other Financial sector, and a new sub-sector
called Insurance, Lloyd's Funds, which will contain the new listed Lloyds
corporate capital vehicles.
The Insurance, Life sector and sub-sector, will be renamed Life Assurance.
Among the company moves, Allied-Lyons is to switch from the Breweries
sub-sector to Spirits, Wines &amp; Ciders. Siebe and Weir Group have both been
reclassified in Engineering, Diversified from Engineering Contractors.
Vickers, which makes tanks and Rolls-Royce cars, is moving from Engineering,
Aerospace and Defence to Engineering, Diversified.
A full list of the changes will be published in tomorrow's edition of the
Financial Times.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Abbey National increases UK retail deposit
share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the mortgage lender and banking group, said yesterday that
its share of UK retail deposits had 'increased substantially' in the third
quarter of the year.
It gave the estimate in its first quarterly business report.
Abbey said its share of new mortgage lending had fallen from the 27 per cent
achieved in the first half as a result of competitive response to its
marketing of fixed rate products in the six months to June 30.
There had been some narrowing of the retail net interest margin, but this
was offset by lower bad debt charges resulting from further cuts in mortgage
arrears and repossessions.
Mortgage accounts more than six months in arrears fell to 21,100 at the end
of September, against 22,800 at the end of June. The stock of repossessed
properties has fallen by one third this year to 6,189 at the end of
September.
Abbey's shares closed 2p down at 401p.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 11m at nine months for Wace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wace Group rose 3p to 168p after the pre-press and specialist
printing company unexpectedly reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.4m in
the nine months to September 30, writes Andrew Bolger.
Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said that in view of the continued changes in
the group he believed reporting the nine-month result for the first time was
the best way of keeping the market informed of the group's development.
He said the improved performance at the half year had continued. Sales for
the third quarter amounted to Pounds 85.4m, taking the nine-month total
above Pounds 250m. Trading profits in the quarter were Pounds 6.2m,
representing a margin of 7.3 per cent, against 6.9 per cent for the first
six months.
During the third quarter progress was made in cutting borrowings, which fell
Pounds 8.4m in the quarter and by Pounds 12.8m in the nine months. Net
borrowings at the end of September were Pounds 75.9m, down from Pounds 88.7m
at beginning of the year.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Vodafone improves to Pounds 174.5m but
warns of downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone, the UK mobile communications group, reported interim pre-tax
profits up 8.9 per cent from Pounds 160.2m to Pounds 174.5m for the six
months to September 30, but warned that high start-up costs for overseas
licences were likely to depress profits for the next two years.
Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive, also projected additional heavy start-up
losses next year should Vodafone win the licence to run the new national
lottery in its consortium with Hambro's, Carlton and Associated Newspapers.
Mr Whent raised the possibility that in spite of Vodafone's large cash
reserves - Pounds 186.3m at September 30 - it might take on a 'relatively
small' amount of debt to meet investment obligations next year.
Group turnover was up 22 per cent at Pounds 389.8m (Pounds 319.8m), but
operating profit fell from 48 per cent of sales to 43 per cent, mainly
because of new overseas licences.
Through its expansion programme, Vodafone's overseas licences now cover a
population equivalent to 42 per cent of its UK base, adjusting for relative
income.
New networks opened in Greece in July and Australia in October.
To achieve its goal of a 50:50 population split between UK and overseas
licences, adjusting for income, the company intends to bid next year as part
of consortia for new cellular licences expected in Belgium, Italy, France
and the Netherlands.
Overseas operations incurred net losses of Pounds 13m for the six months,
projected to grow to about Pounds 25m over the full year because of start-up
costs.
Mr Whent anticipated losses of about Pounds 50m next year, with networks in
the first year of operation in Germany, South Africa, Fiji and Australia. In
1994-95 overseas investment will for the first time exceed UK investment.
With only 4,500 customers between them, Mr Whent said the growth of the
company's two new UK digital networks was 'slower than expected'. He denied
it was due to the successful launch of Mercury One-2-One's digital service
in the London area, attributing it to the poor availability of handsets and
the robustness of the existing analogue network.
Vodafone achieved 130,000 net new connections to its UK network in the six
months, up 130 per cent on last year.
Earnings per share rose 8.7 per cent to 11.7p (10.8p). An interim dividend
of 4.12p (3.43p) is declared.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ronson named in Dollars 83m Pima lawsuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerald Ronson and his co-director of Heron International, Mr Alan
Goldman, are two of 12 defendants named in an Dollars 83m (Pounds 55.7m)
lawsuit initiated by a US federal agency earlier this month.
The suit concerns Pima Savings &amp; Loan, an Arizona-based thrift, formerly a
subsidiary of Heron. Many believe that without the losses Heron made on Pima
it might have avoided the need for a Pounds 1.4bn financial restructuring,
which was completed in September.
The suit was foreshadowed in Heron's restructuring document published in
May. That disclosed that the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is
investigating the affairs of Pima, had asserted that Dollars 83m had been
lost through 'unsafe and unsound lending practices and mismanagement' among
other things. The RTC demanded repayment of the Dollars 83m from the former
directors and officers of Pima failing the submission of reasons why the RTC
should not seek reimbursement.
The document said that Heron was liable to indemnify the directors and
officers against the losses.
Heron acquired Pima in 1980 and it expanded rapidly. But in the late 1980s
it hit problems, along with hundreds of other savings and loan businesses,
and Heron attempted to sell it.
When these efforts failed, the business was taken over by the Office of
Thrift Supervision in March 1990 and later went into receivership. Heron
wrote its investment in Pima down to nothing.
In the 1990 accounts, Heron showed a loss from discontinued businesses,
largely Pima, of Pounds 193.2m, after a Pounds 39.4m loss in 1989.
In the lawsuit, filed in Phoenix, Arizona, the RTC claimed that under
Heron's ownership Pima had turned from a simple home lender to an aggressive
commercial lender chasing a high return on assets.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Marston Thompson up 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the regional brewer, raised first half profits
by 21 per cent to Pounds 11.5m as reciprocal trading agreements with
national brewers contributed to a 4 per cent increase in beer volumes.
Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said he was optimistic about a satisfactory
outcome for the year though the profit increase in the second half was
likely to be lower.
'With few signs of an upturn in the economy, conditions in the brewing
industry remain difficult and continue to become increasingly competitive,'
he added.
Earnings per share during the six months to September 25, grew 19 per cent
to 8.71p (7.3p) and the interim dividend is raised from 1.45p to 1.6p.
Operating profit rose from Pounds 9.58m to Pounds 11.8m on turnover ahead 11
per cent at Pounds 70.1m (Pounds 63.2m).
Beer volume sales outside the company's own pubs increased by 14 per cent
with benefits from the reciprocal agreements with national brewers, growing
sales of canned draught Pedigree, and a 30 per cent rise in marketing
expenditure.
'The increase in external sales is a highly encouraging result in an area
that we see as having further growth potential,' Mr Hurdle said.
Sales in Marston's own estate declined 3.4 per cent. The managed houses
showed good growth - liquor sales 14 per cent ahead, food sales 16 per cent
higher and retail trading profits growing 25 per cent - but trading
conditions remained difficult for some tenanted pubs.
A long period of decline in volume sales to free houses was arrested and
sales were ahead at the half year. Free trade loans were Pounds 500,000
higher but a Pounds 700,000 provision was also made for bad debts.
Capital expenditure in the first half totalled Pounds 21.8m, including
Pounds 12.7m on pub acquisitions.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Capital Radio advances by 33% to Pounds
11.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Radio, which yesterday announced a one third rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 11.7m for the year to September, is seriously considering applying
for the third national commercial radio franchise.
The Radio Authority will advertise the franchise, which has to be mainly
speech-based, next week and the station could be on air by autumn 1994.
Mr Richard Eyre, managing director, said: 'A lot of work needs to be done
but it is too big a deal to turn down at this stage'.
The format specified by the Radio Authority for the last national commercial
channel in the UK for some time would mean that at least 51 per cent would
have to be speech. Capital, on its two London services already offers music
and sport and could add a more substantial news service.
Capital's profit increase came after excluding the exceptional gain of more
than Pounds 2m from the sale of the Duke of York's Theatre. Earnings per
share rose by 30 per cent to 11.3p.
The dividend is up by 9.5 per cent from 5.25p to 5.75p.
Mr Ian Irvine, chairman, said yesterday there had been a revival of
confidence in radio advertising in the last three months of the year.
'Our efforts to make radio more competitive in the media market place are
bearing fruit,' he added.
Turnover in existing businesses increased by 6.7 per cent while costs were
cut by 1.2 per cent. In the six months since its acquisition, the chairman
said the Midlands Radio group contributed Pounds 1.1m to group operating
profits.
Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 14.5m for the
current year.
The main priority for Capital now is to retain its two London licences when
they come up for renewal next summer.
Mr Eyre said yesterday that Capital FM remained London's number one radio
station with a 17.3 per cent share, 5 percentage points ahead of BBC Radio
1; Capital Gold remains the number two commercial station with an 8.5 per
cent market share.
The shares rose 14p to 223p.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Northern Foods rises 5% to Pounds 72.1m -
Profits held back as intensified competition and continued price-cutting are
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Foods, the dairy and food manufacturing company, yesterday forecast
intensified competition and continued price-cutting by supermarkets after
reporting a 5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 72.1m in the six
months to the end of September.
Northern said its performance had suffered from much faster than expected
growth in liquid milk sales to supermarkets, at the expense of more
profitable doorstep deliveries, and from the continuing decline of small
high street shops.
Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman, said Northern had successfully resisted
pressure to cut its prices to supermarkets and hoped to secure a modest
price rise in May. However, market conditions had obliged it to accelerate
cost-cutting plans.
He said discounting and reductions in product quality caused by competition
in the retail trade were unsustainable in the long run.
They risked damaging supermarkets' brand image, while suppliers which
competed purely on low profits would be unable to make satisfactory
re-turns.
Northern was determined to maintain a high level of product quality and to
continue to compete on innovation, service and value, not on low price.
The increase in the first-half figures, which compare with Pounds 68.4m a
year ago, equalled almost exactly a drop in interest charges, and reflected
mixed operating results. Sales rose by 3.5 per cent from Pounds 969.9m to
Pounds 1bn.
Operating profit of the dairy division edged up to Pounds 40m (Pounds 39.7m)
 -the first time Mr Haskins could remember when the performance of the
business had stagnated.
Sales increased by 4 per cent to Pounds 477.3m (Pounds 457.1m), reflecting a
surge in liquid milk sales to supermarkets, which carry a lower margin.
Doorstep delivery volumes, excluding acquisitions, fell by 11 per cent.
The company expected doorstep deliveries to fall to 30 per cent of total
liquid milk deliveries in less than five years.
Operating profit on convenience foods rose from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 22.5m
on sales of Pounds 272.3m (Pounds 262.4m), while grocery saw profits advance
to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 8.6m) on sales of Pounds 105.9m (Pounds 92.3m).
Sales to Marks and Spencer, Northern Foods' biggest customer, had advanced
strongly, while Park Cakes and Fox's businesses had performed particularly
well.
However, profit on meat products fell to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 11.4m) on sales
of Pounds 148.3m (Pounds 158.1m). The declines reflected a reduction in van
sales to small shops and selective trading down by consumers.
Earnings per share advanced to 9.37p (8.99p).
The interim dividend is raised from 3.4p to 3.5p.
COMMENT
Northern Foods appears so far to have fended off retailer pressures to cut
prices, thanks partly to its emphasis on premium products such as chilled
foods and up-market groceries, which are on the sidelines of the
supermarkets' war. However, not all its customers are like Marks and
Spencer. Its biggest weak spot is liquid milk, almost half its business.
Though it insists retailers are bearing most of the cost, their aggressive
pricing is capturing sales from doorstep deliveries at alarming speed.
Meanwhile, its highly profitable sales to small shops are suffering, as more
consumers desert them for big supermarkets. At this stage, Northern Foods'
warnings that the price war is unsustainable seem based more on hope than
expectation. With no sign of a let-up in the second half, analysts have been
downgrading their full-year forecasts to no more than Pounds 160m, compared
with Pounds 153m last time.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: NSM Pounds 699,000 in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NSM, the heavily-indebted international coal company, showed pre-tax profits
of Pounds 699,000 for the six months to September 30, compared with losses
of Pounds 1.98m last time.
The results are the first since the completion of a series of disposals
designed to reduce borrowings which began in March 1991. Borrowings had
fallen to Pounds 88.6m (Pounds 94.6m) at the half-way stage, amounting to
some 158 per cent (200 per cent) of shareholders' funds of Pounds 56m
(Pounds 47.2m).
Interest payments of Pounds 3.94m (Pounds 4.96m) eroded profits, mainly
struck on coal businesses in the UK and the US, of Pounds 4.64m (Pounds
2.98m), including a Pounds 576,000 contribution (Pounds 621,000 loss) from
discontinued operations.
Turnover fell to Pounds 56.9m (Pounds 62.3m) without the benefit of last
time's Pounds 5.44m contribution from discontinued operations.
Future growth in the UK would come from cutting costs and selling additional
tonnage to the electricity generators 'in due course', said Mr John Jermine,
chief executive. In the US, the company's operations were well placed to
benefit from clean air legislation planned to be in force by 1995.
NSM was also due to see income from renting out landfill sites likely to
start in the early part of 1994: 'Ex-coal sites are ideally engineered to
operate as landfill sites,' said Mr Jermine.
He had joined the company in 1991 and admitted NSM had a history of
ill-starred diversifications: 'I have no plans to diversify. The key
objective remains to build on the US operations and reduce debt.'
He said there were 'no obvious ways for reducing the debt' further, barring
small rump disposals. The company was only likely to consider a rights issue
to cover the cost of any future acquisition which is not currently foreseen.
NSM's shares are roughly 90 per cent held by institutions, including the
Kuwait Investment Office, whose resources have been depleted by the costs of
the Gulf war and losses on Spanish investments. NSM said the KIO had a 9 per
cent stake which it had so far said it had no plans to sell.
Earnings per share were 4.3p (10.5p losses) but the company has no plans to
return to the dividend list in the near future.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: In no man's land - neither a hard
discounter nor superstore / A look at Kwik Save amid fears that it may be
hard hit in the supermarket price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the ironies of retailing that Kwik Save, for so long one of the
UK's cheapest supermarket chains, is facing fears that it may be one of the
hardest hit by the latest supermarket price war.
On the face of it, all is well at the 810-store discount chain, with Kwik
Save forecast today to announce a rise in full-year pre-tax profits from
Pounds 110.6m to about Pounds 125m. Its share price has also held its value
rather better this year than those of the superstore chains.
But while the most recent slide in the shares of the biggest chains, which
began after Sainsbury cut the price of 300 own-label products, has abated,
the downwards spiral has continued at Kwik Save. Its shares have lost almost
10 per cent in the last three weeks.
That might seem puzzling, since Kwik Save virtually invented 'hard'
discounting - selling a limited range off narrow margins at very low prices
in no-frills shops - in the UK.
Its founders developed their first supermarket, Value Foods, at Prestatyn in
North Wales in 1962. Renamed Kwik Save in 1965, the chain was modelled on
the pioneer of discounting in Europe, Germany's Aldi. It developed a potent
formula which outlasted would-be rivals such as Victor Value and Pricerite,
and has enjoyed both the highest returns on capital - at close to 40 per
cent - and the fastest underlying sales growth in the industry.
However, fears now surfacing in the City centre on a strategic decision Kwik
Save made in 1988 to expand its range from about 600 to about 2,500 product
lines. That was made possible by investment in new computer systems linked
to laser-scanning at the check-outs.
The move, say critics, has slowed Kwik Save's stock turn, pushed up costs,
and left it no longer able to offer the keenest prices. They fear Kwik Save
has wandered into 'no man's land', where it is neither a hard discounter,
nor a superstore.
Competition is stiffening at both ends of the market. At one end, Kwik Save
faces competition from a new generation of fast-expanding hard discounters.
Ironically, one of these is Aldi, inspiration for Kwik Save in the 1960s,
while another is Shoprite, set up by the son of one of the co-founders of
Kwik Save.
These stick more faithfully to the original discounting principle of
carrying only 600 to 1,000 lines.
At the other end of the spectrum, market leader Sainsbury has cut the prices
of basic goods to a level where they compete with the discounters, and
Tesco, the UK's number two, has launched its Tesco Value line of low-priced
basics. Safeway is cutting prices too.
Kwik Save counters that it is not in danger of losing sales in either
direction, as its introduction of new technology allowed it to extend its
range without sacrificing its edge on price. It claims it can match or beat
the prices of the hard discounters while offering up to three times as many
items.
Moreover, it argues that the expansion of range by the big supermarket
operators through the 1980s from about 4,000 lines to more than 15,000
raised customers' expectations about the number of products they should find
even in a discount store. Kwik Save says it is alone among discounters in
meeting those expectations.
City analysts dispute this, however, claiming that Kwik Save has resorted to
tactical pricing, lowering its prices in areas where it competes directly
with a hard discounter, and so sacrificing margins. One claimed last week
that Kwik Save was even having to lower prices to compete with the
superstores.
Kwik Save's other counter-argument is that it is under-represented in
several parts of the country, particularly south-east England and Scotland.
It is opening up to 80 new stores a year, at an average cost of less than
Pounds 1m per store - against about Pounds 20m for a large superstore - all
funded organically.
In spite of its expansion plans, Kwik Save could be facing a slow-down in
profits growth, and a squeeze on its margins. While some analysts have kept
their forecast for next year's profits at about Pounds 145m to Pounds 150m,
others have dropped them as low as Pounds 128m. The operating margin is
forecast to drop from more than 5 per cent in the late 1980s to below 4 per
cent next year.
The pressure is now on Mr Graeme Bowler, who replaced Mr Graeme Seabrook as
managing director in June and gives his first results presentation tomorrow.
As a former managing director of Franklins, a hard discounter in Australia,
some analysts expect him to be a more aggressive retailer than his
predecessor. They will be listening hard for any indications that Kwik Save
may trim its range to improve prices and move back towards its hard
discounting roots.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Low demand for Lilliput
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail investors and employees have taken up only 24.7 per cent of the
shares available to them in Lilliput Group, the Cumbria-based manufacturer
of hand-painted miniature china cottages.
The company earlier this month placed a total of 12.04m ordinary shares,
priced at 135p, with institutional and other investors.
Of the total, 4.2m were subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through
intermediaries.
Just over 1m have been recalled, of which 35,000 will go to eligible
employees.
The flotation is raising Pounds 16.3m for existing shareholders and Pounds
2.43m net of expenses for the company, of which Pounds 1.47m will be used to
redeem preference and deferred shares.
Dealings begin tomorrow.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: St Paul injects Pounds 20m into the Lloyd's
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Paul Companies, the leading US insurance and financial services group, is
to become the second international insurance company to join the Lloyd's of
London insurance market, taking advantage of the rec-ent opening to
corporate capital.
Last month Yasuda Fire and Marine, Japan's second biggest insurance company,
injected Pounds 1.5m of capital into its Lloyd's subsidiary.
St Paul injected Pounds 20m into a new subsidiary, Camperdown Corporation,
which will supply between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m of capacity to 10 to 15
Lloyd's syndicates in 1994.
Mr Jeff Post, of St Paul, said the group was particularly interested in
obtaining access to specialist markets such as ocean marine and war risk
through its participation at Lloyd's. It was also seeking to underwrite some
catastrophe business.
Mr Post said that following the failure or scaling back of some of the new
Lloyd's investment trusts there was a 'new rush for capacity from some
syndicate managers'.
Merchant banks and securities have raised more than Pounds 800m from
institutional and retail investors in the past few weeks. And two large US
investment companies - London Market Investors and Lutine Capital
Corporation - still have to finalise plans to raise some Dollars 600m
(Pounds 403m) from international investors.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Knight's role cut in Murdoch empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Knight, once designated as Mr Rupert Murdoch's chosen successor in
the event of emergency, has given up the executive chairmanship of News
International.
The former editor of The Economist will in future only be chairman of the
company that holds Mr Murdoch's UK interests.
Mr Gus Fischer, managing director of News International, will become chief
executive.
News International, which has interests ranging from five national
newspapers in the UK to a 50 per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting,
made it clear that the change of title would give Mr Fischer 'executive
oversight of News International'.
As a result the chairman would be free 'to concentrate on the corporate
interests of the company'.
News International said yesterday that the new title followed the changes in
function that had in effect already happened.
Mr Fischer who also remains chief operating officer of the main Murdoch
corporate vehicle News Corporation will continue to run News International
on a day-to-day basis.
Mr Knight will concentrate on relations with government and other companies
and with regulatory issues.
In 1990 Mr Murdoch said Mr Knight would be his successor until his children
grew up 'if I should turn out to be mortal'.
The News Corp chairman and chief executive said last year that nothing had
changed 'except that the children are older'. In October Mr Murdoch said his
wife Anna would act as non-executive chairman in an emergency. There was no
mention of Mr Knight.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Defence quietens music at Thorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI yesterday announced half-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 105m, in
line with City expectations, but its shares fell 35p to 914p.
Investor dissatisfaction arose from a poor showing from the defence
electronics business, which Thorn failed to sell to the General Electric
Company earlier this year.
An operating loss of Pounds 14.7m in the technology subsidiary, compared
with a Pounds 1.4m loss last time, overshadowed strong performances from the
main music and rental businesses. The technology subsidiary includes defence
and commercial electronics activities and security.
The pre-tax figure for the six months to September 30, virtually unchanged
from Pounds 105.2m last time, included exceptional costs of Pounds 10m, most
of which arose from the sale of Thorn lighting and of Thames Television.
Total turnover was up slightly to Pounds 2.1bn from Pounds 1.9bn.
Some investors were upset at the group's conservative dividend policy. The
interim payout was a maintained 9p on earnings per share of 13.8p, against
16.6p. The group said the final dividend would be increased at least in line
with inflation.
Mr Bruce Jones, an analyst at Smith New Court, focused on the defence
losses. He said: 'The defence business let the side down. People expected
the loss to be a lot smaller. If you're in Thorn, you're in Thorn for music
and rental, but these other businesses keep getting in the way.'
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, agreed that the continued presence of the
defence business made it difficult for investors to concentrate on music and
rentals. He said the question of demerging the music and rental arms could
not be addressed until the defence business had been sold. He said, however,
that Thorn had demonstrated over the past few years that it would not sell
its defence business for less than the group thought it was worth.
Operating profits at EMI Music grew 48.3 per cent to Pounds 89.9m, aided by
a strong performance from Virgin, which Thorn purchased from Mr Richard
Branson last year. Sir Colin said Virgin had now been fully integrated into
the group, except in Spain, where Thorn was building a new distribution
centre.
Rental operating profits were up 17.7 per cent to Pounds 52.6m. Sir Colin
said the group was confident it had the right procedures in place to deal
with any malpractice at Rent-A-Center, its US rental subsidiary. He said
that Mr Warren Rudman, the former US Senator investigating newspaper
allegations of unorthodox money collection at the subsidiary, would
recommend ways in which the procedures could be strengthened.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Allied-Lyons rises 15% despite fall in brewing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, reported a 14.6 per
cent increase in first-half profits in spite of a lower than expected
contribution from brewing. Carlsberg-Tetley, the brewing joint venture
formed last December, faced heavy discounting by competitors in a UK market
in which volumes were still affected by recession and by cross-Channel
shopping.
Trading profits of Pounds 63m were up to 20 per cent below market
expectations. Beer sales dipped well below the overall 3 per cent decline
for the industry, partly because of a reduced number of pubs, and market
share fell 0.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
The results did not alter Allied's long-term confidence. 'We see brewing as
a good long-term cash generator and we have been determined not to chase
volume at all costs,' said Mr Tony Hales, chief executive.
Allied's commitment to establishing Carlsberg-Tetley as a strong leading
brewer was unaffected, he added. 'But that task will not be helped if the
chancellor fails to deal with the impact of cross-border shopping. Latest
estimates are that the current loss of duty and VAT revenue on drink is
running at least at Pounds 340m, with Pounds 100m in beer alone.'
Group pre-tax profits, excluding exceptionals, for the 28 weeks to September
18, rose from Pounds 267m to Pounds 306m, helped by a Pounds 10m gain from
currency translation. On an FRS3 basis, taxable profits increased from
Pounds 234m to Pounds 285m, after an exceptional loss of Pounds 21m on the
disposal of the Chateau Latour vineyard.
Trading profit was 7.2 per cent ahead at Pounds 400m on turnover up from
Pounds 2.57bn to Pounds 2.73bn.
The Hiram Walker spirits division raised its profits 3.4 per cent to Pounds
181m. 'Premium brand performance supports the view that spirits brands
continue to have a bright future,' said Mr Hales.
Leading Scotch whisky brands gained volume - Ballantine's in Germany,
eastern Europe, Mexico, Venezuela and duty-free markets; Teacher's in
northern and eastern Europe. Beefeater gin reaped volume and share gains in
the UK and Spain; Courvoisier cognac became the brand leader in the UK
licensed trade.
Retailing profits increased 6 per cent to Pounds 121m. Average managed pub
profits rose more than 12 per cent with food sales 10 per cent ahead.
Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin Donuts planned to open another 150 franchise
stores to add to the 2,098 outlets in 52 countries. Food manufacturing
contributed Pounds 36m.
Earnings per share grew 5 per cent to 18.9p and the interim dividend is
lifted in line with earnings growth to 7.3p.

FT  24 NOV 93 / The vexed question of fund measurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dogged resistance of British actuaries to the hegemony of the American
financial theorists continued this week with the publication of a paper on
the measurement of portfolio managers' skills.
'Disciples of modern portfolio theory have confused risk with volatility or
variability,' says the paper by Nick Day, Sos Green and Jack Plymen. The
three prefer a quite different concept which they dub 'embedded risk' and
which they define as the risk that shares deliver investment returns which
are lower than expected.
The arguments have gone on for a long time. Two or three years ago one of
the founding fathers of MPT, Harry Markowitz, who produced his original
thesis in 1952, and his classic book Portfolio Selection in 1959, was brave
enough to attend a debate at the Faculty of Actuaries in Edinburgh. He was
courteous, but declined to agree that he should redraft his theory which
used the variance of the mean as a measure of the risk.
It all depends, of course, on what you are trying to achieve. Americans are
much more impressed by the importance and the validity of short-term market
values, which explains why they are so obsessed with the quality of
financial reporting, with control of insider trading and so on.
Outside America many investment practitioners believe that market values are
too volatile and unreliable to form the basis for long-term decisions.
British actuaries, for instance, have developed concepts of smoothed market
values. When they assess the solvency of life assurance companies or pension
schemes they value the assets and liabilities on a long-term basis.
Hence their lack of comprehension of the US approach. Short-term price
volatility has no place in the valuation basis of UK pension funds. For the
same reason, the idea that treasury bills are somehow 'riskless' assets
seems bizarre. Their short-term volatility of returns may be negligible but
they certainly do not amount to a riskless way of financing salary-linked
pension liabilities.
But how on earth can you assess whether some shares will achieve targeted
returns with more certainty than others? According to MPT, when markets are
efficient it is impossible to achieve excess returns through stockpicking.
Yet even the American academics have moved away to an increasing extent from
extreme views about market efficiency. The academic debate these days is
more about the degree to which inefficiency exists and can be exploited.
Management techniques in an efficient market should differ from those where
inefficiency exists to a significant degree.
The three actuaries, however, go much further. They say: 'With the
enormously improved statistical background and the increased power of
computerised analysis we suggest that it is now possible to find shares that
are exceptionally cheap and liable to outperform the market over a
reasonable period.'
This is a controversial claim. The power of computers can work both ways:
you can argue that the more numbers are being crunched the more efficient
the market's pricing ought to be. The authors' proof comes down to the
performance of two equity funds, one the small portfolio of a professional
society and the other the much larger fund of a Perpetual unit trust, the
American Growth Fund. Both were monitored for a year, and the first
outperformed its benchmark slightly, the second by a handsome margin.
The authors admit that two portfolios tracked over one year have no
statistical significance. The Perpetual fund does not appear to be a very
suitable example because turnover during the year was more than 100 per
cent; presumably the managers were very good at spotting short-term trading
opportunities, but has this much to do with the risk that shares will fail
to meet long-term targets?
Surely fund performance should be tracked at least over the full course of a
market cycle, including both bull and bear markets, before the portfolio
managers' risks and skills can be properly assessed.
British actuaries can be guilty of short-termism after all.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Weak oil price prompts Elf to issue warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group scheduled to be the first big
privatisation of next year, yesterday warned that 1993 profits would fall to
little more than FFr1bn (Pounds 114m) compared with the FFr6.2bn achieved
last year.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman in August, blamed the decline
on the fall in the oil price, depressed trading conditions, provisions
against stakes in other companies and exceptional charges for restructuring.
He outlined a strategy of cutting costs, limiting capital expenditure and
selling non-core assets to reduce financial charges and improve
profitability. Shares in Elf fell by FFr15.8 to FFr416.7 following the
announcement.
Most industry observers in Paris, however, said the forecast 20 per cent
decline in operating profits was largely in line with expectations. The
planned exceptional costs reflected Mr Jaffre's desire to clear the decks
for privatisation.
'He is getting the bad news out of the way,' said one analyst. 'By taking
these losses now Elf is enhancing its recovery prospects for 1994 and 1995.'
Mr Jaffre emphasised the strength of the group's core operations and the
resilience of its cashflow, and said the dividend would be maintained at
FFr13 per share.
Most of the blame for the downturn in profits was placed on the effects of
depressed demand in Europe and the weak oil price. The decline in the oil
price is estimated to have cost the group about FFr1bn in net profits.
'Our core business is in Europe and we are being affected by recession' said
Mr Jaffre. He added that recovery would be gradual, and that the group's
chemicals operations would probably suffer a loss this year.
Exceptional charges, which are expected to reduce net income by about
FFr2.2bn for the year, include costs for restructuring, principally in the
chemicals operations. Provisions will also be taken against the reduced
value of some of Elf's shareholdings in other companies.
Elf Sanofi, the group's pharmaceuticals subsidiary, also issued a profits
warning. It said net profits this year would be about FFr800m after
exceptional charges of FFr350m. Last year, net profits were FFr1.05bn.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Dublin will not drop Ulster claim, Unionist leader warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Molyneaux dealt a serious blow to the Major-Reynolds peace
initiative last night, warning that efforts to persuade Dublin to drop its
territorial claim over Northern Ireland were probably doomed.
But the Ulster Unionist party leader coupled his remarks with a surprisingly
upbeat assessment of the prospects for agreeing a form of devolved
government for the province.
Downing Street welcomed Mr Molyneaux's support for efforts to agree on
government structures for Ulster and said his criticism of the
Major-Reynolds initiative was 'understandable'. Its discussions with the
Irish government would continue.
Mr Molyneaux's strongly worded Commons statement, which cast a further pall
over next month's planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin, came as Mr John
Major signalled his determination to test the IRA's willingness to agree to
end its use of violence for good.
Mr Major also gave his first public acknowledgment of 'suggestions' that the
IRA may be considering an end to violence.
Intelligence reports seen by Mr Major, who will today meet Rev Ian Paisley,
leader of the Democratic Unionists, have supported the view that Mr Gerry
Adams, Sinn Fein leader, may be ready to call a halt to the violence.
Under the gaze of Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, Mr
Molyneaux said London and Dublin appeared to have made 'no progress
whatever' in their talks on Dublin's territorial claim over the province.
He said there was no reason to question the judgment of Mr Albert Reynolds,
the Irish prime minister, that he would be defeated if he submitted the
claim to a referendum in the republic. 'Nor should anyone assume that the
approval of his electorate would be given in return for a British surrender
to the demands of Mr Adams.'
He went on: 'The disastrous juxtaposition of discussions on political
progress with the price demanded by the IRA in return for a halt to murder
means in effect that Her Majesty's government is being required to do a
deal, not with Mr Reynolds, but with Mr Adams.' Dublin, he said, 'is merely
the conduit'.
Later, he appeared to call for London and Dublin to halt their talks, saying
there was a connection between Mr Adams' plans and last week's leaked Dublin
draft position paper.
But Mr Molyneaux said he was confident a plan for a 'durable accountable
democracy' could be accepted, just as it was 'widely agreed' during last
year's failed talks involving the province's four non-violent political
parties.
The government's efforts to secure agreement on a devolved government for
the province could supply 'the essential ingredient which will stabilise a
dangerously volatile situation'.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Watchdog urges banks to heed customer needs in product sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers need a separate course in ethics to stop them selling their
customers products that may not meet their needs, said the industry's
consumer watchdog yesterday.
According to Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman, bankers are subject
to an increase in commercial pressure to be competitive in their approach to
customers.
In his annual report Mr Shurman highlighted the pressure to 'oversell'
insurance products, saying the commission earned was very profitable. He
criticised the banks for not always explaining the limitations of policies
clearly enough to potential customers.
He added that this was only one example of the increasingly competitive
environment. He said banking ethics should be taught as a formal subject to
underpin the banking practice code, which is currently being reviewed.
According to Mr Shurman's report, the numbers of complaints against banks in
the year to September showed signs of levelling out. However, consumer
pressure groups said this still left complaints at an unacceptable level.
The apparent levelling follows an increase of 60 per cent over the previous
12 months.
Mr Shurman said small-business complaints for the six months to the end of
September represented just under one-fifth of complaints to the ombudsman.
However, the complaints scheme has been open to small companies only since
January this year. The numbers are expected to rise next year.
The total of new complaints rose to 10,231, compared with 10,109 in the year
to September 1992. There was, however, a sharper rise in the number of
complaints accepted for full investigation - which the British Bankers'
Association says gives a truer picture of the scheme. These rose to 1,111
from 956, an increase of 16 per cent.
The average award made was just over Pounds 1,000, but the highest award -
to a small company - was Pounds 81,700.
Complaints that existing customers had not been told about new deposit
accounts with better terms, and reports of difficulties with cash machines
have fallen since last year, while mortgage complaints have risen.
Mr Shurman urged banks to show more sensitivity even when they were in the
right.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Book pricing scheme faces review: OFT will consider
public-interest aspects of publishers' accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected decision to re-examine the net book agreement, which governs
the price of most books sold in the UK, was announced yesterday by the
Office of Fair Trading.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, said he
would consider whether the scheme operated against the public interest.
It was more than 30 years since the restrictive practices court had decided
that the agreement did not operate against the public interest, he said.
Because of enormous changes since then in the economics of publishing and
retailing 'we must now consider the possibility that the court would reach a
different judgment today on the effects of the agreement'.
The agreement allows publishers to decide on the minimum price for a book.
It is one of the most contentious issues in British publishing.
Its opponents, such as Mr Terry Maher, the former chairman of Pentos, owners
of the Dillons bookshop chain, argue that by preventing discounting it keeps
the price of books artificially high. In turn, that limits the numbers sold.
The Publishers Association argues, however, that the agreement supports the
publishing of a wide range of titles and is important to the survival of
independent bookshops.
Sir Bryan appears to have taken his decision because the government has not
found parliamentary time this session for proposed legislation prohibiting
anti-competitive agreements.
He said: 'I consider, therefore that I should review the case under existing
legislation, in order to decide whether to apply to the Court for leave to
have its decisions reviewed.'
The Publishers Association expressed regret at his decision because the OFT
reviewed the agreement in 1989 and concluded 'that there had not been such
changes in circumstances as to justify seeking a new reference to the
court'.
The OFT can apply to the Restrictive Practices Court for leave to have its
decisions reconsidered if there is prima facie evidence of a material change
in circumstances relevant to the court's original reasoning.
The OFT intends to look at everything from changes to the cost and
technology of producing books to the profitability of book publishing and
retailing.

FT  24 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Were it not for the difficult markets in which it operates, the interim
figures from Allied-Lyons would be truly disappointing. The excuse for the
mere 3.4 per cent rise in profits from wines and spirits was the run-down of
US stockpiles of European drinks, built up during last year's transatlantic
trade dispute over oilseeds. But any distortion on that score must surely be
offset by gains on currency movements. Similarly the 10.5 per cent rise in
brewing profits conceals a distressingly weak start to the Carlsberg-Tetley
joint venture, which is not included in the previous year's figures.
Evidently Allied, having had its hands full with the competition policy
aspects, misjudged the extent of discounting in the beer market when the
venture was finally launched.
Retailing and, in a more modest way, food manufacturing, look better. But
the former generates little cash. So it is difficult to see anything other
than a slow reduction in the group's Pounds 2bn debt, especially if the flow
of proceeds from disposals slows and pension contributions resume. Allied
has also slipped a further Pounds 43m of provisions on to its balance sheet,
largely to cover restructuring at Carlsberg-Tetley which will entail
additional cash outlays.
The consolation to investors daunted by such a hard slog is a yield
approaching 5 per cent. That looks doubly attractive with base rates at 5.5.
From Allied's perspective, the Bank's timing was indeed precise.

FT  24 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was more fodder for the bulls than meat for the bears in Vodafone's
interim results. The drop in operating margin was due to start-up losses
overseas rather than competitive pressure at home. Declining revenue per
subscriber in the UK is a reminder that margins will fall over time, but
Vodafone is still attracting new customers fast enough to maintain momentum.
Importantly, Mercury's One-2-One network appears to be expanding rather than
cannibalising the market for mobile phones.
Yet it is early to draw firm conclusions about the impact of low-cost
competition. Hutchison is waiting in the wings, and pricing could take
another downward lurch next year. Vodafone therefore looks wise to pursue
growth overseas. Operating losses from overseas projects this year and next
 -and sharply higher capital expenditure - are the price. But while its UK
business is throwing off cash and generating double-digit profits growth,
Vodafone can stand the strain. Cash piles have few attractions anyway with
interest rates so low.
With US investors determined to focus on the value of Vodafone's portfolio
of licences, even substantial dents in profits and cash flow will not
undermine the shares. Judging the worth of cellular phone licences from
Greece to Fiji is no easy matter, but the appreciation of Vodafone's shares
during the summer owes much to efforts to do so. Whether such notional
valuations will be justified by earnings is less certain.

FT  24 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In general, investors are paying far more for shares than trade buyers are
prepared to offer for companies, as the current dearth of takeovers
indicates. Thorn is a case in point. It is hard to argue that the stock
market undervalues the company. The interim divided was flat and the annual
pay-out may be raised only a little above the rate of inflation. Thereafter,
it will take time to rebuild cover sufficiently to justify significant
increases. Earnings will remain depressed by the horrors of Thorn's
seemingly unsaleable defence business, which lost Pounds 14.7m in the first
half. Meanwhile, the noise emanating from the investigations into its US
rental arm and CD division will continue to drown out the vibrant underlying
performance of both businesses.
Investors may fondly imagine that other companies, with an urge to follow
the multi-media fashion, could well place a higher value on Thorn's assets.
With 22 per cent of the global music market, Thorn is undoubtedly a hot
intellectual property. Like Paramount in film production, Thorn commands
scarcity value. Yet the benefits of vertical integration in music production
and distribution remain unproven. Moreover, with the diversified Thorn
currently trading on a similar rating to the narrowly-focused Polygram, the
market is already implicitly placing a sky-high value on Thorn's music
business. It seems unlikely that any potential predator would be prepared to
offer more.

FT  24 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Back to base
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The only real surprise about yesterday's base rate cut was its timing.
Markets have long discounted a cut near the time of the Budget. Its arrival
a week early might seem neither here nor there, but it does mean that a half
point is all the market can expect. Indeed, the Bank, which only a few weeks
ago was arguing against a cut, has set something of a floor under interest
rates for the time being. On its own admission, yesterday's cut takes into
account the overall stance of the Budget - evidently the Governor has
enjoyed an insight so far denied to the full cabinet. If the markets are
disappointed by the content of the Budget itself, there will be no
consolation in the thought that a large rate cut could be in the offing.
Nor does a mere half point cut suggest that much radical pruning of the PSBR
is planned. Were the chancellor to be planning a full frontal attack on
mortgage interest relief, say, a deeper rate cut would have been in order.
That would not preclude some deft manipulation of income tax allowances
which would shift a greater burden on to higher rate tax payers while
permitting an expansion of the 20 per cent band. Mr Clarke will surely still
want to make a splash with his first effort. The political attractions of
such an approach are beguiling.
If that is indeed the approach, the markets may be less impressed by his
failure to correct the overall deficit. Yesterday's cut almost certainly
brought the trough of the interest rate cycle closer. Yet the recovery
remains modest, and at some stage a painful fiscal adjustment looms. There
is little enticement for equities in that. If base rates have little further
to fall, there is not much to go for at the short end of the gilt market
either. That will make the PSBR harder to fund as long as it remains large.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Clarke nudges UK base rate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The half a percentage point cut in the UK base rate of interest announced
yesterday is a bit of a disappointment. It is disappointing not so much in
itself, as for what it suggests about the prospective balance of fiscal and
monetary policy. If next week's fiscal adjustment were of comparably modest
proportions, the chancellor would have failed to achieve the necessary
rebalancing of UK macroeconomic policy.
A country with a floating exchange rate can at least correct monetary policy
mistakes relatively easily. Fiscal mistakes are another matter. If this
opportunity for a decisive rebalancing were to be lost, it may prove
difficult to correct the error before the next election. By then, it could
well be too late.
When Mr Clarke states that the base rate cut takes 'full account of the
overall stance of the Budget', he would seem to be making two points: first
and most obviously, that no further cuts can be expected at the time of the
Budget; second and more speculatively, that the Budget will contain only a
modest further fiscal tightening.
That the Bank of England has been allowed to determine the timing of the
decision is not all that important. It is intended to reinforce credibility
by divorcing the timing of changes from any specific political event or
particular economic indicator. This is sensible. But Mr Clarke remains the
organ grinder.
Yesterday's cut is the first one of just half a point since May 1992, which
suggests that the exceptional period of large cuts that followed sterling's
exit from the ERM is now over. Small frequent changes are indeed a sensible
way of adapting to modest changes in circumstances. Small, infrequent
changes are another matter.
Lower inflation
This is, after all, the first interest rate cut in 10 months. Yet that
period has seen encouraging progress on inflation, particularly in view of
the devaluation. It has also seen a marked downward adjustment in
expectations of inflation. At the same time, recovery has proceeded at a
modest pace, if faster than the Treasury expected last March. If this
performance justifies no more than a half point cut in base rate, the
government does indeed seem determined to lower inflation towards the middle
of its 1-4 per cent target range. The top end is, it appears, not low
enough.
The aim is defensible. The UK has after all paid a high price to get
inflation down. But pursuit of the aim in this way is risky.
One danger is that fiscal tightening may become still more necessary, since
slow recovery would of itself entail a correspondingly modest improvement in
the fiscal position. The worry is that no more than a modest improvement
from what is the UK's biggest ever inflation-adjusted deficit in peace time
may undermine the credibility of the government's low inflation objective.
This would increase the chances of an economically depressing rise in
long-term nominal interest rates.
Monetary easing
The possibility that a modest monetary easing may, in the end, necessitate a
larger fiscal adjustment than a sharp one is only one danger. Also
problematic is the UK's external position. It is possible to take a purist
position on the fact that the UK is running a current account deficit while
output is still well below potential. But the purist position depends on the
implausible assumption that resources can be shifted smoothly and easily
into the production of tradeable goods and services.
All the evidence on the performance of the UK economy over the long term
suggests this is not true. It takes a long time before changes in
profitability lead to increased investment in industries exposed to the
pressures of external competition. This makes it still more desirable that
the fiscal and monetary policy mix be consistent with securing sustained
profitability. The UK's economic position today offers an invaluable
opportunity to secure that aim, alongside low inflation.
A large fiscal adjustment offset by further reductions in base rates would
be the best policy. True, it would risk a short-term spike in headline
inflation. But it would also rebalance the economy and reduce the risks
posed by the fiscal deficit. Boldness is sometimes safer than the
comfortable alternative of 'steady as she goes'. This is such a time.

Can the Leeds Permanent, Britain's fifth biggest building society, do
nothing right? Nine months after its chief executive announced he was
quitting, it has yet to find a permanent replacement. It failed to carry
through its planned merger with National Provincial and yesterday it told
the Press Association it was cutting its mortgage rate by half a point and
then changed its mind. 'I got over-excited and jumped the gun,' explained an
embarrassed young man in the press office.

Joo Alves, the lucky Brazilian politician who recently attributed his wealth
to lottery winnings rather than kickbacks, is even luckier than Observer
thought.
According to the Caixa Economica Federal, a government agency investigating
the case, for Alves' version to be correct he must have won the lottery
24,000 times in the space of five years and pocketed some Dollars 9m in
winnings. Still, this is the land of entrepreneurial spirit, as one Rio de
Janeiro lottery demonstrates. Its latest advertising slogan runs: 'Your
chances are back - Joo Alves is no longer playing.'

No other country makes such a song and dance about its budget as does
Britain. Now even the British Psychological Society is in on the act, for
the first time briefing the nation's media on its own nutty ideas.
In the event, Cary Cooper from UMIST, together with his former PhD student
Howard Kahn, now at Heriot-Watt, were hard put to go beyond the basic
truisms.
The budget 'can make people feel more or less financially secure, which can
inevitably affect their spending or investing or entrepreneurial
behaviours'.
When cornered, Cooper and Kahn admitted they had no research to back up
their conclusions. Cooper had rung overseas colleagues to see if they had
looked into psychology and their budgets. They hadn't. Surprise, surprise.

Michael Heseltine is keen to join forces with the Prince of Wales to help
the DTI in its global export drive.
So how come January will see him with a group of British businessmen in
Melbourne - and His Royal Highness simultaneously in Sydney on entirely
different business? The answer lies in the sort of unwritten protocol
invented long before the crude business of trade became a paramount
consideration of government.
Prince Charles - leading a mission of his Business Leaders' Forum charity -
cannot be directly associated with trade promotion in those countries where
he remains heir to the throne.
And despite Australian prime minister Paul Keating's best efforts, that is
still likely to be the case when the Prince arrives.

My, my. The Bank of England seems to be working itself up into a complete

Iain Saville, the project controller, has done something few Bank of England
officials ever dare to do. He's written a letter to the Investors Chronicle
in a bid to get across his side of the argument. Moreover, today sees the
first of a series of Bank of England roadshows up and down the country,
enabling investors to moan at Pen Kent, the closest there is to a Bank

Not since former deputy governor Kit McMahon led a US roadshow in the 1970s
to drum up support for the Britain's first Yankee bond issue has the Bank
ever waged such a high-profile publicity campaign.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Observer: Pizza the action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some companies have learned to their cost that gimmicky promotions can
backfire - viz Hoover's disastrous free flights offer . . .
Pizza Hut, the Pepsico-owned restaurant chain, is possibly now regretting
its latest marketing foray at New York's Madison Square Garden, home to the
New York Knicks, America's top basketball team.
At Knicks' games Pizza Hut is offering free pizzas to everyone in the crowd,
so long as the Knicks' opponents fail to score at least 85 points. This is
quite a gamble, given that every game is a sell-out to a capacity crowd of
20,000 fans, and the Knicks are the best defensive team in the league.
Several times so far this season visiting teams have struggled to make 85
points, putting the heat under those Pizza Hut executives responsible for
the idea. Their personal career version of pizza-to-go almost arrived in
last week's game against Miami Heat.
Thousands of hungry New Yorkers howled 'pizza, pizza, pizza' as the final
seconds of the game against Miami - on a puny 82 points - ticked by.
Miraculously, Miami reached 85 points as the whistle blew.
Pizza Hut executives also blew - a sigh of relief - but it vanished as
quickly as the smile on the face of a New York waiter who sees a tip of less
than 12.5 per cent.
For although the execs had avoided a jumbo-sized payout, their promo had
nevertheless clearly bombed. New Yorkers to the core, the disappointed fans
stopped screaming for pizza and instead started yelling abuse at Pizza Hut.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Leading Article: The case for work-sharing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The renewed interest in work-sharing among European governments, some larger
employers, and the European Commission, does not deserve the brush off it
has received from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor.
Some of Mr Clarke's suspicions are well-founded. Work-sharing has become
associated with anti-competitive reductions in working time, as proposed in
a recent European Socialist manifesto. Supporters of work-sharing also
sometimes make the elementary mistake of assuming a static economy with a
fixed amount of labour to share out and so overstate its potential
contribution to reducing unemployment.
But there are, equally, a number of economic and political trends that are
making work-sharing a more practical proposition.
First, there is a much more realistic acceptance on the part of employees,
and even some unions, that work-sharing means pay-sharing and must not be
allowed to increase unit labour costs. Second, a decade of growing incomes
for most of those in employment in Europe has increased the number of
employees who are sufficiently well paid to countenance a trade-off between
pay and working time. Third, opinion polls suggest that work-sharing is
popular because it goes with the grain of more flexible and family-friendly
working hours. Indeed, on the same day that Mr Clarke was dismissing
work-sharing in Brussels, Ms Ann Widdicombe, the Employment Minister, was
praising it in London, at a seminar organised by a group called New Ways to
Work.
Prejudice and inertia
Standing in the way of the spread of work-sharing is prejudice and inertia
on the part of both employers and employees, along with an array of tax,
employment law, benefit and pension rules which create disincentives to
cutting hours and pay. To cite just one example, a large number of older
workers who might be attracted to work-sharing as they approach retirement
are put off by final salary pensions, which link their pension level to
their final rates of pay.
Many employers, too, point out that even if workers take corresponding cuts
in pay the outcome is not neutral for unit labour costs as there are extra
head-count costs relating to such things as recruitment and training.
One idea would be for governments to provide modest incentives for employers
to off-set the disincentives to companies of a larger headcount. But many
employers should not require subsidies. Service organisations, especially,
can get a better relative contribution from part-time or four-day-week
staff. By offering flexible working time packages, they can recruit from a
larger base and retain valued staff. The main role for government should,
therefore, be in removing disincentives which work against flexible working
hours.
Reduction in hours
Government can also set an example in the public sector. The Netherlands
example, where all new posts in the public sector are limited to a maximum
32 hour week, would probably not be appropriate in the UK. But the
Netherlands did experience a 30 per cent rise in employment between 1983 and
1991, along with a 13 per cent reduction in hours worked per person.
The economics of work-sharing is more complex than that equation suggests,
and work-sharing does not deal with the root causes of unemployment. But if
the effect on both demand and competitiveness is neutral, there is no reason
why it should not have some small positive impact on employment over the
medium-term.
For many workers, however, especially those on middle or lower incomes,
cutting working time and pay remains unattractive. Nissan car workers in
Sunderland, faced with a downturn in production recently, chose to stick to
normal working hours for the majority and voluntary redundancy for a small
minority. And even relatively well-off Volkswagen workers have been
complaining that the loss of one day's pay per week will leave them
struggling.
The message that there is no such thing as a 'normal' working week, working
day or working lifetime will take years to sink in. That applies as much in
Brussels as in governments and businesses across Europe.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Burgers, booze and Bull: Guy de Jonquieres examines
GrandMet's strategy and seeks common ground between its food and drinks
divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For much of the past seven years Grand Metropolitan, the large consumer
products and services group, has insisted that it is no longer an
unpredictable maverick and has acquired a clear and purposeful sense of
direction. Its challenge now is to show that it knows not only where it
wants to go, but how to get there.
From next Wednesday, there will be a new pair of hands on the wheel. They
belong to Mr George Bull, who moves from heading GrandMet's food division to
become chief executive and heir apparent to Sir Allen Sheppard, the group's
flamboyant and hyper-active chairman.
Long an acquisitive conglomerate, GrandMet has re-shaped its operations
since the mid-1980s. It has sold a string of mostly unrelated businesses
including hotels, betting shops, brewing and much of its pubs estate. It has
also entered new ones, notably by buying Pillsbury, the US food and
restaurants company, for Dollars 5.8bn in 1988.
Though the torrent of deals bewildered some observers, the group says that,
unlike its previous wheeling and dealing, they were all part of a master
plan. Its central objective is to become a tightly focused concern,
dedicated to international leadership in branded food, drinks and retailing.
Yet old ghosts continue to haunt GrandMet. For all its repeated statements
that it is committed to a coherent strategy, Sir Allen admits that many
investors remain uncomfortable. 'Just under the surface, they are still ill
at ease,' he says.
The choice of Mr Bull has been widely interpreted as a sign that GrandMet's
board believes a change of management style - if not of corporate direction
 -is needed. All the more so, since Mr Bull was promoted over Mr Ian Martin,
the chief operating officer long considered favourite for the top job.
Unlike Mr Martin, who has a reputation for abrasiveness and is best-known
for his skill in reorganising troubled businesses, Mr Bull is a suave
marketing man to his fingertips. A fruity-voiced old Etonian and former
Guards officer, he affects an amiably bumbling manner, calling himself 'a
simple drinks merchant'.
The pose fools nobody who knows him well. In reality, he is respected as an
astute, demanding and independent-minded manager, who inspires strong
loyalty among staff. He also has an impressive record in building businesses
 -not traditionally regarded as GrandMet's strongest suit.
As chief executive and then chairman until last year of International
Distillers &amp; Vintners, Grand Met's drinks division, he helped make the
business the world's largest spirits company and the main engine of the
group's growth.
IDV's compound annual profits growth exceeded 20 per cent in the five years
to 1992, when it contributed 56 per cent of GrandMet's total. Despite
recession, it continues to churn out cash and is estimated to have raised
profits by at least 10 per cent in the year to September.
The 57-year-old Mr Bull strikes a more conservative tone than the group has
sometimes done in the past. Shunning breathless rhetoric about global goals
 -'I hate the word global' - he talks instead of a stepping-stone approach
to international expansion. He is also said to be less preoccupied than Sir
Allen with maximising short-term financial returns.
His personal style is unusually austere by the standards of senior GrandMet
executives. While the group's headquarters occupy a large and sumptuously
furnished mansion in London's St James's Square, Mr Bull made a point of
having his utilitarian quarters at IDV's Regents' Park offices re-decorated
only infrequently.
A strong believer in decentralised management, he has already set about
chopping back an elaborate network of committees which sprang up under Mr
Martin. 'George wants less interference from the centre. We are going back
to the good old days when decisions were taken quickly,' says Mr John
McGrath, chief executive of IDV.
GrandMet is proud of its entrepreneurial culture, inherited from Sir Maxwell
Joseph, the mercurial financier who founded it 31 years ago. Indeed, the
group believes the freedom it gives managers is one of its greatest assets.
'We have a very strong history of being a bundle of energy, a get-up-and-go,
doing company,' says Mr Bull.
Like Sir Allen, he says GrandMet's competitive advantage is rooted in a
proven set of marketing and brand-building skills, which can be transferred
across frontiers and between businesses.
Mr Bull, who has run GrandMet's food division since July last year, argues
that its main businesses also operate in much the same market: 'All our
consumers are identical. They all eat and drink added-value branded
products. They are also international - they are the same consumers
everywhere.'
But these arguments do not convince everyone - and some wonder how firmly Mr
Bull believes them. 'Much of the international branding strategy is hype,'
says a former GrandMet executive. 'It grew out of a search for a credible
concept which investors would buy, not from any deep-rooted corporate
philosophy.'
Even sceptics agree that the group has a talent for attracting and
motivating able managers. But they also argue that its sometimes uneven past
performance and history of free-wheeling individualism make it hard to be
sure exactly what its enduring core skills are.
Some executives also concede that food manufacturing and alcoholic drinks
are much less alike than the company claims. Capital-intensive and directed
largely at the mass market, the former business calls for management,
marketing and distribution methods very different from the latter, which
involves few fixed assets and is geared to luxury brands.
The dissimilarities were further underscored last year, when a collapse in
US fresh produce prices pole-axed profits at Green Giant, the processed
vegetable business which is Pillsbury's biggest division. Nor is there much
obvious strategic common ground between food manufacturing, drinks and
Burger King, the fast food division, which is primarily a franchised service
operator.
To date, IDV, which has operations in 48 countries, is the only part of
Grand Met to have achieved broad-based international success. The division,
which is jealously protective of its operational autonomy, has increased its
share of mature western markets by a blend of acquisitions, skilful
marketing and aggressive product innovation.
But though IDV believes its performance can continue to defy a steady
decline in alcohol consumption in the west, reduced scope for acquisitions
require it increasingly to look elsewhere for volume growth. Its prime
target is eastern Europe, where opportunities - but also risks - are large.
GrandMet's retailing record is more mixed. Burger King has been turned from
a lame duck into a highly profitable growth business, thanks largely to the
efforts of Mr Barry Gibbon, who has run it since it was acquired five years
ago.
By contrast, Pearle, the US eyewear chain which is the group's only pure
retailing operation, has performed dismally. It is being extensively
restructured in an effort to stem losses and is likely to be sold if a buyer
can be found.
But the acid test of GrandMet's strategy is its food business. Sir Allen
says he still thinks it can be as successful internationally as IDV. But he
concedes that GrandMet faces 'a hard slog'. 'We're very much a come-lately.
It's a great pity we didn't begin our strategy a decade earlier,' he says.
Pillsbury owns some long-established brands, and its efficiency and
marketing have been sharpened up since it was acquired. However, the company
is beset by price competition in US groceries, which it is seeking to offset
by faster cost-cutting and new product development.
Furthermore, Pillsbury is only medium-sized by food industry standards, with
few sales outside North America. The markets in which it is strongest, such
as chilled dough and processed vegetables, are also relatively mature. Mr
Paul Walsh, its chief executive, says the company needs more growth
businesses.
Building up Pillsbury's position in North America must take priority over
international expansion, he says, 'because if we miss a beat in the US, we
won't have the cash flow to develop abroad.'
So far, Pillsbury has been cautious about moving outside the US,
concentrating principally on a handful of developing countries such as
Mexico, China and South Africa. Its preferred method of market entry is
through joint ventures with local partners, Mr Walsh says, because they
require fewer management and financial resources than do wholly-owned
operations.
The boldest international foray has been by Haagen-Dazs, Pillsbury's premium
ice cream brand. Expansion in Europe and Japan has helped double annual
sales to about Dollars 500m in five years, and is the most striking
advertisement of GrandMet's claims to expertise in taking food brands across
frontiers.
But Haagen-Dazs has yet to show a profit. Some observers, even inside
GrandMet, also fear it may become vulnerable to more powerful competitors
such as Unilever and Nestle, which both plan rival 'super-premium' ice cream
brands.
The liveliest debate, though, is what to do about Europe, where GrandMet is
little more than a marginal player, with interests in baking, canning and
food service. Efforts to turn Brossard, its cake subsidiary, into a
Euro-brand have made little headway, and an exhaustive search for suitable
merger or takeover candidates has yielded little.
Some executives have begun to question whether it is worth persevering. They
argue that Europe's economic prospects are so unexciting, its food markets
so fragmented and local competition so well-entrenched, that the group
should concentrate on Asia instead.
Much may depend on acquisition opportunities. Sir Allen says mega-bids are
'less the flavour of the decade than in the 1980s', while Mr Bull is
believed to be cautious about their virtues. But Sir Allen is also widely
thought eager to make one more big takeover before he retires in early 1996.
Whether GrandMet's balance sheet would allow that is another matter. Though
gearing has fallen sharply since the late 1980s, it is still estimated at
more than 50 per cent when the value of its acquired brands is included, and
about 180 per cent without them.
To afford a really juicy target, the group might need to make a big
disposal. The only obvious candidate is Burger King. Some observers think
GrandMet may in any case have to consider selling the business eventually if
it is to mobilise the resources needed to become a serious world player in
food manufacturing.
Meanwhile, shareholders may need to wait longer to enjoy tangible rewards
from GrandMet's much-trumpeted strategy. The group has forecast a 5 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits before exceptional items for the full year, to
be published on December 1, and says trading conditions remain tough. At
385p yesterday, its shares are well below their peak of 512p 18 months ago.
Sir Allen is jauntily philosophical: 'One day, doors will open, clouds will
roll back and our shares will be dramatically re-rated.' However, he adds:
'It will probably take a new chairman to make that change.'

It has taken nearly five months. But yesterday Britain was able to see its
new economic double act of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England, in action together for the
first time.
The half percentage point cut in bank base rates to 5.5 per cent, their
lowest level since 1972, was a surprise. Nearly 10 months had elapsed since
the last base rate cut from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. The City had been
pencilling in a cut on or shortly after next Tuesday's Budget to offset,
perhaps only in part, the higher taxes still expected that day.
The Treasury's gloss on the rate cut was significant. It marked a further
step towards giving the Bank a greater share in monetary policymaking, a
process that began after the debacle of sterling's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism on September 16 last year. At the same time, it
reaffirmed the impression fostered in recent weeks by Mr Clarke that
independence for the Bank is not high on his agenda.
In his statement announcing the cut, Mr Clarke made clear that the first
official interest rate change since he moved into Number 11 Downing Street
at the end of May was his decision. As has become customary since Black (or
White) Wednesday, the change in borrowing costs was justified in the light
of a range of monetary indicators. By saying that he had weighed these
factors and taken 'full account of the measures' that he would announce in
the Budget, the chancellor also gave a strong indication that there would be
no further Budget Day rate cut to follow yesterday's reduction.
But he also made clear that yesterday's move followed consultation with Mr
George, and in that sense it is to be regarded as a joint decision of Bank
governor and chancellor. Moreover, the timing of the decision had been left
to the governor. Mr Clarke added that 'from now on the precise timing of
interest rate changes will be a matter for the Bank to decide'.
The contrast with the last base rate cut on January 26 could not have been
greater. That cut, determined as yesterday through the announcement of a
minimum lending rate by the Bank, clashed with an important auction of
government gilt-edged stocks and was widely interpreted as a politically
inspired move by a badly rattled prime minister.
It prompted Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, to urge in his bitter
resignation speech in June that the timing of future interest rate changes
'should never be used to offset some unfavourable political event'.
Mr Lamont's words bore fruit yesterday. An important consideration for Mr
Clarke and the Bank was to divorce the rate cut from day-to-day politics. An
announcement amid the ballyhoo of Budget day next week would have undermined
the government's insistence that its monetary policy must be consistent with
keeping inflation, as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage
interest payments, inside its 1 to 4 per cent target.
What we cannot judge is who influenced whom: whether, for example, there was
a complete meeting of minds between Mr Clarke and the governor on half a
percentage point or whether the chancellor pushed for more and 'steady'
Eddie, with his known loathing of inflation, resisted such a move.
It was also difficult yesterday to pinpoint when the basic decision to cut
rates was taken. Neither the Bank nor Treasury would elaborate on the
history of the move although the Treasury announcement, which referred to
last Thursday's news of a drop in average earnings growth to 3 per cent,
suggested that chancellor and Bank governor decided late last week.
However, the circumstances of the rate cut point to a high degree of trust
between the chancellor and the governor. Mr George is clearly in the Budget
'loop' and knows more about the chancellor's plans for taxation than
government ministers other than the prime minister and those in the
Treasury.
This is consistent with what we know about the relationship that has
developed between the two men since Mr Clarke took over the Treasury at the
end of May and Mr George moved up from deputy to governor of the Bank at the
beginning of July.
The chancellor has been generous in his praise of Mr George and the
appreciation is reciprocated. Although Mr Clarke is garrulous and Mr George
famously tight-lipped, the two men are more similar than they might appear.
Both are roughly the same age (Mr George is 55, Mr Clarke 53). Both were
educated at Cambridge University. Both have risen from humble backgrounds on
the strength of their ability and drive.
But the decision to involve the Bank more closely in interest rate policy
has deeper roots than the good relationship between two successful men. It
builds on the decision after sterling's exit from the ERM to set an official
inflation target and make the Bank of England responsible for monitoring
progress towards achieving this in its quarterly inflation report. Mr
George, when named governor in January, was given a specific mandate 'to
support the government in its determination to bring about a lasting
reduction in the rate of inflation'. Mr Clarke has gradually extended the
bank's leash. The inflation report published at the beginning of this month
was the first to be issued by the Bank without having to be submitted to
advance scrutiny by the Treasury.
So why did the Bank choose yesterday to cut rates? Mr George's explanation,
to a BBC radio reporter yesterday, was that he 'couldn't see any particular
reason why we should wait until after the Budget', given what he knew from
of the chancellor's Budget plans and from recent statistics.
It could all be a skilful move by the politically agile Mr Clarke to defuse
anxieties ahead of his Budget. The Bank clearly regards yesterday's rate cut
as part of a rebalancing of policy and not an easing. That suggests that the
chancellor will announce a further fiscal tightening next week on top of the
extra taxes totalling Pounds 6.7bn for 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn for 1995-96
announced in Mr Lamont's last Budget in March.
Although the Bank and Treasury insist that there is no 'ready reckoner' to
measure a trade-off between changes in interest rates and fiscal policy, it
would be logical to deduce from yesterday's modest rate cut that any tax
increases to be announced next week will not be great. The forecasts of City
pundits yesterday pointed towards net tax increases of Pounds 2bn to Pounds
3bn.
However, Mr Clarke could still spring a nasty surprise. There are signs that
the Bank believes the economy is growing more strongly than the 1.9 per cent
annual rate disclosed in official figures last week. Its interest rate move
yesterday has to be seen in the context of lags in the effect of monetary
policy which mean that the Bank was acting with a view to conditions in the
economy two years away rather than in the near future.
In other respects, yesterday was a good day for the Bank to act. There were
no statistical releases to cause market operators to suppose that specific
indicators in future might trigger further rate changes.
And Mr Clarke, by giving the Mr George a little more elbow room, may have
taken some heat out of a longer-term policy issue - whether to give
independence to the Bank.
The bandwagon for having an independent but democratically accountable Bank
of England is gathering pace. A top level panel of academics, City
luminaries, former central bankers and erstwhile finance ministry officials
from Britain and abroad last week proposed that the Bank should be free to
set monetary policy independent of the Treasury. The influential House of
Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee is expected to come up with the
same message before Christmas.
It is not a message that the parliamentarian Mr Clarke is particularly keen
to heed. The more he gives the Bank greater operational responsibility now,
the less he may have to cede real power later.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Quaint little quango: Democracy and British interests go
hand in hand - sometimes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last night Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, hosted a
reception in honour of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. This
little-known quango has now been up and running for just over a year, headed
by Diana Warwick, formerly general secretary of the Association of
University Teachers.
Ms Warwick is no Tory. By choosing her as the WFD's first chief executive,
the board of governors (seven politicians of various parties, seven
independent 'experts') showed that, in its effort to spread pluralism
overseas, Britain would practise what it preached.
At first glance the WFD looks like a belated and rather feeble imitation of
the US National Endowment for Democracy, set up by Ronald Reagan as part of
his worldwide anticommunist crusade in 1983. Both are supposed to spend
taxpayers' money on promoting democracy abroad, and both have structures
designed to refute any suspicion that the party in government at home is
using them exclusively to back like-minded parties in other countries.
The Ned has Dollars 35m (Pounds 23.7m) to spend annually, beside which the
WFD's Pounds 2m for 1993-94 looks paltry - though it is double what it was
in its first year, and Ms Warwick has asked for a further 50 per cent rise
in 1994-95, hoping Mr Hurd's enthusiasm will shelter her against the
Treasury's chill wind. But the Ned was nearly blown away this summer, when
the House of Representatives deleted its budget from the 1994 foreign aid
appropriations bill. (It was restored in October by a House-Senate
conference committee.)
The Ned had come under attack for corruption and mismanagement, and for
running its own foreign policy which does not always coincide with the
government's. Its structure seems almost designed to produce that result,
since it passes 70 per cent of the money to four subsidiary quangoes, set up
by the Republican and Democratic parties, the AFL-CIO trade union movement,
and the US Chamber of Commerce. Officials of these bodies, and of the Ned,
have been accused of using the money for 'political tourism', luxury travel
for themselves and their friends ostensibly for political fact-finding, and
of financing activities whose connection with democracy was dubious.
Examples from the 1980s in a recent briefing paper from the Cato Institute,
a Washington think-tank, include the funding of a military-backed
presidential candidate in Panama; of the opposition to former President
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica (whose impeccable democratic credentials were
marred only by his criticism of US support for the Nicaraguan Contras); and,
most bizarrely, of an extreme right-wing group in France, justified by the
AFL-CIO on the grounds that France, under Francois Mitterrand, was
'threatened by the communist apparatus'.
The WFD, with much less money to throw around and a staff of only four,
should have less scope for such abuses. Although 50 per cent of its funding
goes to projects recommended by British political parties, each project has
to be approved by the full board.
It has started work in three priority areas - central and eastern Europe,
the former Soviet Union, and English-speaking Africa - where many countries
attempting a transition to democracy are 'intrinsically important to
Britain' and/or particularly amenable to British leverage. Among projects Ms
Warwick is particularly proud of are sponsorship of Sposterihach, a bulletin
produced by a small group of Ukrainians 'to inform Ukrainian opinion-formers
about international affairs and international perceptions of Ukraine'; and
support for independent media in the former Yugoslavia.
Both of those come under the 'non-partisan' heading. Of projects proposed by
political parties, the Conservatives have so far had the lion's share in
central and eastern Europe, while all the South African projects in the
first year were proposed by the Labour party, involving various forms of
assistance to the ANC. By contrast there were non-partisan projects in Kenya
and Malawi, both aimed at helping to nudge reluctant governments towards
multiparty democracy.
Support for the Malawi Democratic Alliance was perhaps the most daring,
since this happened in a country whose government had not yet conceded the
principle of multiparty democracy. But it still fitted with the broad thrust
of British foreign policy, which is to encourage accountable and transparent
government in countries that receive British development aid. The WFD is
conspicuous by its absence in east Asia, where western efforts to export
democracy have run into harsh criticism from countries, such as Singapore,
with which Britain has important business ties.
In the Islamic world, the WFD's first-year activities were confined to two
projects in Yemen and one in the Palestinian occupied territories. Ms
Warwick appeared uncomfortable when I asked her how the board would react to
an appeal for help from a group of Saudi Arabian citizens seeking to promote
democracy in their country. She referred me to the 'guiding principles' set
out in the foundation's first annual report, which declares the need to
'reinforce success' and 'prevent backsliding', and notes 'the relative
importance of different countries to British interests'. Saudi Arabia is
very important to British interests, but I doubt if Mr Hurd thinks those
interests would be served by promoting democracy there.
On the other hand there is a fourth guiding principle, rather cryptically
phrased: 'the contribution to the 'domino' effect'. Could it be that the
foundation sees Yemen as a democratic 'domino' on the Arabian peninsula? It
is probably more tactful not to ask.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Small business in favour of leasing
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms DAPHNE GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tony Mallin of the Finance and Leasing Association is quite wrong to
claim that changes by the Office of Fair Trading to current leasing
regulations are not favoured by small businesses (Survey of leasing and
asset finance, November 19).
This chamber has presented evidence personally and in writing to Sir Bryan
Carsberg, OFT director-general, urging that protection afforded to
individuals and unincorporated businesses be extended to private companies.
Leasing deals can be a minefield for smaller businesses.
Both the FLA and government should remember that small businesses and the
jobs that depend on them can be at the mercy of the unscrupulous and some
regulation is in the interests of business.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Publication better than legislation
on debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D S BABER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate continues as to whether commercial overdue accounts should
be subject to statutory interest. Nothing has altered our belief that, if
such legislation were imposed, it would be a bureaucratic nightmare to
administer and could be viewed by many debtors as an invitation to take more
credit from their suppliers rather than approach their banks.
We firmly believe that the simple alternative suggestion would be
sufficient: that all companies be required to publish in their statutory
audited accounts the amount owed to creditors beyond (say) 60 days overdue.
Thus, at a glance, all potential suppliers could quickly judge if they would
be likely to be paid promptly. The larger the corporation, the more
frequently are the accounts published so the situation would be well
regulated. The really bad payers would soon gain the notoriety they deserve.
There is no doubt that if more capital were released into circulation rather
than tied up in overdue accounts it would benefit the British economy
enormously.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not really such a good way to run a
railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN MACKELLAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While there is much to commend French Railways, handing over British
Rail to our French colleagues might not have the effects your correspondent,
Noel Clarke (Letters, November 22), claims.
In 1992, for example, InterCity delivered 87 per cent of its trains on time
or within 10 minutes. In the same year, 74.9 per cent of French TGVs clocked
in within 14 minutes of advertised arrival times. InterCity achieved that
without subsidy. In total, French Railways receives about 50 per cent more
subsidy than BR as a proportion of its income.
We may still have our imperfections, but BR has posted some remarkable
improvements in operating performance in recent years, and has consistently
been among the most efficient in Europe financially for a decade.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: VAT on all food a harmful move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Poyner (Letters, November 19) argues that all food should be
subject to value added tax. He says that 'to suggest that this would harm
the less well-off is unproven'.
There is already abundant evidence that, even without VAT on most foods,
some families simply cannot afford a healthy diet. For instance, there are
the 1990 study by the Family Welfare Association and the 1991 and later
surveys by the National Children's Home. The findings of these studies are
reinforced by data from the 1990 Dietary and Nutritional Study of British
Adults and the 1991 Household Consumption and Expenditure survey, which
spell out the sharp differences between the diets of the better off and
those on low incomes. The NCH survey shows that it is primarily lack of
money, not ignorance, that accounts for lower spending by poor households on
fresh fruit and vegetables.
Low income can also make it impossible for people who live well away from
big supermarkets, hypermarkets and discount stores, and who don't own a car,
to afford frequent fares in order to benefit from lower prices often
available at these shops.
Poor diet, of course, puts health at risk and will make it harder for the
targets set in the government's Health of the Nation paper to be met.
If VAT were to be added to all foods, the plight of the poorest families
would be worsened at a stroke, unless state benefits were raised to
compensate. There could also be an outcry from other consumers if their food
bills suddenly rose by 7 per cent to cover VAT - particularly if the
argument used to justify this is that it will bring the UK in line with the
rest of the EU.
It seems highly premature to do this before reforms are completed to the
EU's Common Agricultural Policy, which currently costs the average household
of four almost Pounds 20 a week extra - the combined cost of food bills kept
artificially high by this policy, and extra taxes which go to pay for
storing the surpluses produced and then to subsidise their disposal.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bonds sign of Italy's confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FABRIZIO GALIMBERTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley is puzzled by Italy issuing 30-year government paper
('Italy adds another dimension to debt', November 17). I agree that a
country believing in low inflation should be wary of locking in high real
interest rates for 30 years. But this did not stop the US government from
issuing 30-year bonds at punitive rates in the early 1980s, when Paul
Volcker (then chairman of the US Federal Reserve) was hell-bent on uprooting
inflation. A country like Italy which, for better or worse, houses the third
largest bond market in the world, must offer investors the possibility to
play with all the notes of the maturity keyboard. As Barry Riley says, the
30-year bond is a diversion. But a useful one.
Mr Riley's conclusion is pessimistic: Italy will be forced to restructure
the debt, and 'there will be action long before 2023'. However, both the
experience of Belgium (with a higher debt/gross domestic product ratio than
Italy's) and the UK (where after the war the debt/GDP ratio stood at 300 per
cent) show that default is not the only way out. Italy has already locked in
low inflation through the most effective incomes policy in Europe. Policy
makers can only wait for the markets to appreciate present virtue more than
past vices.
Finally, Barry Riley writes that Italy's primary budget deficit is
worsening. This is incorrect, both as to level and rate of change. The
primary budget has been in surplus since 1992. The OECD estimates that in
1993 Italy will have a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP in its primary balance,
against a surplus of 0.4 per cent for Japan and a string of deficits for the
the five other G7 countries. As to the rate of change, Italy is about the
only country recording an improvement of its public finances in 1993. Maybe
this is why the Italian government felt confident enough to dip its
financial toes in the uncharted waters of the 30-year bond.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: A mafiosi 'Boccanegra' - Opera in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time since the war, Germany's orchestras and opera companies
are having to justify their existence - no more so than in Frankfurt. The
era of limitless state subsidy has come to an abrupt end. Recession is
biting hard, cutbacks are under way. The Frankfurt Opera faces a reduction
in subsidy over the next four years from DM66m (Pounds 26m) to DM48m (Pounds
19m). The number of salaried staff is to be reduced by 22 per cent, and new
productions will probably drop from six to three per season. This is a tough
prescription for a city that counts itself one of Germany's major musical
centres.
The only consolation is that Frankfurt is not alone, and no company is being
forced to close. According to the Frankfurt Opera's managing director,
Martin Steinhoff, the cuts will fall wherever possible on the administrative
rather than artistic side. He says the company is being as pragmatic as
possible, but criticises the city government for slashing services for
taxpayers, while keeping its own 26,000-strong bureaucracy virtually intact.
None of this affected Simon Boccanegra, the first home-grown production
since the arrival of Sylvain Cambreling as music director at the start of
the season. Musical standards were high, the staging looked expensive. It
was a good choice of opera, because Simon Boccanegra is little known in
Germany.
That did not prevent Matthias Langhoff - a well-established drama producer
in Berlin and Paris - from trying to rewrite the story. Verdi's patricians
and plebeians became the mafiosi of modern Italy; Renaissance intrigue
became today's corruption. The prologue took place on the harbour-front of
postwar Genoa, complete with cranes, ships' prows, dockers and prostitutes.
Act one opened on a seaside terrace, Amelia making her entrance in a red
swimsuit. The Doge's council chamber was transformed into a champagne
reception for Boccanegra's business associates. The final act was set in
front of a dockside pizzeria.
Some of this made interesting theatre, if only because of the alienating
devices incorporated into Jean-Marc Stehle's semi-realistic stage pictures.
But Langhoff's approach never rang true. Verdi's humane Doge emerged as a
godfather, devoid of moral authority and corrupted by power. Instead of
probing the inner psychology of the characters, Langhoff trivialised them,
overloading the stage with cheap and irritating detail, contradicting the
music and confusing an already complex plot.
But thanks to Cambreling, the music was never swamped. The shifting moods
were precisely characterised, the instrumental colours vividly brought to
life. It was good to hear orchestra and chorus in such good shape. John
Brocheler made a tall, handsome Boccanegra; there was nothing particularly
Italianate about his singing, except its conviction. Harald Stamm gave a
commanding performance as Fiesco, using his big bold voice to tremendous
effect. Keith Olsen was the lusty Adorno, Ivan Kusnjer a credibly shifty
Paolo. Amelia, portrayed as a spoilt rich kid, was sung by Gunnel Bohman.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: Massenet's magical 'Cendrillon' - Richard Fairman
hails Robert Carsen's new production for WNO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Saturday's morning papers it was reported that a competition is to be
held for the design of Cardiff's new opera house. What could be more fitting
for Welsh National Opera that evening than this enchanting opera on the
theme of a dream fulfilled?
After the rediscovery of so many Massenet operas in the 1970s the composer
seemed to get forgotten. Perhaps his desire to please was out of tune with
the hard-nosed ethics of the next decade. Or, more likely, the new breed of
radical producers assumed that his operas had nothing to offer them. How
wrong they were. WNO's new production of Cendrillon is probing, stylish, up
to the minute, and still sends the audience away with stars in the eyes.
The opera is a fairly faithful version of Perrault's fairy-tale Cinderella.
So captivating is its blend of magic, romance and humour that it seems
wicked that British audiences have been denied it for so long. I have seen
the opera only twice before and realise in retrospect how crudely those
productions upset its delicate balance, hamming its comedy, over-sugaring
its sweetness. All it needs is a touch as deft as the composer's own.
In Cardiff the curtain went up on a strikingly simple set (designs by
Michael Levine). A log fire burns in a late 19th-century French
drawing-room. On the mantelpiece are an elegant gold clock, ready to strike
twelve at midnight, and an invitation to the ball. What we do not know at
this point is that the producer, Robert Carsen, is going to swivel the room
around and send us out through the window into a world of enchantment.
For the time being we are left with the family and servants. Father is a
well-meaning man, amusingly played by Donald Maxwell, though his voice does
not take too kindly to Massenet's lyrical writing. The stepmother is a
snobbish bossy boots, played with devastating wit by Felicity Palmer. The
scene where she enumerates every twig on her family tree, while bathing her
aching feet, was killing. There are plenty of good one-liners for her in
Jeremy Sams's English translation.
But now Carsen casts his spell of inspiration. As Cinderella goes to sleep
in front of the fire, a miniature fairy godmother (Lillian Watson, bright
and twinkling, if a touch strident on the highest notes) appears at the
window and turns out to be the stepmother's alter ego - her better half. The
attendant fairies are none other than the household servants, tripping along
daintily with silver wings sewn on to their uniforms.
Wearing the fairy's blue high heels, Cinders sets off for the ball only to
find Prince Charming curled up in her father's favourite armchair. Another
right decision: for the first time in my experience these two roles were
cast, as the composer always intended, with sopranos, Rebecca Evans as
Cinderella and Pamela Helen Stephen as the Prince, each as touching as the
other. Their first duet floated as hushed as a kiss on the breeze - only one
of many reasons to offer gratitude to the evening's conductor, Patrick
Fournillier.
At last Massenet's lovely opera has the staging it deserves: its magic, its
humour, its intimacy, all perfectly balanced and with a sprinkling of
psychoanalysis light as fairy dust. Any regrets? Only that the ball scene
omits the ballet, included by the students at the RNCM in Manchester last
year. Everything else is sheer delight. A personal note to the managing
director of WNO: can I come straight back for the next performance please?
A co-production with Monte-Carlo, Toulouse, Turin and English National
Opera. Performances in Birmingham this week, then touring to Oxford and
Bristol

FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: Up with sex, down with violence - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listen to the claims of those busybody organisations which campaign to
impose their tastes on everybody else, read the 'Shock] Horror]' stories of
their finger-wagging allies in the tabloid papers, and you will believe that
sex'an'violence on television is, as ever, on the increase. But if you sit
down for week after week, year after year and monitor the output, you will
find that something much more interesting is happening. Far from going up,
the incidence of violence has actually gone down since the worst days of the
1970s and early 1980s, yet equally clearly, sex is, indeed, on the increase.
Hence the wonderful sight last week of the tabloid press up on its hobby
horse having a fit of the vapours over the explicit pictures in BBC2's
Buddha Of Suburbia.
'Shame Of BBC's Porn Play' shrieked the Sun on Wednesday and then, purely in
the public interest you understand, and despite its own distaste for such
things, it provided photographs of the actresses in the nude. This seems to
have struck the Daily Mail as a wizard wheeze because next day it splashed
'A full frontal assault' across a double spread, above a story which began
'BBC bosses refused to make eleventh-hour cuts to last night's episode of
the controversial sex drama The Buddha Of Suburbia despite public concern
over explicit scenes.' Nowhere did it explain how there could have been
'public concern' over scenes which the public had not seen. More surprising,
however, given the obsession of such newspapers with the supposed need for
censorship, is the blindness to the sea change that has occurred in the last
15 years.
If you went into any British television drama department today with a series
of The Sweeney (or Starsky And Hutch for that matter) made in the late 1970s
you would be told they were untransmittable because of the violence. The
head of drama would freeze-frame the video at the point where six beefy
villains in balaclavas, armed with pickaxe handles, were leaping from the
back of a Transit van to set about poor old DI Regan and his DS George
Carter. Go away, you would be told, and come back with something more
thoughtful: why not swap psychology for violence? Have a look at Cracker or
Between The Lines and see how the old idea of 'action' has switched very
largely from physical to mental.
Whether this change is a good thing is debatable. Those of us who do not
happen to like watching violence will be content, but if my great aunt were
alive she would be most upset. She used to sulk through the likes of
Panorama muttering 'What about a nice bit of violence for poor old auntie?'
and then, when Dragnet or Big Breadwinner Hog came on, drum her heels on the
floor and giggle. She lived in Purley, read Jeffrey Farnol, and never hurt a
fly. Why should such people be forbidden their violent fix? And what about
violent young men? Some doctors and criminologists argue that violence on
television is cathartic, and serves as a substitute for the real thing: take
it away and such delinquents will be more inclined to go out and do it
themselves. Perhaps the present increase in reports of violent crime results
from the decrease in violence on television?
Of course there is still violence on television, from children's animated
cartoons to bought-in Hollywood movies (and we shall come back to the
question of Hollywood's role). But anyone monitoring the amount and
intensity in the broadcasters' own programmes, especially in peak-time
drama, would have to admit that there has been a significant reduction. What
the tabloid press seems to have missed is the simultaneous increase
throughout the mass media in references to all things sexual, whether
pictorial or verbal. There are many possible reasons, ranging from a
continued long-term reaction against Victorian hypocrisy to the supposed
needs of the Aids industry.
Since papers such as the Sun with its 'Page Three girls' have themselves
contri-buted so obviously to this change it seems bizarre that they are
blind to it. To a generation which now accepts nudity as readily in
television drama as it does on Page Three or in the National Gallery, the
'fetch the smelling salts' pose of outrage adopted by the tabloids whenever
one of the Redgrave women sheds her underwear seems ludicrous. This
assertion is based not only upon evidence from my own children and their
friends, now in their twenties, but from last week's edition of Open Space
on BBC2.
Presented by a remarkable woman named Isabel Koprowski, this made a common
sense plea for Britain to move further and faster down this road and begin
to catch up with our Continental partners. In many people, she pointed out,
hostility towards explicitly sexual material arose from the belief that
pornography always means violence towards women, a lie repeated endlessly by
the busybody organisations and some of their tabloid allies. It is almost
entirely untrue of Britain's soft porn (the only sort legally available) and
very rarely true of the hard porn available across the Channel. This stuff
is actually about enjoyment, and, in the print media, more and more the
enjoyment of women as well as men these days.
In their own defence the busybodies and tabloids would probably say that a
still picture of a naked woman (or man, presumably) was one thing but
vigorous rumpy pumpy on the screen in the corner of your living room was
something else entirely. It is certainly true that representations of sexual
intercourse have now become almost commonplace in British television drama.
In the past few weeks we have seen brother-sister incest in some detail in
Stephen Poliakoff's Close My Eyes on Channel 4. In Scarlet And Black we have
watched from within several ladies' chambers as Monsieur Sorel's ladder (did
he always pack a collapsible model?) whanged against their balconies, a
signal at which nighties would slide magically to the floor. Even the ITV
soccer drama All In The Game has had them playing hide the sausage . . .
though with the woman on top, naturally. In 1993 anything else would be
desperately politically incorrect.
What the B &amp; T brigade never seem to ask themselves is whether there might,
perhaps, be some point to these scenes other than a desire to outrage them.
While watching The Buddha Of Suburbia did the oh-so-easily-shocked gentlemen
on the tabloids really not notice that the big sex scene was supposed to be
comical? That even as the director's wife with the voracious sexual appetite
was riding our hero to such a noisy climax, he (underneath, natch) was
gazing around in utter boredom? That his girl friend, pleasuring the
director on the other side of the room, was also deep in a cocktail party
conversation about the ICA? This drama (final episode at 9.25 on BBC2
tonight, heaven only knows what sort of a record rating it will get) is a
satire about the social mores of Londoners in the 1970s. Attitudes to many
subjects - Asians, contemporary music, mysticism - have been represented and
variously parodied, ridiculed or attacked, and it would be odd, given the
time and attention that so many people devote to it, if sex were to be left
out.
The trouble with the B &amp; T attacks is that by spreading outrage
indiscriminately over anything at all to do with sex, they end up conveying
to the impressionable, and especially to those who actually see very little
of this sort of material, that there is nothing to choose between, say, the
closing sex scene in last week's Buddha Of Suburbia and the opening sex
scene in the Hollywood movie Basic Instinct. Yet the truth is that the
television scene was funny and telling whereas the movie scene (with the
woman on top, of course, first humping her victim and then slashing him
hysterically with a knife) is utterly repellent. So much so that I, a cinema
and TV critic for 30 years, turned my face away in shame for the human race.
If we cannot distinguish between these things we are lost.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: Sviatoslav Richter - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sviatoslav Richter returned to the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday afternoon.
A Richter piano recital is always a special experience, with the rarity of
its provenance tinged and heightened by the threat of peril (will he turn up
at all? will he cancel at the very last moment?).
On this occasion it was a breathtaking experience: the greatest living
pianist encountered at the peak of his powers, delivering Beethoven and
Schubert with awesome concentration of fire and ice, imaginative daring and
breadth of vision.
Jets of critical superlatives can afford wearisome reading. This time,
however, this particular reviewer was left no alternative to spraying out
whole streams of them: artistic completeness of the kind demonstrated by
Richter's second-half accounts of the Beethoven 'Pathetic' Sonata and the
Schubert 'Wanderer' Fantasia has the power to make one feel one has never
really heard either the works or the instrument itself before.
Two summers ago, when he came to Britain for concerts in London and
Aldeburgh, the weight of Richter's septuagenarian years and Slav melancholy
seemed to press a little harder on the playing than one had imagined they
ever could. On Sunday, the cares of age were cast aside. After a first half
of Bach - austere yet full of questing turns of phrase and touch, that was
like a testing of the waters - he plunged into the second with an urgency
all the more exhilarating for being directed entirely inward, to the music's
very centre.
The Beethoven was all urgency, every rhythmic pattern alert with immediate
forcefulness and long-term significance, the slow movement a taut span of
bated energy. The timbre and weight of the Yamaha grand, in some respects
not unlike that of a 'period' piano (but without the limitations of volume
and inequalities of registration), was made to seem the sound and substance
of Beethovenian argument.
There was no gap, no shortfall between idea and execution; nor - a handful
of forgivable, indeed hardly noticeable finger slips apart - was there in
the Schubert, one of the mightiest adventures of Romantic keyboard invention
here unfolded in all its majesty. After two Grieg encores, each one a
time-stopping marvel of fine-grained pianism, the concert was over, and one
was left wrung out, uplifted, cherishing its memory.

Not a night for FT readers to go to the cinema. BBC2's 'The Money Programme'
mounts a 60-minute special, Unusual Transactions (BBC2, 8.00), about Asil
Nadir and Polly Peck's missing millions. It claims 'Exclusive first-hand
testimony from those involved helps to shed new light on what went so badly
wrong'.
The minute that ends, Dispatches (C4, 9.00) undertakes a hatchet job on the
Treasury. CBI director Howard Davis describes the Treasury as 'the bank that
likes to say no', and economist Tim Congdon declares 'It is not a matter of
opinion whether their forecasting record is poor, it is a matter of fact.'
No doubt the last episode of The Buddha Of Suburbia (BBC2, 9.25) will
achieve record ratings thanks to the publicity stunt laid on by the
tabloids. 'Buddha's sex romp goes on as the BBC refuses to make cuts'
snorted the Mail; 'Shame of BBC's Porn Play' screamed The Sun, providing
photo after photo to illustrate the nature of the shame. The fact that this
is a highly entertaining comedy about the absurdities of the 1970s was never
mentioned, of course.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Crops under doctor's orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A single body to monitor the use of agricultural pesticides, which would
save millions of pounds spent on cleaning up drinking water, should be set
up in the UK, according to a study by Newcastle University published last
week.*
The study advocates the introduction of a prescription service for crops
with the chemicals doled out by independent crop doctors, rather than
representatives of agro-chemical companies who could tend to encourage
greater use of pesticides.
This would entail a completely regulated market in pesticides similar to the
National Health Service. It could prove cheaper in the long run than paying
for the clean-up of drinking water, thereby reducing water bills.
Water companies estimate it will cost Pounds 800m in equipment and Pounds
80m a year in running costs to treat polluted drinking water and bring it up
to EU standards. But the study points out that a national ban on the
herbicide Isoproturon could greatly improve the water at a cost of only
Pounds 28m.
The monitoring of pesticide use could come under the auspices of the
proposed new Environmental Protection Agency, the study suggests. But it
would need additional information about the use of chemicals on the land if
it is to do its job properly. The study found the monitoring of agricultural
pesticides is 'grossly inadequate,' and regulation has been geared more to
the needs of agriculture than the environment.
The principle of polluters paying for environmental damage is not being
applied to pesticides since water companies are removing chemicals from the
water supply and passing the bill on to consumers. The report suggests
imposing a levy on agro-chemicals with the highest tax applied to the
pesticides that appear in greatest concentrations.
