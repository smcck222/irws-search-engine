FT  20 NOV 93 / Beady eye on their nest egg: Will the UK government risk a
pensions crisis by raiding occupational schemes in the Budget?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, struggles with the final preparations
for his first Budget, there is growing speculation that he will resort to a
well-tried soft option on November 30: milking the pension funds. Yet the
wider costs of following his predecessors, Lord Lawson and Mr Norman Lamont,
down this tempting road are worrying, because Britain's pension funds are
heading for a financing crisis.
For once, the powerful pensions lobby, bending politicians' ears before the
Budget, may have a point. Another raid on the occupational pension schemes'
Pounds 350bn nest egg might be the last straw for many companies that are
finding final pay-related pension liabilities increasingly onerous.
The incipient funding crisis in pensions is not just a British concern but
affects public and private sectors in most developed countries. It stems
from the demographic strains that arise from an ageing population and the
impact of disinflation on government finances and on the value of pension
fund assets and liabilities.
Smaller working populations are having to meet the cost of sustaining larger
retired populations. And in the public sector these costs are harder to meet
without the help of high rates of inflation, which until recently provided a
prop to government revenues.
In Britain the demographic pressure is less than in most of the OECD area.
The problems of disinflation, though real in other areas of public spending,
have largely been defused in the state pension scheme by a decision in the
early 1980s to stop uprating the basic state pension in line with earnings.
It is now uprated in line with prices, which rise more slowly. But the
private sector has not had the benefit of any comparable change in the rules
to off-set the damage to its finances from falling inflation. Rather, the
rules have been made tougher.
In the 1970s and 1980s, private occupational pension schemes promised to pay
pensions worth up to two-thirds of final pay. Yet in practice only a
minority - those who stayed with the same employer for most of their career
 -received what they thought they had been promised. The system depended on
an elaborate web of implicit cross-subsidies. It was easy to give high
retirement incomes to long-stayers because occupational schemes were
delivering pensions that were falling in real terms, while the deferred
pension liabilities of employees who were made redundant, or who left
voluntarily, were shrinking fast thanks to inflation.
For much of the 1980s the cost of meeting pension liabilities was further
reduced by exceptionally high investment returns. Employers took
contribution holidays as the surpluses of assets over liabilities mounted.
This picture has now changed markedly. In response to widespread
disillusionment over inequitable cross-subsidies, the government introduced
regulations between 1986 and 1990 that required pension schemes to increase
deferred pension rights and pensions being paid in line with inflation, up
to a maximum of 5 per cent. With the latest recorded year-on-year increase
in retail price inflation at 2.8 per cent, a 25-year low, the
cross-subsidies have clearly been wiped out. It follows that companies have
to pay more to meet a given pension promise.
The government has also made a number of cuts in the tax privileges enjoyed
by pension funds. Lord Lawson, who refers disparagingly in his memoirs to
'the middle-class welfare state', tried but failed to remove the anomalous
tax relief on lump sum payments on retirement because of pressure from the
pensions lobby. He responded to this rebuff by seeking to tax pension funds
by the back door, starting, in 1986, by imposing a statutory limit on the
size of temporarily bloated pension fund surpluses.
This delighted company finance directors by encouraging them to claw back
pension fund surpluses into profits through pension fund holidays. But the
result is that pension fund finances have been greatly weakened. Actuarial
surpluses have been run down, just as dividend income has come under
pressure and the inflation subsidy has disappeared.
Lawson's move also reduced the incentive for companies to run occupational
pension schemes since it made them a less attractive tax shelter. The scope
for smoothing profits and tax liabilities has been reduced. And subsequent
tax changes, such as the cap imposed in 1989 on the amount of pension that
qualifies for tax relief and the reduction of the tax credit on dividends,
have increased the distortions in the system for taxing savings.
One final problem for companies is that a majority of pension funds are now
mature, in the sense that they are paying out most of the income from
contributions and dividends in the form of pensions. As Penny Webster, a
partner in consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow points out, most actuaries
feel obliged to advise pension fund trustees to adopt a lower risk approach
to investment, which is heralding a shift from equities towards gilts and
thus lower investment returns. This is to ensure greater protection for
benefits that no longer enjoy the cushion of a big surplus of cash flow over
outgoings.
In Britain, actuarial practice does not lead to disinflationary scare
stories of the kind that afflict the General Motors pension fund in the US,
where each one percentage point fall in bond yields has added Dollars
5bn-Dollars 6bn to pension liabilities. But some actuaries claim that there
is now a shift towards more pessimistic valuation assumptions. And there is
controversy over whether the trend would be more pronounced if the
government introduces new minimum solvency requirements in response to the
Goode committee report on pension law reform.
While actuarial assumptions cannot affect the ultimate cost of pensions,
they do affect corporate cash flow in the short and medium term. Knowing
that a prudent increase in contributions today may be compensated for by
lower contributions later is no consolation to employers now emerging from
recession.
The result is that few, if any, defined benefit (final pay-related) pension
schemes are being set up. Company finance directors are, says consulting
actuary Mr Bryn Davies, 'addicted' to pension fund holidays and reluctant to
contemplate pumping company cash back into pension funds.
It is at this point that Mr Clarke makes his Budget debut. It seems unlikely
that his chief interest will lie in enhancing the coherence of the pension
system or injecting logic into the ramshackle arrangements for the taxation
of savings. His priorities will be financial; and there are many who want to
help him effect a swift and sizeable transfer of cash from the pension funds
to the exchequer.
Former economic secretary to the Treasury, Mr John Maples, suggests removing
tax relief on pension contributions while making pension payments exempt
from tax. This would be worth Pounds 7bn a year to the exchequer on the
basis of a 25 per cent tax charge. Alternatively, Mr Clarke could further
restrict the tax credit on dividends received by pension funds. Or he could
remove the upper rate tax relief on contributions. Or, again, he could
remove the lump sum relief on retirement.
The Maples proposal is more complex than it appears, because of the
inter-relationship between private occupational pension schemes and the
state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). Changing the tax arrangements
for private sector schemes would involve making changes to Serps, part of
whose cost is met by the private system via guaranteed minimum pensions.
The administrative problems of such a change for the private sector alone
would be considerable. Employers would have to run parallel systems for
existing and for new employees. Given that some beneficiaries will live into
their nineties, this absurdity could last for 70-odd years. Since funds for
existing pension scheme members would have to be closed, an actuarial
valuation would need to be carried out on a so-called discontinuance basis,
which is more cautious than a long-term valuation for an ongoing fund. This
would almost certainly lead to a requirement for increased contributions
from companies. Other tax changes might also add to the disincentives for
employers to continue with final pay-related pension schemes.
The disturbing point is that the government is undermining the incentives
for private pension provision via companies just when the move to price
uprating in the state system is ensuring that the state's pension safety net
in the 21st century will be wholly inadequate. The alternative, favoured
more by right-wing ministers - personal pensions  - cannot provide an
adequate alternative because the cost of personal pensions is prohibitive
for the lower paid.
If the government continues to run down the state system, while companies
become increasingly disillusioned with final pay schemes, the least bad
option may be one advocated by the social security select committee
chairman, Labour's Mr Frank Field - company-run defined contribution (money
purchase) schemes, where the investment risk falls entirely on the pension
scheme member. But with tax incentives dwindling, no shortage of labour and
constant pressure in capital markets for enhanced profits, employers may not
bother.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Planning to counter the budget crunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial advisers have in recent weeks noticed a strong surge in interest
in pension planning ahead of the Budget in 11 days. But they are urging
caution against hasty action, writes Andrew Jack.
If Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announces immediate changes to tax
relief on pensions, it may be worthwhile to accelerate pension contributions
before the changes come into effect - which could be from December 1, the
day after the Budget.
Topping up pensions could help if Mr Clarke reduces tax relief on pension
contributions, which is currently available at the higher rate up to certain
limits.
If this option were adopted - in line with declining limits on other
concessions, such as tax relief on mortgage interest - it could be
worthwhile to accelerate pension payments before the Budget. But this would
be most beneficial only if any changes were effective immediately.
The risk is that the chancellor could also increase the upper rate of income
tax. Anyone liable for tax at the higher rate who had made accelerated
pension payments would then be unable to take advantage of relief at the
higher level. However, there is a danger that any hasty action to start or
change a pension plan could trigger administrative costs and might lock
people into an undesirable option.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Man in the news: Act of faith on history's stage - F W de
Klerk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
History draws a fine line between the visionary leader and the dreamer: both
have visions, but only one succeeds in making his dreams come true.
Mr F W de Klerk of South Africa may this week have made the fatal mistake
which separates the one from the other, when he decided - against all the
odds and against the principles which he had so long espoused - to hand over
white power and accept majority rule.
It was one of the more extraordinary reversals in the history of nations,
which provides few examples of men who abdicate power without being forced
to do so. And it was certainly never Mr de Klerk's intention: not when he
acted on his initial vision of a peaceful multiracial South Africa, and
released Mr Nelson Mandela from prison nearly four years ago; and not when,
during the violence and anarchy that have followed, he refused better deals
than the one he has now accepted.
The deal he has signed will give him a place in a multiparty government of
national unity, and an unenforceable commitment from Mr Nelson Mandela,
likely to be the next president, that his views will not be ignored in
cabinet. But Mr Mandela let there be no mistake about his intentions: he
will try to obtain Mr de Klerk's assent for government action; but where he
cannot, he will proceed nonetheless. The majority will rule, and the
minority will have no constitutional power to stop it. Power will be shared,
but only so long as it suits Mr Mandela to share it.
Government spokesman Dave Steward speaks of the 'deep underlying symbiotic
relationship' which underpins power-sharing; but it is hard to see that
happy relationship surviving long under the strains of cohabitation.
Yet Mr de Klerk did not set out to bargain away white power: his supporters
did not elect him to do so; those who voted resoundingly for him in last
year's white referendum were promised a different outcome.
He set out, ironically, to avoid the fate of the white minority regime in
Rhodesia, which waited to negotiate until it had fallen from strength, and
was left with an ineffectual 20-seat bloc in a 100-seat national assembly,
under black majority rule. The plan was for the South African government -
which had never lost a liberation war and had successfully crushed dissent
before opening negotiations - to negotiate from strength to guarantee the
best future deal for whites.
This was supposed to include entrenched powers for minority parties in
cabinet, including what amounted to a veto for Mr de Klerk's National party
on important issues; and autonomy for regional governments, to provide a
check on central government power. Until recently, the National party was
not interested in the argument that conventions of multiracial power-sharing
would develop over time; it argued that whites' fear of majority rule would
make them reject a constitution which embodied it.
All that has changed: government negotiators insist the constitution lays
the basis for a 'convention' of power-sharing, and that Mr Mandela has
accepted a gentleman's agreement to respect it. But minorities have neither
a veto in cabinet, nor any blocking power; they could walk out of cabinet,
but this would not bring down the government. Moreover, the constitution
fails to entrench powerful regional government, which was another National
party demand.
It is a measure of Mr de Klerk's image as a shrewd politician who skilfully
fights his corner that many observers assume not that the president has
conceded defeat, but that he has a trick up his sleeve which will deliver
real power into his hands in the end.
That may yet be true: for Mr de Klerk seems genuinely to believe the ANC
cannot - and will not try - to rule without the National party. He is
gambling on the fact that his party's power in fact will far exceed that in
law. That power, say government negotiators, is based on the party's
strength in the civil service and security forces (packed with Afrikaners
since 1948), the economic clout of whites, the favour of the international
community (which Mr de Klerk sees as his ally) and the votes of the National
party electorate.
His negotiators now argue (albeit belatedly) that constitutional guarantees
are worth nothing unless the party proves it is indispensable to the
country's new rulers: that restoring stability, the ANC's chief short-term
goal, cannot be achieved without security force co-operation, which only the
National party can deliver.
But Mr de Klerk does not intend simply to play the role of what political
analyst Steven Friedman, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, calls
'gate keeper to white confidence'. Mr de Klerk believes a 'silent majority'
of black, coloured and Indian voters will flock to the NP from the ANC -
whether in response to spiralling violence, or because coloureds and Indians
will reject the ANC as an African party, or because other Africans fear the
prominence of the Xhosa tribe in the ANC leadership.
Only next year's election will tell whether Mr de Klerk imagines votes where
they do not exist, and sees powerful backers where none are present. Recent
opinion polls have given the NP 11 to 13 per cent of the national vote, and
though this is almost certainly understated, the constitution agreed this
week will do little to bolster his white support. Dissent over the
constitution could yet split the party, with hardline ministers furious at
the deal.
Mr de Klerk's act of faith in his electoral support may pay off. If it does,
it will indeed guarantee his party, and the Afrikaner nation which he set
out to protect, a more secure long-term future than the minimum entrenched
powers available from the ANC. But the risks are enormous. If he is wrong,
Mr de Klerk could end up forfeiting all effective minority power, and being
branded a traitor by his own people (many of whom already name him so). It
would be a tragic irony if the man who had the courage to end apartheid
should do no more than exchange one form of racial domination for another,
and be forced off the stage of history at what ought to have been his
greatest hour.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Climbing out of the hole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government is in better shape at the start of the new
parliamentary season than it was at the conclusion of the old. The
Conservative party appears to be in a less fractious mood now that the
Maastricht treaty is behind it. Tories should be able to unite behind the
items outlined in the Queen's speech on Thursday. The prime minister, who at
the end of the summer was left hanging by his fingernails over a chasm, has
begun a long climb towards safer ground. His bold initiative on Northern
Ireland might just restore his reputation, at least as a skilled negotiator.
Meanwhile the economic recovery is leading its political counterpart, at
about the optimum pace. The rate of return to growth is sufficient to
provide hope, but not too rapid to constitute overheating. This should best
suit the government as it prepares for Budget day on Tuesday week.
Encouraging
It must have been hoping for signs of increased activity encouraging enough
to allow the chancellor to raise taxes without appearing to risk choking off
recovery, and yet not so strong that an offsetting interest rate cut is
ruled out.
To judge by the past week, things are turning out just right - the economy
is indeed growing, but only modestly. Output rose by 0.6 per cent in the
third quarter and at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent. Broad money growth
accelerated in October.
An unexpectedly large seasonally adjusted 49,000 fall in unemployment last
month brings the total decrease this year to 137,000. A batch of
encouraging, if statistically unreliable, trade figures suggested this week
that the government may be getting the kind of export-led recovery that
Britain needs. The overall trade deficit in August fell to its lowest
monthly total for 6 1/2 years. More reliable was yesterday's news that the
deficit with countries outside the European Union fell to Pounds 293m in
October from Pounds 921m in September, while the value of exports rose by
8.8 per cent.
Yet the improvement in the balance of trade is partly the result, of low
retail demand. The value of imports from non-EC countries fell 3.5 per cent,
while total retail sales volumes rose in October by a mere 0.1 per cent to
stand 3.2 per cent higher than a year ago. This is the lowest year-on-year
rate of growth for five months. Price competition is intense. The fall in
unemployment disguises a still rather depressed labour market with
employment growth effectively flat while wage inflation is low and falling.
Meanwhile the retail prices index fell 0.1 per cent in October, cutting the
annual rate of inflation to 1.4 per cent. In short, Mr Major has a
sufficiently modest recovery to justify a further interest rate cut. Whether
he will get the kind of accelerating recovery he needs over the coming two
years remains in doubt, given the fact that still indebted consumers will be
facing a rising tax burden between now and the next election, while the
ability of UK exporters to grab market share as growth in Europe revives is,
as yet, untested.
On the political front his new slogan, 'back to basics', remains very much
under test. Conservative party workers and, perhaps, backbench MPs have
shown signs of rallying round, but the broader electorate remains sceptical.
Insofar as 'back to basics' means anything, its application to the
legislation announced in the Queen's speech is questionable. A harsher
law-and-order regime is, at best, an incomplete answer to the challenge of
rising crime. A new quango for teacher training is an inadequate response to
the challenge laid down on Monday by Sir Claus Moser's freelance national
commission on education, which argued forcefully that the development of
knowledge-based industries requires an intensified educational programme.
The rest of the Queen's speech is a rag-bag, containing proposals chosen for
their acceptability by potential Tory rebels. What is left of the coal
industry is to be privatised, but the government has declined to apply the
same principle to London's buses.
It is leaving Sunday trading to a free vote - which, it must be hoped, comes
down in favour of maximum deregulation - and dodging the promise of a new
environmental agency by passing a 'paving' bill, allowing officials to
prepare the way. The umpteenth local government bills since 1979 will
restructure councils in Wales and Scotland.
Verified
If the overall programme is uninspiring, Mr Major's courageous assumption of
personal responsibility for Northern Ireland this week is wholly to his
credit. In spite of his administration's occasional dependence on Unionist
votes he has put the more recalcitrant of them on notice that if they
decline to take part in peace talks they will be left out. He has offered
Sinn Fein a place at the table in return for a verified end to IRA violence.
He is working, with Dublin, towards an overall political settlement. If the
Ulster parties fail to agree on new structures, he intimated on Thursday, he
will produce proposals of his own. History suggests that the odds are
against success, but the prime minister is right to try.

A COMPROMISE deal between Amec Offshore and officials of the GMBU general

averted an indefinite all-out strike at the Tyneside offshore fabrication
company, Chris Tighe writes.
The threatened strike by the 900 manual workers was over company plans to
make the night shift work seven hours a week longer without extra pay.
An overtime ban has also been called off. Under the compromise the night
shift will work an extra four hours. All employees will receive a one-off
compensation payment and night-shift workers will receive extra payments
until June.

PRISON officers yesterday decided to challenge Thursday's High Court
judgment that they had no right to take industrial action.
The challenge comes as the Prison Officers' Association faces removal from
the government's list of trade unions.
The association yesterday wrote to its members telling them to comply with
the court's instruction to call off three days of industrial action planned
for next week.
Mr John Bartell, its chairman, said the association planned legal action to
overturn the court ruling. 'We will go to trial over this issue. The court
decision will lead to more chaos and disruption in the prison service than
our industrial action would ever have done.'
The Trades Union Congress said it was seeking an urgent meeting with leaders
of the 30,000-member association, which said it intended to 'step back and
let the government sort out the chaos'.
The government stressed it had not intended to remove union rights from
prison officers. The Home Office said: 'Matters could not be left as they
are. We want to move quickly to restore their rights under employment laws.'
The judgment may raise human rights questions for the government, which has
already been forced to reconsider its stance on union membership at GCHQ.
The association had planned not to accept prisoners brought by the police or
Group 4, the private security company, from Monday, in a protest over
privatisation and prison overcrowding.
Mr Justice May, in granting the injunction, accepted the government's
arguments that because prison officers hold the office of constables they
are not protected under employment law if they take industrial action that
breaches their contracts.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said many questions needed to be resolved
to put industrial relations in the prison service, including relations with
the association, on a proper footing.
There was a need to extend to prison officers 'the appropriate elements of
employment protection legislation which they do not currently enjoy,
including access to industrial tribunals; and to provide arrangements by
which prison officers' remuneration can be settled'.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Judge suspends Ramsden sentence: Guilty pleas avoid a
daunting trial after SFO's most demanding investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY RAMSDEN, former chairman of Glen International and acknowledged
'king' of the Japanese warrants market, yesterday pleaded guilty to four
charges of fraud at the Old Bailey.
His plea marks the end of the most complex prosecution yet brought by the
Serious Fraud Office, and avoids a trial most lawyers predicted would be
particularly complicated and arduous.
After what the SFO called 'constructive discussions' with him, Mr Ramsden
admitted four counts of making reckless or false statements to induce
investments. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended for two
years.
The complexity of Mr Ramsden's multi-million pound trading in Japanese
warrants (long-term options on stocks) and his 'back of an envelope'
accounting methods had made the case the SFO's most demanding investigation.
Lawyers for the SFO yesterday responded to public criticism of the office by
claiming Mr Ramsden's plea demonstrated the effectiveness of its operations.
They said the case had been seen by some people as unprosecutable.
Mr Jeremy Roberts QC, for the SFO, told the court that Mr Ramsden had a
'meteoric' rise in the City through the success of Glen International.
However his fall, when the company collapsed in September 1987 owing Pounds
100m, was even more meteoric.
Between the end of May 1987 and July that year, he had persuaded banks and
securities houses to invest many millions of pounds in his warrant trading
'funding circles' which involved a risky and complicated series of
transactions. At that time he had known there was a substantial risk Glen
International could not meet its obligations, Mr Roberts said.
Mr Ramsden's problems had stemmed from his taking money out of Glen
International to finance other activities such as buying racehorses, Mr
Roberts said. By taking money out of the profitable parts of his business,
he had left himself exposed to the large losses he sustained on the volatile
warrants market.
His problems had become serious when he had defaulted on an agreement to buy
warrants from Nikko Securities which then stopped acting as a partner in his
funding circle. He had then been forced to look for other investors.
Among the new investors he had found were the National Commercial Bank of
Saudi Arabia and the Japanese securities houses Cosmo Securities and
Taiheiyo Europe.
He had raised a total of Pounds 90m from these institutions knowing his
company might have problems eventually buying the warrants from them as he
had agreed.
Mr Ramsden had not set out to defraud his creditors, but was guilty of
criminal recklessness, Mr Roberts said.
He added: 'The prosecution say it was quite wrong to obtain new funds
without a full and frank disclosure of the mess that Glen International was
in.'
Judge Pownall QC, passing sentence, said Mr Ramsden had built up an honest
and phenomenally successful business of which he could be proud. 'It is all
the more sad that by your plea you have had to admit recklessness,' he said.
Explaining his decision to suspend the four concurrent two-year jail
sentences, the judge said the offences to which Mr Ramsden had admitted
would normally result in immediate prison sentences.
However, Mr Ramsden had tried to repay creditors before being declared
bankrupt owing Pounds 25m. He had also had to endure almost six months
imprisonment in the 'quite appalling' conditions of Terminal Island jail in
Los Angeles.
Mr Anthony Arlidge QC, for Mr Ramsden, had earlier said that the jail had a
threatening and violent atmosphere with dangerous gangs operating inside it.
Mr Ramsden, the son of a postman, left school at 16 and began working in the
settlements and clearing areas of the stock exchange before starting to
trade the foreign stocks, particularly Japanese ones, upon which his
reputation grew.
At the height of his success, Mr Ramsden was noted for his lifestyle of
conspicuous consumption. The owner of some 80 racehorses, he was also billed
by the racing press as 'the biggest punter in the history of the turf'. In
1985 alone, his gambling losses were said to total Pounds 26m.
Yesterday he left the Old Bailey saying: 'I have had a very difficult time
in my life. I am glad it is all over.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / Lloyd's agents pessimistic about Merrett Group's survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S agents were pessi-mistic yesterday about the survival prospects of
the Merrett Group, which owns one of the largest managing agents at the
insurance market and administers two of its biggest syndicates.
Merrett was hit this week by the withdrawal of a US plan which would have
compensated for a sharp fall in the number of Names  - the individuals whose
assets support Lloyd's  - prepared to back the agency's syndicates.
Efforts to drum up support from members' agents, which allocate Names to
syndicates, appear to have been unsuccessful. One members' agent said that
Merrett's biggest syndicate, number 418, needed a minimum of Pounds 50m of
capacity (capital supporting underwriting) from Names to survive. But by
yesterday morning only between Pounds 32m and Pounds 33m had been secured.
'I don't think it will fly,' said the agent. 'I just can't sell the
syndicate to Names.'
Without more support it appears that the syndicate will not be big enough to
accept a 'reinsurance to close'  - an arrangement used by Lloyd's syndicates
through which outstanding liabilities are transferred from one year of
account to the next.
If this occurred, 418 would be forced to stop accepting new business in 1994
and would be likely to leave the accounts of its 1991, 1992, and 1993 years
'open'  - because of uncertainty about the scale of future claims.
The same fate could also be in store for syndicate 1067, which has also
suffered a decline in backing from agents.
This is a crisis for the Merrett Group that would have seemed inconceivable
in 1988 when 418 had 7,537 Names, a capacity of Pounds 285m  - and was
regarded as a flagship for the Lloyd's market. Traditionally specialising in
marine insurance and areas such as war risks, Mr Stephen Merrett,
underwriter and chairman of the group, had spearheaded diversification into
one of the most rapidly growing areas of the international market  - US
legal liabilities ranging from pollution and workers' compensation to the
professional indemnity risks of accountants and company directors.
The syndicate became an important market for US brokers such as Marsh &amp;
McLennan, leading giant coverages for US corporate buyers.
In the US Mr Merrett won a reputation as a leading international specialist
on issues such as environmental liability. At Lloyd's, although he was never
a popular figure, Mr Merrett won a reputation as a tough and knowledgeable
underwriter.
Earlier this year Mr Merrett became deputy chairman of the market, but his
reputation had already been damaged as the scale of losses suffered by 418
in 1985 on a series of large US reinsurance contracts became clear.
In one of the biggest legal actions at the market, 2,000 Names are claiming
substantial damages in actions against their agents and Mr Merrett.
The management of the Merrett agency has also come under fire because of
delays in the reporting of 418's 1990 losses  - which amount to about Pounds
67.3m compared with capacity of Pounds 213.5m.
Bad publicity, much of it stemming from the legal action, has made matters
worse. In August, following intense pressure from senior figures at Lloyd's,
Mr Merrett resigned as deputy chairman.
Agents are playing down the potential impact on the market as a whole. They
are confident, for example, that other Lloyd's agencies will take over
administration of the three remaining syndicates and say much of the
business now led by 418 and 1067 could be picked up by rival syndicates at
Lloyd's. Following the successful attraction of corporate investors, many
syndicates are now relatively flush with capital for the first time for
three years.
'I know it can't do the market any good to lose the name of Merrett,' said
one members' agent. 'But brokers will simply place the business elsewhere.'
Several thousand Names would pick up the bill for 'running off' the
syndicates (paying and administering claims on existing policies). Here too,
though, agents are optimistic that the extra costs would be limited. Both
418 and 1067 are currently expected to make profits in 1991 and 1992, and
agents suggest that the Lloyd's Corporation  - which regulates and
administers the market  - may conduct the 'run-off' of 418 and 1067's 'open
years' between 1990 and 1993.
The biggest loser would be the Merrett Group itself. The loss of income from
its two biggest syndicates would stretch the resources of the agency and
raise questions about its capacity to manage its three other syndicates  -
179, 332 and 1184  - as well as about the future of the group as a whole.
As for Mr Merrett, the affair completes a disastrous year. Earlier this week
Mr Bob Clements, the president of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, and one of the
most influential figures in the US insurance industry, offered a vote of
confidence, when he described much recent criticism of Mr Merrett as
'personalised' and 'without regard to fundamentals'.
It is evidently a view that many Names and some of their agents do not
share. 'Like Thatcher or Gorbachev, Mr Merrett is lauded overseas but not in
his country of origin,' said one agent.

FT  20 NOV 93 / British Coal adds fifth pit to proposed closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL wants to shut its Silverdale pit in Staffordshire, taking to
five the number of collieries where closure has been proposed.
Littleton in Staffordshire may become the sixth on Monday when management
meets union leaders at the pit.
Production at Silverdale will end on December 3 if miners decide not to
fight the closure. British Coal told local union leaders that the pit had
lost Pounds 5.7m in the past six months. Financial and market pressures had
forced the closure proposal.
British Coal, which operates 30 pits including the five named for closure,
said it would make every effort to transfer miners to other pits but
admitted there would only be 'limited opportunities'.
Silverdale was one of 12 pits reprieved in the government's white paper in
March and has been 'market tested' to try to find new sales. The pit was
sunk more than 100 years ago as an iron ore mine before coal reserves were
discovered. It produces about 1m tonnes of coal a year and is one of the
last remaining collieries linked to a pit village.
The announcement came as miners in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, worked their
final shift after voting to accept closure.
British Coal and the National Rivers Authority, the river pollution
watchdog, have agreed a framework for dealing with the ending of water
pumping at pits that face closure and the consequent threat of minewater
pollution, Chris Tighe writes.
The authority said yesterday that under a new memorandum of understanding
signed this week it will be fully informed by British Coal before any
pumping operations cease and given the data needed to predict future
consequences. The agreement between the two bodies covers all future pit
closures in England and Wales.
Mr Malcolm Colley, technical manager for the authority in its Northumbria
and Yorkshire region, said the agreement could mean that should a pit close
very suddenly, British Coal would have to continue pumping for some time
afterwards. This would ensure a phased withdrawal and allow time for action
to prevent minewater contaminated with metals from polluting streams and
rivers.
Anxiety over the threat of minewater pollution has been sparked by the rapid
recent closure of collieries. The authority had expressed concern that it
was not always informed in advance by British Coal when pumping was to
cease, and had warned it would consider legal action should the environment
be at risk.

FT  20 NOV 93 / The fat worker and other tales of union life: David Goodhart
laments the loss after 142 years of the AEEU's anecdotes from the shop floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL THE 20 assemblers win equal pay with the seven people in the wire tag
section who earn 90p an hour more at Potterton the boiler-makers? Will the
workers at the Morris Singer Foundry in Basingstoke continue to resist
compulsory redundancies by working short time instead?
Alas, we may never know the outcome of these everyday tales of shop floor
negotiations in British manufacturing. For the monthly business reports of
the regional officials of the AEEU craft union, where they are painstakingly
recorded, have been published for the last time.
Since 1851 the reports have been a barometer of the shop-floor mood,
capturing in a few short sentences the officials' six or seven most
important meetings of the month with employers, members and shop stewards.
The reports, which appear under unflattering passport pictures of the 30
officials, now bear a strong whiff of the 1950s. But the issues that arise
most often  - regrading, differential disputes, selection for redundancy  -
are still the bread and butter of manufacturing labour relations.
The following report from Mr Dave Gough, north-west, about Ford, is typical:
'Met senior management and shop stewards concerned about company intention
to temporarily transfer eight craftsmen to production line without
agreement. Although no loss of pay, members are worried about loss of status
and the creation of a precedent for the future.'
The tone is not always belligerent. Mr Denis O'Flynn of the AEEU Foundry
Division writes about TRW Valves of Wednesbury: 'The company would not be
moved from its intended action of curtailing the role of the convenor. A
tour around the factory proved to be both interesting and educational. My
thanks to the management for the opportunity to see some innovatory ideas in
action.'
But organised labour is not always a push-over, as Mr John Hodgkins from the
South West reports about Aerostructures in Hamble. 'The management insisted
on going ahead with three dismissals. Arrangements were made for a mass
meeting with a recommendation for a ballot for strike action. The management
found alternative work for our members before the meeting took place.'
Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, regrets the
passing of the reports. 'They are an irreplaceable primary source for what
is actually happening in manufacturing and a far better guide than all the
academic research which says that British industrial relations is totally
transformed,' he says.
The reports have been useful for spotting manufacturing-wide trends. The
last issue, for example, shows a cautious increase in pay militancy with
about 10 bargaining groups deciding to reject 'final' pay offers from
companies and opting for strike ballots. That is a markedly higher number
than in previous months.
Also, big companies which claim entirely to have decentralised pay
bargaining to individual plants, but still operate de facto central control,
can be caught out by a flick through the regional reports which show the
same offer being made everywhere.
There are plenty of industrial curiosities in the last issue. Such as the
man at NEI Clark Chapman who was suspended for being overweight, or the
dispute at Valor Heating when workers had part of their pay docked when work
was disrupted by a bomb scare.
The reports, like the union, are old-fashioned but rooted in the labour
movement's 19th century traditions of democracy and accountability. 'The
trouble is they no longer fit,' says one AEEU official as the union replaces
the monthly journal with a slick new quarterly magazine sent to every
member. But this will be a poor substitute for keen students of labour
relations in British manufacturing.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Howard yields on Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday moved to rescue its Sunday Trading bill by bowing
to pressure to extend employee protection against being forced to work on
Sundays.
The extension of protection to future shopworkers, as well as those already
in employment, was a significant climbdown  - Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary, had repeatedly refused demands for protection to be extended.
It also increases the chance that confusion surrounding Sunday opening in
England and Wales will be resolved this year. Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office
minister, said MPs would be given a free vote 'well before Christmas' on the
bill's three options for reform.
The options, in the order they appear in the bill, are:
Total deregulation.
Strict regulation, prohibiting large shops from opening except four Sundays
before Christmas, but allowing DIY shops and garden centres and some small
shops to open.
Partial de-regulation, allowing small shops to open at will, but restricting
large shops to six hours.
Campaign groups and MPs had warned that the government's previous stance on
worker protection threatened to derail the bill by ensuring that none of the
options would attract enough support from MPs to gain an overall majority.
Mr Lloyd said: 'It became clear that for a great many people an essential
ingredient of an acceptable and satisfactory resolution of this matter
involved a degree of protection not just for existing workers but for future
workers.'
The bill would not allow shopworkers in England and Wales from being
dismissed or unfairly treated  - for example by refusal of training or
promotion  - for refusing to work on Sundays. It would also extend
protection from shop-floor workers to 'all workers in or about a shop'.
The government's move came two days after the Keep Sunday Special Campaign
and Retailers for Shops Act Reform  - which support strict regulation of
Sunday trading  - combined forces.
The change may benefit the government's de-regulation options the most. Many
Labour and backbench Conservative MPs are thought to have been swayed by
constituents' support for Sunday opening but were not prepared to vote for
de-regulation without protection for new workers.
Campaign groups welcomed the decision, but the Keep Sunday Special Campaign
said it would continue to call for statutory double-time payments for Sunday
working. Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, which recently switched allegiance
from KSSC to the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which supports partial
de-regulation, is also pressing for double-time pay.
Mr Lloyd warned that the government would 'certainly whip against' any
amendment proposing premium payments, which it believed would discriminate
unfairly against small shops.
The date tipped for the bill's second reading, when MPs will vote on the
principle of reforming the 1950 Shops Act, is November 29. The vote on the
options is expected on December 8 or 13.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Problems at Merrett Group intensify
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS of the Merrett Group were intensified yesterday by the
resignation of three senior executives.
Mr Dennis Purkiss, group chief executive, is to take a prominent position
with a leading UK company. Mr Ken Barrett, the underwriter of syndicates
1066, 67 and 68 - which Merrett had intended to merge into syndicate 1067
next year - and Mr Stewart Laderman, the underwriter of 418's non-marine
division, have also accepted positions outside the group 'where they
perceive to be better able to sustain their personal underwriting
aspirations'.
Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman, said in a briefing note to staff that
discussions were 'in progress to determine the future arrangements in
covering their various responsibilities'.
Mr Barrett became active underwriter of 1067 in July this year after the
resignation of Mr Stephen Burnhope.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Non-EU trade gap falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT reported yesterday that the UK's visible trade gap with
countries outside the European Union fell from a revised figure of Pounds
921m for September to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 293m in October.
The deficit last month was the smallest with non-EU countries since January
1988, when the Central Statistical Office first produced such figures. It
reflected a jump of nearly 9 per cent in the value of exports to Pounds
5.28bn last month  - a record in value terms.
At the same time imports fell 3.5 per cent to Pounds 5.57bn from Pounds
5.77bn. Britain recorded a surplus in trade in manufactures with non-EU
countries of Pounds 170m last month, the first such surplus since January
1988. Exports of finished manufactures, food and fuels rose sharply last
month in volume terms.
Yesterday's figures suggest that UK exporters are taking advantage of
stronger growth in the US. The Pounds 138m surplus in north American trade
in October was the highest since March 1989. Britain maintained its
traditional surplus with the oil exporting countries.
Taking three-month figures, which the government says give a better guide to
trends, exports in August, September and October were 4.5 per cent higher in
value terms than in the May-July period while imports rose 3 per cent.
Compared with the same period last year, exports were 28 per cent higher and
imports 22 per cent higher.
In volume terms, exports were 2 per cent higher in the latest three months
compared with the three months to the end of July, while imports were up 4
per cent. Volume exports and imports were up by 14 per cent and 12 per cent
respectively compared with August-October 1992.
Just under half Britain's visible trade is with non-EU countries. These
figures are produced on a more timely basis than those with the UK's
European Union partners, which have been plagued by problems with the
Intrastat system of gathering trade statistics introduced in January.
However, recent large monthly changes in the non-EU figures have made it
difficult for the CSO to assess the trend, although the deficit appears to
have been falling since January. Its latest estimates of trends suggested
that UK exports to non-EU countries were growing in value at 1.5 per cent a
month compared with 0.5 per cent growth per month for imports.
Figures for trade volumes have also fluctuated. For example exports
excluding oil and erratic items such as ships, aircraft, precious stones and
silver jumped 11 per cent in October compared with September, while imports
excluding oil and erratics rose by 2.5 per cent. The CSO estimated that
underlying export growth was about 1.5 per cent between September and
October compared with 1 per cent for imports.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Staff at Yarrow to return to work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITE-COLLAR workers on strike at the Yarrow warship yard on the Clyde voted
yesterday to return to work, having successfully fought off an attempt to
introduce performance-related pay for 500 draughtsmen and supervisory staff.
The staff walked out two weeks ago in protest at a pay offer of 1.8 per cent
plus a performance-linked rise of up to 2.6 per cent.
Yesterday's deal gives all white-collar staff a general increase of 2.5 per
cent. Officials of the MSF technical union said performance-related pay
would never work in the shipbuilding industry.
Yarrow, part of the GEC group, has orders for three warships for the Royal
Navy and for two more for the Malaysian navy.

FT  20 NOV 93 / BZW fined for breach of rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW Futures, the futures broking arm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has been
fined a total of Pounds 67,500 by the London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange for breaching its rules.
As well as fining BZW, Liffe fined four BZW floor traders, who were found to
have 'acted with reckless disregard for the interests of a client' in
incidents between April and June 1992. Liffe fined all four traders and
suspended them from the exchange floor for between two weeks and two months.
The breaches involved executing clients' orders at disadvantageous rates and
crediting the resulting profit to a BZW futures account. Nearly 100 bond
futures trades were executed through BZW Futures' 'error account', designed
to handle failed trades.
The breaches involved losses to clients of less than Pounds 5,000, and there
was no personal profit for the traders.
The four were named as Mr Giovanni Cameran, booth manager, Mr Tom Rainey,
booth broker, Ms Louisa Gibson, pit trader, and Mr Jason Willis, booth
broker. Mr Cameran and Mr Rainey have both resigned from BZW, a spokesman
said.
Mr Cameran was fined Pounds 2,000, Mr Rainey Pounds 4,750 and Ms Gibson and
Mr Willis Pounds 1,000 each by Liffe.
The breaches were discovered as a result of routine surveillance procedures,
Liffe said. Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of Liffe, said: 'It is a
matter of great regret that these breaches of the exchange's rules
occurred.'
The breaches are an embarrassment for Mr Nick Durlacher, BZW Futures
chairman, who is also the chairman of Liffe. BZW said yesterday it accepted
the findings of the Liffe disciplinary panel and did not condone any
disregard for Liffe rules.
BZW has about 35 traders and support staff on the Liffe floor. In 1992, BZW
Futures contributed Pounds 5.75m to BZW's Pounds 241.8m pre-tax profits.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Dublin urges London to legitimise unity goal: Tim Coone
examines the painstakingly crafted wording intended to lead to a settlement
in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEAKED document published by the Irish Press in Dublin yesterday, which
sets out the Irish government's view on a possible peace settlement in
Northern Ireland, is a draft counterpart to an earlier, equivalent British
government paper which remains secret.
Both papers were prepared after talks between civil servants from both
governments over the past two months.
Final drafts from both sides are expected to provide the basis for a
statement from the British and Irish prime ministers, tentatively scheduled
for early December. This would provide a blueprint for a peace settlement in
Northern Ireland and a basis for resuming round-table political talks in the
province.
The document is not a final draft, and has not been politically cleared at
the top level. Indeed Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
yesterday said it had no connection with the peace process. Nonetheless the
document is the clearest indication yet of what is seen in Dublin as a basis
for a political settlement.
It also indicates the concessions Dublin is seeking from the British
government in return for dropping its territorial claim to the province.
Its main points are:
Both governments must 'be open to change' in their 'constitutional
doctrines' relating to Ulster to reflect more accurately the divided
loyalties there, and would be required to 'encourage the process of
agreement among all the people who inhabit the island'.
Both governments would recognise 'the legitimacy of the two major traditions
that exist in Ireland  - those who wish for no change in the present status
of Northern Ireland, and those who wish for a sovereign united Ireland
achieved by peaceful means and by agreement'.
A downgrading of Dublin's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland  - to an
aspiration  - would be balanced by Britain acknowledging 'the full
legitimacy and value of the goal of Irish unity by agreement, cherished by
the greater number of people living in Ireland'.
'Objective meaningful expression and opportunity' to the aspiration of
unification would be created through new Anglo-Irish structures and by
incorporation of special provisions into any new devolved government
structures in Northern Ireland.
A new devolved administration in the province 'would assume executive and
legislative responsibilities over a wide range of subjects (but) must secure
widespread acceptance throughout both communities'.
New north-south institutions mandated by both parliaments 'to discharge or
oversee a range of executive functions' to be 'administered uniformly
throughout the island'. These functions could be expanded by agreement with
the new devolved administration.
These institutions would provide the framework for north-south co-operation,
especially 'for developing an integrated approach for the whole island in
respect of the challenges and opportunities of the EC'. They would be
subject to parliamentary scrutiny, 'including any new inter-parliamentary
forum which may be set up by agreement between elected representatives north
and south'.
A standing UK-Irish conference would 'guarantee and monitor' a new
agreement, and would have 'contingency powers of intervention and redress'
in the event that devolved power structures in the province failed to abide
by their obligations.
Majority consent in Northern Ireland to any change in its status would be
constitutionally guaranteed by the republic in a new agreement.
The majority in Northern Ireland are fully recognised to have a right 'to
withhold consent for any such change unless and until they are persuaded by
democratic political means only, free from coercion and violence'.
Negotiations on a political settlement would be only between those
'committed exclusively to constitutional methods and not with organisations
who use, threaten or support violence for political ends'.
Organisations which have 'demonstrably expressed their commitment to the
democratic process by renouncing violence' would be entitled to a role in
negotiations. Any new agreement would require endorsement by 'the people'  -
an oblique reference to an all-Ireland referendum.
It is thought the document has elements of the peace plans formulated by Mr
John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams,
Sinn Fein leader.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Teachers vote heavily to continue tests boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL ACTION in schools in England and Wales looks set to continue
after the largest teachers' union voted to maintain its boycott of national
curriculum tests.
The NUT's ballot had 69,732 members in favour of continuing the boycott with
only 3,477 against. About 139,000 were eligible to vote.
The government was swift to condemn the decision by the National Union of
Teachers, which was made in spite of a series of concessions. Other
teachers' unions showed solidarity with the NUT in continuing the boycott.
Last summer, boycotts by all three main teaching unions reduced the first
national tests for 14-year-olds to a farce, and forced the abandonment of
plans to publish league tables of schools' performance in the tests.
Since then, the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir
Ron Dearing, has announced that the number of items on which teachers must
assess 14-year-olds will be cut from 41 to six, while plans have been
scrapped for national tests in technology, modern languages, history and
geography. But all the main unions said teachers had yet to see any evidence
of reduced workload.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'The interim Dearing report,
the attitude of government and the material for future testing currently
available have not convinced teachers that the problems of workload and
educationally unsound tests have been resolved.'
Sir Ron is due to report to the Department for Education on detailed changes
to the curriculum by the end of next month, but Mr McAvoy said these were
unlikely to have an impact on the NUT's boycott. The union will consult its
members less formally when more information on testing is available.
Baroness Blatch, education minister, said: 'Parents will find it difficult
to understand the reason behind this decision given the changes already made
as a result of Sir Ron Dearing, and the degree to which teachers have been
consulted.'
Mr Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, described the news as 'disappointing', and said the tests had
already been 'streamlined' to 'provide teachers and parents with essential
information about children's progress'.
However, other teachers' unions gave strong support to the NUT. Mr Peter
Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, whose
union will ballot on the boycott after Sir Ron's final report has been
published, said: 'We would have expected the same result from our members.
Teachers in schools, rather than policymakers, are yet to experience a real
reduction in a killing workload.'
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said
his union's boycott would continue.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Brussels sets price for salmon imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday reacted to pressure from the Irish and
British governments by imposing a minimum price on imports of Norwegian
salmon into the European Union until the end of the year.
Scottish and Irish salmon producers have been hit by what the Commission
described yesterday as 'massive imports of Norwegian salmon at low prices'.
On Thursday the Norwegians rejected Commission calls to restrict salmon
exports. Yesterday, Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, the fisheries commissioner, took
action under the safeguard rules of the EU's common fisheries policy.
The decision comes at a sensitive time for Norway, which is negotiating
membership of the EU. Finding a way to preserve Norwegian fisheries is one
of the trickiest aspects of the membership talks.
The Commission's move was also attacked for not going far enough by the
Scottish Salmon Growers Association. Mr Jim Payne, chairman, said: 'The
levels of minimum import prices simply cement the market price at Norwegian
dumping levels and do nothing to resolve the crisis in the industry.'
The new minimum import price for fresh and frozen whole (ungutted) salmon is
Ecu2,860 (Pounds 2,633) per net tonne.
The Scottish Salmon Growers Association says that works out at Pounds 1.22
per pound, below the current weighted average price of Pounds 1.32 per pound
for salmon at fish markets. Prices have risen slightly since touching a low
point recently of about Pounds 1 per pound.
However, Norwegian sources said last night that the minimum price would
represent an increase 'in relation to the price of the last few weeks'.
Officials claim that total exports of Norwegian salmon for this year are
forecast to rise by only 5 per cent.
Norwegian salmon farmers say output is set to grow faster in Scotland and
Ireland than in Norway. They recently ended talks with Scottish and Irish
farmers on creating a network of producer organisations aimed at controlling
production.
The Irish government had formally requested safeguard measures, but the
British authorities - to the irritation of Scottish salmon farmers - had
only asked for 'appropriate measures' to deal with the problem.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Hurd hints at end to aid for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday warned the warring
factions in Bosnia that they could not expect humanitarian aid to continue
indefinitely if there was no progress towards peace.
He said in the Commons debate on the Queen's Speech: 'If the present
political vacuum and lack of co-operation persists, the parties cannot
expect the humanitarian commitment, which many of us undertake, to continue
indefinitely. It is unrealistic to suppose that this effort can be expected
to go on for ever and ever and ever when it is not receiving local
co-operation and there is no progress towards a political settlement.'
His remarks were seized upon by the Labour party as a signal that the UK was
contemplating the withdrawal of troops from Bosnia.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, described Mr Hurd's 'hint that
humanitarian aid might be stopped' as a 'grotesque error' of judgment. Mr
David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said he did not believe the signal
was particularly helpful. 'British troops should stay in Bosnia as long as
their mission is attainable,' he said.
Mr Hurd's remarks follow a warning this week from Lord Owen, peace envoy in
the former Yugoslavia, that the world community would have to decide how
long it could sustain intervention in Bosnia. Lord Owen told the
Confederation of British Industry in Harrogate there was a danger that
intervening in civil wars only worsened the situation. 'There will come a
moment when the world community will have to decide how long we can sustain
intervention.'
Whitehall officials yesterday played down suggestions that Britain might
withdraw in the short term, but warned that the UK may seriously consider
pulling out if the fighting continues into next spring.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Waste groups slam Tupe 'confusion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE DISPOSAL contractors will assume they must take on existing workforces
on unchanged pay and conditions when bidding for local authority contracts,
following new trade association guidance.
The decision by the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors
conflicts with government advice that there is no need to assume that the
controversial Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) Regulations of
1981, known as Tupe, apply to competitive tendering.
Mr Steve Webb, policy director for the association, said the decision was
necessary because 'some authorities were using the confusion to suit
themselves and they would apply Tupe when they wanted to and not when they
didn't'.
He said the government had added to the confusion by failing to make a firm
statement on the issue. 'The only thing we seemed able to do was to adopt a
policy that we would assume that Tupe does apply. That at least puts some
levels of certainty into the situation.'
Mr Webb said the association was confident its members would continue to win
local authority contracts even if they did not make swift savings through
redundancies or pay reductions.
The environment department said the association was free to tender on this
basis if it wished, but 'the legal position remains that private contractors
cannot determine just like that whether Tupe applies'.
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities welcomed the association's
decision as 'a belated recognition that Tupe at least exists'.
However, Ms Lesley Courcouf, the AMA's Tupe specialist, said it should be
left to local authorities to say whether Tupe applied.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Spending on cars boosts growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER spending, much of it on cars and durable goods, was the main
support of UK economic growth in the third quarter, government figures
indicated yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office reported that consumer spending increased in
real terms by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in the third quarter
compared with the second quarter, and by 2.4 per cent compared with the
third quarter of 1992.
By contrast, revised figures for UK gross domestic product confirmed a late
October report that the economy grew by just 0.6 per cent in the third
quarter. GDP grew by 1.9 per cent compared with the same period of 1992,
just under the 2 per cent annual growth estimated last month.
Overall domestic spending on goods and services increased by just 0.3 per
cent in the quarter and by 1.4 per cent compared with last year. This was
depressed by Pounds 423m of de-stocking and low government consumption,
which grew only 0.2 per cent in the quarter and 1.1 per cent over the past
year.
Investment rose by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter after falling 2.9 per
cent in the previous three months, and was 1 per cent up on the third
quarter of last year.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Possibility of a sea-change in IRA leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is taking seriously the possibility that Sinn Fein's recent
peace initiative with Mr John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour party
may represent a sea-change in the thinking of the IRA leadership, Philip
Stephens writes.
Intelligence reports seen by Mr John Major have supported the view expressed
by Mr Hume that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, may be ready to call a
halt to the violence.
That in turn has raised cautious hopes that the IRA's traditional Christmas
ceasefire might offer an opportunity for a more durable cessation of
violence.
In spite of high-level denials of any official contacts with Sinn Fein, it
is acknowledged in Whitehall that the British security services maintain
close contacts with members of the party.
Their reports suggest that, in spite of the military and political strength
of the nationalists, the present generation of IRA leaders is seeking an
alternative to the terrorist campaign.
Mr Adams' peace overtures are said to have had the support of the movement's
military leaders. Explanations for the apparent change of heart vary, but
the most common is that Mr Adams and his colleagues simply do not want the
next generation of Sinn Fein activists to have no future beyond violence.
They have been dismayed by the lack of support from Washington for the
republican movement and hit by a succession of arms cache discoveries in the
republic.
The reports, supported by the contacts of experienced local politicians in
the province, offer a partial explanation of Mr Major's public offers this
week of a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein if it renounced
violence.
But officials stressed that doubts remain over whether Mr Adams could
prevent a breakaway movement of hard-line IRA terrorists.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Life houses open attack on SIB plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIFE INSURANCE ind-ustry has begun preparing opposition to the draft
rules on commission disclosure issued this week by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.
Allied Dunbar, the life subsidiary of BAT Industries, has written to
regulators, politicians and chief executives in the industry warning that it
sees no basis on which disclosing commission can be made fair and
informative in terms of disclosing the potential for bias in giving advice.
Mr George Greener, BAT financial services chief executive, argued in the
letter that there was a risk that the plans would be manipulated, with
offices turning towards salaried rather than commission-based payments to
their staff in order to look more competitive.
He added that any disclosure regime which had to cover a range of sales
forces, from independent financial advisers working on a commission basis to
the salaried company representative who received bonuses, could not present
a clear picture of the equivalent incentive to sell.
Another of the largest life offices, Legal &amp; General, said yesterday that it
was 'still to be convinced that the proposals were the best way of
achieving' the aims of providing customers with the information they needed.
There is also concern among some life companies at the SIB's recommendation
that commission disclosure should apply to term assurance policies, which
are taken out for protection rather than for investment.
They fear that this could lead to a requirement for sales agents to reveal
the incentive to make a sale on other types of insurance as well.

TALKS between the European Union and the US on the farm trade controversy
secretly restarted yesterday in Brussels as Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade
negotiator, prepared to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in
Washington on Monday to attempt to break the deadlock in the Uruguay Round
of world trade negotiations.
Mr Joe O'Mara, a senior official from the US Agriculture Department,
yesterday met Mr Guy Legras, head of the European Commission's agriculture
directorate.
'We had a discussion, and it's one of a seris of discussions we've been
having, and that will continue' between now and the December 15 deadline set
to conclude the Round, Mr O'Mara said.
He refused to divulge any details of the talks, which the Commission has not
acknowledged as taking place. Mr O'Mara was due to fly back to Washington
today.
Officials in Brussels believe the two main items discussed were the Blair
House agreement the two sides reached 12 months ago, to cut subsidised food
exports, and market access for agricultural produce.
Blair House is one of the foundations on which success in the Uruguay Round
depends. While both sides say they do not want to re-open the hard-won deal,
the EU, under French threats to veto an overall trade deal, is seeking
'clarification' or additional concessions.
Washington, which believes Brussels got the better of the Blair House
compromise, wants additional guarantees on entry to European food markets.
Senior officials here believe the most likely 'clarification' Washington
would be prepared to concede would be to ease the 'front-loading' of the 21
per cent cuts in subsidised export volume.
A joint memorandum worked out by both sides after the Blair House deal was
struck envisages that these cuts would take place evenly over the six years
of the agreement, with some flexibility to offload cuts from one year if
they were 'paid back' the following year.
This flexibility might be increased to allow a greater shift towards the end
of the six years. By then, if the EU's reform of its Common Agricultural
Policy is working, the cuts might not have to be made at all. The CAP reform
is intended to rein in overproduction and reduce grain prices to world
market level, whereby they could be exported without subsidy and free from
Gatt constraints.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Clinton wants bigger role for Asia-Pacific grouping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday called for the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation grouping to evolve into a much closer-knit organisation that
could in years to come play the same role in uniting the Pacific region that
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation played after the second world war in
bringing Europe together.
'We can't imagine now how we could have weathered the cold war without Nato.
In the same way, future generations may look back and say they can't imagine
how the Asia-Pacific region could have thrived in such a spirit of harmony
without Apec,' Mr Clinton told business and community leaders in Seattle,
where he will meet leaders from the Pacific rim countries today.
While Asian members of the 17 country Apec forum have been reluctant to move
towards a more formal relationship, Mr Clinton sketched out areas where the
organisation, until now an informal consultative grouping, could take a more
active role.
These included dispute resolution, the establishment of telecommunications
standards, the promotion of an open skies agreement to liberalise air
traffic, and common work on environmental problems.
Mr Clinton said he would propose the creation of an Asia-Pacific business
round table and an education foundation, and would call for Apec finance
ministers, who have not previously been involved in the organisation, to
meet soon.
Asian members have poured cold water both on the US ideas for expanding Apec
and on the suggestions of a group of 'Eminent Persons' to aim for the
creation of an Asia-Pacific Economic Community.
'China's understanding is that Apec is a forum for economic co-operation in
the Asia-Pacific region. At present there is no idea for turning this
organisation into an Asia-Pacific Economic Community,' Mr Qian Qichen,
China's foreign minister, said yesterday.
Ms Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister for international trade and industry,
also criticised efforts to institutionalise Apec.
'We have no objection to the finance ministers meeting, but it shouldn't be
a yearly affair, otherwise we'll get into the same rut of any organisation
which gets over-institutionalised,' she said.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Hosokawa to cut income tax to stimulate economy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government yesterday confirmed that it plans to cut income tax
early next year in an attempt to stimulate stubbornly poor domestic demand.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said he would implement tax reform
in line with yesterday's long-expected proposals from a government tax
panel, for a cut in income tax, to be funded by an increase in consumption
tax.
Japanese business groups and the US government agree that a cut in income
tax is vital to help pull Japan out of recession.
The changes are part of a wider overhaul of the tax system, designed to
spread the tax burden more evenly and avoid a drop in government tax revenue
as the population ages.
The panel left the precise size and timing to the government, but economists
assume the income tax cut will be worth Y5,000bn (Pounds 31.5bn). That
should lift next year's growth by 0.6 per cent, Asahi Bank forecast
yesterday.
The main recommendations are:
The top rate of income and residential taxes combined should be cut to 50
per cent from 65 per cent (of which 50 per cent is income tax and 15 per
cent residential). Income tax on low incomes should also be reduced.
Tax reform should not worsen Japan's tight fiscal position.
Consumption tax should be raised from its current rate of 3 per cent. Food
and other necessities should not be exempt.
Inheritance taxes should be reviewed to ease burden on transfers of property
and companies.
Corporate taxation should be reduced.

FT  20 NOV 93 / US trade deficit widens

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE faster pace of US economic growth is leading to a wider trade deficit,
figures yesterday indicated.
The Commerce Department reported an increase in the trade deficit to Dollars
10.9bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in September against Dollars 10bn in August. The
shortfall was higher than analysts expected but fell well short of the
Dollars 12.1bn deficit registered in June, the largest deficit to be seen in
recent months.
The higher deficit reflected a 3.5 per cent monthly rise in imports to
Dollars 49.8bn, which more than offset a 2.1 per cent increase in exports to
Dollars 38.9bn. For the first three quarters, imports were up 9.5 from the
same period last year against a rise in exports of 3.1 per cent.
In its latest forecast for the US economy, out this week, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development projected a current account
deficit of Dollars 107bn this year, rising to Dollars 135bn, or 2 per cent
of gross domestic product, next year. The external deficit was Dollars 66bn
last year.
The rise in the US trade deficit mainly reflects faster economic growth in
the US than in most overseas markets, especially Japan and Europe. Many
forecasters predict US growth at 4 per cent a year or more this quarter.
There is little sign of any erosion of American export competitiveness.
In the first three quarters, US exports to Asian newly-industrialising
economies rose 10 per cent relative to the same period last year. US exports
to the European Community were down but that mainly reflected the weakness
of European demand.

<TEXT>
TOYOTA is to sell some General Motors cars in Japan under its own name,
giving the US carmaker the greatest access of any foreign manufacturer to
the Japanese car market.
Though the deal is expected to result in the sale of only 20,000 vehicles a
year from 1996 onwards, it still gives a boost to US car makers' attempts to
break into the Japanese market.
The big three US companies sold only 14,093 US-produced vehicles between
them in Japan last year.
Under the deal, concluded yesterday, Toyota will buy GM's Cavalier cars and
ship them to Japan on carriers which otherwise would return empty after
bringing Japanese cars to the US. The cars will be sold as Toyotas through
the company's 5,000-strong dealership, the biggest vehicle distribution
network in Japan.
Mr John Smith, GM's chief executive, said the deal showed 'the US has closed
the competitive gap with Japan and is now in a position to build these
global vehicles that can compete any place in the world'.

The panel will produce more a more detailed final report by the end of next

Yesterday's proposals could increase divisions in the seven-party coalition
just as it is basking in the triumph of having pushed political reform plans
through the lower house of parliament.
The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, opposes a rise in
consumption tax on the grounds that this will hit the less well-off.
Consumer groups made the same criticism.
However, the Japan Renewal party, the second largest coalition member,
follows the powerful finance ministry's line that income tax cuts must be
funded by consumption tax rises, rather than by government bonds.
Japan's social security budget will come under heavy demands from its ageing
population over the next decade. By 2007, one in five Japanese will be aged
65 or more, making it one of the most aged populations in the industrialised
world, up from 13 per cent now.

</DATELINE>

THE SCOPE of the Uruguay round package of global trade reforms will hinge
critically on significant deadlock-breaking initiatives from top US and
European Union trade officials when they meet in Washington next week,
according to trade negotiators in Geneva yesterday.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade which oversees the Uruguay Round, told a meeting of all trade
negotiators that it was 'particularly urgent that the major trading powers
bring to the table a decisive contribution that will enable us to achieve
the balanced package necessary to conclude the round.'
He warned of the danger that participants in the negotiations will withdraw
conditional market opening offers 'unless there is a determined and vigorous
effort next week to move the market access package forward decisively'.
The comments add weight to an increasing awareness that the Kantor-Brittan
meeting in Washington on Monday and Tuesday next week will play a critical
part in shaping the final Uruguay Round package.
Negotiators remained confident yesterday that agreement will be reached by
the December 15 deadline, but emphasised that the outcome of the Washington
talks would determine whether it would be a 'big agreement', or more modest
in its scope.
Both the US and the EU have assembled large technical teams to back their
top trade negotiators in the event of any breakthrough in Washington. These
will cover farm trade, trade in goods, financial services, subsidies and
dumping rules.
Trade negotiators who only a day earlier were praising US President Bill
Clinton for his success in winning Congressional support for the North
American Free Trade Agreement were yesterday fiercely critical of issues
being raised by the US which are jeopardising progress towards an agreement.
The US was criticised in particular for putting conditions on its offer
dealing with trade in financial services, and for wanting to insulate its
tax authorities from multilateral discipline if they were ever to
discriminate against foreign companies. Mr Sutherland complained that these
moves 'may prove utterly counterproductive'.
Several countries have threatened to withdraw their offers in financial
services if the US does not change its position. These include India,
Malaysia and Hong Kong.
'Unless there is an urgent review of these positions, not only will the
effort we have made to improve existing offers falter, but the important
progress that we have already made may begin to unravel,' said Mr
Sutherland.
He called on the US to tackle 'domestic interests who may take unrealistic
positions on what it is possible to achieve in this first multilateral
negotiation.'
Mr Les Samuels, the US Treasury assistant secretary responsible for tax
policy, is due to arrive in Geneva on Monday to explain the present US
position, and to listen to reactions.
Judging from the views expressed by trade negotiators yesterday, Mr Samuels
must expect some uncomfortable discussions.
The US has also been attacked for trying to weaken proposed anti-dumping
rules.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Hyundai, Daewoo at odds over leadership of Korea TGV project
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DISAGREEMENTS have erupted between GEC Alsthom's main Korean partners,
Hyundai and Daewoo, over which should lead the domestic consortium to make
the Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) for the country's new high-speed rail
project.
The dispute comes as GEC Alsthom is trying to conclude negotiations with the
Korean government by the end of the year on a Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn)
contract for the supply of TGV trains and technology.
Hyundai Precision and Industry triggered the row this week when it said it
had been selected by GEC Alsthom to lead the Korean consortium building half
of the 46 TGV trains, which will run between Seoul and Pusan by 2001.
Daewoo Heavy Industries, another participant in the consortium, protested
against the decision, claiming that GEC Alsthom had promised it would be the
main subcontractor for the transfer of TGV technology.
'Daewoo and GEC Alsthom have a contract on the transfer of high-speed rail
technology, and GEC Alsthom named Daewoo the leading manufacturer in its
bidding offer,' said Mr Suk Jin-chul, president of Daewoo Heavy Industries.
'I cannot understand how GEC Alsthom can ignore such an agreement and select
Hyundai. We will take all necessary legal actions if Hyundai is named its
final choice.'
Daewoo had also expected to be chosen as consortium leader because it had
co-operated with GEC over the past decade in building rail carriages for
Seoul's underground system.
Daewoo suggested that GEC Alsthom selected Hyundai because Hyundai might be
more willing than Daewoo to establish a joint venture with GEC Alsthom to
produce conventional rail carriages for Korea's expanding rail and
underground networks.
Mr Ambroise Cariou, director of GEC Alsthom's Seoul office, yesterday
dismissed Daewoo's claim of exclusive rights to TGV technology as
'nonsense'.
He said all three main subcontractors, which include Hanjin Heavy
Industries, would have equal access to TGV technology. Hyundai Precision,
which makes transport equipment, was selected as the consortium leader on
the basis of its industrial and technical capability.
Hyundai is expected to receive 40 per cent of the Korean half of the TGV
contract, with Daewoo getting another 40 per cent and Hanjin 20 per cent.
The dispute is the second to hit the Korean TGV project since GEC Alsthom
won priority negotiating rights in August for the train contract. Siemens,
which competed against GEC Alsthom for the contract, lodged a protest at the
decision, claiming the Korean government's selection process was unfair and
biased.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S revised schedule of tariff reductions submitted yesterday to Gatt
includes no offer on the most sensitive categories - white spirits, leather,
forest and agricultural products including rice - where the country is
facing demands for improved foreign access.
The move by Japan, which has publicly expressed a strong desire to help push
the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion by the December 15
deadline, shows the difficulties negotiators still face.
Meanwhile an official at the trade ministry said there was nothing more to
offer at this point on leather and leather shoes, which have been a point of
contention with the EC.
For mining and manufactured products, however, Japan indicated it was
willing to be more compromising with an offer of an average 60 per cent cut
in tariffs on 6,600 products, which will bring average tariffs on these
products to 1.5 per cent.
On rice Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, indicated yesterday that
there might be scope for Japan to accept minimum levels of imports. Although
he reiterated the official line that the government opposed lifting the ban
on rice imports and denied media reports that US and Japan had agreed on a
compromise deal over rice, he said he could not tell what would happen after
the negotiations.
Japan is seeking to avoid being blamed for delaying the Uruguay Round.
Officials are currently under negotiations with the US over a compromise
agreement to partially open its rice market in exchange for rice to be
exempt from tariffication.
Japanese officials want a six-year moratorium on tariffication of rice
imports, during which Japan would import 4 to 8 per cent of its domestic
consumption, a slightly higher range than the 3 to 5 per cent minimum access
level under Gatt's Dunkel text.
The Japanese government aims to appease both the international community and
the Japanese public with its proposal. However, whether it will be accepted
by the US and other countries remains to be seen, since it fails to
guarantee that Japan will open its rice market through tariffication after
the six year grace period.

STRIKES, protests and fuel shortages continued in southern Nigerian cities
yesterday, despite a ban on all demonstrations and an assurance by the
government that it will not lift the 700 per cent fuel price rise which
sparked off the strikes.
General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's new military head of state, issued a warning
on Thursday that political opponents would be suppressed and and 'political
associations' would be proscribed.
The new government is being assembled while Mr Ernest Shonekan's civilian
interim government ministers and the elected governors of all 30 states,
dismissed by Gen Abacha on Thursday, are clearing their their desks. An
announcement of the new cabinet is expected by Monday.
Britain warned Gen Abacha it was discussing tougher sanctions with its
international partners after what it called his deplorable decision to ban
political parties.
The foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, told parliament that Britain's
patience towards its former colony was running out. 'We deplore the decision
of the Nigerian military to take back power and, as announced last night, to
dissolve all democratically elected institutions,' he said.
Britain, other EC countries and the US imposed sanctions on Nigeria,
Africa's most populous nation, after the previous military government
annulled the results of a presidential election in June.
Sources close to the military said the seizure of power which took most
Nigerians by surprise on Wednesday, was intended to pre-empt action by less
senior officers in the armed forces who grew restive over the interim
government's loss of control and the stalled transition to democracy.
The measures begun by Mr Shonekan to stop fuel racketeering have already
taken effect in the north's main city, Kano, where fuel is on sale at the
official price for the first time in months.
A official in charge of the Oil Ministry until a minister is appointed told
the big oil marketers there was no question of rolling back the fuel price,
increased from N0.70 to N5 (15p) a litre last week, and they would be
assisted in delivering to filling stations.
Lagos, the commercial capital, is still badly affected by the general
strike. The port is closed, big banks and factories are shut, and fuel and
public transport are scarce.
Violent clashes were reported in parts of the Yoruba-speaking south-west,
the homeland of Mr Moshood Abiola, who was the unofficial winner of the
presidential poll annulled in June.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jose Luis Corcuera, Spain's long-standing interior minister, yesterday
tendered his resignation, prompting the first cabinet crisis for Mr Felipe
Gonzalez since he was returned to power at the head of a minority government
in general elections last June.
Mr Corcuera's aides said he had resigned 'irrevocably' after Spain's Supreme
Court, the 12-member Tribunal Constitucional, ruled against powers in new
public security legislation drawn up by the Interior Ministry for police to
search the homes of suspected drug dealers without a court order.
The resignation is politically ill-timed for Mr Gonzalez, who had hoped to
delay a cabinet reshuffle until early next year, when he planned to bring in
members of minority nationalist parties from the Basque Country and
Catalonia to the government.
Mr Corcuera had been among those earmarked to leave the government, as he is
likely to run for a senior post in the ruling Socialist party at its
national congress in March.
Neither the Basques nor the Catalans have however shown any inclination so
far to join the government and Mr Gonzalez will next week have to find an
unexpected substitute for Mr Corcuera, which will make his cabinet look
rather like a caretaker administration.
Complicating the prime minister's choice were reports yesterday that senior
officials in the Interior Ministry, who might have been expected to replace
Mr Corcuera, had indicated that they wished to resign along with him.
Mr Corcuera, who joined the cabinet in 1988, had served notice during June's

An electrician by training and a former trade union official, he is the only
member of Mr Gonzalez's Socialist government who is not a university
graduate, and his tough and bluff stand against both terrorism and drug
dealers had earned him widespread respect and affection.

THE battle by foreign consumer products companies for the loyalty of Russian
consumers was stepped up yesterday as Procter &amp; Gamble, the US giant,
announced plans to take a controlling stake in a manufacturing plant near
Moscow.
The deal, worth more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m), marks an expansion of
the US group's latest foray into eastern Europe, and signals its intention
of selling a broader range of products to Russian consumers.
At present P&amp;G makes two detergents in Russia: Ariel, the world's
biggest-selling brand and Tix, a local brand. Once it takes control of the
plant in Novomosovsk, 130 miles from Moscow, the company says it will expand
its range of detergents and cleaning products made in the country.
'We see great promise in this (Russian) market,' said P&amp;G. The company has
already built or is building plants in Hungary, Poland and the Czech
republic.
'Right now it's in the laundry business, but it could be other products in
future.'
Leyla Boulton adds from Moscow: The acquisition is the latest of a series of
purchases by foreign buyers belatedly taking part in the mass Russian
privatisation programme.
The sell-off of large numbers of Russian factories is designed to improve
their performance and attract badly-needed foreign investment.

FT  20 NOV 93 / US Senate passes Dollars 22bn anti-crime bill
</HEADLINE>

THE US Senate yesterday overwhelmingly passed a Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.7bn)
anti-crime bill, but doubts remained whether both houses of congress could
agree on unified legislation before they adjourn next week.
Following its 95-4 vote, the Senate immediately moved on to debating the
Brady bill, which would impose a five-day waiting period on buyers of
handguns. This measure, named after Mr James Brady, the White House press
secretary severely wounded in 1981 in the attempt on President Ronald
Reagan's life, has already secured the approval of the House.
The most significant features of the omnibus crime bill include funding for
an additional 100,000 police officers, a ban on the sale of 19 types of
semi-automatic assault weapons, among them the AK-47 and the Uzi, and
tougher sentences for persistent offenders and those found guilty of violent
crime in which guns are used.
Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, said in a television interview that
both the Brady bill and the ban on certain types of assault weapons were
'critically important steps in developing a programme where we make sure
that weapons are rationally and properly used in America'.
Unlike the Senate, the House has taken a piecemeal approach to crime
legislation, passing individual bills rather than lumping them together.
Even if reconciliation cannot be achieved in a conference committee of both
chambers over the next few days, legislation can be carried over into the
next session, starting in January.
In a magazine interview this week, President Bill Clinton said he might
advance additional gun control measures next year, and Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York has already proposed punitive tax increases on
the sale of ammunition. The president did not exclude asking for a total ban
on handgun sales, though this would probably come much later.
The National Rifle Association, the powerful lobby against gun control, had
some success in watering down the Senate bill and will be particularly
pleased if the Brady bill falls by the wayside, as it has for seven years.

FT  20 NOV 93 / American Airlines sues strikers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines said yesterday it had filed a law suit in Texas charging
the trade union representing striking flight attendants with falsely
implying that the carrier's operations were unsafe.
The airline, the second-largest US carrier after United, took the action on
Thursday after 21,000 members of the Association of Flight Attendants began
an 11-day walkout over proposed changes in staffing, work rules and fringe
benefits. The strike is intended to disrupt American's flights during the
busy Thanksgiving day holiday period.
American, a division of AMR, has tried to continue operating with other
employees trained to replace the strikers temporarily. It was also
recruiting new flight attendants at its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas,
and 30 other cities.
The suit charges that the union and its public relations firm, Abernathy &amp;
Mitchell of Washington DC, have asked travel agents to steer customers away
from American flights on the grounds that its staffing levels and training
programme were unsafe.
Mr Ray Abernathy of Abernathy &amp; Mitchell, denied that the firm or the union
had ever 'alleged or implied American Airlines' operations or aircraft were
unsafe'.
The airline is seeking unspecifed damages for business losses and Dollars
10m (Pounds 6.7m) in punitive damages.
On the first day, the strike appeared to be far more successful than the
airline had expected. The union said about 90 per cent of its members at
American were honouring picket lines and the airline's system was 'virtually
shut'.
The airline had to cancel many flights and restrict others to freight and
mail. Many passengers were found seats at competing airlines.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Ciampi's fate rides on local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE leaders of Italy's main political parties held rallies across the
country yesterday urging a heavy turn-out in today's municipal elections.
The poll, covering almost 11m voters, a quarter of the electorate, will be
an important test of opinion. The outcome is liable to determine the life of
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's government.
Overall, 450 city and town councils are up for renewal. The main interest
centres on the big cities.
In the north Mr Umberto Bossi's populist League will be seeking to extend
its domination. In the last partial municipal elections in June, the League
succeeded in its main objective in taking Milan.
Elsewhere the long-governing Christian Democrats will be desperately trying
to maintain the allegiance of the electorate, especially in the south.
The opinion polls suggest they will suffer a sharp loss of support and, for
the first time since 1946, will hold no large city.
They are expected to lose out to the neo-fascist MSI on the right, and on
the left to coalitions sponsored by the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left.
Under new rules for the direct election of mayors, candidates must either
obtain an absolute majority or face a run-off between the top two candidates
within two weeks.
The backers of the winning mayoral candidate are then allocated 60 per cent
of council seats to ensure a stable governing coalition.
Lazio soccer club president Sergio Cragnotti was taken to a Milan prison
yesterday for questioning after giving himself up to police, Reuter reports.
Suspected of false accounting, Mr Cragnotti was managing director of
Enimont, an alliance between state energy group Eni and the Ferruzzi
agro-industrial group's Montedison, which collapsed after less than two
years' activity in 1990.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Brussels fans the urge to converge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EU MEMBER states have laid strong foundations for economic and monetary
union, but further efforts will be needed to maintain the momentum of
convergence, according to the European Commission.
It calls for 'decisive action' to reduce budgetary imbalances, and urges
states to reject 'go-it-alone' economic, monetary or commercial policies
which might undermine the single market.
The Commission will present its report on convergence and the implementation
of the single market to EU finance ministers on Monday. The Maastricht
treaty, which came into force on November 1, requires Brussels to assess the
progress made in the first stage of Emu, before next January 1, when stage
two will begin.
The report contains a staunch defence of the single market programme, which
has been criticised for not delivering all the promised benefits. It claims
that legislative steps already taken 'will be sufficient to trigger the bulk
of the competitive and resource allocation gains which will flow from
internal market completion'.
However, the Commission concedes that those improvements have been obscured
by the effects of recession, which has led to increased unemployment and
stalled the process by which poorer countries are supposed to catch up with
the wealthier.
The report highlights continued difficulties in meeting Maastricht criteria
on public finances. It points out that only Ireland and Luxembourg are on
course to meet the 3 per cent target for budget deficit as a proportion of
gross domestic product by 1996. The EU average is 6.4 per cent, higher than
at the start of the decade.
The Commission also warns that if exchange rates are not managed carefully,
'sudden changes in relative competitiveness. . . . could generate demands
for safeguard restrictions on cross-border trade', undermining the single
market.

A DROP in car and consumer goods sales led to a 0.3 per cent decline in
French industrial output in September from the level of the previous two
months, according to Insee, the official statistics agency. However, Insee
revised upward its initial estimate of zero growth in gross domestic product
in the second quarter to an increase of 0.3 per cent.
The economy ministry, commenting on the output figure, said the fact that
the overall level in July-September was 0.45 per cent higher than in the
previous quarter convinced it that France was on the road to recovery.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Balladur steps into merger row: PM tries to soothe Swedish
fears on Renault-Volvo link-up

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, has written to Mr Carl Bildt,
his Swedish counterpart, in an attempt to counter Swedish opposition to the
proposed merger between Renault and Volvo's car and truck operations.
It is the most significant move so far by the French government in its
attempt to win over Swedish shareholders who threaten to vote down the plan
to create Europe's second largest automotive group.
The Swedish government also confirmed for the first time that it had
approached the French government. At Volvo's request it had pressed demands
that Paris provide assurances on the timetable for the privatisation of
Renault and a commitment not to use a state golden share to force down
Volvo's proposed 35 per cent stake in the merged Renault-Volvo company.
Details of Mr Balladur's letter were not revealed. But it appeared not to
have fully satisfied the Swedish side. Senior officials said the dialogue
with Paris would continue.
Mr Bildt, who had previously avoided direct involvement in the issue, is
understood to have intervened two weeks ago following an appeal from Volvo.
The prime minister told Swedish radio yesterday there was 'a strong need for
clarification' of the privatisation and golden share issue, the main focus
of shareholder concern. He said that without it there was a 'very limited'
chance the deal would be approved.
The French government has said it plans to privatise the merged group as
quickly as possible, with a target date of the second half of next year. It
has also promised that the golden share to be retained after privatisation
will not be used against Volvo and is designed to protect the merged group
from a hostile takeover.
But verbal statements have failed to satisfy Volvo shareholders who forced
the Swedish group to postpone a vote on the deal until December 7.
Continued shareholder resistance and the approach of the deadline have
pressed the French government into a concerted effort to reassure Swedish
investors. Mr Balladur's letter follows a meeting earlier this week between
Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, and Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's
chief executive. Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chief executive, was also
in Sweden yesterday to lobby Volvo shareholders.
The merger, and the planned privatisation of the new automotive group, is
one of the most important elements of French industrial policy and the
government's plan to sell 21 publicly-owned companies.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Union ministers yesterday agreed new measures to protect potential
buyers of timeshare properties from unscrupulous sellers.
Since timeshare ownership became popular, buyers have often complained about
high-pressure selling techniques and their inability to bring sales people
based in other countries to justice.
The directive approved yesterday provides for a minimum 10-day 'cooling-off'
period to allow timeshare purchasers to change their minds.
Britain, which had pushed hard for European-wide legislation, welcomed
agreement on the directive. Many British people have bought a share in
holiday homes, particularly in Spain. Existing UK legislation includes a
14-day cooling-off period, but applies only to contracts signed in Britain
or under UK law.
The new EU legislation also calls for contracts to be written in two
languages to avoid confusion, and prevents sellers asking for deposits
during the cooling-off period.
The directive did not meet with the approval of all consumer affairs
ministers. Italy and Portugal voted against it on the grounds that there
should be a deposit and the Dutch abstained after calling for a longer
cooling-off period.
However, Lord Strathclyde, UK consumer affairs minister, who was not present
for the agreement, said it was 'an effective package of consumer protection
law' which would avoid 'unnecessary and bureaucratic burdens on the
industry'.
The measures were attacked, however, by the Timeshare Council, which
represents legitimate timeshare companies in the UK. Mr Norman Burden, the
council's chairman, said that the prohibition on deposits was unacceptable
to the industry.
He said: 'It goes against centuries of good commercial practice and
undermines the mutual commitment which is the basis of every satisfactory
contract. We shall continue to fight hard for the right to reasonable
deposits.'
He added: 'This new move brings a lot of uncertainty to an industry that
sustains around 20,000 full-time jobs in Europe.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / EU aims to slam its open doors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Union's much-vaunted policy of greater openness in its
decision-making, proclaimed by the last four heads of government meetings,
is in danger of taking a big step backwards before the next summit in
Brussels on December 10.
The Union's stated policy is to give the public right of access to all EU
information, except where national security, monetary stability, commercial
confidentiality, privacy, or relations with non-member countries could be
endangered.
The policy was strengthened in the wake of Danish voters' initial rejection
of the Maastricht treaty in June 1992.
However, ambassadors of the Twelve, in their latest attempt to draw up a
code of conduct, have now inserted additional grounds for exemption,
entitling all EU institutions to 'refuse access in order to protect the
interests of the institution and safeguard the secrecy of their
deliberations'.
This discretionary catch-all is contained in a confidential compromise
proposal - or so-called 'non-paper' - from the current Belgian presidency of
the EU.
It is intended to close the gap between member states like the Netherlands
and Denmark, which want freedom of information norms similar to their own or
US or Scandinavian rules, and more secretive countries like Britain,
Portugal and Belgium itself.
'That is a step back, closing off things that are now relatively open,' said
a diplomat from the Union's dwindling open government camp.
He predicted that the code of conduct would lead to a small number of
exemplary sackings of officials, to tighten up on the frequent leaks which
are how a good portion of EU policy-making comes into the public domain.
Foreign ministers of the Twelve are expected to decide on the issue early
next month, before the Brussels summit.
Although television cameras have this year been allowed in to record some
set-piece EU ministerial proceedings, the openness question, identified
repeatedly by the Twelve as one of the prime causes of public disenchantment
with Europe, will almost certainly be settled behind closed doors.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Bankers united on pace of union: Tietmeyer and George
recommend a cautious approach to Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Union governments must put their monetary houses in order before
implementing measures to speed the pace of union, central bankers said
yesterday.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, and Mr Eddie George, governor of
the Bank of England, displaying a rare degree of unity, both argued against
premature moves towards European economic and monetary union.
'As the credibility of the system has been greatly impaired by developments
in the past few years, every member state must now initially pursue a policy
to restore its own credibility,' Mr Tietmeyer told a Frankfurt conference.
'In future, the rules of the system can at best foster this credibility, but
not replace it.'
Lending his support to the view that there should be no quick and general
return to narrow bands in the exchange rate mechanism, Mr Tietmeyer went on
to argue that 'we should be careful. . . . to avoid too ambitious and too
early implementation of new instruments such as common targets for monetary
aggregates.
'Given the present environment and the essential need for building up the
credibility of the system again, such a move would be premature and in the
end counter-productive. Regaining credibility by improving (economic)
convergence is a serious and long-term job and requires co-ordinated action
of all member states on their own responsibility,' he said.
Mr George warned of the danger that 'political aspiration will run ahead of
economic reality', which in his opinion would set back rather than advance
the cause of European union. He urged that it would be better to concentrate
on the 'here and now' - in other words, the immediate task of promoting
convergence between the economies of individual European countries.
Especially important was internal price stability, without which lasting
exchange rate stability would be no more than an illusion.
He acknowledged, as did Mr Tietmeyer, that the flexibility inherent in the
move towards wider bands for currency fluctuation in the ERM posed risks for
the convergence process. He argued that monetary policy objectives within
the EU, having once been too tightly drawn, were now underspecified, and
that there was a case for buttressing the ERM in its current, looser form
'with clearer Community-wide understandings on the domestic policy
objectives to be pursued within the looser exchange rate framework'.
The agreement between the two men contrasts with the tensions which arose
over the conduct of monetary policy in September of last year, when the UK
perspective was that German monetary rigour directly contributed to market
pressure on sterling and its eventual withdrawal from the ERM. Mr Tietmeyer
acknowledged that the functioning of the EMS had been affected by German
monetary policy in the early 1990s, itself a reaction to the inflationary
problems caused by reunification. But he said that the EMS would have
suffered a shock even in the absence of German reunification as 'the less
dynamic world economic environment would have exposed the lack of
convergence between participating countries'.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Italy seeks way out of dispute over steel cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government is expected to set up a special commission in the
next few days to try to resolve its acrimonious dispute with the European
Commission over reducing overcapacity in the European steel industry.
A meeting of EU industry ministers broke up in disarray on Thursday after
Italy rejected demands by Brussels for a 2m cut in annual production
capacity at Ilva, the Italian state steel group.
The Rome government has been strongly resisting the scale of the Ilva cuts,
arguing that they would compromise the viability of the Taranto steel works
in southern Italy, the largest in Europe, and create a serious social
problem with rising unemployment.
Italy is now expected to draw up a new plan covering both the public and
private sector and Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, is expected to
establish a commission with a brief to find a solution acceptable to the EU.
Italy, it seems, is willing to play for high stakes. But it does not wish to
be seen pitted against all its partners, nor be accused of sabotaging
integration on the issue of steel which was central to the early stages of
forming an common market.
In the view of the unions, who are seeking an early meeting with the
government, the best solution would be to spread the production cuts into
the private sector. They argue that Taranto is a very modern plant with
another 30 years of productive life. Better to eliminate capacity among the
older private plants, in particular Falck's operation at Sesto San Giovanni
on the outskirts of Milan.
Taranto has an unemployment rate exceeding 25 per cent, and rationalisation
of Ilva puts a quarter of the 13,000 steel jobs there at risk. Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, last week took the unprecedented
step of writing a personal letter to Mr Jacques Delors, Commission
president, warning of 'explosive social consequences' if Taranto were
compromised.
The government has its hands full trying to ensure the 1994 budget passes
smoothly through parliament and is anxious to avoid social unrest as the
country moves towards an early general election.
The loss-making Ilva group, controlled by Iri, the state holding, is being
split in two covering flat products (essentially Taranto) and special
steels.
The main privatisation issue is who will take over Taranto. Both France's
Usinor and Nippon Steel are possibilities.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Divisions over Ulster exposed by Dublin leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP between the British and Irish governments over the shape of a
constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland was underlined yesterday by a
document setting out Dublin's terms.
A draft position paper leaked to an Irish newspaper confirmed Dublin's
intention to drop its territorial claim over Northern Ireland and
acknowledged there could be no change in the province's status without the
consent of a majority of the population.
But in return it sought British acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the
goal of Irish unity 'by agreement' and consent to a marked extension of
Dublin's role in the province.
This would be exercised through a strengthened Anglo-Irish
inter-governmental conference and new north-south institutions with
executive powers.
The leak  - coming just a day after Mr John Major, the prime minister,
reinforced his personal commitment to a settlement  - embarrassed the Irish
government and annoyed Downing Street.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, quickly disassociated himself
from the paper, whose authenticity was confirmed by the Irish foreign
ministry.
Mr Reynolds said no such document had been presented to the Dublin
government. The paper had 'no connection whatso-ever' with the peace
initiative.
Neither Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, nor Downing
Street would comment yesterday on the substance of the document. But the
interventionist tone of some proposals would almost certainly be
unacceptable to London.
There also seems little prospect of Downing Street agreeing to an
inter-governmental body with powers as wide-ranging as Dublin envisages or
to entrust the proposed north-south institutions with developing an
integrated approach to the European Union.
Unionists were yesterday already balking at the paper's emphasis on
'enhancing' the co-operative structures of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.
Mr Ken Maginnis, security spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party, said it
was 'presumptuous' for Dublin to take such a 'divisive' approach to a
delicate problem.
The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party,
said: 'We are moving to Mark Two of the Anglo-Irish agreement.' The two
governments did not want to 'consult the people' at all. 'Until we deal with
Articles 2 and 3 (of the Irish constitution which lay claim to Northern
Ireland) there can be no progress.'
Sir Patrick said the paper was 'not a document we have received' and it
would be futile for him to speculate on it.
The Northern Ireland secretary met briefly with Mr Reynolds and Mr John
Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, at a conference in
Londonderry. Mr Hume said he would shortly meet Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn
Fein president, to brief him on his recent talks with Mr Major.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Seaq breakdown disrupts trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, PETER JOHN and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange's ageing Seaq automated price display system broke
down for four hours yesterday, forcing market makers and investors to resort
to telephones to find the best price to buy or sell shares.
The breakdown is the second in two months, with a shorter disruption of
about 90 minutes in late September. Seaq screens show at a glance the prices
market makers are offering for the purchase and sale of stock, allowing
instant comparisons for those seeking the best deal.
The stock exchange declined to give any explanation for the failure, saying
only that it was investigating the matter.
The exchange is developing a successor to Seaq which it plans to build
itself. After internal debate, the exchange's board rejected a proposal to
allow Nasdaq, the US screen-based trading system, to build a successor.
The absence of firm prices yesterday caused leading institutional investors
to cease trading, with buyers deciding that they could not be sure they were
getting the best price for stock.
'Who knows what deals were done, and at what price, while the system was
down?' commented one trader.
At Panmure Gordon, a leading institutional broking house, Mr Nigel Little, a
senior trader, said: 'The Seaq problems caused major complications. It was
all the more serious because there was some sizeable business around.
Overseas clients felt themselves completely cut off from the market.'
Meanwhile, the system's failure also threw the derivatives market into
disarray because the London International Financial Futures Exchange was
unable to calculate the value of the FT-SE, making it impossible to close
the expiring November FT-SE 100 options contract. The closing price should
have been based on the FT-SE between 10.10am and 10.30am, but had to be
delayed for hours, leaving dealers with open positions.
'It was an absolute horror for the market,' said one futures dealer. 'This
is the first time I have ever seen anything like this happen in the equity
index market.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / Apec offers tariff cuts in move to beat Gatt deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASIAN and North American countries yesterday agreed to offer a series of
tariff cuts in an effort to force the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations to
a successful conclusion before the December 15 deadline.
In a declaration issued at the end of a two-day meeting in Seattle of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation group, trade and foreign ministers called
for 'urgent action' to complete the round and issued a challenge to other
participants to improve their market access offers at trade talks under way
in Geneva.
In an effort to 'jump-start' the Geneva talks, 12 of the 17 Apec members
agreed to reduce tariffs to zero in sectors in which they have significant
trade, including electronics, wood and paper, non-ferrous metals, scientific
equipment, toys and oilseeds.
The meeting, described by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, as
'highly productive', came on the eve of an unprecedented informal summit of
Pacific leaders today to be hosted by President Bill Clinton at Blake
Island, near Seattle.
Mr Clinton was yesterday holding bilateral meetings with the Chinese
president, Mr Jiang Zemin, and with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime
minister.
He promised that the US would press hard for completion of the Uruguay Round
but would not accept a 'flawed' agreement. A successful General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, he told Seattle business leaders, would create 1.4m US
jobs in the next 10 years and expand the world economy by Dollars 5,000bn.
Mr Christopher said the Blair House agreement between the US and the
European Union on agricultural subsidies would not be reopened for further
discussion.
Apec ministers said the Blair House accord had already weakened the draft
final Gatt agreement. 'Any further efforts to weaken that outcome would
jeop-ardise the ability to secure an overall acceptable result on
agriculture,' the declaration said.
Apec members, who account for 40 per cent of world trade, had been expected
to issue a strong call for completion of the Uruguay Round talks.
However, their willingness to offer additional moves went further than
expected and provided a powerful impetus to the Geneva talks. The initiative
is likely to put pressure on France, which has the most problems with the US
on farm trade issues.
As well as the tariff cut offers, the ministers said they were prepared to
eliminate, reduce or harmonise tariffs in sectors previously agreed by the
so-called 'Quad'  - Japan, Canada, the US and EU  - before the July Tokyo
summit. These sectors include pharmaceuticals, construction equipment,
medical equipment, steel and beer, and, with certain exemptions, furniture,
farm equipment and spirits.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Trade data lift growth hopes: Non-EU deficit at lowest level
since 1988
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S trade deficit with countries outside the European Union fell last
month to its lowest level since January 1988, according to figures published
yesterday, wrapping up a week of economic statistics that have been far
better than expected.
News that the trade gap with non-EU countries narrowed sharply to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 293m in October from Pounds 921m in September
reinforced the picture of an economy enjoying steady growth, with few price
pressures and which is slowly increasing its share of export markets.
It came after Thursday's announcement of an unexpectedly sharp fall of
49,000 in the total of unemployed last month and Wednesday's news that
inflation had dropped to 1.4 per cent in October from 1.8 per cent the month
before.
The week's most disappointing figure - the disclosure on Tuesday that the
government is still heading towards a Pounds 50bn budget deficit for 1993-94
after borrowing Pounds 2.7bn in October - will have done nothing to dissuade
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, from raising taxes in his Budget.
But City economists said yesterday that the week's other news - of weak
money supply growth, subdued bank lending and slower retail sales growth in
October - should leave the chancellor free to cut bank base rates to help
counter the impact of any fiscal tightening.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday confirmed that the economy grew by
0.6 per cent in the third quarter, with gross domestic product 1.9 per cent
higher than a year ago. Consumer spending was the main engine of growth,
advancing 0.9 per cent in the quarter and 2.4 per cent compared with last
year.
But improved exports also supported activity. Investment rose slightly, with
provisional estimates pointing to a 5 per cent increase in manufacturing
investment compared with the second quarter and 2 per growth compared with
the same period of last year.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the economic
outlook was especially good compared with expectations at the time of the
March Budget. 'Output growth is firmer, inflation weaker, unemployment lower
and the trade deficit better behaved than people anticipated,' he said.
However, Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers International, warned that
a week of 'astonishingly good figures' did not necessarily mean that the
economy's problems were over.
Some economists were sceptical about the reliability of the trade
statistics. Mr John Marsland, UK economist at brokers UBS, said the sharp 11
per cent rise in export volumes between September and October reflected 'an
unusual bounce' in car exports.
The Treasury also sounded a note of caution about the big drop in the
October non-EU trade deficit and warned against placing too much emphasis on
one month's figures. But it said the GDP figures 'confirm the preliminary
view that recovery is continuing across a broad front'.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Tiphook in talks over Pounds 830m sale of division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the leasing group struggling for survival under Pounds 1.2bn of
debt, stepped back from the brink yesterday with a proposed Pounds 830m deal
to sell its container leasing business.
Tiphook shares, which had fallen from a peak of 564p in October 1991, closed
up 19p at 63p.
The UK-based company said it was in talks with Transamerica, the US
financial services and leasing group, over the sale for cash of the
container division, although no assurance could be given that the deal would
go through.
If it does, Transamerica will jump into second position in the world
container leasing market, after Genstar, the subsidiary of GE Capital
Corporation of the US. Together, the two would control about 68 per cent of
the worldwide industry, according to the US Journal of Commerce.
Transamerica said it was confident the proposed acquisition would not
encounter anti-trust problems. If containers owned by shipping groups were
included, it said, its market share would be considerably less.
Tiphook said the deal would substantially reduce its debt and balance sheet
gearing. Analysts estimated it would cut Tiphook's gearing to less than 200
per cent, which is not considered excessive for a leasing company.
The company said it would give shareholders 'details of the structure and
future trading strategies of the newly shaped Tiphook'. It plans to retain
other activities which it believes will be capable of servicing the
remaining debt.
The container division, shown in Tiphook's 1993 accounts to have gross
assets of Pounds 628.8m, has made the greater part of group profits in
recent years. The rest of Tiphook comprises a trailer rental business, the
market leader in western Europe, and a railway wagon leasing activity.
One analyst said: 'The container business is the heart of the group. Tiphook
could end up with a grotty business and a pile of debt.'
The stock market was surprised by the price of the deal. Since Monday, when
Tiphook said it was in talks to sell its container division, speculation had
centred on a price of Pounds 400m.
One analyst said Transamerica was paying more per container than it would
cost to buy the fleet new. Others noted that as well as an operating fleet,
Transamerica would get a worldwide network of depots and offices.
Tiphook's fleet totals 526,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) while
Transamerica's amounts to 420,000, giving a combined total of 926,000, 15
per cent of world capacity including containers owned by shipping groups.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Anti-dumping issues given priority -
Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA is urging the US and Mexico to set up a high-profile mechanism to
negotiate new anti-dumping and subsidy rules within a specific time frame
under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, is expected to tell President
Bill Clinton when the two men meet in Seattle today that Canada's
implementation of Nafta on January 1 is conditional on the creation of
working groups, or similar bodies, to deal expeditiously with these issues.
Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's trade minister, yesterday indicated however, that
the new Liberal government, which came to office last month, was unlikely to
delay Nafta's implementation.
US anti-dumping and countervail actions have been at the heart of
several acrimonious trade disputes with Canada over the past few years,
including softwood lumber and pork. Most recently, Washington has threatened
to act against alleged subsidies on Canadian durum wheat.
'At the very least, the government wants to ensure that the anti-dumping
issue is front and centre,' a senior government official said yesterday.
Nafta already provides for a working party on trade and competition policy,
and for further examination of subsidies.
Canada's concerns on subsidies would be substantially addressed by a
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations. But the Uruguay Round would do little to reform anti-dumping
rules.
Nafta's approval by the US House of Representatives had little impact on
Canadian financial markets yesterday. Mr Michael Manford, chief economist at
ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, said that Nafta had been overshadowed by concerns
about widening federal and provincial budget deficits.
Nafta is expected to have a far smaller impact on the Canadian economy than
the four-year-old US-Canada free trade agreement. Canada's trade with Mexico
totals about CDollars 3bn a year, a fraction of its trade with the US.
Mr Manford said that Nafta might be mildly damaging to Canadian business in
the short term, as some labour-intensive sectors, such as textiles and shoe
manufacturers, moved production facilities to Mexico. But these losses are
expected to be offset later by rising exports to Mexico.

ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday unveiled pre-tax
profits of SKr569m (Dollars 69m) for the third quarter of 1993, a nine-fold
increase from SKr63m in the same 1992 period.
Surging sales and intensive cost cutting lie behind the upturn, which drove
up profits for the first nine months to SKr1.86bn from SKr122m.
A strong improvement in the company's performance is expected in the final
three months, when the impact of the 25 per cent drop in the value of the
krona will be felt more strongly as hedging programmes expire.
The company expects its 1993 result will be 'somewhat more than double' last
year's SKr1.3bn level.
However, many analysts had been more bullish, looking for profits of around
SKr3.5bn, and they were disappointed by the company's cautious tone. The
group's B shares dipped SKr1 to SKr412.
Nine-month sales jumped 41 per cent to SKr42.4bn from SKr30.2bn, while
orders climbed 30 per cent to SKr49.2bn.
The weaker krona accounted for 10 per cent of the orders increase, and 20
per cent of the sales rise.
The group now has an order backlog of SKr45.6bn, after increasing its order
intake for the last eight quarters.
The biggest sales growth came in Ericsson's radio communications division,
where surging sales of mobile phones lifted sales to SKr16.9bn from
SKr9.3bn. In the third quarter the unit's sales doubled to SKr6.24bn.
Overall sales in the third quarter were SKr15.0bn, compared with SKr9.7bn.
There has been a particularly strong development in China, Ericsson's fifth
most important market after the US, Italy, Sweden and the UK.
The Chinese market continues to grow, although the group anticipates
increasing problems with the financing of some orders.

THE conservative black leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday warned
President F W de Klerk that he would fight South Africa's new interim
constitution and reduce it to 'the rubble of passing history', Reuter
reports from Durban.
Chief Buthelezi, who walked out of the constitutional talks five months ago,
said in a statement that Mr de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, the African
National Congress leader, had decided 'to go it alone' without his
participation or approval.
'We will meet the present draft constitution. . . . with determined
resistance,' said Chief Buthelezi, who demands autonomy for the
Natal/KwaZulu region where he has his power base.
'I want to point out that when it comes to the implementation of the new
constitution and the whole transitional phase, nobody should expect us to be
faithful and diligent in assisting,' he added.
Mr De Klerk, Mr Mandela and 17 other leaders approved an interim
constitution early yesterday providing for non-racial elections next April.
Black and white right-wing groups reject the document as a recipe for
domination by the ANC.
'Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela will in the end know that the best that they
could do together will end up. . . . incurring the wrath of such a large
percentage of South Africans that (it) will be reduced to the rubble of
passing history,' Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party,
said.
He told Mr Peter Kooijmans, Dutch foreign minister, yesterday that he would
not take part in the election if it meant legitimising a flawed
constitution. 'I would rather go into the political wilderness.'
The International Labour Organisation yesterday resumed technical assistance
and co-operation in South Africa after a boycott lasting three decades.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, Japan's second biggest carmaker, plans to close four of its Japanese
factories for two days next month in an attempt to trim output and cut
costs, it said yesterday, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
The decision reflects the severity of Japan's economic slowdown and its
impact on the car industry. Nissan has already announced plans to close one
of its main factories on the outskirts of Tokyo.
The move will affect about 15,000 employees, to be given extra days off with
90 per cent pay, to be funded partly from government employment adjustment
subsidies. The closures, which will cut output by about 4,000 vehicles,
follow a similar move this month affecting over 2,000 workers.
The company's domestic production declined by 13 per cent in the first half
of the fiscal year. The decision also reflects the downturn in the European
market, where exports have fallen 47 per cent. Nissan has already revised
its production forecast by 12 per cent to 1.8m units.

THE United Nations' operation in Somalia is a mess, with little hope of its
efforts there ever bearing fruit, the medical charity Medecins Sans
Frontieres said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'It's a dead end and I am very pessimistic about Somalia. It's such a mess
and there is no possibility of it working,' Mr Alain Destexhe,
secretary-general of the charity, said.
There had been no improvement in Somalia since the UN dropped its
high-profile hunt for Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, Mr Destexhe said.
The UN had confused its humanitarian and political roles in Somalia and
other crisis areas such as former Yugoslavia. 'After two years, the track
record in Bosnia and Somalia is negative on both a humanitarian and a
political level.'
Relieved and joyful relatives laughed and wept as the men, looking weak with
filthy clothes and unkempt beards, were freed one by one after shaking hands
with top local officials.
A young woman called Fahmeeda said her brother had been trapped in the
mosque after going there to worship on October 15, the night the army sealed
off the compound.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Salinas sees his big gamble vindicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas's huge gamble in embracing the North American Free
Trade Agreement more than three years ago has been vindicated by the
decision of the US House of Representatives to support the agreement, but
the costs of ratification have been higher than he could have ever have
imagined.
The agreement - still to be ratified by the US and Mexican Senate but
certain to be passed by both - is widely considered the most important
economic and foreign policy initiative taken by Mr Salinas in his five-year
administration, and possibly by any Mexican president in decades.
The pact formally reverses generations of Mexican nationalism, and would in
all likelihood lock in the pro-market economic reforms of the Salinas
government for the fore seeable future.
'It is a turning point for Mexico,' says Lorenzo Zambrano, the chief
executive of Cemex, the giant Mexican cement company. 'It guaran tees the
change from a closed protected economy to an open, competitive one.'
Other Mexicans see the treaty in almost metaphysical terms. 'Nafta buries
the Mexican revolution,' says Mr Homero Aridjis, a poet and ecologist. 'It
is the end of an epoch and a new economic revolution will start.'
The agreement's approval would come as a personal boon to the president, who
had staked much of his personal prestige on the treaty. It should also make
next year's presidential election easier for Mexico's ruling party, from
which Mr Salinas is prevented from standing.
Rejection of the treaty would have played into the hands of the nationalist
left, which has long criticised Mr Salinas' zeal in embracing the US and
free trade in one fell swoop.
The accord's passage is expected to have some short term economic benefits.
'This is good news for the economy,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, head of Baring
Securities in Mexico City. 'It will increase investment, lower interest
rates, and raise growth.'
Nevertheless, despite the short-term optimism, few believe competition with
the US will be easy. Mexican wages costs are about a fifth lower than the
US, but productivity is much less.
Many Mexican companies are already finding it tough to survive with average
tariffs of more than 10 per cent. Some sectors, such as agriculture, are now
largely closed to imports, but will be opened up under the agreement, and
are expected to suffer.
While the treaty should raise productivity and draw investment, inefficient
businesses will likely fail. The process of industrial restructuring, which
has been going on since Mexico joined Gatt in 1986, has already helped push
unemployment up, and cut economic growth to an expected 1.1 per cent this
year.
The battle for Nafta's ratification has also been politically costly for
Mexico's government, which has, for example, made last-minute concessions in
sectors such as agriculture that it vowed not to make.
The constant attacks on Mexico's authoritarian political system, abject
poverty and corruption by US critics of Nafta have hurt the ruling party and
Mr Salinas.
In trying to persuade the US to support Nafta, Mr Salinas has given in to US
pressure on one issue after another - on entry of Chinese or Cuban
immigrants to Mexico, the results of local elections, and future increases
in the country's minimum wage.
But Nafta's passage should help Mexico in its quest to join the Organisation
for Economic Development and Co-operation. By removing the cloud of
uncertainty over the economy, the agreement should accelerate the process of
Mexico gaining investment-grade status on its debt, a long-sought goal that
would truly put travails of the debt crisis of the 1980s behind it.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: France urges US to make fresh Gatt
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE said yesterday it was now up to the US to produce 'new proposals' to
bring the Gatt negotiations to the same successful conclusion as the Nafta
accord.
Mr Gerard Longuet, France's foreign trade minister, said the ball was now in
the court of the Clinton administration which could and should henceforth
'devote itself fully to the Uruguay Round'. Reports from the US agriculture
department that Washington was ready to discuss the Blair House farm trade
agreement, as demanded by France, were welcomed in Paris.
But Prime Minister Edouard Balladur warned against any attempt to present
France with a take-it-or-leave-it Gatt accord hours before the December 15
deadline for the Uruguay Round. French officials said Paris would need
sufficient notice of any agreement so it could consult all parties and its
parliament. The French premier reiterated that a Gatt accord would need
unanimous approval by European Union countries, giving France an effective
veto.
In response to suggestions Mr Balladur should now show the same political
courage as President Clinton in facing down protectionists in his own party,
a senior French official said yesterday France 'is not in the same phase of
economic growth as the US and therefore does not have the same room for
manoeuvre' in negotiations.
French officials also criticised the tactics of Mr Peter Sutherland, the
Gatt director general, for 'pretending that the so-called Dunkel draft final
agreement had the basic agreement of all parties' and diverting the Geneva
negotiations onto other issues. Many Gatt participants, including the US and
the EU, still had serious problems with the Dunkel draft of 1991.
After a month free from any farmers' demonstrations, the Balladur government
is now slightly more confident of selling an eventual compromise to its
agricultural lobby.

MINISTERS and officials at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in
Seattle expressed relief at President Bill Clinton's Nafta victory in the
House of Representatives on Wednesday night.
Although delegates have carefully avoided saying that a defeat would turn Mr
Clinton into a lame duck host for this 15-country gathering, officials
clearly believe that the US president will now be in a much stronger
position to provide leadership for Apec.
'He'll come here as a stronger duck,' said Mr Peter Cook, Australia's trade
minister.
Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's international trade minister, said after the vote:
'Certainly, it seems to me to strengthen President Clinton's presentation of
himself as a man committed to freer trade and liberal trade on a global
basis.'
Apec delegates had been at pains to point out a bright side for their
organisation whether Nafta won or lost. Mr Philip Burdon, New Zealand's
minister for trade negotiations, said that while Apec would complement
Nafta, in the event of failure it would have become a fallback position.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (18): The burden shifts from south to
north - But what happens in 1995 will cushion the impact of the UBR / Rating
revaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT fluctuations in property rents will have a profound effect on the
distribution of the business rates burden when it comes to the next rating
revaluation in April 1995.
For some businesses, rates could more than double; for others, they will
nearly halve. While the south of England will generally benefit from the
revaluation, companies in the north of England will suffer a marked increase
in their rates burden, particularly in the industrial market.
As a result, the impending revaluation will have a lasting influence on the
performance of different parts of the property market. In particular, it is
likely to aid the recovery of the market in central London at the expense of
other parts of the country.
The next revaluation will go some way to reverse the impact of the
redistribution in the rates burden that occured when the uniform business
rate (UBR) was introduced in 1990.
Coming 17 years after the last revaluation, it resulted in substantial rate
increases for many tenants, particularly in the south of England. For many
traders, the large increase in rates, at a time, when they were already
grappling with recession, had a severe impact on their profitability.
When the next revaluation comes into force, another shift in the burden is
expected - but in the opposite direction. Northern towns, which have proved
far more resilient to the property recession, have seen far smaller declines
in rental values than those in the south. As a result, many businesses in
the north of England face substantial rises in rates, in some cases more
than doubling their previous rates bills.
The revaluation, which takes effect on April 1 1995, involves a revision of
the two elements of rates - the rateable value and the UBR. The calculation
of the rateable value will be based on April 1993 rental values; the
calculation of the UBR will reflect the changing distribution of commercial
property values across the UK.
The UBR is set by the government in England and Wales. In Scotland, there is
no UBR: each region levies its own rate. However, Scotland, too, will have a
revaluation in 1995, based on property values in April 1993.
Most commentators expect a fall in UBR in 1995. Even though rents in some
sectors dipped sharply in the recession, the steep increases in 1988 and
1989 more than compensated. Overall, rents increased by 21 per cent in the
five years to April 1993, according to the Investment Property Databank, a
research group. This gives the government scope to reduce the UBR to keep
the total amount of business rates constant, after adjusting for inflation.
Estimates for the UBR in 1995 vary significantly, depending on inflationary
expectations and differing forecasts for the increase in rateable value.
Earlier this year, Herring Baker Harris and Gerald Eve forecast that the UBR
in April 1995 will be set at 40.6p and 35p, respectively.
However, that disguises large variations between different sectors and
regions. The revaluation will result in a marked shift in the rates burden,
because of the different timing and extent of the property recession in
different parts of the country.
The 1990 revaluation was based on rents paid in April 1988, while the 1995
revaluation will be based on rents paid in 1993. The timing of the
revaluation is significant in that some markets, such as City of London
offices, which moved from peak to trough between 1988 and 1990. In most
other parts of the market, rents peaked much later and have fallen by far
less.
The difference between the best and worst performing parts of the property
market between 1988 and 1993 is marked. Herring Baker Harris, chartered
surveyors, believes that commercial rents changed by between -43 per cent
and +230 per cent in the period. Given that the UBR is likely to fall in
1995, it estimates that the shift in rental values will feed through into a
change in rates payable of between -46 per cent and +230 per cent.
Herring Baker Harris expects a significant shift in the burden of rates: the
contribution from the south of England will fall from 70 per cent to 60 per
cent of the total. The contribution of Greater London will fall from a third
to a quarter.
There will also some shift in the burden of business rates between different
sectors of the property market. Industrial occupiers will bear the brunt of
this redistribution with an increase in their share of the total from 18 per
cent to 22 per cent of the whole.
The contribution of retailers will remain at about 35 per cent of the whole,
the contribution of office occupiers will fall from 29 per cent to 27 per
cent and the contribution of the leisure, educational, utilities and
miscellaneous category will fall from 18 per cent to 16 per cent.
The extent of this shift will depend on any phasing provisions that may be
introduced to smooth the transition, as they were at the last revaluation
when the government introduced transitional relief to cushion the effect of
the increases, particularly in the south.
Opinions differ on the likelihood of transitional relief. On one hand, the
increases in rates suffered by the worst-affected companies, such as
industrial occupiers in the north, will not be on the same scale as in 1990.
On the other hand, the revaluation may occur at a time when the government
is facing another election, in which case it may be particularly sensitive
to the impact of rate increases.
Even if the changes are phased in, the revaluation should be of immediate
benefit to occupiers in some of the markets worst affected by the property
recession. Unlike falling rents which give no benefit to occupiers which are
tied into existing lease obligations, the decline in rents should reduce
occupation costs immediately.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (17): Edinburgh makes up for lost time
 -James Buxton reports heightened activity, in spite of delay in re-letting
Charlotte Square / Scotland

<TEXT>
A VISIT to the splendid penthouse offices of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in the
centre of Glasgow, gives a highly instructive overview of the Scottish
commercial property scene.
The lift passes three empty floors on its way up the eighth-storey building
in St Vincent Street. Kenneth Campbell, the managing partner for Scotland,
ushers me out on to the terrace and points to the sole construction crane on
the skyline. 'That's working on a Glasgow district council property,' he
says.
Then, somewhat hesitantly, he points to the several large unoccupied, or
barely occupied, office buildings that dot the city centre, the product of
over-optimistic expansion in the late 1980s. Quickly he switches the
conversation to Edinburgh, where things are a little more cheerful.
Scotland did not have the excesses of the property boom of the south of
England. But Glasgow, always the largest and most stable commercial property
market in Scotland, renewed much of its office stock in the central business
district and boldly extended the core down to the river Clyde with the
Broomielaw development.
Edinburgh, meanwhile, was slower to get started, but significant
developments are now taking place.
In the early 1980s, the Scottish Development Agency struggled to persuade
developers to look at new sites in Glasgow. But towards the end of the
decade developers were taking a much more confident view of the city's
prospects as its image improved. There were high hopes of attracting
businesses and government departments relocating to the city.
The result was that, in the 10 years to 1992, developers added another 3.5m
sq ft of offices to the 16m sq ft office stock; but the stock that was
occupied only rose by 1m sq ft. According to the consultants Erdman Lewis,
supply has been outstripping demand since 1989.
Though Keith Aitken, of KFR, says there is a significant upturn in the
property market this year, with take-up of prime office space running at
higher levels than last year, rents for prime sites have returned to 1989
levels (around Pounds 18 a sq ft prior to incentives) and, according to
Erdman Lewis, will show little growth up to 1995.
In the spring, the property market suffered a cruel disappointment when the
ministry of defence decided to create a new centre for the army's pay and
personnel in the city: but instead of, as had been expected, taking Tay
House, a largely vacant building with a wing straddling the M8 motorway, the
MoD chose to shoehorn the new staff into its existing properties in the
city.
Edinburgh, on the other hand, presents a slightly more cheerful picture.
Cranes are hovering over the new Edinburgh International Conference Centre,
a long-awaited project promoted by the district council and Lothian and
Edinburgh Enterprise, which will anchor the expansion of the business core
of the city south from the Georgian New Town into the Lothian Road area.
Standard Life is to build a new headquarters close by, and Scottish Widows
is seeking planning permission to build on the long-vacant Port Hamilton
site to the south. A joint venture of Cala and Morrison is is hoping to go
ahead with an office development close to the conference centre.
The first move by businesses out of the New Town was to Saltire Court, an
imposing stone-fronted building developed by Scottish Metropolitan. But
coming on the market a little late, it was slow to fill up. Now, however, it
is 98 per cent let, on headline rents of around Pounds 22-Pounds 23 a sq ft.
Furthermore it was recently sold by ScotMet to the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority for Pounds 53.1m, a Pounds 6.5m surplus on book value,
representing a yield of 7 per cent. 'That was a remarkable achievement which
really puts Edinburgh on the agenda for international investors,' says Mr
Peter Smolka, of Hillier Parker, selling agents.
But the other side of the coin is that almost half of Charlotte Square,
formerly the stately core of the Edinburgh office district, is vacant,
following the departure of fund managers, solicitors and accountants to
Saltire Court.
The re-letting of Charlotte Square is held up by two factors. First, a lot
of medium-sized modern accommodation in other parts of the New Town has
recently become available, or will shortly do so, giving Edinburgh occupiers
a range of choice they have not had for years. Second, the district council
imposes intense restrictions on development and alterations in the listed
properties in Charlotte Square.
'The council must now make concessions on the rules to allow open-plan
office space to be created in Charlotte Square behind the Georgian facades,'
says Mr Smolka, 'otherwise the buildings will remain unoccupied and
eventually become derelict.'
On the fringes of the New Town, values have dropped to such an extent that
one or two office properties are returning to residential use, according to
the surveyors Ryden. Out at South Gyle, near the by-pass on the western edge
of Edinburgh, new developments are taking shape that avoid the planning and
traffic constraints of the centre. The infrastructure has been completed at
Edinburgh Park, intended as a prestige office area with harmonised
architectural design, and Scottish Equitable is to build a new headquarters
close by.
Already the two leading Scottish banks, Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of
Scotland, have built large head offices at South Gyle, and Royal Mail is
building a sorting office. Safeway and Marks and Spencer are the lead stores
in the recently opened South Gyle shopping complex.
In Aberdeen, the office property market has become more lively in recent
months, according to Ryden, with an increase in take-up and a rise in
inquiries. The Aberdeen market is driven by the oil industry, and several
oil companies are relocating staff to the city from London, or are planning
to do so.
Available space is on the increase, but speculative developments in Aberdeen
have in the past been rare, though Ryden believes that space built
speculatively would be taken up, given the apparent and latent demand.
Mr Smolka says: 'The perception of Aberdeen is that it is a one-business
economy and therefore more risky to speculative developers than other big
Scottish cities. The big oil companies mostly have their own purpose-built
head offices, so it's not very promising for property investors.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (16): Fearless in dockland - Why the
principality has received such healthy inward investment / Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLUTCH of analysts looked slightly bemused. Why were they here, gulping
lungfuls of sea air, rather than tucked up in a comfortable, air-conditioned
ivory tower?
In fact, why was anybody here on this vast building site out on the western
frontier? It was a dockland - so often a synonym for the kiss of commercial
death.
Harry Groen seemed happy enough, however. The chairman of NCM Credit
Insurance, who had drawn the City-slickers across the Severn Bridge to hear
about his new 450-job UK headquarters, could have chosen a multitude of more
conventional locations closer to London. Yet here he was, proudly boasting
about the delights of settling in Cardiff.
The dockland location carries no fears: 'In fact, he sees it as a positive
advantage to the image of the company,' says Duncan Syme, development
director for Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC). 'It shows customers
how thrusting and go-ahead they are to choose such an exciting scheme.'
That must be a relief to Grosvenor Waterside, a development subsidiary of
Associated British Ports and the real source of the analysts' interest that
day. But it fits neatly into a changing perception of life beyond the
bridge. A host of Japanese and Americans have also visited Wales, giving it
the lion's share of British inward investment over the past few years.
Money helps overcome prejudice, of course. CBDC has spent around Pounds 150m
preparing sites and building roads to turn the docks into the biggest urban
regeneration scheme in Europe - and there is plenty more to come. Meanwhile,
fireworks over the freewheeling financial regime which led to a clear-out of
top executives at the Welsh Development Agency cannot obscure the fact that
more than a decade of heavy investment has saved the region from economic
disaster, as the coal and steel industries have collapsed. This year more
than Pounds 50m will go into some 700,000 sq ft of joint ventures and
385,000 sq ft of commercial development.
But has this all produced a false market? 'There is a danger that the loss
of Cardiff's assisted-area status, combined with a more general review of
government spending, may prematurely withdraw an important underpinning of
the local economy,' says Mike Rees, of Chesterton.
Doubts over the domination by quangos in consumption of commercial space
also haunt Ben Gabbitass, of Applied Property Research. The Welsh Health
Common Services Authority, for instance, is the other major letting on which
CBDC has built its case for success. Like NCM, it is also an internal move
within the city, whereas original plans for the Bay anticipated a relocation
from outside every two years.
'I would like to know where the net additional demand is coming from to fill
all the new space being planned,' says Mr Gabbitass. 'There seems to be a
lot of shuffling around by people who leave as much space empty as they
take.'
Duncan Syme will have none of this. NCM could have gone anywhere, and had to
convince its funders that this was a viable commercial move, he says. Others
would follow, now that the bill allowing construction of a barrage across
Cardiff Bay had received parliamentary approval. 'We could have got by
without the barrage, but this will make us a first rather than a second
division location,' he says. Just as important, the final road link with the
M4 will be completed within a year, making it as accessible as the city
centre.
The ultimate aim is to merge the Bay and the city centre. British Rail has
ambitious plans to help close the gap with an 850,000 sq ft office scheme
behind Central station, aptly called The Bridge; while Mr Syme has ideas for
a processional boulevard linking the two areas. Like every other part of
Wales - and the UK - however, little will happen without pre-lets, and that
depends on other major businesses following NCM.
Local politicians hope to draw in outsiders by turning Cardiff into a major
European city, doubling its size with the help of more than 2bn of
investment in the Bay over the next 20 years. A more immediate influence,
however, is coming from improvements in accessibility. Mr Rees says the
second Severn Bridge, due for completion in 1996, is boosting a wide section
of east Wales by attracting developers to strategic sites around the new
motorway link.
Meanwhile, elimination of the final M4 bottleneck east of Swansea will break
another psychological barrier, opening up Wales' second city. It has already
beaten Cardiff to the punch by completing its own tidal barrage, and is
aiming to stay ahead of the game by drawing in Pounds 200m of private
investment over the next decade, pump-primed through a Pounds 27m joint
venture with the WDA on four development sites.
Fund managers have already overcome their fear of venturing into Wales, says
Peter Kelly, of DTZ Debenham Thorpe: 'In the last two or three years we have
moved on to the agenda for every prime investor's portfolio.' This is
because the regional economy is so strong since the replacement of heavy
industry with new business.
Property values have risen by more than 10 per cent in the past 12 months,
and yields are below 9 per cent for well-let property. The WDA has sold
Pounds 50m of property this year, and was innundated with offers for the
Treforest Estate, which was offered for Pounds 18.5m and sold for Pounds 26m
to Morgan Grenfell Asset Management.
But there is still not much of an office market, because hardly anything is
being built in which sellers could re-invest. Institutions would like to get
the two major schemes in Cardiff Bay, but ABP is not giving up its jewels.
The next round of development is not as far away as some might think,
according to Mr Kelly. An average 300,000 sq ft annual take-up has left
Cardiff with a vacancy rate of only 10 per cent. A couple of large lettings,
and the wraps might come off city centre schemes mothballed during the
recession.
Meanwhile, local demand will support pre-lets of 75,000 sq ft a year in
smaller units around the Inner Harbour, he says. These would almost
certainly fetch 14 to 15 a sq ft, confirming that the Bay is matching
city-centre values.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (15): Slightly less than shipshape -
Vanessa Houlder finds Bristol changing tack after the recession / The
South-west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION has left deep scars on Bristol and the south-west. The buoyant
economic conditions enjoyed by the region in the 1980s evaporated in the
1990s as its core industries, including defence and financial services,
suffered severe setbacks.
After years of worrying about the problems of success, such as labour
shortages and congestion, Bristol has changed tack. Increasingly, it is
concerned about re-establishing a vibrant economic base. 'We cannot be
complacent,' says Mr Andrew May, chairman of the planning and development
committee of Bristol City Council. 'We have to develop new sectors.'
Agents report an upturn in interest in the past six months, from occupiers
in sectors such as computers and financial services. However, nobody denies
that letting market is difficult. 'The market is still tough. Companies are
very cost conscious. It takes them a long time to make a move,' says Mr
Michael Finucane, of King Sturge, chartered surveyors.
Weak demand has taken a toll on office rents. Asking rents are down by about
a tenth from their peak; the decline is greater if tenants' incentives, such
as rent-free periods are taken into account. Renting second-hand space in
the centre costs Pounds 8-10 a sq ft a year, while new space commands about
Pounds 20 a sq ft.
The amount of empty office space in Bristol stands at about 1.7m sq ft,
equivalent to about 12 per cent of the total stock. That is below the
national average for city centre offices, which is estimated to be about 15
per cent.
The oversupply is particularly noticeable in small buildings of less than
2000 sq ft, which account for over 1m sq ft of the empty space. 'In recent
years, small self-contained buildings, typical of the Clifton and Queen
Square areas, have declined in popularity relative to open-plan
accommodation, which is perceived by occupiers as being more efficient,'
according to Chesterton, chartered surveyors.
The stock of vacant new buildings in Bristol, which account for about
500,000 sq ft of space, is relatively small compared with previous downturns
in the property cycle, such as the early 1980s.
This is, in large part, attributable to the council's past restraint when
granting planning permission. Recently, it has begun to take a less rigid
stance, as part of its efforts to bolster the city's occupier base.
Hitherto, however, the council's tough line with developers, coupled with
its concern about issues such as conservation, car restraint and
environmental issues, has provoked concern that the city was indifferent to
the needs of the property market and commercial occupiers.
A recent survey by APR for the Estates Gazette uncoveredwidespread criticism
by Bristol companies which considered that the motorist and commercial
occupier were badly catered for. Many said they would consider relocating to
an out-of-town centre, motivated by desire to escape the traffic and parking
problems and be nearer a motorway.
The popularity of the out-of-town market, which includes schemes such as
Arlington's Aztec West business park, is evident from its success in
securing lettings against competition from the city centre.
The out-of-town market accounted for 200,000 sq ft of the 380,000 sq ft of
space that was taken up in Bristol last year. The 200,000 sq ft of space
that was taken up in the first six months of 1993 was split evenly between
the town centre and the out-of-town centres.
Concern about the competition from out-of-town centres is not limited to the
office market. The city's retailers are soon to face competition from Cribbs
Causeway, a 650,000 sq ft regional shopping centre close to junction 17 of
the M5. The scheme, which is being developed by J T Baylis and the
Prudential, is due to start construction next year.
In general, however, development in Bristol is at low ebb. Although 1.85m sq
ft of offices have planning permission, most schemes are likely to remain on
the drawing board for some time. An exception is the second phase of the
95,000 sq ft Trinity Quay scheme being developed by the Church
Commissioners, which was pre-sold to the National Westminster Bank for
Pounds 40m last year.
Few schemes are likely to start without securing a tenant in advance.
According to Chesterton, the schemes that are most likely to begin
construction include Temple Meads, where the Bristol Development Corporation
has planning permission for up to 250,000 sq ft; Bond Street, where National
Provident has planning permission for up to 110,000 sq ft of new offices;
Thomas Paty House, where there is planning permission for 65,000 sq ft of
offices; and Newfoundland Street, where Wyndham Investments is planning
80,000 sq ft of offices.
The Bristol Development Corporation, the regeneration body, has announced
several other proposed developments, including a Pounds 20m office scheme by
Dysart Development and a Pounds 50m retail and leisure complex by Wilson
Connolly at Avon Meads, next to the new spine road it is building to link
the M32 in the north to the A4 Bath Road in the south.
Hanson, the conglomerate, has also proposed a large retail and leisure
scheme on a former Wills tobacco factory in South Bristol.
In the warehouse sector, there is more evidence to support an early
resumption of development activity. A distribution warehouse scheme at St
Philips Central, which is being promoted by Bristol &amp; England Properties,
has already secured lettings for about three-quarters of its space.
The investment market is also making slow progress in Bristol and the
south-west. Although the institutions have the capacity to make investments,
there is a distinct shortage of the type of buildings - with long leases and
financially secure tenants - that they find attractive.
A strong pick-up in the letting market will eventually feed through into new
investment opportunities. On the current showing, however, that is still
some way off.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (13): Professions give Leeds the edge
 -Chris Tighe and Ian Hamilton Fazey analyse market patterns on the east of
the Pennines / The North-east and Yorkshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE A lack of evident excitement, the market in north-east England is
going through important underlying and long-term changes, reflecting its
move from heavy and traditional industries.
Nowhere is this more apparent than on the sites within the remit of the Tyne
and Wear and Teesside development corporations, where much of the region's
recent property development has been focused.
Now midway through their lifespans, both are at the crucial stage of
marketing key sites, following sometimes complex land acquisition, and
invariably costly reclamation and improvement.
Examples include the TWDC's East Quayside and Royal Quays flagship schemes
on the Tyne, and the Teesside Development Corporation's Teesdale site. To
complement the transformation of this site, a barrage has been erected
across the Tees to cover ugly mudflats and enhance leisure amenities.
Following a lengthy legal wrangle, eventually resolved in the TWDC's favour,
construction has recently begun on the prominent East Quayside site in
Newcastle: the first office space has been pre-let to the North of England
Protecting and Indemnity Association.
That the association is moving from one of the city's central areas, where
many much older offices already languish vacant, highlights the disparity
between demand for smart new premises, at Pounds 12 plus a sq ft, and the
lack of enthusiasm for older buildings lacking car-parking and cachet.
Top rents have eased from about Pounds 14 in the last three years. Local
agents, although concerned at the dead weight of old, unwanted offices, are
adamant more new space is needed to maintain Newcastle's standing as the
regional capital, especially at a time when a worrying number of
organisations have scaled down their north-east bases in favour of
amalgamation with their Yorkshire operations.
While the development corporations do not have a monopoly of new
development, most new commercial development in the region has benefited
from some form of state incentive. For example, Leeds-based Akeler's Doxford
Business Park, on the edge of Sunderland, where much of the first phase has
recently been let, has Enterprise Zone status.
The imminent creation of two more north-east EZs, on Tyneside and in the
former coastal mining strip of East Durham, may well make developments
outside EZs and development corporation land less likely. The exception to
this will be schemes which have some specific attraction or novel feature,
such as the proposed Pounds 30m Durham University Science Park, next to the
established Mountjoy Research Centre, and the Pounds 100m Project Genesis
scheme for the 'green', environmentally friendly regeneration of the Consett
steelworks site in County Durham.
After its explosion of new shopping space in the past decade, Tyneside's
retail sector is generally consolidating rather than expanding. But in
Northumberland a new out-of-town shopping development is imminent on land
beside the A1 on the edge of Alnwick, where the Duke of Northumberland's
estate has won planning consent for retailing.
On Teesside, the development corporation is proposing a Pounds 16m second
phase at the Teesside Retail Park, the former Stockton racecourse site, to
the chagrin of struggling high street traders.
Meanwhile, research by Leeds University suggests Newcastle is losing to
Leeds in financial and professional services, the main driving force for
office rental pressures in the city centre and the benchmark for Yorkshire
and Humberside and the north-east.
Leeds's clear emergence as the regional financial centre east of the
Pennines has come in the past five years. Property demand was already being
spurred by the relocation of substantial parts of the departments of health
and social security from London.
Leeds has achieved critical mass in at least two areas of financial and
professional services, and this has helped keep a steady pressure on demand.
The city was already particularly strong in large legal practices,
half-a-dozen of which are among the biggest in Britain, each employing
hundreds of people.
But the past three years have brought large numbers of new jobs in
telephone-based financial or other services. First Direct, National
Breakdown, Barclaycard, Club 24 and - the latest incomer - Direct Line have
all established bases. The reason why Leeds is successful in this field is
the neutral, non-threatening West Yorkshire accent. First Direct
deliberately chose Leeds after researching the acceptability of a wide range
accents around the country.
Ian Barraclough, managing partner of DTZ Debenham-Thorpe, says: 'We see
about 1m sq ft being needed up in 1994. Leeds is looking very strong. Land
values and construction costs have remained stuck and there is plenty of
land available. Headline rents are around Pounds 18 to Pounds 20 per sq ft,
the same as two years ago, but with less than 200,000 sq ft of new space
available in 1994, we should see rents rise again.'
He thinks this sort of demand, and the consequent guaranteed returns from
new building, should help Leeds secure a large share of the Pounds 7.5bn DTZ
Debenham-Thorpe estimates as available, mainly from abroad, for UK property
investment.
Bradford is benefiting from Leeds' strength because, although it is part of
the same economic sub-region (the two chambers of commerce merged this
year), its office rents are around Pounds 12.50 a sq ft, making it
attractive for back-office operations for Leeds' financial and professional
services.
York, the ancient walled city, remains attractive for much the same reason
as Chester, its north-western counterpart; but Sheffield's picture looks
less rosy. Sheffield has also suffered from the polarisation of professional
services into Leeds, and is short of office space anyway.
In contrast, the rundown in defence industries is leaving Harrogate with
space to spare. Natwest's Switch card operation recently found 50,000 sq ft
there at only Pounds 10 a sq ft.
Until economic recovery is more firmly established, however, other market
sectors will drag their feet. 'Tenants won't move,' Mr Barraclough says.
'They are worried about creating double overheads. Nervous tenants don't
create opportunities for investors.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (14): Manchester's paradox encourages
relocation - Ian Hamilton Fazey examines the regional capital's imbalance
between supply and demand / The North-west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURPRISING frisson of anxiety is rippling through north-west England's
property community, particularly in Greater Manchester. Some specialists are
beginning to talk about shortages - in spite of more than 1m square feet of
overhanging, unlet new office space from the 1980s.
This paradox arises because the market is not homogeneous. Pockets of
increasing demand do not coincide with pockets of oversupply. Demand is
rising in the city centre; the area around Manchester Airport continues to
be attractive, because of the airport's growth; and Chester remains one of
the most pleasant parts of England to live and work.
All three pockets are short of good, new, high quality space. The region's
most concentrated bulk of this, however, is in the old Manchester Ship Canal
docklands at Salford Quays and Trafford Park, where two expiring enterprise
zones encouraged a spate of rapid building in the late 1980s. About 1m sq ft
of modern space can be had at relatively soft rents.
Some of the mismatch between supply and demand is encouraging modest
relocation within the region, with parts of Cheshire hoping to benefit, and
some take-up at Salford Quays. But it seems unlikely to knock on much into
Merseyside, which is still trying to put right its promotional problems and
where demand is relatively poor and supply modest anyway.
The effect is likely to be most obvious in the next 18 months on rents in
Manchester's city centre. This prime area sets the region's rental standard
 -a headline range between Pounds 20 and Pounds 23 a sq ft - with demand
driven by the city's financial and professional services sector, which grew
steadily throughout the 1980s, making Manchester Britain's foremost banking
centre outside London.
This is part of an ever more obvious regional trend echoed elsewhere in
Europe. Self-standing regional financial centres are developing to service
regional economies, as these local markets become too small to offer
economies of scale to national centres.
This intrinsic source of demand is now being augmented as a result of the
north-west's suffering less than elsewhere in the recession and showing
signs of recovering faster. The region's rate of economic growth more than
doubled to 3.2 per cent a year in 1986-90 - about the national average - but
shrunk by only 1.7 per cent in 1991.
By contrast, UK gross domestic product declined by 2.4 per cent in 1991,
with regions like the West Midlands (3.0 per cent), the East Midlands (1.8
per cent) and East Anglia (2.9 per cent) suffering much more than the
north-west - their downturn being accentuated further by growth rates of 4
per cent or more in the 1980s.
But while these last three regional economies continued to shrink last year,
north-west England's stood still at zero growth. In other words, it turned
earlier. The net impact of the north-west's suffering a shallower recession
than the Midlands and south is a stirring of demand now.
As Simon Reynolds, partner in charge of business space at the Manchester
office of Grimley JR Eve, the chartered surveyors, puts it: 'Third-quarter
inquiries were 23 per cent up on the second quarter and well ahead of last
year. Our problem is we have no tower cranes. Top-quality property at the
top end of the market is a rarity. We have decreasing supply and rising
demand.'
What top-quality space there is in Manchester city centre is filling and
changing hands. Some had its end user lined up from the outset, as with the
new Manchester headquarters of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountant. Trinity
Court, developed by Barlows, the Chester property company, has already
attracted Hammond Suddards, the Leeds law firm now expanding in Manchester,
and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank.
Although top-of-the-range headline rents are said to be holding, Mr Reynolds
points out: 'True market rents are realistically around Pounds 14 or Pounds
15, because of the deals that are being done.'
Deals might include several months of rental holidays - usually enough to
pay for fitting out and furnishings - and the developer paying for a
relocater's old leases for a limited period, or until they can be assigned.
The hope is that markets will pick up in time to save both parties
embarrassment when the period runs out.
As the economy improves, most property professionals expect no growth in
headline rents, but rather an improvement in effective rents as deals
tighten up. However, what is happening now is adding to potentially
difficult problem.
Mr Reynolds says: 'The dark side of the market is second-hand space. The
real millstone is 1.33m sq ft of it in Manchester. This will rise to 1.75m
sq ft in about two years' time. The deals that are being done now to get big
tenants to move are leaving behind a potential glut of second-hand space
that will be increasingly difficult to shift.
'The hope is that the lack of new space will mean good second-hand space
will start to go, but it takes four to five years to let buildings dating
from the 1960s and 1970s. You have to thoroughly refurbish them to have any
chance.'
With no shortage of potential foreign investors, the hope is more tower
cranes will start to appear soon as developers replace old offices, a
process that usually takes a couple of years per building. In the meantime,
The Quays - a couple of miles from Manchester city centre - offer the
north-west's only concentration of good space.
The three schemes there - the Anchorage, Harbour City and Exchange Quay -
were developed respectively by Amec, Manchester Ship Canal Company, now
absorbed into Peel Holdings, and the Charter Group, which went down in the
recession. About 230,000 sq ft should be let by Christmas - 50,000 sq ft was
let in the summer, 100,000 sq ft is in legal process and 80,000 sq ft went
last year.
This leaves about 945,000 sq ft to go, but at around Pounds 15 a sq ft with
incentives thrown in as well, it offers good value, given its quality,
waterside location and links to the motorway system and the airport. Mr
Reynolds says the Quays needs one of its three schemes to be fully let and
another about 60 per cent full for rents to start hardening.
Meanwhile, confidence is rising among retailers. Peel last month cleared the
final legal hurdle in the way of the Trafford Centre, a 300-acre regional
shopping centre on the banks of the ship canal near the convergence of five
motorways. About 7m people will be within an hour's drive. It should open in
1997.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (11): European fruit in the heart of
England - Birmingham is near the top of investors' shopping lists / The
Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MIDLANDS property market was far from immune to the recession. But it
was not hit by the same degree of overbuilding - and rental spiral followed
by free fall - as the south.
Some Midlands cities, with the benefit of European cash, began initiatives
during the recession, which are now bearing fruit.
Birmingham city council, for example, has made significant improvements.
Pedestrian areas have been opened, linking the traditional city core area
with the west end, where the National Convention Centre - again built with
the help of European grants - is located. The canal network is being
rejuvenated as a feature.
Birmingham (along with Manchester and Leeds) now features strongly near the
top of property investors' shopping lists, according to Ed Luker of Richard
Ellis.
There is an evident shortage of prime new office space in the city centre.
So much so, says Geoff Thomas, of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, that there is 'every
indication of an imminent new phase of speculative development'.
One of the most high-profile current developments is Temple Court, in Bull
Street, a major refurbishment of the former Lewis's department store by
Richardson Barberry Properties.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand has taken 100,000 sq ft on a pre-let at over Pounds 20 a
sq ft, while the Lord Chancellor's department has bought a long lease on a
further 130,000 sq ft. There is also a retail element. Temple Court has now
been bought by John Ritblat's British Land for Pounds 32m - a price which
reflects an estimated yield in respect of the offices of around 8.5 per
cent, according to Simon Robinson, of Richard Ellis, Birmingham.
Altogether, development completions over the past 18 months have totalled
651,000 sq ft (net), estimates surveyor Chestertons. Most were built
speculatively, and include:
Balfour Beatty/Church Commissioners' 136,000 sq ft 55 Colmore Row, which was
pre-let to solicitor Wragge &amp; Co at Pounds 23.50 a sq ft; the Church
Commissioners' Colmore Gate, 2-8 Colmore Row, where there have been lettings
to Royal Insurance (75,000 sq ft) and Touche Ross (42,000 sq ft) and the
remaining 30,000 sq ft is under offer; and the Chateau in Victoria Square,
taken by TSB as its new headquarters. TSB has subsequently bought the
152,000 sq ft building.
There is growing pressure on investment yields, partly because of
Birmingham's under-supplied status, and partly because of conditions in the
current investment market itself - large amounts of money available and
relatively few properties on offer. Mr Robinson reckons that the next big
Birmingham office transaction will be struck at 'well below 8 per cent'.
The new convention centre, along with the council's improvement of access
and rejuvenation, have led to a flurry of activity in the surrounding West
End area. One of several developments is Helmwell's 100,000 sq ft canalside
Tindal Bridge office project, where one third has already been let to
Property Holdings and the Vehicle Registration office.
The strategic location of Birmingham and other Midlands areas makes them
logical choices for distribution facilities. Severn Trent Property's 90-acre
Midpoint Park, on the north-east edge of Birmingham, is home to Cadbury's
new 400,000 sq ft warehouse. And garden equipment manufacturer Hozelock has
agreed terms for a 175,000 sq ft facility, which will open in autumn next
year.
In Coventry there is also a new initiative to revitalise the city centre.
The council is seeking to raise Pounds 22m this year, mainly by the sale of
property assets - land and leasehold interests with marriage value.
With additional cash from Europe and the private sector, it will aim to
undertake joint ventures with private sector companies, says David Holt, of
Richard Ellis. Among the key areas identified is the Lower Precinct, part of
the main shopping centre, where there are hopes of a new department store.
Out-of-town business parks around Coventry have enjoyed considerable
success. The City of Coventry's Westwood Business Park is almost complete,
now that PowerGen has taken a 126,000 sq ft headquarters. P&amp;O Properties'
110-acre Middlemarch park houses companies that include Digital Microwave,
Peugot Talbot and Tangram Computers. And there is now only one building, the
36,000 sq ft Stone Court left available, according to Mr Holt. A new phase
will be launched next year.
In Nottingham, the office market is extremely tight, with no new or
refurbished space over 10,000 sq ft available. The main reason is the delay
caused by the design competition for the new Inland Revenue headquarters.
This has led to the Revenue taking some 115,000 sq ft of offices in various
buildings on three- to 15-year leases, mopping up most of the excess offices
in the city. Most of the government's short lettings were concluded at
around Pounds 10 a sq ft. With at least five major unfilled requirements in
the market - mostly other government departments looking to relocate to more
modern offices - pre-lets are being negotiated at about Pounds 12 a sq ft.
The new 409,000 sq ft Inland Revenue building is now going up in Castle
Meadow with completion scheduled for 1994-95. Chesterton points out that the
market could well be flooded with second-hand space over the next few years
 -as the Revenue comes out of its temporary offices and leases on many 1960s
office developments fall in and the tenants move out. Much of the poorer
stock is likely to be unlettable.
Further south, Milton Keynes has suffered the same problems as locations
such as Watford - rocketing rents and overbuilding in the spill over from
the London market. Rents at the peak were as high as Pounds 17 to Pounds 18
a sq ft. Now, with around 600,000 sq ft of empty space - out of a total
stock in the central area of 1.3m sq ft - latest lettings have achieved
Pounds 8 a sq ft plus 'small giveaways', according to Roger Saper, of Jones
Lang Wootton. Some have been as low as Pounds 5 a sq ft. The largest
available building is Norwich Union's' 143,000 sq ft Witan Gate House,
which, it is understood, was considered and rejected by both BT and Nissan.
Quoting rent is Pounds 15 a sq ft.
During the boom of the 1980s, take-up of office space was up to 300,000 a
year. Agents are looking at several years before the vacant space
overhanging the market is absorbed. Until most of it is, the Milton Keynes
office market is effectively stalled.
Swindon's office market has been spared the worst of the development spree
which plagued most of the M4 corridor. But, though there is a limited amount
of good, new space, there is a massive amount of second-hand accommodation,
says Alistair Elliot, of surveyor Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Quoting rents for
second-hand space ranges from Pounds 6 to Pounds 12 a sq ft.
However, at St Martins' successful Windmill Hill business park, a new
305,000 sq ft phase is under construction. Rents achieved at Windmill Hill
so far are Pounds 15 a sq ft.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (12): Southampton sails ahead - But
Portsmouth has been hit by cuts in the Royal Navy and the defence industry /
The South
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE OPENING of the controversial M3 link through Twyford Down, scheduled for
the end of next year, will integrate the south coast towns with the national
motorway network.
Principal beneficiary is likely to be Southampton, possibly at the expense
of Basingstoke and Winchester to the north. Southampton exhibits as clear a
case as any of the two-tier office market present in most UK cities. There
is a limited supply of high specification new space which is letting at up
to Pounds 18.50 a sq ft, compared with Pounds 14 two years ago. There is
also plenty of empty space in second-hand buildings, of which some 250,000
sq ft is within 1960s and 1970s tower blocks.
Most of this older accommodation is poorly specified, without
air-conditioning or acceptable on-site parking provision. Rents are as low
as Pounds 5 a sq ft, rising to Pounds 13 for good refurbishments.
The only two new buildings in the city centre are the 36,500 sq ft Skandia
House, in Portland Place, where Eagle Star has recently taken 22,000 sq ft
at a rent believed to be in the region of Pounds 18 a sq ft, and
Timberlaine's 16,250 sq ft Mountbatten House in Grosvenor Square.
A further two new office buildings are under construction, both in
Commercial Road. Scottish Amicable is putting up 65,000 sq ft for completion
at the end of this year, and Timberlaine has made a start on 40,000 sq ft to
be known as Thorneycroft House.
A number of proposals are in the pipeline. But most are unlikely to go ahead
without pre-lets in place, according to Andrew Wood, of Chestertons.
Prospective developments include: Brunswick Gate, Brunswick Place, where
Bryant Developments has planning permission for 46,000 sq ft of offices;
Queens Quay, where Associated British Ports has a 28-acre site with consent
for up to 375,000 sq ft of offices; the Pirelli site, on Western Esplanade,
where the city council and Pirelli have outline consent for a mixed
development.
Martin Tice, of surveyor Vail Williams, considers, however, that the gradual
increase in demand, apparent since the beginning of this year, could lead
developers and funds to take another look at opportunities dismissed through
lack of confidence no more than 18 months ago.
Several out-of-town sites could also provide new office space. Arlington has
consent for a further 500,000 sq ft on its Solent Business Park at junction
9 on the M27; and at junction 7 there is potential for up to 200,000 sq ft
at the Botleigh Grange office campus.
London &amp; Edinburgh Trust has been granted planning for up to 1.5m sq ft of
business space on its site at junction 5 - at Eastleigh Airport, which is
being upgraded regularly and now offers a comprehensive European service.
Neighbouring Portsmouth has been hard hit by cutbacks in the Royal Navy, the
defence industry and problems at IBM and other major computer companies. And
it looks set for further suffering with more local jobs under threat.
However, while the Isle of Wight has successfully achieved Assisted Area
status, Portsmouth's bid was turned down.
There has been a dearth of new office building in the city over the past few
years, notes Mr Tice. However, two recent lettings have given confidence to
a sluggish office market. Insurance broker Rossborough UK has taken 9,614 sq
ft on two floors at the Swedish Slaget's (part of the Lundberg Group) 68,500
sq ft, 10-storey Baltic House on the northern fringe of the city centre. It
is Portsmouth's only air-conditioned office building.
The other significant letting is to the department for the environment,
which has taken the 13,666 sq ft Wynnstay House office building in Cosham.
The building will be occupied as the Cosham job centre and offices, on a
20-year lease with a 15-year break clause.
There has been a slow but steady revival in industrial demand in the
Portsmouth area this year, after three years of decline. The market is still
unsettled, however.
Little new industrial/warehouse space has been built around Portsmouth over
the past four years. Vail Williams estimates that current supply - excluding
Gosport, Fareham, Havant and Waterlooville - is around 635,000 sq ft; with
only 10 per cent in new buildings. So here, too, there is a marked two-tier
market, and occupiers looking for good modern space face limited options. Of
these, one is Blueprint Portsmouth, a 34-acre development by British Gas
Properties on the eastern outskirts of the city. Two recent lettings of
8,600 sq ft and 13,150 sq ft have achieved rents rising to Pounds 6 a sq ft.
Nearby, close to the junction of the A27 and Eastern Road, John Menzies has
taken a pre-let of a new 17,150 sq ft warehouse and office building at
Pounds 6.26 a sq ft.
At the site of the former airport, Percy Bilton has 10 acres of land
available for pre-lettings at its Bilton Business Park and Gatcombe House
Properties, and Portsmouth city council is soon to make a start on an
eight-acre site at North Harbour.
On a larger scale, Stand Harbour Securities, a joint venture between
Portsmouth-based Warings Group and businessman Bob Merrick, is busy with a
143,225 sq ft business park at the environmentally sensitive Cams Hall
estate close to junction 11 on the M27 at Fareham. Centrepiece of the park
will be the restored listed hall itself, built in 1620 by Hampshire high
sheriff Emmanuel Badd and rebuilt in 1767.
As part of the agreement with the council, the estate's parkland and
surrounding woods will be restored and there will be an extension to the
coastal footpath around the whole Cams Hall Peninsula, completing the
missing link from Fareham to Porchester. There are also two new 18-hole golf
courses.
Bournemouth has, over the years, attracted finance companies and insurance
companies, including Abbey Life, Zurich Assurance and Lloyds Bowmaker. There
has been very little speculative development. The one exception is Slough
Estates' Wessex Fields, which offers two buildings, one air-conditioned of
some 50,000 sq ft and the other 20,000 sq ft. Completed two years ago and
marketed at Pounds 17 and Pounds 15 a sq ft respectively, both are still
vacant except for part of one floor in the smaller building. Asking rent is
now down to Pounds 13.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (10): The south waits for light at the
end of the tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENT HAS waited a long time for a project like the Channel tunnel, to help
it counter the attractions that draw businesses west of London. But the wait
for a rail link may be even longer, as transport grants are among the prime
targets for cuts to help fund VAT rebates.
Further postponement into the next century will be a blow to private sector
investors. Some of the biggest business parks in the country are being laid
out in an area that has traditionally missed out on the regions's
prosperity.
The most ambitious is Kings Hill, at West Malling, where the Rouse group has
used US ideas to create a 3m sq ft business park on 650 acres provided by
Kent County Council. 'We hope to shift a lot of space to companies who will
be paying Pounds 15 a sq ft, rather than almost twice that amount west of
London,' says Emma Goodford, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
Only three freehold sales, totalling almost 65,000 sq ft, have been agreed
so far, but these are early days for a scheme planned to take 20 years and
include a creche, shopping and housing.
Bryant and Countryside have bought some of the land, and are keen to start
building homes, but Rouse will not contemplate speculative commercial
development during the current uncertainty.
Competition for pre-lets is intense with so many rivals in the market,
including Eureka and Orbit parks on the M20 and Kent International at
Thanet, each ranging from 100 to 350 acres. Others wait in the wings, such
as the 750-acre Ashford Great Park, but they are all treading water while
tenants wait to see where the London rail link will go and whether the
tunnel boom materialises.
On Crossways park, near Dartford, Blue Circle has drawn on the more
immediate attractions of the M25 to create a massive distribution centre.
Some 200,000 sq ft has been let in the last six months and another 120,000
sq ft is under negotiation. Now the company wants to attract office users -
perhaps envious of the 200,000 sq ft headquarters Colonial Mutual is
building at nearby Chatham Marine.
Competition will intensify as centres west of London exert powerful
magnetism. Developers are now being wooed back by the promise of revival,
just when space is running out. Jones Lang Wootton points out that the
region between the M3 and A23 has only around 18 months' supply of new
buildings left and 500,000 sq ft of outstanding demand.
A recent sub-let on the Guildford Business Park, at around Pounds 18 a sq ft
to CableTel, shows how values have declined since the peak, when town-centre
deals were struck at Pounds 25. But JLW is reminding investors that the
region is poised to return to a strong long-term growth rate.
Squeezed between the rivalry of east and west, Crawley is one of the few
towns with the capacity to take major tenants, following a long period of
growth related to Gatwick airport. At one time, the town had a surplus of 1m
sq ft and rents fell from a peak of Pounds 26 a sq ft to the mid-teens, says
Martin Booth, of JLW. But several deals this year have eased the pressure.
When Masefield House, the 120,000 sq ft former BAA headquarters, was let to
Geco Prakla at Pounds 14.50 at sq ft, it also proved that business could be
sucked in from both directions, as the company consolidated space from
Orpington to the east and Woking in the west, says Emma Goodford, of KFR.
Another significant catch was KPMG, which has centralised regional
operations here.
The town may be squirming with discomfort at rising unemployment, but this
has made it a more viable proposition for employers who can be sure of
getting staff, she adds. And with only two new buildings of any size left on
the market, investors face a brighter future.
Brighton is in a similar position, with a large chunk of new offices left
over from a period when it was the darling of the expanding financial
sector. Most of this sits empty in Trafalgar Place, next to the rail
station, where almost 120,000 sq ft is being offered at Pounds 19 a sq ft by
developer AMEC.
One ray of hope comes from signs of growth among financial groups. Sun
Alliance has just taken the 15,000 sq ft left by KPMG's move to Crawley; and
London &amp; Edinburgh Insurance, based at nearby Worthing, is in the market for
75,000 sq ft.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (9): The motorway effect arrives late
in the north - The home counties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE OPENING of the M40 extension, providing a fast link from London to
Birmingham, was expected to have an impact on the surrounding areas.
But its timing, coinciding with the Gulf war and the worst of the recession,
meant that only recently have the anticipated effects begun to be seen,
observes James Kennedy-Cooke, of DTZ Debenham Thorpe.
The new Charwell Valley services at junction 10, to open next summer, should
add impetus to the warehouse market. And at nearby junction 11, AMEC and
Abbey Life have just completed the 103,000 sq ft MXL centre, at Banbury -
the M40's only high-quality distribution centre.
Oxford city centre has seen a gradual revival in demand over the past six
months, says Scott Harkness, of surveyor Adkin Commercial. He estimates
that, during this time, 45,000 sq ft of good modern space has been let.
Adding smaller developments and second-hand space to that would take the
total to between 80,000 and 109,000 sq ft.
In common with many other locations, central Oxford has seen virtually no
speculative developments completed in the past three years. And though there
is still space available, it is slowly being taken up.
In Cambridge, activity revolves around research-based and technology
industries. Some companies are now looking at further expansion. There is,
says John Tweddle, of surveyor Bidwells, a strong resurgence of interest in
this sector, with a spate of lettings at the Cambridge Science Park and
several proposals to add to or create new premises. In addition, developer
Bride Hall, says Andrew Lawrence, of surveyor Connells Commercial, is busy
with a new phase at the science park, where rents range from around Pounds
10 to Pounds 12 a sq ft - down from their peak of Pounds 14 to Pounds 15.
It is a different picture in the city centre, where rents peaked at around
Pounds 23 a sq ft but have now halved. Available space stands at between
600,000 sq ft and 700,000 sq ft, Mr Lawrence estimates. However, that
compares with some 1m sq ft two years ago.
At Ipswich, Kim Watson-Powell, of Bidwells, sees signs of a revival of
interest, mainly from professional firms.  However, although there is a
great deal of talk, it has yet to be translated into actual transactions.
Ipswich suffers from a shortage of good-quality office space and an almost
total absence of 'institutional' quality buildings.
At Chelmsford, 1992 is reckoned to have been the low point in the office
market. Only 30,000 sq ft was taken up. This year, that figure should at
least double, particularly if Tarmac Brookglade's 36,000 sq ft County House,
currently under offer, is duly signed up, says Nicholas Jones, of Nelson
Bakewell, who adds that there will then be no new offices available in lot
sizes of over 10,000 sq ft.
Basildon is not an established office centre, and activity is centred on
out-of-town space. Recent lettings include 43,000 sq ft by Ford Motor
Company at Trafalgar House's Southfields Business Park, where there is now
only around 3,500 sq ft still available, according to Stuart Mole, of
surveyor Glenny. Demand has picked up, although it is still inconsistent, he
adds.
South Bedfordshire towns, including Luton and Bedford, are suffering from an
over-supply of new space. The area has been affected by cuts at General
Motors over the past 10 years, and unemployment is high.
There has been little speculative development since Capability Green in the
mid-1980s, says Roger Saper, of Jones Lang Wootton. The 90-acre business
park, where 350,000 sq ft has been built, now houses tenants that include
Whitbread, Barclays, Nabisco and Siemens.
There is 33 acres for development at the park, which boasts as high a
standard as any in the UK. Jones Lang Wootton are now marketing the entire
development on behalf of the estate of NH Phillips, the original developer.
There has been some interest in buildings at the 35-acre Houghton Hall Park,
at Houghton Regis. The striking Herculean building offers a total of 60,000
sq ft in three wings, and has been developed by Danish consortium
Laserglide.
Glaxo, which is building a new research campus on a 75-acre site in Gunnels
Wood, dominates the current market in Stevenage. The pharmaceutical giant
already has a further 25-acre site for expansion. But it is also understood
to be on the look-out for more sites in the Gunnels Wood area.
The largest office letting in Stevenage in the past 18 months was in Gunnels
Wood, where Penta Technologies took the 16,000 sq ft Chadwell House at
Universities Superannuation Scheme's business and industrial park. On a
10-year lease, rent rises to Pounds 200,000 in the fifth year.
In the town centre, one of the largest office buildings available is Cramond
Lelliot's 68,250 sq ft Kings Court, close to the railway station. Asking
rent is Pounds 17.50 a sq ft. Markheath's King's Court, a 22-acre site again
close to the station, has infrastructure in place for 600,000 sq ft of
offices. It is one of six sites identified by the Hertfordshire Development
Organisation's marketing plan as of strategic significance in attracting
inward investment from overseas.
The Reading office market received a boost early this year with news of the
sale of Kumagai Gumi/Ranelagh Developments' 121 Kings Road for some Pounds
45m, to OIL Property Investment, the property investment arm of the German
Hypo Bank. This sale, at a yield of just over 9.3 per cent, was one of the
first of a growing number of provincial office investments made by overseas
investors. Tarmac's 29,000 sq ft Adelphi House, let to the DSS, is also said
to be attracting interest at yields of 7-7.5 per cent.
The only new building in central Reading due for completion within the next
two years, says Mr Head, will be CIN's 51,000 sq ft Phoenix House adjoining
the station. However, Tim Warboys, of Jones Lang Wootton, says that the firm
has received a conditional offer for the post office site, again next to the
station, subject to planning consent for 50,000 sq ft of offices and the
refurbishment of the original post office.
Competition from out of town comes from Arlington's 720,000 sq ft business
park at Theale, where KPMG Peat Marwick has signed up a 30,000 sq ft
pre-let. Arlington is quoting rents of Pounds 24.50 a sq ft - and this
figure looks likely to be repeated for new space in the town centre.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (7): EBRD deal reflects institutions'
confidence - Big UK investors are flooding back to the office market /
London
</HEADLINE>

THE SEA-CHANGE in sentiment towards property in little over a year is
astonishing.
During the dark days of recession, it appeared that only overseas investors
were bold enough to keep the market ticking over. There remained strong
demand from Germany, the Far East and the Middle East, in particular. But
since sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism in September
1992, UK institutional investors have flooded back into the London office
market with almost reckless abandon. Falling yields on long bonds have made
property yields appear increasingly attractive.
The strength of the market was signalled last month by Deutsche Grundbesitz
Investmentgesellschaft's purchase of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development's headquarters in the Broadgate complex for Pounds 170m. The
sale of the building, which contained 360,000 sq ft of office accommodation
and 12 retail units, was probably the biggest single property transaction in
London for more than two years.
UK fund managers, though, have accounted for about two thirds of City
investment activity this year, spending some Pounds 171m in the third
quarter. Typical of the pattern of recent deals was Scottish Amicable's
purchase of Woolgate House for Pounds 87m on an initial yield of about 8.5
per cent. The 266,000 sq ft property is let to Chase Manhattan Bank for at
least another 17 years.
UK property companies, which have been active raising about Pounds 1.4bn in
fresh funds from shareholders, have been elbowed aside in the rush to secure
good-quality properties. But many UK property companies argue they are
already overweight in central London, and are keen to diversify into retail
and provincial markets.
One of the more innovative attempts to secure London properties was Postel's
restructuring proposals for the property developer Greycoat, which ran into
serious financial difficulties during the recession. Postel was clearly
attracted by the prospect of acquiring developments at a knock-down price,
although its proposals were eventually voted down by the company's
preference shareholders.
Postel has had to dream up ingenious ways of investing in the sector because
of the dearth of investment grade property on the London market. Not
surprisingly, property owners have been reluctant to sell while yields are
still tumbling. This has led some investors to widen their spectrum of
interest and look at secondary locations. 'In central London, people are
prepared to accept a shorter lease of perhaps 10 years or less and are
having to compromise on some of their ideals to secure a purchase,' says Mr
David Hutchings, head of investment research at Healey &amp; Baker, the real
estate consultants. 'There are even murmurings that the development market
may begin to recover.'
Apart from the investment interest in property, there has been a gradual
revival in the occupational market too. 'A lot of occupiers who have held
their fire over the past couple of years are beginning to move, because they
believe the market has reached the bottom. They know they are unlikely to
get a better deal in six months time, and supply has been falling steadily
over the past six to 12 months,' says Mr Michael Soames, head of London
Agency at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
The amount of vacant space in the City is now beginning to fall sharply. In
the early 1990s, there was about 20m sq ft of vacant property in the City.
By the end of the third quarter of this year the availability levels had
fallen to 12.35m sq ft, according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. The IRA bomb,
which devastated the City in April, damaging 30 buildings containing 2.5m sq
ft of space, undoubtedly had a big impact on take-up levels. But even
excluding this factor, there has been a steady pick-up in transactions.
A similar picture holds true for the West End. There has been a healthy
demand for well located freehold properties, although investment activity
has remained weak because of restricted supply of suitable properties.
Tenants are becoming more active, and Richard Ellis, the property
consultants, recorded a 20 per cent fall in the availability of West End
offices in the first half of the year. Rental declines have also begun to
slow showing a 3 per cent fall in the core Mayfair and St James's districts
over the same period.
The Docklands market, however, has remained quiet, as worries about whether
the Jubilee line underground extension would be completed has deterred new
tenants. Lettings have remained at a low level and there is still some 4.9m
sq ft of space available. But confidence appears to be gathering strength
now that the transport project has been approved.
As the substantial overhang of property in London is gradually absorbed, the
balance of power will gradually revert to the owners and the need to provide
new tenants with incentives, such as rent-free periods, will diminish. It is
perhaps even possible to foresee the day when headline rents will rise. But
doubts remain and whether rents will rebound strongly enough to justify the
prices currently being paid for some properties is open to question.
The implied yields on some City properties may have dropped to as low as 5
per cent, leaving precious little margin for error. As Mr Soames, of Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley, says: 'Most of the properties investors are buying are
over-let, meaning the rent being paid is way in excess of the market rent.
The main reason for buying property, namely income growth, is not even there
at the moment, and may well not be for the next 10 to 15 years.'
The property sector may, therefore, remain vulnerable until it becomes clear
that rents really are on the upward track, holding out the promise of income
growth. In the meantime, any rise in interest rates and a backing up of bond
yields would deliver a nasty jolt to confidence. Re-emerging investors would
also have occasion to worry if economic recovery remained anaemic and
occupier demand showed few signs of improvement. After the first investment
flush, investors may be in for an anxious wait to see whether their
enthusiasm is justified.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (8): The industry looks west - Two
recent surveys offer grounds for optimism / The M25
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

AROUND THE fringes of London is a tarmac tidemark left by the city's Big
Bang. Hundreds of empty buildings litter the M25 landscape.
'It epitomises everything that went wrong during the boom,' says Stephen
Mallen, head of research at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. 'Banks were throwing
money at developers, who indulged in some of the worst excesses of
speculation.'
More than half the 14m sq ft of available office space around the motorway
corridor is concentrated in a short stretch between the M4 and the A1(M),
according to Mr Mallen. In some bloated centres, a fifth of space stands
empty, and rent levels have halved since the boom. Many obsolete older
buildings may never see another tenant, as they cannot compete with a
plethora of new ones.
Go east of Potters Bar or the A23, however, and such excesses disappear. Big
office schemes are rare, because the money that did flow into the eastern
zone went into its traditional strengths - distribution and retailing. It is
no coincidence that Costco, the US warehouse club, which recently overcame
blocking moves by Britain's biggest retailers, has chosen to build its first
UK outlet next to the Lakeside Shopping Centre at Thurrock, where the M25
crosses the Thames. It might, therefore, seem logical to look at this
under-developed area for any recovery. The government favours development
along the East Thames corridor, and the Channel link will help depressed
areas of south Essex and north Kent.
Site preparation is already going on among big landowners like Blue Circle,
but any general uplift seems unlikely to take off for several years, because
of political prevarications. The Channel link is likely to be delayed yet
again by spending limits in the Budget. 'And the government has yet to put
its money where its mouth is over the East Thames Corridor,' says Mr Mallen.
So the industry is looking westward for more immediate opportunities, and
two studies provide evidence that this is not a forlorn hope. Tenants
absorbed 3.7m sq ft of space in buildings greater than 5,000 sq ft in the
first nine months of this year - 12 per cent more than that in the whole of
1992, according to a Richard Ellis survey.
KFR, which sets a higher threshold of 10,000 sq ft for the buildings it
monitors, comes to similar conclusions. The overall vacancy rate dropped to
just over 13.5 per cent in the three months to September, the largest drop
since it began quarterly reports 18 months ago. 'The market has definitely
turned since the beginning of this year,' says Mr Mallen.
Even more welcome to banks nursing burned fingers is the fact that the new
space they funded is in greatest demand, accounting for 75 per cent of
deals. Much of the property is going to local companies, which do not have
the same problems getting rid of existing space as in central London. They
are taking the chance to grab high-quality buildings at rents ranging from
Pounds 15 to Pounds 20 a sq ft, compared with as much as Pounds 30 in the
boom. Industry and business services accounted for more than half this
year's take-up, with computing companies and the public sector absorbing
around 15 per cent each, says Richard Ellis.
Big names are also back in the market. Important deals in the last few
months have included the 96,000 sq ft Lansdowne Building in Croydon, taken
by Tarmac; Eastern Gate, Bracknell, (63.500 sq ft) let to Mortgage Services;
and Athena Court, Hounslow (54,000 sq ft) to BSkyB.
Chris Hiatt, of Jones Lang Wootton, which has carried out a detailed
analysis of the office market west of London, points out that, while the
area as a whole has up to five years' supply available, some centres are
much closer to equilibrium. Vacancy rates in new buildings have fallen below
5 per cent in centres like Windsor, Maidenhead, Staines, Croydon and Woking.
Others, such as Guildford, Redhill and High Wycombe, are below the
psychologically important 10 per cent level.
JLW forecasts stronger economic recovery in the region than in the rest of
the UK, pushing tenant demand back to its long-term average, just at a time
when minimal new space is coming on to the market.
Shortages of high-quality buildings are already emerging, leading to the
first inquiries in nearly three years from developers interested in
speculative building, says Tony Fisher, of Chesterton. He picks out AXA
Equity and Law, which spent Pounds 8.3m to take over Maidenhead Business
Park to create up to 300,000 sq ft. 'This trend will continue on the
assumption of demand outweighing supply, and land values being offered at
today's prices, although whether this can be sustained for much longer
remains to be seen.'
Few expect a return to the lemming-like rush of the boom years, when
planning changes enabled every industrial estate to magically transform
overnight into an office park. Andrew Nesbitt, AXA property director, does
not intend starting development for at least a year, unless he can net one
of several major names currently in the market for space.
But with JLW forecasting a return to rental growth from the end of next
year, more investors will be scouting around the this section of the M25 in
the near future. At the opposite extreme, others will be looking for
industrial opportunities out in the eastern sector, where rents of Pounds 7
a sq ft and more now match former boom centres like Heathrow, but land is
far cheaper and planning rules less restrictive.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (6): Diagnoses in conflict - A
prominent consultant sees gloom. A prominent park developer disagrees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKE-UP ON business parks has collapsed by 75 per cent since the the late
1980s, says property consultant DTZ Debenham Thorpe.
Its study of parks, published earlier this year, shows that investment deals
formed less than 1 per cent of the property market last year, compared with
12 per cent in 1990; and that development is running at a mere third of peak
levels.
As head of Arlington Securities, Britain's biggest park developer, Patrick
Deigman might be expected to be discouraged. However, his company has nearly
a dozen projects under way, with more than 5.5m sq ft still to be built.
Beyond these sit more than 20m sq ft in the pipeline. Even so, the company
set alarm bells ringing around the market recently by laying off staff.
But the statistics are incorrect, insists Mr Deigman. There had never been a
tidal wave of potential development. A crowd of no-hopers had jumped on the
bandwagon during the boom.
The lay-offs were not a sign of falling business, but part of an internal
reorganisation under which property investments were transferred to the
British Aerospace parent company, he says. 'We should clock up more than 1m
sq ft this year,' says Mr Deigman. Institutions are also falling over
themselves to diversify out of city centre holdings, he adds, forecasting
yields under 7.5 per cent by the end of the year.
'We get a letting every month or two, and intend to restart development next
year,' says Philip Wakeling, who looks after Colchester Business Park for
GRE. But rents are down from 14 to 10 a sq ft, and nothing will be built
without a pre-let.
DTZ Debenham Thorpe says that business parks have fallen into an even bigger
black hole than the notorious City of London office market since 1988. Yet
Paul Lunn, of Applied Property Research, which provided the basic
statistics, is busy stripping out developments which have no chance of going
ahead or boast dubious claims to business park status. This could cut supply
by 40 per cent. Even that figure will be debatable, however, as no one can
agree on how to define a business park.
Some analysts refuse to acknowledge any scheme that includes manufacturing
or warehouses, which is ironic, considering that a new generation of parks
now on the drawing board will contain the whole spectrum of business
activity - and maybe even housing. Others set a minimum of 100 acres for the
'true' park, ignoring the fact that some of the most successful schemes over
the last decade are much smaller.
Even the much-reduced total still leaves what appears to be a vast
over-capacity, however. Business parks flourished in the 1980s, because
tenants were either squeezed out of town centres by soaring rents or buoyant
enough to take swish new premises on greenfield locations. Today, neither of
these pressures seems to apply.
Wrong again, says Mr Deigman. Firstly, recession makes businesses look hard
at costs, and discover that property makes up little more than 5 per cent of
bills. People are the big expense, and moving them to a more efficient
environment can raise productivity. He quotes KPMG, which has just decided
to centralise its Oxford and Reading offices in 30,000 sq ft at Theale, near
Reading. The rent is likely to be around Pounds 24 a sq ft, compared with
town-centre level of Pounds 15.
This kind of letting will be vital in future, says DTZ. Business parks have
to grab a larger slice of total demand or widen their appeal to include
town-centre tenants. Some are much better placed than others to do this.
'Business parks reflect the health of their local region,' says John
Heawood, of DTZ. 'This is inevitable, as 80 per cent of tenants move no more
than 20 miles.'
Trafalgar House, for instance, has picked up two of the largest deals ever
seen on a business park through local moves. At Brooklands, in Weybridge,
Surrey, both Sony and Procter &amp; Gamble are building huge new headquarters
only a few miles from their old homes. Both also bought freehold sites to
create bespoke buildings, which is now about the only activity taking place
in the sector, as developers have stopped speculative building.
Even the best locations will fail unless they can offer accessibility and
amenity, however. Tenants surveyed by Weatherall Green &amp; Smith gave road
links and parking as main reasons for selecting accommodation - far above
air conditioning or landscaping.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (5): Slough points the way out of
despond - The growing view is that this recovery is more durable than
previous ones / The industrial market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market, at least, believes the industrial property sector is well
on the way to recovery. The shares of Slough Estates, the UK's biggest
industrial property company, have more than tripled since the UK quit the
exchange rate mechanism.
This sudden upsurge of confidence is rather surprising, given the historical
pattern of property revivals. After previous recessions, the industrial
property market lagged the general improvement in the economy. But there is
a widespread view this time round that demand for industrial property is
picking up more strongly and more quickly than could be expected at this
stage of the economic cycle.
Part of the explanation could simply be that the recession of the early
1980s was particularly severe on the manufacturing sector while this
recession has primarily hit service companies. The optimists suggest that
industrial property may continue to perform relatively strongly, with the
government seemingly committed to developing the manufacturing sector and
with service companies still shaking out labour, depressing demand for
office space.
Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, says: 'Generally, things are
improving, but there is still a fragility about the market. It varies from
region to region, depending on local levels of supply and demand and the
strength of the underlying economies.'
The company has seen a steady pick-up in demand throughout this year.
Enquiries are currently running at double the level of 1992. Lettings, too,
have picked up strongly, starting in the Thames Valley and west Midlands
markets and spreading to the north-west England, west London, Docklands, the
west country, the south coast and Kent. In the past year, Slough has
completed lettings for 77 industrial and warehouse units and four retail
warehouse units to such tenants as Daewoo, Sketchley and Motorola. Slough
Estates is even confident enough of the market's strength to begin some
selective speculative development.
A few investment institutions, such as Equity &amp; Law and AMP Asset
Management, have also been prepared to dip their toe in the water and test
the market for speculative industrial sites. Although the building
companies, which flooded into the speculative industrial property market in
the 1980s, are unlikely to return as quickly given the banking restraints
under which many now operate.
Others in the industry, too, report that there is a firmer feel to the
underlying industrial and warehouse market, as tenants sense the market may
have bottomed and begin searching for good deals while they are still
available. Company head offices appear more willing to authorise operating
units totake on new space.
There is particularly strong interest in freehold property - largely as a
result of the historically low cost of borrowing. Guy Douetil, an industrial
agency surveyor at Healey &amp; Baker, suggests: 'Perhaps one in 10 serious
enquiries that comes through will now convert into a letting, whereas it was
a lot rarer than that before.'
Fund managers, who have traditionally concentrated their investment in the
commercial office sector, now appear eager to increase their exposure to
industrial property as yields begin to fall sharply. Double-digit yields
were widely available in the sector last year. But since the beginning of
1993 they have dropped by perhaps 200 basis points to about 7 1/2 per cent.
Richard Harrold, head of property investment at fund managers Postel, which
has about 20 per cent of its Pounds 2.5bn property portfolio in the
industrial sector, says: 'Three months ago, we took the view that the
industrial market would recover quicker this time than in previous
recessions. We had more confidence that there was a higher level of
industrial activity than previously when industrial property had been among
the last sectors to respond.
'We have been trying to invest in the industrial property market over the
past 18 months, and have found it quite difficult.'
As in other sectors of the property market, investment has chiefly been
driven by relative yield considerations. Even at current yields, industrial
property appears attractive when set against the returns available on bonds,
equities or cash. The critical question now is whether yields are likely to
fall any further.
'I think yields may nudge down a bit more. But you cannot yet put your hand
on your heart and be confident about the prospects for rental growth. One
has still to be nervous about the economic recovery,' says Mr Harrold.
During the recession, rents dropped sharply, particularly in the south-east,
and there appears little prospect that they will recover quickly. Healey &amp;
Baker estimates there has been an 11.6 per cent fall in rents on industrial
property over the past year. Since 1990, there has been a large number of
tenant failures as companies ran into financial difficulties. In many cases,
landlords were confronted with the painful choice of either cutting or
deferring rents or seeing their tenants go out of business and losing all
income. Even though the level of liquidations has dropped in the past six
months, it will take time for tenant demand to pick up sufficiently to
absorb the rental slack in the market.
Sir Nigel Mobbs is optimistic that there may be some resumption of rental
growth towards the end of next year. But he believes the overall figures may
mask an increasing polarisation between the performance of modern high
quality industrial property, which remains in short supply, and older
secondary space, of which there is a glut.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (4): High streets see most development
 -The emphasis is on in-fill sites, because, although there is unlet
property in most towns, much is unsuitable / The retail market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETAIL market, which led the way into the property recession, looks set
to lead the way out.
Having lost nearly a quarter of its value in the four years to May 1993,
retail property values have begun to recover. Investment yields have
declined sharply in many cases, while rental values have mostly stopped
falling. Even the property development market is showing the first signs of
a revival.
But many parts of the market are still far from buoyant. Rents on older
property in secondary locations are still declining in many parts of the
country; empty and boarded-up shops dominate many high streets and shopping
centres.
So far, there is little sign of rental growth. The improved confidence on
the part of landlords is chiefly a result of the reduced concessions they
are now forced to offer. The average incentive offered to a new tenant has
reduced from the equivalent of two years rent free to just nine months in
the past two years, according to Erdman Lewis.
The decline in the retail sector has been longer, but shallower, than other
parts of the market. From the high point to the low point of the market, the
fall in retail rents was 17 per cent, compared with 46 per cent for offices
and 23 per cent for industrial.
In the view of Healey &amp; Baker, rental growth is likely to resume in 1994 for
prime retail space, before reaching a plateau in the second half of the
decade as the growth in retail sales slows. As the market recovers, it
expects there will be short, sharp increases as centres realign to higher
demand, rather than a sustained upwards trend.
The uncertainties governing rental prospects extend beyond the outlook for
consumer spending. Much depends on the development cycle; the success of the
new wave of discount stores could also have a marked impact on the high
street.
Development activity is currently at low ebb, but the improvement in the
market may spur some developers to begin construction before planning
permissions obtained in the late eighties expire.
The main focus of development activity is in-fill sites in the high street.
Even though there is an ample supply of unlet properties in most towns, some
of this is deemed unsuitable because it is over-rented, poorly configured,
too dilapidated or in a poor location.
Outside town centres, development activity is currently subdued. Just 2.54m
sq ft of shopping centre floorspace is currently under construction, less
than 15 per cent of the 18.9m sq ft recorded at the peak of the 1980s
development boom.
The prospects of large out-of-town shopping centres winning planning
permission in the future have been much reduced as a result of a hardening
of the government's planning policies. Last year the Department of the
Environment issued a new policy guidance note, known as PPG6, which
emphasised the need to revitalise town centres, rather than promote large
out-of-town stores.
The prospects for construction in shopping centres that already have
planning permission is mixed. Cheshire Oaks, the planned shopping centre
outside Chester, suffered a setback in September when Boots pulled out as
the joint developer. In Bristol, however, the Cribbs Causeway shopping
centre is considered viable and is due to begin construction next Spring.
The viability of new development depends on consumer confidence and the
take-up of developments undertaken at the end of the 1980s. Conditions vary
considerably around the country and in different sectors of the retail
market.
Central and suburban London remain among the worst-performing areas in the
country, despite an upturn in interest from small multiple and independent
retailers.
Away from London, most shopping areas in the south-east have been stable in
the first half of 1993, according to Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors.
In the same period in the Midlands, south-west and Wales, rents were fairly
stable; in East Anglia, feeble consumer demand resulted in a 3.1 per cent
decline in rents in the first half of the year; in the north of England they
fell declined slightly.
Scotland and Northern Ireland have seen a good recovery in the past six
months, with positive rental growth of 1.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent
respectively.
Retail warehouses have been the best performing part of the property market.
According to Erdman Lewis, chartered surveyors, total returns on an
annualised basis at June were 31.2 per cent for retail warehouses, compared
with 7.7 per cent for shops.
The foodstore market has also performed strongly, although the low level of
lettings makes its performance more difficult to assess. Demand is strong
for sites in the best locations, as a result of the expansion programmes of
the large store groups such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway.
It remains to be seen how far their future is affected by the arrival of
discount stores. In particular, the large store groups are concerned about
the advance of warehouse clubs like CostCo, the US-style stores which
specialise in bulk sales in out-of-town locations.
The increasing emphasis on discounting is one factor that may hold back
profitability and growth in parts of the retail business. However, given the
constraints on new development and the improving prospects for consumer
spending, the coming year is likely to see a restoration of rental growth.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (3): London leads the revival - The
upturn in demand, most visible in the capital, has been led by overseas
investors, particularly from Germany / The office market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE market, long the sickest sector of the commercial property
industry, is beginning to stage a recovery.
The value of well-let properties has increased, as a marked decline in
investment yields - the ratio of income to capital - has compensated for a
continuing decline in rental values.
High-yielding office buildings, with financially secure tenants and long
leases, have become increasingly attractive to investors, as bond yields
have declined. This upturn in investment demand has been noted throughout
the UK, as investors' traditional preoccupation with location has taken
second place to their concern about security of income.
The turnaround in sentiment has been particularly apparent in the London
office market, which was long spurned by investors who were dismayed by the
large oversupply of buildings and the weakness of tenant demand.
This upturn in demand, which was led by overseas investors, particularly
from Germany, has been particularly apparent in the market for highly
over-rented offices - where there is little prospect of any rental increases
in the foreseeable future, because the rent payable exceeds the market rate.
The attraction of the building's high, secure yield outweighed the poor
prospects for rental growth.
The state of the office rental market shows less promise than the investment
market. The twin problems faced by the industry - oversupply of buildings
and weak demand - are still forcing rents downwards in most regions.
There are sharp variations between different parts of the country. The
over-supply of offices is most pronounced in London which, as a result, has
suffered the sharpest decline in rents.
A recent report by Chesterton, chartered surveyors, found that nearly 18m sq
ft of new or refurbished space was available to let in city centres around
the country, of which 15m sq ft is in London.
Outside London, office rents have tended to fall more as a result of weak
demand than sharp over-supply. Vacancy rates have remained much lower than
in London, because there was much less speculative development. Chesterton,
chartered surveyors, estimated that the London vacancy rate was about 18 per
cent, compared with a rate of about 12 per cent in regional centres.
As a result, rents have not tumbled to the same extent as in London. Whereas
in London's west end rents have fallen by 62 per cent from their peak, in
the north-west rents have fallen by 9 per cent, while in the East Midlands
they have fallen by 14 per cent.
These large variations in demand and supply between different UK cities
result in marked differences in the prognosis for rental recovery in
different parts of the country. On average, growth is expected to return in
1995 or 1996. However, cities with a relatively tight supply of office
buildings, such as Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Edinburgh, may
see rental growth before 1995.
The factors governing rental prospects are complex. First, much depends on
how fast tenants respond to an improvement in the economy. Many will delay
expanding into new offices, because they already have plenty of unused space
in their existing offices.
Second, the difficulties of reletting old offices mean that many tenants who
wish to move to new premises are unable to dispose of their old leases.
Third, the over-supply figures may prove to be exaggerated, because much of
the empty office stock is virtually unusable. There is already a two-tier
market: the new or good-quality second-hand accommodation attracts far more
lettings than the poorer-quality space, where availability rates remain
stubbornly high.
The difficulties in securing lettings of low-grade offices may lead to these
premises being taken off the market. Office owners have an incentive to
decommission buildings, because it removes their liability to pay rates.
This possibility that older offices will never find a tenant raises yet
another uncertainty. At what stage will property owners be prepared to
resume development?
In general, market rental values are too low to justify development on a
speculative basis. Moreover, banks are unwilling to lend on a speculative
basis, so the only developers capable of undertaking projects are those with
their own resources or institutional backing.
However, there has been an upturn in the number of schemes winning finance,
because they have secured pre-lets. Tenants with leases that expire in
several years time would often prefer to take advantage of low land and
construction costs by agreeing to lease a building now than wait until their
leases expire when the supply of suitable offices may have greatly
diminished.
Even the speculative developer is making a come-back. Pearl Assurance and
Arcona Properties are developing a 30,000 sq ft speculative office scheme in
London's West end. Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier at the helm of
Lonhro, and Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, have announced
proposals for developing Number One Poultry, on a speculative basis. Great
Portland Estates recently announces its intention to start development on a
80,000 sq ft building in Great Portland Street.
These first stirrings in the development market do not yet signal a
full-blown revival in the property market. Nonetheless, they are a sign that
the first building blocks for recovery are firmly in place.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (2): Optimism strengthens in spite of
downbeat statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THREE years of decline, the investment market for top-quality property
is beginning to strengthen. The fall in interest rates, following sterling's
exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, helped stabilise
the market. It reduced the risk of tenant failures and eased the pressure on
company balance sheets, lessening the need to sell property.
Moreover, the falling cost of finance and the diminished returns on cash
helped attract overseas buyers and private investors into the market. By
late spring, the growing confidence had prompted institutional investors to
return.
Potential demand for property is widely considered to be at its highest for
at least five years. Property companies raised about Pounds 1.5bn in new
funds in the first half of 1993, and are channelling much of this into the
market. Overseas investors are also making significant investments; their
1992 total is expected to be around Pounds 1 1/2 -Pounds 2bn. But these
sources of finance are overshadowed by the potential demand from UK
institutions, which are prepared to invest Pounds 7bn in commercial property
over the next 12-18 months, according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property
advisers.
Last year, the combined institutional net purchases of just less than Pounds
1bn was half the 1991 total, and one of the lowest recorded over the past 12
years. As a percentage of new investment, property slipped from about 15 per
cent at the start of the 1980s to 5 per cent at the start of 1993.
But there has been a sea change in attitude in the past few months. Like the
mid-1970s, when institutions returned in force, there is a widespread view
that the property cycle is on an upswing. Admittedly, this view is not
wholly reinforced by official statistics. Figures from the Central
Statistical Office suggest institutions were actually net sellers of UK
property during the second quarter of 1993. Nonetheless, most commentators
believe these statistics give a misleadingly downbeat impression. The large
number of transactions agreed in the second quarter are unlikely to show up
in the figures until later in the year.
The speed of the revival in investor interest is even prompting fears of
overheating in some parts of the market. Competition is intense for
buildings with blue-chip tenants and long leases. Security of income has
become one of property's main attractions. Falling bond yields highlight the
yields available from property - which rose above gilt yields in 1992 for
the first time since the 1960s.
Some investors fear such attractions could be eroded by legislative changes.
The government has announced plans to abolish privity of contract - whereby
the original tenant retains the ultimate responsibility for paying rent
throughout the lease - on new leases.
The impact this will have is hotly debated. Around 60 per cent of the UK's
50 largest funds surveyed by DTZ Debenham Thorpe believed the new
legislation, if not applied retrospectively, would have no impact on the
value of their existing portfolios. A quarter, however, feared it would
reduce the value of their existing assets.
The DTZ survey also found that nine out of 10 respondents believe there will
be a recovery in values over the next couple of years. At present, however,
investor demand is largely restricted to a narrow band of top-quality
property. Property with shorter leases and less financially secure tenants
is still difficult to sell, not least because banks remain highly cautious
about lending.
But the banks' caution is not necessarily a cause for dismay. It may lead to
a shortage of development finance, which will restrict the supply of new
property and encourage a revival in rental values.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (1): Institutions spur the recovery -
Investors are prepared to look beyond current uncertainties, because yields
are higher than on gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UK property market, which has suffered the worst recession for at least
50 years, has finally turned the corner. After falling by an average of 42
per cent between November 1992 and May this year, property values have begun
to recover.
The pressure of funds going into the market is the highest for at least five
years. As much as Pounds 7bn has been earmarked by institutions for property
investment, according to recent surveys.
Property companies are also in a strong position to make acquisitions. The
virtual doubling of their share prices between mid-1992 and mid-1993 allowed
them to raise close to Pounds 1.5bn in new funds.
Even bankers, who are still grappling with serious problems on their
property lending, have become less depressed about the industry's prospects.
A recent survey by Chesterton reported a 'dramatic and comprehensive' change
in outlook by bankers in the first half of this year.
At first, the enthusiasm for property seems paradoxical. The property
industry is still clearing up the damage left over from the late 1980s. The
expansion of the economy and a sharp upturn in bank lending triggered the
development of an excessive amount of new buildings, which were unable to
attract tenants when the country went into recession.
More than 15 per cent of offices in the UK's city centres are empty. Rents
are still falling, except in parts of the retailing sector, and demand for
new space from tenants remains feeble. Even those tenants who feel
sufficiently confident to take new space are often prevented from doing so
by difficulties in disposing of their existing leases.
Rents may have further to fall. An examination of real rental performance,
after adjusting for inflation, shows that rents have fallen no more since
1989 than they did during the mid-1970s crash, even though the fundamental
problems facing the industry are more severe, particularly in the office
sector.
Investors are also concerned that the security of property's income stream
is being undermined by the shift in the balance of power between landlord
and tenant, which is eroding the traditional 25-year lease with upward-only
rent reviews. In recent years, tenants have often been granted options to
break their lease at certain times, which drastically reduces the value
placed on a property.
The government has announced changes to privity of contract, whereby a
tenant who signs a lease is responsible for the rent owed by subsequent
tenants throughout the lease's duration. The new rules, which will only
apply to new leases, will restrict landlords' rights to claim unpaid rent.
Landlords are anxiously awaiting the outcome of a Department of the
Environment review of other aspects of leases, including upward-only rent
review clauses. Landlords consider that, if these clauses were outlawed, it
would reduce the security of a building's income and have a severe impact on
property values.
The reason why investors are prepared to look beyond these uncertainties is
that property prices have tumbled to a level where yields - the ratio of
annual income to capital value - are significantly higher than on gilt edged
securities.
The result is that a building with a financially strong tenant on a long
lease is an investment with a security of income that resembles a bond.
This relationship has increased the sensitivity of property to shifts in
bond yields. Accordingly, property values increased as bond yields fell in
the course of this year.
But the boost to property values from declining bond yields is unlikely to
be sustainable. The fundamental reason for investing in property is the
prospect for a resumption in rental growth.
Most commentators do not expect a resumption in rental growth until the
latter part of next year, although already retail rents have stabilised.
Even when rents begin to recover, the speed of the recovery will be slow
unless there is marked improvement in the prospects for employment growth or
retail spending.
One factor stimulating a recovery in rental values is the fact that
development is still at a low ebb. Only 6.2m sq ft of offices are currently
being built in the UK's cities, compared with the 15m sq ft completed in the
peak year of 1991.
Even though more than 72m sq ft of office space remains in the planning
pipeline, a shortage of bank finance will limit the scope for new building.
With the exception of a handful of prominent schemes, the development
projects currently being undertaken are limited to schemes that have already
secured a tenant.
The shortage of bank finance is proving a more general constraint on the
recovery of the market. The willingness of banks to lend on property is
generally confined to a small sector of the market, which has financially
strong tenants on long leases. Many, probably most, properties are still
unsaleable because of the difficulties of raising finance.
So far, this emphasis on security of income, which is paramount for bankers
and investors alike, has limited the resurgence in the property market.
The importance that investors have traditionally placed on location when
buying a property has fallen into second place behind security of income.
Even buildings that are very over-rented - where the rent paid by the tenant
exceeds the open-market rent - have proved highly popular, if the income
stream is sufficiently secure.
Opinions differ on the popularity of this type of building once the recovery
in rental values gets under way. It is likely that high-yielding,
over-rented buildings may lose some of their appeal, because it will be many
years before an increase in rents will have an impact on their value.
An improvement in tenant demand is also likely to make investors more
adventurous in their choice of property, as there is a diminishing risk of
being left with an empty building if the existing tenant defaults.
property is confined to relatively few properties, which are often held by
long-term investors. The result is that large sums of money chasing a
relatively small pool of attractive properties are forcing values up
sharply.
As a result, there is concern in some quarters that the market is
over-heating. The sceptics believe that rental prospects are not
sufficiently good to justify the yields on which properties are changing
hands. They believe that, unless bond yields remain on a downward track, the
recovery in the property market will slow down next year as investors wait
for more evidence of rental improvement.
Nonetheless, those investors who bought property when the market was in the
depths of depression have already reaped their reward. After a prolonged
period in the doldrums, this was the year when property became fashionable
again.

FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Whitbread wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results from Whitbread were well received, the 'A' shares forging ahead 19
to 519p in brisk turnover of 2.1m. The strong showing by the retail division
prompted some big investors to hook into the stock as a recovery play,
although some specialists were taking a more cautious view.
Some expressed concern that the group's brewing business remained under a
cloud and would restrict any growth potential from the retail side. However,
this did not discourage the stock's supporters, who pointed out that the
company is well placed for a consumer-led recovery. Forecasts for the full
year were trimmed to a range of Pounds 232m to Pounds 240m.
Pharmaceutical group Wellcome fell on negative comments in a television
programme which examined legal action Wellcome could face from families of
children allegedly damaged more than 20 years ago by the whooping cough
vaccine it manufactured. The stock slid 17 to 649p and others in the
pharmaceuticals sector were dragged back in its wake. Glaxo lost 7 to 651p
and Zeneca 13 to 774p.
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings rose 10 to 1654p
after gains in the US on Wednesday night.
Lloyds Bank was the pick of the banking sector, advancing 10 to 580p, with
BZW said to have recommended the shares after the 'yes' vote on Nafta in the
US congress on Wednesday evening.
Dealers said the buy note reflected perceptions that the value of Lloyds'
substantial Mexican debt could rise considerably as Mexico participated
freely in the economic recovery in North America. Dealers also said that
Lloyds had continued to benefit from its yield premium over other leading UK
banks.
HSBC opened sharply higher as the Hong Kong market performed better than
many London traders had expected after Morgan Stanley's big downgrade of its
Hong Kong market rating. But the firmer trend was quickly eroded and HSBC
shares retreated from an initial 744p to close a net penny off at 733p after
another hefty turnover of 5.8m.
Standard Chartered also performed well, finishing 16 stronger at 1053p.
A much better tone permeated a merchant banking area given a rough ride by
the market since the splendid figures recently announced by Hambros and SG
Warburg. Hambros moved up 2 to 360p and Warburg 10 to 850p.
Whitbread's results helped other big brewery and restaurant groups, with
Allied-Lyons advancing 11 to 572p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle 6 to 475p.
Ladbroke rallied from its recent mauling, improving 3 to 159p. First Leisure
remained dull, slipping a penny to 235p, in spite of a strong buy note from
Credit Lyonnais Laing. Airtours rose 13 to 446p on talk of good bookings for
1994.
Results from Storehouse, the fashion retailer, were better than expected
which, together with an upbeat statement, helped the shares jump 17 to 200p.
However, analysts expressed slight disappointment with the unchanged
dividend. Market forecasts for the full year clustered around the Pounds 65m
mark.
There was another surge in the price of Lloyds Chemist, the shares climbing
13 to 306p, a rise of 40 in the past two weeks. Analysts have attributed the
strength to the shares' underperformance and speculation that the Budget
could reveal prescription charge increases. Profit-taking shaved 5 from
Boots to 520p.
House broker Hoare Govett was said to be behind a rise in Tate &amp; Lyle, which
reports results next week. The shares moved ahead 13 to 391p. Yield
considerations lifted Booker 5 to 403p.
Among food retailers, Argyll Group's recovery continued, the stock adding 6
at 277p. Kwik Save was under further pressure ahead of results expected next
week, although the shares recovered to close steady at 577p. J. Sainsbury
appreciated 7 to 386p.
In spite of an announcement that investors had shied away from an open offer
from Aegis Group, Europe's biggest media-buying network, the shares held
steady at 19p. An offer of 231m new ordinary shares at 20p apiece was only
14 per cent taken up, while an offer for 68.2m new preference shares at 22p
was 7 per cent taken up.
Union Discount firmed a penny to 170p in spite of news that Newton
Investment Management had sold 2.3m shares, equivalent to a 12.3 per cent
stake, in the company.
Ugland, the former Bristol Channel Ship Repairers, moved forward 8 to 108p
on its market debut.
Racal Electronics came under renewed pressure after a sizeable agency cross
and talk that one influential broking house had adopted a persistently
bearish stance on the shares. The stock closed 14 lower at 198p after
turnover of 6.5m shares.

<TEXT>
The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, climbed 20 to 678p as one overseas
buyer was said to have picked up a block of shares and left the market short
of stock.
Dealers were scrambling for stock in the morning and the subsequent squeeze
in the share price led to the inevitable rumours.
First, there was talk that copper prices were poised to pick up, although
this was discounted by analysts. Then there was some hope that a midday
presentation to the Association of Mining Analysts would yield good news.
However, the presentation is a regular feature and generally covers
technical ground - yesterday was no exception.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Third-quarter results from British Gas, usually regarded by the market as
price insensitive, came in worse than market expectations and triggered a
bout of underperformance by the share price.
At the close of trading the stock was 3 1/2 cheaper at 325p, a fraction
above the day's low point, after good turnover of 11m shares.
Dealers said the market was worried that a series of earnings forecast cuts
could be under way and that the company might be forced into announcing very
heavy job cuts if the government accepts the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission recommendation to break up the group.
Nomura has long adopted one of the market's most bearish viewpoints on Gas.
Mr Steve Turner, the broker's Gas analyst, said: 'The figures were well
below expectations despite a Pounds 40m boost from colder weather and the
utilisation of Pounds 25m worth of provisions.' He reduced his full year
forecast from Pounds 950m to Pounds 925m.

FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUGGESTIONS that Dixons' much vaunted deal to sell its loss-making US
subsidiary Silo may have come unstuck knocked the shares, already under
pressure following Amstrad's profits warning. Dixons firmly denied the US
deal rumour to analysts and the shares rallied in late trading. They closed
at 270p, after touching 266p, down 7 on the day. Turnover in the stock came
to 4.4m.
The Silo deal, in which Dixons agreed to sell the group to Fretter, another
US retailer, in return for equity has underpinned the revival in the share
price since it was disclosed in September. Although analysts said the
details are taking longer to finalise than expected, all were dismissive of
the speculation. Dixons was also said to be trying to play down the
importance of its connections with Amstrad, arguing that the amount of trade
with the electrical components group was shrinking.
Amstrad shares have been among the market's best performers in the past
couple of weeks as talk of imminent good trading news triggered
exceptionally heavy buying interest in the traded options as well as the
cash market. They dropped yesterday after the company shocked the market by
issuing a profits warning only minutes before the annual meeting. The
meeting was 'noisy and angry; there were a lot of upset shareholders', said
one analyst who attended the gathering.
Amstrad's statement warned that it was worried that sales and margins would
not match last year's levels and that present City expectations of sales and
profits for the current year were likely to be optimistic. The news
devastated Amstrad's share price, which fell sharply from an early 54 1/2 p
to end 10 3/4 down at 43p. Turnover was a hefty 16m shares.

FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY fireworks in London derivatives turned out to be no more than a few
damp squibs as the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 faded away ahead of
Footsie options expiry today, writes Peter John.
The Footsie future for December opened at 3,138, some 10 points above
Wednesday's official close. Following economic data which suggested that
employment prospects were recovering but wage growth was remaining low - the
dream ticket of recovery without inflation - the contract shot forward to
3,153. At that level it was some 15 points above the day's high point in the
underlying cash market. That compares to a fair value premium to cash of
only 6 points and consequently presented an opportunity to arbitrage by
selling the highly priced futures market and buying the comparatively cheap
cash market.
As a result, the futures fell back to 3,133.5 by the official close when
more than 11,600 contracts were traded. It continued to trickle off in after
hours trading.
Options dealings were overshadowed by the expiry of the November series on
the Footsie today although there was a large trade in the European-style
Footsie options with one house buying 1,250 puts expiring in June at a
strike price of 3,125. Total options turnover was 36,750 lots, slightly down
from 38,900 on Wednesday. The most active stock option was BT with 2,496
lots dealt.

FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains trimmed before the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market's base rate optimism survived the absence of a move by the
Bundesbank yesterday, but the extra bonus which came from the success of the
Nafta vote in the US congress soon melted away. An early gain of more than
18 points on the FT-SE 100 Index was lost when Wall Street opened lower, but
the UK market turned higher again at the very end of the session.
Further consideration of the sharp fall in domestic inflation confirmed the
market's view that a base rate cut at Budget time is now virtually certain,
with analysts disagreeing only over whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer, will risk a cut of more than one point.
Few London strategists had been predicting a rate cut from the Bundesbank
yesterday so there was little significant response when the German central
bank left rates unchanged.
The FT-SE Index closed 5.5 higher on the day at 3,125.5, having rallied
after a burst of activity in the futures sector had pushed the Footsie
briefly into negative territory.
Second line stocks extended this week's recovery, taking the FT-SE Mid 250
Index ahead by 15.8 to 3,452.5. Trading in second line issues made up around
58 per cent of the day's Seaq total which rose by 6.6 per cent as base rate
hopes rekindled confidence.
Company results continued to provide an erratic guide for the stock market
which will next week face trading statements from important members of the
consumer industries which the market hopes will lead the UK out of
recession. There was some recovery in BOC, which has been weak since
announcing results.
Both Whitbread, the brewer, and Storehouse the retail group that includes
the Mothercare chain, pleased the stock market with good profit figures and
positive comments on the trading outlook. But Amstrad, the consumer
electronics group, depressed the sector with a profits warning.
It was the turn of the store sector to catch up with the revival of interest
rates optimism. Banking stocks, which had made their response in the
previous session, made little further progress yesterday.
International stocks were mostly firmer, on relief that worries over the
NAFTA vote had proved unfounded, although the response in London was
tempered by Wall Street's downturn at the close of the previous session.
Concerns over the downgrading of the Hong Kong stock market by a leading US
investment bank also proved overdone. Figures from Cable &amp; Wireless were
taken calmly and HSBC held steady.
A steady trend in fixed interest and sterling currency markets underpinned
the equity market's confidence that domestic interest rates can be cut at
the end of the month. But market strategists pointed out that a full point
cut may be already in the market and that the Budget is almost certain to
bring less encouraging news for the stock market in the form of higher VAT
taxes.
Some concern was expressed at the apparent petering out of retail sales in
October when they rose by only 0.1 per cent. Nikko Europe commented that
this looked like a 'disappointing result for the beginning of the Christmas
shopping season. Consumers are willing to buy but not on credit and only at
the right price ..'

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Discounted Nafta news brings
selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US INVESTORS put the successful passage of Nafta through the House of
Representatives behind them yesterday, and instead focused on rising bond
yields. With profit-taking also in evidence, the result was a decline in
share prices across the board, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.01 at 3,685.34.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 1.19 to 463.62, while the American SE
composite shed 3.00 to 469.54 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.02 to 754.34.
New York SE volume was 313.5m shares.
Although the equity markets had hoped that the House of Representatives
would vote for Nafta, investors did not greet the good news with buying,
primarily because expectations of a successful outcome had already been
discounted earlier in the week. Thus, the stage was set for some early
losses as investors took more profits earned during the markets' gains on
Tuesday.
Another rise in bond yields also pressured equity prices lower. The bond
market was reacting to the latest evidence of economic growth - weekly
jobless claims fell by 20,000, and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's
report on local business activity was stronger than expected.
Although the data should have been bullish for stocks, equity investors were
more concerned by the latest rise in bond yields, and with prices also
undermined by computerised sell programs, the markets ended the day notably
weaker.
Trading in Chevron was halted because of an order imbalance on the sell side
amid speculation that Pennzoil, a major shareholder, would sell its stake in
the company.
After refusing to comment, Pennzoil later confirmed that it had sold 8.2m
shares in the oil group. By the close, Chevron was down Dollars 4 3/8 at
Dollars 88 5/8 on volume of 10.5m shares, while Pennzoil, which was left
with a 2.8 per cent stake in Chevron, was up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 58 1/8
.
Other major oil stocks were mixed. Texaco fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 65 3/4
and British Petroleum Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 3/4 , but Exxon firmed
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 64 1/2 and Mobil Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 77 3/4 .
Mexican-related stocks celebrated the Nafta vote with gains. Telefonos de
Mexico rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 in volume of 7.4m shares, the
Mexico Fund added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 29 3/8 and the Emerging Mexico
Fund climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 22 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed mixed after busy trading. The TSE 300 index lost
1.8 at 4,234.7, but rises led declines by 435 to 362. Volume came to 68.3m
shares valued at CDollars 860m.

MEXICAN equities ended higher after an erratic session characterised
alternately by strong demand and profit-taking after Wednesday's US approval
of Nafta. The IPC index gained 17.68 at 2,166.18 after veering between
2,145.52 and 2,174.51. Some analysts expect the market to rise 30 per cent
by next March.

chemicals underperform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BOURSES responded to the falls on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, back from a day's holiday, effectively matched Wednesday's gains
in other continental markets as the DAX index rose 13.62 to 2,085.34; but it
lost most of that rise after hours.
Turnover fell from DM11.1bn to DM9bn. Among blue chips, there were falls
against the trend of 30 pfg in both BASF and Hoechst, to DM274.20 and
DM279.20 respectively, with Bayer only 80pfg higher at DM328.50. Hoechst
revealed disappointing third quarter results nine days ago, and BASF and
Bayer produce their figures next week.
Commerzbank jumped DM4.90 to DM362.40, hoping for news of a higher dividend
next week, and Porsche put on DM30, or 4 per cent to DM785 in a generally
firm automotive sector, up on the higher dollar, said Ms Heidemarie Hoppner
at B Metzler in Frankfurt.
PARIS lost early gains as the session progressed. The CAC-40 index closed up
1.68 at 2,149.67 after a day's high of 2,171.93. Turnover was some FFr4.4bn.
Roussel-Uclaf advanced FFr24 to FFr721 with some reports suggesting that
investors were switching out of other drug stocks.
LVMH rose FFr126 to FFr3,770 on news that it was selling its skin care
products company to Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US. However, suggestions that
it was to sell its Pommery champagne division were denied by the group.
AMSTERDAM lost a little momentum towards the close of business, but the CBS
Tendency index remained in positive territory, showing a gain of 0.5 to
137.5.
Heineken broke through the Fl 200 level for the first time in a week, Fl
3.10 higher at Fl 200.70 as it reported that its Spanish unit was to sell a
brewery to Coors of the US.
Hoogovens was worried by fears that a deal on European steel subsidies might
not reach agreement, the shares ending down Fl 2.40 at Fl 45.70.
MILAN maintained an interest in telecoms as Stet announced that it had
approved a restructuring plan, and was hopeful of an improvement in earnings
over the next three years. Its shares rose L125 to L3,769, and those of Sip,
the domestic operator, by L74 to L3,195.
The Comit index closed 10.69 higher at 548.05. In a note on the telecoms
sector, James Capel came out on balance in favour of Sip as standing to reap
the greater benefit from the proposed reforms, and suggested that there was
a case for switching out of Stet into the domestic utility.
Among the banks Credito Italiano advanced L31 to L2,479, and BCI L88 to
L4,466.
ZURICH got back on the upgrade after pausing earlier this week for the
outcome of the US Nafta vote. The SMI index closed 16.0 better at 2,727.1
after profit-taking eroded a day's high of 2,735.0.
UBS enlivened a staid banking sector, rising SFr12 to SFr1,307 after a
confident look at 1994, and Brown Boveri gained SFr16 to SFr1,045 ahead of
next week's figures from the Swedish-Swiss operating group, Asea Brown
Boveri.
BRUSSELS broke through the 1,400 level to record its second consecutive
record high, the Bel-20 index advancing another 11.07 to 1,408.83.
Turnover was down from Wednesday's BFr4bn, when the market was excited by
the day's combination of interest rate cuts and government agreement on
economic reform, but it was still healthy at BFr2.8bn.
Banks and other financials were strong on expectations that more interest
rate cuts could be on the way and, in retailing, GIB put on BFr18 to
BFr1,376 in exceptional volume of 293,600 shares as analysts said that
institutionals had seen it as undervalued.
STOCKHOLM was disappointed when the Riksbank left Swedish interest rates
unchanged and when Ericsson, the high flying telecommunications group,
managed to disappoint the market with a forecast that 1993 profits would be
'somewhat more than doubled'.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 3.10 to 1,396.60, Ericsson was
unchanged on the day at SKr413, down from an intraday high of SKr426, and
Volvo's turnround from a loss to profits substantially higher than expected
left the carmaker only SKr3 higher at SKr422.
WARSAW plunged under selling pressure from small investors trying to raise
cash to buy shares of Bank Slaski in Poland's biggest ever public offering.
The WIG index fell 537, or 5.9 per cent to 8,609.8 and turnover was a very
active 1,600bn zloty as investors placed 47,823 orders, an all-time record.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-taking following the ratification of the North American Free Trade
Agreement by the US House of Representatives eroded early Tokyo gains, but
the Nikkei average held its ground, closing marginally higher on the lack of
negative news, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 57.61 up at 18,166.32 after a day's high of
18,336.63 and a low of 18,117.71. Traders said activity was largely
technical, with the futures market leading the downturn on disappointment
that the dollar did not strengthen after the passage of Nafta.
The Topix index gained a net 10.50 at 1,551.32. Volume was 220m shares,
against 216m. Many investors refrained from activity due to the afternoon
voting in the lower house over political reform. Following the parliamentary
voting, however, investors failed to react since the passage of the bill had
been expected.
Rises still led falls by 618 to 316, with 200 issues unchanged. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.02 to 1,251.22.
Retailers were strong on hopes of benefits from proposed deregulation
measures. Ito-Yokado jumped Y100 to Y5,590 and Seven-Eleven appreciated Y100
to Y9,150.
In spite of profit-taking by corporate investors, bank stocks remained firm
on index-linked buying. Mitsubishi Bank rose Y50 to Y3,050 and Fuji Bank put
on Y30 at Y2,280. Regional banks were actively traded. Joyo Bank, the day's
most active issue, was finally Y3 down at Y866, and Aomori Bank added Y9 at
Y640.
Honda Motor fell Y30 to Y1,470 on selling by US brokers, while Sony lost Y10
to Y4,840 after the dollar failed to rise following the Nafta vote.
Meanwhile, East Japan Railway shed Y2,000 to Y456,000 and Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone lost Y3,000 at Y778,000 on profit-taking after initial gains.
Penta Ocean Construction was hit by margin unwinding and closed Y7 cheaper
at Y553.
Daikyo, the condominium builder, forged ahead to finish Y17 up at Y893,
after losing ground on prospects of bleak full year results.
In Osaka, the passage of the political reform bill in the lower house
increased buying, and the OSE average rose 52.77 to 20,342.95 in volume of
15.7m shares. Santen Pharmaceutical advanced Y120 to Y3,180 on its forecast
of a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the business year to March.
Roundup
SOME markets in the region used the US congress approval of the Nafta
agreement as an excuse to take profits yesterday, following Hong Kong's
third day on the downgrade.
HONG KONG fell, but not by as much as London feared on Wednesday following
the leak that Morgan Stanley was cutting its weightings in the market.
The Hang Seng index lost 171.55, or 1.8 per cent, at 9,335.43, up from an
indicated 9,185 in London overnight. Turnover edged up from HKDollars 8.04bn
to HKDollars 8.14bn. Mr David Roche, global strategist at Morgan Stanley,
talked of 'a bubble on the Hong Kong market . . . it is not that the China
story has gone too far, it is that it has gone too fast'.
SINGAPORE rose briefly on news of Nafta's passage, but drifted lower in the
afternoon. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 10.31 down at 2,086.20,
after a day's high of 2,105.35. Volume was modest at 166.55m shares.
AUSTRALIA was disappointed by domestic corporate news, which left the All
Ordinaries index a modest 3.7 higher at 2,108.0. Turnover amounted to
ADollars 414.1m.
National Australia Bank's results came within expectations, but there was
disappointment that hopes of a scrip issue proved unfounded. The shares
ended 2 cents up at ADollars 12.88, off a day's high of ADollars 13.14.
There was less satisfaction with results from Westpac, 3 lower at ADollars
4.60.
NEW ZEALAND added to Wednesday's strong rally with a 2 per cent advance,
after the political situation was clarified. The NZSE-40 capital index moved
ahead 40.06 to 2,114.42 in turnover of NZDollars 84.5m.
Foreign buyers, in particular, were reported to have been re-entering the
market, with Telecom picking up 15 cents to NZDollars 4.30.
SEOUL registered its second 1993 high of the week, the composite stock index
ending 12.46 stronger at 822.63. However, brokers said once again that the
latest gains reflected an influx of individual investors, and that a
technical adjustment was expected next week.
BOMBAY rallied on support from foreign institutions. Mr Nigel Spence of
Lehman Brothers commented that switching of funds out of Hong Kong and into
India had been evident. Confidence had also returned to equities, he added,
following the lifting of the Srinagar seige by the army on Tuesday. The BSE
index closed 54.69 up at 2,932.31.
BANGKOK moved forward on strength in the finance sector, which helped the
SET index to a gain of 10.59 at 1,371.72. Turnover totalled Bt16.1bn.
MANILA eased as investors were seen taking profits. The composite index lost
7.13 to 2,404.18 in 1.25bn pesos turnover. PLDT fell 15 pesos to 1,790 pesos
after an overnight decline in New York trading.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Zurich tests equity turnover peaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in leading European equity markets resumed its advance in October
with a 10.1 per cent rise, matching the decline of the previous month.
The October advance was accompanied by a strong 5.4 per cent rise in the
FT-Actuaries Europe index, with confidence bolstered early in the month by
President Boris Yeltsin's military success against Russian hardliners who
had occupied the White House in Moscow. The Bundesbank's unexpected decision
to cut discount and Lombard rates on October 21 generated more enthusiasm.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities notes that the strength of the
markets was reflected in sharp improvements in local market indices in
Switzerland, which rose by 8.9 per cent, the Netherlands, up 8.6 per cent,
Germany, 8.2 per cent higher, and Spain, 7.3 per cent ahead. Markets which
rose most during the month also demonstrated the largest increase in
turnover.
Mr Cornish adds that turnover on Seaq International, the London screen based
trading system, rose by 10.7 per cent on the month for the seven continental
European markets, 'so that there was a slight rise in London international
volume as a percentage of the domestic market turnover, suggesting buying
interest on the part of both international and domestic investors'.
Zurich and Amsterdam, September's worst performers, became October's biggest
gainers. Buyers bought both as a result of the dollar's strength and falling
interest rates.
Swiss turnover surged by 42.9 per cent to levels surpassing the previous
peak of July 1989 as the SMI index finally broke through resistance at 2,500
early in the month and went on to establish a series of record highs.
Mr Nicholas Wergan of Smith New Court notes that demand for stock was the
result of the apparent redis-covery by foreign investors of Swiss blue
chips, on realisation that they had become cheap by international standards.
Banks pulled the market higher as some interim results surpassed
expectations, while insurers benefited from plans to increase the sector's
weighting in the SMI index.
Mr Wergan said Switzerland had also proved a beneficiary of hesitancy over
the outlook for Germany and France, while there was a return of investor
awareness towards the small and medium Swiss stocks in the light of the
bottoming out of the domestic economy after monetary easing.
The Netherlands saw turnover rise 32.8 per cent, also a record, and Spain
advanced 26.3 per cent in October and 20.7 per cent over the average of the
previous three months.
Italy was the month's big loser as the market was unnerved by an
increasingly uncertain political outlook and as it faced up to the prospect
of a very heavy calendar of capital raising exercises, most notably that by
Fiat. Turnover fell 28.6 per cent on the month accompanied by a 2.2 per cent
fall in the local market index.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Nafta vote helps the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Clinton's narrow triumph over Nafta was the cause for some
movement in the dollar yesterday, even though the markets had assumed a
success for the administration on the trade deal ahead of the congress vote,
writes Rachel Johnson.
In early trading, the D-Mark continued its slide against other European
currencies and the dollar, even though further falls were arrested by the
decision of the Bundesbank not to reduce either of the key lending rates at
its regular meeting. It held fire and announced that its next two-week
tender would be set at 6 1/4 per cent, a cut of four basis points from the
lowest rate of 6.29 per cent in this week's pact.
The German discount rate remains at 5 3/4 per cent and the Lombard emergency
financing rate at 6 3/4 per cent. The cut in the repo rate provided the cue
for the dollar's high for the day of DM1.7146, after a previous close of
DM1.7050. There was resistance to any rise above that level and it closed in
London at DM1.7110. In New York it finished at DM1.7133.
'That should set the floor for the time being,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon,
chief economist at Citibank, the US bank. 'Now the main speculation is about
a cut in French rates.' The French had been using currency strength to
rebuild their reserves, but it now appears that the franc was resilient
enough to weather a cut in French interest rates.
After a high of FFr3.4580 against the D-Mark, the French currency finished
in London at FFr3.4610, up from FFr3.4720.
The dollar drifted down after the Bundesbank's moves, reflecting the fact
that the Nafta decision had been well anticipated in the market. The release
of weekly US unemployment figures did not manage to boost the dollar any
more than the trade deal, although expectations of a reduction in German
interest rates next month and improving US economic data will keep
expectations about the US currency rosy.
The dollar's performance against the yen was not particularly affected by
the Nafta outcome. Although the currency was helped by the news, dealers
waited to see what Mr Clinton would say to the Japanese prime minister.
Today, Mr Clinton meets Asia-Pacific economic forum leaders to discuss the
lifting of trade barriers and reduction of surpluses with Japan and China.
His success with Nafta could help to accelerate a trade agreement with
Japan. As Japan holds a Dollars 50bn trade surplus with Washington, any
success in these talks should help the dollar against the yen.
In London, the release of a mixed bag of economic data in the form of a
sharp fall in unemployment and weak credit figures left sterling generally
firm. Against the D-Mark, the pound benefited from the Bundesbank's decision
to cut the repurchase rate, closing at DM2.5275 after a previous DM2.5175.
Sterling was unchanged against the dollar at Dollars 1.4770.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Bundesbank holds fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S key economic releases and speculation about interest rate moves
at the UK Budget time drove the money market yesterday, writes Rachel
Johnson.
After Wednesday's encouragingly low inflation numbers, those hoping for an
interest rate cut in the Budget on November 30 took strength in the money
supply figures - which showed weak demand for credit across both the
personal and corporate sectors.
At its regular fortnightly council meeting, the Bundes-bank did not change
either its Lombard or discount rates but did pare another four basis points
off the repo rate. Next week's two-week rate will be fixed at 6.25 per cent.
This prompted some speculation in Paris of a 15 to 20 basis points trim in
the French intervention rate over coming weeks - possibly ahead of an
official cut in German rates.
In London, however, the three-month interbank rate for sterling remained
unchanged at 5 1/2 per cent from the previous day's close. This rate
reflected mixed sentiment in the market following an unexpectedly sharp drop
in UK unemployment and well-founded caution about the chancellor's next
move. Short sterling was almost unaltered on the day - the March con-tract
closed steady at about 94.79.
'The latest figures have been conducive for a rate easing, but we have had
our fingers burnt predicting Kenneth Clarke before,' said one trader.
Also impelling caution were yesterday's labour market figures, which left
analysts wondering as to the real direction of the recovery after poor
retail sales figures earlier in the week.
The surprising 49,000 fall in unemployment last month to 2.85m suggests that
the jobless total is now on a downward trend - but the figures have been
erratic since the falls first started occurring in February.
The sterling yield curve still reflects expectation that the chancellor will
lower rates by  1/2 percentage point in the Budget and by the same amount in
April.
The Bank of England's operations were routine. It predicted a fairly large
liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.7bn (later revised upwards to Pounds 1.8bn)
in the morning, which it fully relieved during the day.
Elsewhere, the Central Bank of Norway cut its overnight lending rate to 6.75
per cent from 7 per cent.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kanowna Belle formally opened
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kanowna Belle, often described as the best gold find in Australia for ten
years - with resources of more than 4m troy ounces and an expected mine life
of more than 20 years - was formally opened yesterday by Mr Richard Court,
premier of Western Australia.
Located 18km north east of Kalgoorlie at the old Kanowna mining centre, the
mine is expected to produce 150,000 ounces of gold in its first year rising
to an annual 170,000 ounces once a refractory (difficult) ore processing
facility starts up towards the end of 1994. Joint venture partners, Delta
Gold and North Broken Hill Peko, spent ADollars 76m to bring the mine into
production after drilling pin-pointed the deposit, well away from old
workings, late in 1989.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sharp fall in world stocks may
boost sugar prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHORTFALL world sugar production against consumption is expected to
reach 1.58m tonnes for 1993-1994 - higher than previous forecasts - which
could lead to a run-up in sugar prices next year.
Sugar prices moved higher on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange
yesterday - in mid-morning's trading the March futures contract was 18 cents
higher at 10.36 cents a lb.
The deficit in the sugar crop is expected to cause a draw down in world raw
stocks of 2.18m tonnes (including a 600,000-tonne allowance for wastage)
according to a review of the sugar industry published by C. Czarnikow Sugar
Futures, the Londson broker. Czarnikow's previous review, published in
August, predicted a stock reduction of 1.8m tonnes.
World sugar output is forecast to reach 112.27m tonnes in the 1993 - 1994
season - a slight increase on last year's 111.77m tonnes. But consumption in
1994 is expected to rise to 113.86m tonnes from 112.3m in the previous year.
World stocks are still sufficient to meet demand following the record
production in 1991-1992. Mr Chris Pack at Czarnikow said: 'stocks are
disappearing out of the system. It's not becoming critical yet but it is
much closer in balance'.
Sugar prices have been buoyed in recent weeks by the prospect of tighter
supplies in the first half of next year. But the recovery in the African
crop which had been severely depleted by drought in the past two years looks
set to depress the market in the second half of next year.
Production problems in India are expected to lead to a crop not much above
last year's depressed level, according to Czarnikow, which has reduced its
production estimate by 270,000 tonnes to 11.69m, compared with 11.53m tonnes
in 1992-1993.
Mr Pack believes that India will have to be an active buyer of sugar next
year as domestic consumption continues to rise, and its demand could support
prices.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Prolonged drought delays sowing
of Greek winter wheat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK FARMERS have had to postpone sowing winter wheat this autumn, because
of a severe drought affecting much of the country. The first rainfall in six
months in Thessaly, the main grain-producing region, came last week but was
not enough to soften the ground for sowing.
Hard wheat output in Greece averages about 1.4m tonnes yearly, of which 80
per cent is exported. This year's crop amounted to only 900,000 tonnes, even
though farmers in drought-stricken districts resorted to irrigating the
wheat crop.
Soft wheat output fell to 900,000 tonnes, compared with 1.9m tonnes last
year. However, exports have not been affected as durum wheat reserves are
high after after a bumper harvest in 1992, amounting to 1.8m tonnes.
Production of maize, which relies on intensive irrigation to achieve
adequate yields, dropped by 25 per cent to about 1m tonnes this year.
'It's clear that after three dry winters in the past five years, reserves of
ground water are getting dangerously low,' said Mr Paris Diamandouros of
Diamandouros Brothers, a leading grain exporter.
Greece's main winter crops, olives and citrus, will also be affected by the
drought. The agriculture ministry's initial estimates suggest that yields
will be down by 20 and 25 per cent respectively, unless rainfall is heavy
over the next month.
The ministry has not yet calculated the cost of the drought, but independent
analysts reckon it will amount to at least Dollars 400m in lost production.
Citrus output could fall to about 800,000 tonnes, according to early
estimates from growers. Production of olive oil is not likely to exceed
220,000 tonnes this season, down from 280,000 tonnes last year.
While growers in western Greece, where rainfall has been close to normal
levels, forecast an average crop, production is forecast to drop sharply in
other olive-growing regions.
Among the worst-affected is the island of Mytilene, where output is forecast
at 6,000 tonnes, compared with with 30,000 tonnes in the 1992-93 season.
On Crete, a 25 per cent drop in precipitation this year, means that farmers
in mountainous districts, where trees cannot be irrigated, could lose most
of their crop. Mr Stelios Papadakis, whose olive trees are in the foothills
of Mount Ida, said: 'The fruit is so shrivelled, it may not be worth paying
the cost of picking this winter'.
However, olive oil prices, now about Dr750 (Dollars 3) a kilogram, are not
likely to not rise sharply. Some 80,000 tonnes of oil is being stored by
co-operatives around Greece, while local consumption of olive oil has been
declining at a rate of about 4 per cent a year, according to Elaiourgiki,
the state-controlled marketing co-operative.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US producers seek big CIS
aluminium cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US ALUMINIUM industry yesterday urged its government to negotiate an
immediate cut of 1.1m tonnes in Commonwealth of Independent States'
aluminium production and for CIS exports of the metal next year to be held
at a maximum of 500,000 tonnes.
This request was delivered ahead of multilateral negotiations in Washington
next month between some of the major aluminium-producing countries.
The US Aluminium Association said that during the past 16 months 700,000
tonnes of annual capacity had been curtailed in the US and 5,000 workers
laid off because of problems caused by a surge in CIS exports from 250,000
tonnes in 1989 to a projected 1.6m tonnes this year.
Mr Richard Holder, the chairman of the association, said that, because CIS
domestic demand was so weak, production cuts were 'the only feasible means'
of achieving export targets.
Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World Metals, said to be the
largest trader in CIS aluminium, claimed, however, that 'Russian production
has not increased, it has just been switched from domestic military
applications to export'.

Norske Shell, the Norwegian unit of the Royal/Dutch Shell group, said
yesterday that oil leaking from a storage tank on its NKr2bn Draugen
platform had ceased and that traces of oil seen at a joint on another tank
had disappeared, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The leak was discovered late on Sunday and production was halted for 36
hours. Norske Shell estimated the volume of oil leaked at less than 10 cu m
and said none had been seen on the surface. The tanks are being examined by
a camera on an remotely-operated vehicle.
'The authorities are being continuously updated on the results of the
investigations. These results are also sent to NC for investigation and use
in the efforts to determine the causes, effects and methods of sealing the
leakage source,' Shell said.

The GOLD price rose sharply in London but proved unable to better its recent
peak on Dollars 378.50 a troy ounce and closed at Dollars 377.25, up Dollars
5.25 on the day. Dealers said the rise was sparked off on New York's Comex
and then fuelled by London-based short-covering. 'We're seeing US fund and
trade demand, and London was a little short anyway and has had to cover,'
one explained. SILVER prices were similarly firmer, with cash metal climbing
15 cents to Dollars 4.68 an ounce after breaking through long-standing
resistance at Dollars 4.60. At the London Metal Exchange the NICKEL market's
failure to build on an early advance above Dollars 4,700 a tonne for three
months metal prompted selling back down to Dollars 4,640, a loss of Dollars
60 from Wednesday, although some late commission house buying cushioned the
fall. The London Commodity Exchange March COCOA futures price proved unable
to make further ground after edging to a new second position peak of Pounds
1,028 a tonne in the morning, although the rise did not attract substantial
producer selling, dealers said. The price closed at Pounds 1,019 a tonne,
down Pounds 2 on balance.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Newmont finds glittering prize
in Peru - A gold project that is attracting the interest of other foreign
miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of big-name international mining concerns is hard on the heels of
Denver-based Newmont Mining's hugely successful new gold venture in the
north-central Peruvian Andes. RTZ, Placer Dome, American Barrack and Genmin
are among the overseas companies reported to be eager to snap up similar
bargains among still-available concessions.
Minera Yanacocha poured its first gold on August 7 and is on target to repay
the Dollars 36.6m capital investment in a staggeringly short seven months.
Yanacocha is a joint venture between Newmont, the Peruvian mining group
Buenaventura and Mine Or of France, a subsidiary of BRGM. The World Bank's
International Finance Corporation came in at a late stage to take up 5 per
cent of the shareholding.
'Nowhere in the world have we seen ore like this,' says Mr Len Harris,
Newmont's general manager in Peru. 'And nowhere else have we received more
co-operation from a government.'
The disseminated low-grade deposit, some 45km from the Andean town of
Cajamarca, has been documented for well over a century. The original claim
was staked by Cedimin, a company formed by BRGM and Buenaventura. Newmont
entered into an exploration agreement with Cedimin in 1984 and has directed
operations ever since.
What has finally made exploitation of the Yanacocha deposit feasible is the
development of leaching techniques during the past decade. Newmont, now the
largest gold producer in the US, pioneered the process. Yanacocha is one of
Peru's earliest experiences of the technique, already widely used in
neighbouring Chile.
The ore at Yanacocha is exceptionally porous. After a little blasting it can
be scooped up by loaders and trucked straight to the leach-pads. There it is
simply flattened by bulldozers prior to leaching. No crushing is required,
which reduces costs considerably.
'It was always obvious that, technically, this was a marvellous deposit,'
says Mr Harris. 'Security has been Newmont's prime concern, but it's just
another risk in a risky business - and you resolve it by getting good people
to protect you.'
Now, in and around the site, a contract company provides probably the
tightest security ever seen in Peruvian mining. The ratio of guards to
workers is almost one to one.
Transport and air-freight of the end-product - dore bullion ingots
containing 60 per cent gold and 40 per cent silver - is handled by Johnson
Matthey, the UK-based refiner, which is purchasing all Yanacocha's present
output.
Newmont officials say output from the three mines in the Carachugo deposit,
where work is at present concentrated, should top 250,000 troy ounces next
year. That would almost double Peru's official gold output level, according
to Mr Daniel Hokama, the mines minister.
For 1995, prospects are even more glittering. Another deposit in the same
concession area as Carachugo, known as Maqui Maqui, 'looks to be a bigger
and higher grade orebody', says Mr Harris. Feasibility studies are now being
completed by Kilborn of Canada and it is hoped that the Newmont board will
give the go-ahead this month.
Carachugo's mineable reserves are reckoned to total 28.7m tonnes, giving the
deposit a life of between five and six years. Average gold content is 1.38
grams a tonne - high for the leaching technique. Newmont profitably leaches
gold with as little as 0.6 grams a tonne in its US mining operations.
Maqui Maqui could bump up total output from the Yanacocha concession to well
in excess of 6m tonnes, say Newmont officials. And there are still more
promising anomalies within the 25,000-hectare concession site.
Local groups have expressed fears of environmental damage from a possible
escape of the cyanide solution used to leach the ore. Newmont officials say,
however, that they are applying 'the same stringent precautions in Peru as
we would in the state of Nevada'.
All pipes carrying the cyanide solution from leach-pads to plant run through
plastic-coated channels; there are sophisticated monitoring devices to
detect leaks; a large pond has been built to catch overflow in case of
exceptionally heavy rainfall; and Dollars 250,000 has been spent on the
Canadian 'Inco' process to neutralise the cyanide solution to drinking water
standards if it ever became necessary to discharge the solution.
'We're doing more here than the law calls for,' says Mr Harris. 'That's
right - it's also good business.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago traders tired of being
early birds

OLD HABITS die hard. At the Chicago Board of Trade, where the opening bell
for grain futures had rung at 9.30am for 100 years, traders are having
trouble adjusting to starting work an hour earlier.
In response to a petition by disgruntled members, the exchange will on
November 30 hold a vote on whether to ditch the new schedule.
The CBoT moved to an 8.30am opening in July in an effort to position its
agricultural contracts more prominently in the European business day. The
action came after a membership vote in May of 583 to 347 in favour of the
plan.
While CBoT agricultural volume increased through the summer, traders say the
surge was due to midwestern floods and a drought in the south-east which
reduced maize and soyabean harvests. The extra hour of trading has done
little to boost European business, critics say, and they're tired of the
inconvenience.
The board of director's decision to put the issue to a membership vote for a
second time this year reflects the fragmented state of the exchange's
leadership. Mr Patrick Arbor, the chairman, strongly supports the earlier
hours, and believes they should be tested for a full year to see if they
improve exchange competitiveness.
Lumber futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange skidded yesterday despite
news on Wednesday that US housing starts had reached their highest level in
four years in October, and that the issue of housing permits, an indicator
of future building activity, was also on the increase.
Lumber prices for January delivery dropped as much as Dollars 10 per 1,000
thousand board-feet as traders reacted to weak prices in the underlying cash
markets. The futures contract, which peaked at Dollars 419.60 on November 9,
has retreated by nearly Dollars 50, in part because high prices have
discouraged wholesale buying at sawmills, and wood delivered against the
November futures contract has dumped cheaper supplies on the secondary
markets.
'The mills are trying to market lumber at a cash price of about Dollars 390,
while the secondary market is at Dollars 370,' said Mr Curt Cunningham, a
forest products analyst at Pacific Trading in Seattle. At Dollars 373, the
futures contract was indicating a cash price of about Dollars 362, he said.
Over the longer term, strong housing demand and sharply reduced timber
cutting would support prices, he added. 'I think you'll probably see futures
move to last year's price peaks or higher.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis face pressure for oil
production cut
</HEADLINE>

PRESSURE IS likely to grow on Saudi Arabia over the next few days to take
the lead in cutting oil production in order to underpin weak prices,
according to analysts.
Saudi Arabian officials have refused to comment on their stance at next
week's meeting in Vienna of oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, although one said 'price is an important key issue'.
But he warned that any action undertaken by Opec next week would have to
'deliver', adding: 'Any action which will not deliver will not be followed.'
In Tehran the Iranian news agency Irna reported that Opec ministers would
have to consider a 3 to 5 per cent cut in the 24.52m-barrels a day
production ceiling set in September.
Mr Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Associates in
Paris, predicted that Saudi participation in 'getting the volume down by
about 300,000 barrels a day would have a very strong effect on the markets'.
The Saudi official professed, however, to being 'baffled' by the market's
softness, which has persisted in recent weeks after an initial boost
following the September Opec accord.
He suggested that higher North Sea output and the arrival on the market of
Gulf crude pumped before the Opec meeting in Geneva at the end of September
were among the factors contributing to the price weakness.
'At the time when Opec is making every effort to decrease our production,
there has been a consistent increase by others,' said the official, pointing
out that Norway's output has risen in recent weeks and that Oman, also
outside Opec, last week announced record output levels of 800,000 b/d - a
50,000 b/d rise on last year's average.
The Saudi official flatly denied that the kingdom's decision to hold output
at 8m b/d under the September accord, while other states were permitted a
slight rise in production, signalled a return to being the cartel's swing
producer.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Profit-taking erodes early gains on
rate-cut optimism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RATE-CUT optimism and US congressional approval of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (Nafta) boosted European government bonds in the morning,
but prices eased back on afternoon profit-taking after the Bundesbank left
leading German interest rates unchanged.
While few had expected a cut in German key rates, many were slightly
disappointed by the Bundesbank's announcement of fixed-rate securities
repurchase agreements at 6.25 per cent for next week - 4 basis points below
this week's rate. The repo rate fell 9 basis points this week, fuelling talk
that the Bundesbank had adopted a more aggressive easing policy, and
yesterday's announcement damped hopes for further sharp repo rate easing in
the near term.
'They clearly wanted to signal that, while they will continue easing,
they're not stepping up the pace,' said a trader. Nevertheless, most traders
remain confident that the key discount and Lombard rates will be cut again
in December.
The December bund futures contract slipped off its day's high of 100.45 to
end at 100.22, down 0.04 point from Wednesday.
IN FRANCE there was some disappointment that the central bank left its 6.45
per cent intervention rate unchanged at its latest repo operation, but hopes
for easing in the next few weeks and the German repo ease kept prices
underpinned.
Switching into intermediate maturities from the long end caused the yield
spread between 10-year bonds and the higher-yielding 30-year bonds to widen
to some 73 basis points, from 69 basis points on Wednesday. OATs
outperformed bunds, with the 10-year French yield gap over Germany narrowing
to 14 basis points from 16 on Wednesday and 23 last week.
UK GILTS shed most of their early gains and closed slightly lower in line
with European and US bonds, but sentiment remained bullish following
unemployment and earnings data which were seen to confirm the picture of
non-inflationary economic recovery.
The long gilt future closed at 115 13/16 , down  1/32 from Wednesday.
AMONG Europe's high-yielders, Spain continued to outperform Italy, with the
10-year yield gap between the higher-yielding BTPs and their Spanish
counterparts widening to 85 basis points, from 53 basis points at the start
of the week.
Spanish bonds have been boosted by hopes for a successful completion of the
social pact talks as well as speculation on near-term rate cuts, while
Italian bonds are beset by jitters ahead of Sunday's municipal elections and
worries over the budget outlook.
But according to Mr Andrew Roberts, bond analyst at UBS, investors should
consider switching out of Spain into Italy. 'The spread has widened out so
much there could well be a correction next week,' which could bring the
yield gap back to some 70 basis points, he predicted.
NAFTA'S passage through the US Congress and the political reform bill's
passage through a plenary session of the diet pushed Japanese bonds about
1/2 point higher. The JGB futures contract rose 0.53 point to 114.45.
US Treasury prices fell across the board yesterday in the wake of bearish
jobless claims data and a stronger-than-expected regional economic report
from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  23/32 at
100 3/16 , yielding 6.226 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 17/32 , to yield 4.110 per cent.
Investors ignored Congressional approval of Nafta, and instead focused on
the latest data to point to accelerating economic growth. First, prices
ticked lower after the government announced that claims for state
unemployment insurance fell by 20,000 in the second week of November.
Both the short and long end of the market posted further losses later in the
day when the Philadelphia Fed said its index of local business activity
jumped from 15.4 in October to 22.4 in November. Trading was slow throughout
the day.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Two German states launch 30-year
Eurobonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long end of the D-Mark sector of the international bond market looked
yesterday in danger of becoming saturated as two more German states launched
30-year Eurobonds.
The states of North-Rhein-Westphalia (NRW) and Rheinland-Pfalz raised DM500m
and DM200m respectively through offerings priced to yield 71 or 72 basis
points over 10-year German government bonds.
The yield spreads on yesterday's offerings reflected the spread on
Baden-Wurttemberg's DM750m 30-year Eurobond issue which was launched earlier
this week and which kicked off the recent rush of long-dated bonds by German
states.
Some syndicate managers said that the yield spreads on yesterday's offerings
should have been around 80 basis points since demand for long-dated bonds
appeared to be slowing.
Goldman Sachs, the joint lead manager of NRW's offering, said that although
NRW had a notionally weaker rating of AA plus compared with
Baden-Wurttemberg's triple-A, the spread was justified by the fact that it
was Germany's most populous state and its name was well-known with
investors.
Issuance in the D-Mark sector is expected to remain brisk for the next week.
Japan's Export-Import Bank is believed to be seeking to raise at least
DM500m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. However, syndicate managers
said that it could be difficult for the borrower to achieve its funding
target of 10 basis points below dollar Libor.
Issuance in the Eurodollar sector remained buoyant yesterday as the Kingdom
of Sweden returned to the market with a Dollars 300m offering of three-year
Eurobonds.
Lead manager Paribas said that Sweden's bonds injected fresh supply into the
short end of the Eurodollar market where spreads had tightened dramatically
due to the dearth of new issues. GECC's bonds, for example, were now
yielding 10 basis points below US Treasuries which compared with a launch
spread of 10 basis points over US Treasuries.
There was also a spate of dollar floating-rate notes which appealed to
investors who believed US interest rates could start to rise in the new
year.
Two Argentine corporate borrowers are due to come to the Eurobond market in
the next few weeks. Gas Argentino, the holding company for 70 per cent of
the shares in the privatised MetroGas, is expected to raise Dollars 130m
through an offering of five-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which have a call option in the fourth year, also allow the
holders to participate in the profits of MetroGas. The bonds are likely to
be priced to yield around 350 basis points over US Treasuries. Chemical Bank
is arranging the offering.
Sociedad Comercial del Plata, a diversified Argentine company, is scheduled
to raise Dollars 80m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds, via
Paribas.

<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, has priced its
offering of 2.99m units in Union Miniere, its metals subsidiary, writes
Tracy Corrigan.
Each unit consists of one share and one warrant. The shares are priced at
BFr2,350. Each warrant entitles the holder to buy one share at a strike
price of BFr2,450 from November 26, 1993 to December 15 1994. The sale will
bring Societe Generale's stake down to 50.1 per cent. The parent company has
said it intends to remain a majority shareholder, and under the terms of the
offering is not allowed to sell more shares in the next year.
The offering is seen as a play on zinc prices and on the dollar/Belgian
franc rate, according to lead underwriter SG Warburg.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: CBoT may win trading space in
Dollars 26m land deal
</HEADLINE>

THE Chicago Board of Trade is close to clinching a Dollars 26m real estate
deal that would expand its trading space by 45,000 sq ft and alleviate the
severe overcrowding that has come with the exchange's record volume this
year.
'Construction of a new trading facility is the most crucial issue facing
this exchange,' said Mr Patrick Arbor after his board of directors approved
the plan.
'If I have one goal during my chairmanship, it is to get this plan passed,'
he said. A membership vote will be held on the plan in early January.
The deal calls for the exchange to purchase property just south of its La
Salle street office and trading complex and construct a new building that
would open on to the existing CBoT agricultural futures trading floor.
When complete, it would provide 75,000 sq ft of unobstructed trading space.
Outgoing chairman Mr William O'Connor proposed a similar plan for the same
piece of property a year ago. Members voted down that proposal because they
objected to fees proposed to finance the project.
Mr Arbor has had difficulty reviving the plan, but has apparently been aided
by this year's volume surge.
The CBoT surpassed its all-time record volume total of 154.2m contracts, set
in 1990, on November 10. Led by its Treasury bond and note futures
contracts, 1m contract days have become fairly routine, with five recorded
so far in November.
As of Tuesday, overall exchange volume had surged to 157.7m contracts.
Mr Arbor says he is confident the real estate deal can be financed through
existing exchange revenues, and that no special fees will be imposed on
members if the plan is approved.
The Chicago Board of Trade is investigating the market potential for futures
and options products based on prices of residential real estate.
The exchange said it will join with a real estate research firm, Case
Shiller Weiss, to explore trading derivatives on indices based on the
movement of single family home prices in the US.
Although the CBoT pioneered futures products based on pools of home
mortgages, there is currently no way to hedge price risks associated with
home ownership.
Mr Mark Shaels, a CBoT director, said: 'Single family homes are considered
the largest asset class in the US, far outdistancing the stock or bond
markets.'
The exchange believes that derivatives on metropolitan home price indices
could be used by mortgage writers, insurance companies, and real estate
developers for risk management, but that the project could meet resistance
from real estate professionals, who are not accustomed to using derivatives.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tough new players in video games
 -Michiyo Nakamoto watches Matsushita and Sony enter the field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Christmas season has traditionally been a time of plenty for Japan's
video games makers. But this year, the run up to the holiday is likely to
bring the industry less cheer than usual.
When Nintendo, the most successful video games maker, announced its business
results for the first half of the fiscal year yesterday, the figures showed
the first signs of slowdown from a company which has seen sales rise almost
continuously over 10 years. They confirmed a growing suspicion that Japan's
video games makers face a turning point in their fortunes that is being
brought about by a major change the industry faces.
While the squeeze on profits the industry is beginning to experience stems
directly from the economic downturn and the Japanese currency's strong
appreciation this year, it is also a sign of the tougher times Nintendo and
its chief competitor, Sega, are likely to encounter ahead.
In October, Matsushita, the consumer electronics group, made its debut in
the video games market amid much fanfare with the launch of a multimedia
video games machine developed by 3DO, the US start-up company in which
Matsushita has invested.
A few weeks later, Sony too announced that it would be launching a home use
video game system next year that would offer ultra high speed,
three-dimensional graphics.
For Nintendo and Sega, the intrusion of the two large consumer electronics
companies into the games market spells the end of a lucrative world where
demand seemed to rise endlessly and which had been virtually closed to
outside competition.
In the US, Dollars 6.4bn worth of games software was sold in 1992, or more
than the year's entire film box office revenues in the US, according to a
report by Barings Securities.
Japanese trade ministry statistics show that the video games market last
year grew 13 per cent in Japan to Y411bn (USDollars 3.8bn), while the
audio-visual market shrank 12 per cent to Y371bn.
With almost 90 per cent of the market, Nintendo has enjoyed monopoly
profits, with operating margins ranging between 25 to 30 per cent, compared
with average operating margins of 5 to 6 per cent in the consumer
electronics industry, says Mr Barry Dargan at SG Warburg Securities.
Given the spectacular growth and profits available in the video games
market, it was likely to be a matter of time before the consumer electronics
giants made a serious bid to divert some of those gains their way.
It is still too early to tell how successful Matsushita and Sony might be in
doing so.
However, the two electronics companies have a number of factors in their
favour which could make them formidable competitors.
The shift to next-generation games systems that is being brought about by
technology advancements means that the timing is right for newcomers to try
to stake a position in the market. With their strong brand names, Sony and
Matsushita can be expected to find easy acceptance among consumers.
The advances in technology are also moving games programmes closer to
Hollywood type entertainment, using full motion video footage and high
quality sound and to the world of interactive multimedia.
This is where Matsushita and Sony, with a wealth of entertainment material
in their film and record libraries, have an advantage over existing video
games makers. Matsushita's hugely successful film Jurassic Park is being
made into an interactive game while Sony will launch such a game based on
its movie Last Action Hero.
The consensus is that the biggest loser from the entry of Matsushita and
Sony into the video games market will be Nintendo.
Against the moves of the consumer electronics giants, Sega has formed a
number of alliances to ensure that it is well prepared for the changes that
the video games industry faces. It has joined hands with TCI, the cable
operator and Time Warner, the entertainment group, to provide video games on
cable TV and with AT&amp;T to provide video games down the telephone line.
Nintendo, however, being the most dominant player, not only has the most to
lose, the company has appeared surprisingly unmoved by the impending threat
to its dominance.
'We will go our own way,' says a Nintendo official who defends the decision
to stand behind its current generation machine for the time being by
pointing out that 'providing greater computing power does not necessarily
lead to more entertaining games'.
Nintendo is betting on a tie-up with Silicon Graphics, a leading US maker of
visual computing systems, to develop a more advanced machine than either
Sony's or Matsushita's for launch in 1995.
It also hopes its proven expertise in bringing hit programmes to the market
will help it stave off the competition. However, it is precisely in the area
of software that Nintendo faces the strongest competition from Matsushita
and Sony, both of which own Hollywood film and music studios.
As software moves relentlessly in the direction of full motion video using
footage from entertainment films, 'Nintendo may find itself left out in the
cold,' Mr Dargan says. It will either have to pay huge royalty fees for
entertainment software based on films or be relegated to the lower end of
the market, he believes.
Whatever the eventual outcome, as a host of makers line the shop shelves
with competing systems, the video games market next Christmas season will be
ringing to a more discordant tune.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Australis Media to acquire cable
TV group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE long-running saga over the development of a pay-TV industry in Australia
took a new twist when Australis Media, which was only floated on the
Australian Stock Exchange in September, said that it had agreed to purchase
Lenfest Group.
Lenfest, a US-based cable TV company, recently acquired New World
Telecommunications, provisional winner of the tender for Australia's B
satellite pay television licence.
Yesterday, Australis said it would issue new shares to fund the deal. It
added that it expected to complete the ADollars 117m (USDollars 77m) payment
for the B satellite TV licence as soon as regulatory approval was received.
Australis also said a further significant equity issue was envisaged to fund
the development of satellite television.
The Australian government's plans to auction off two pay-TV licences were
thrown into disarray when little-known companies put in high - and therefore
winning bids - but subsequently failed to deliver the funds promised.
However, Australis, which already operates microwave technology pay-TV
services, said it had held discussions with the Australian Broadcasting
Authority, the Trade Practices Commission, and the Minister for
Communications and that it expected the procedure for allocation of the B
licence to be straightforward.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sharp gains at Westpac and
National Australia Bank

FURTHER signs of the recovering fortunes of the Australian banking sector
were evident yesterday when Melbourne-based National Australia Bank, which
also owns the Clydesdale, Northern, and Yorkshire banks in the UK and the
National Irish Bank, and Sydney's Westpac reported strong profit growth in
the year to end-September.
NAB, viewed as one of the nation's strongest banks, said that profits after
tax, abnormal items and outside equity interests, jumped to ADollars 1.13bn
(USDollars 730m) from ADollars 675.1m. Westpac, meanwhile, made a net profit
of ADollars 39.2m, but this compared with a ADollars 1.56bn loss in the
previous year.
The sharply improved results follow news of a much better performance by
Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) earlier in the week, and bank shares -
which had already risen over the past few days - generally strengthened
again. NAB closed 2 cents higher at ADollars 12.88, and ANZ added 13 cents
to ADollars 4.80. Westpac, however, gave up 3 cents to close at ADollars
4.60.
NAB's domestically-based Australian bank business contributed ADollars
732.6m to group operating profit (before goodwill amortisation), a 15.2 per
cent increase on the previous year. The specific charge for bad and doubtful
debts here fell by 10.7 per cent to ADollars 335.3m, while non-accrual loans
stood at ADollars 890.1m, down by 36.4 per cent on the previous year and
representing 2.3 per cent of lending assets. NAB said that economic
conditions had been 'mixed' but that home loan activity and bill
acceptances, for business lending, had grown strongly.
In the UK and Ireland, operating profits overall increased by 61.1 per cent
to ADollars 292.8m - although Northern Bank saw a reduced contribution at
ADollars 31.4m, down from ADollars 63.8m. The improvement would have been
more marked but for a Dollars 98.8m charge for restructuring costs.
Non-accrual loans fell by a fifth, to ADollars 639.1m or 2.9 per cent of
lending assets.
The New Zealand banks contributed operating profits of ADollars 95.1m,
against ADollars 9m. This largely reflected a ADollars 80.3m contribution
from Bank of New Zealand, which was acquired last November.
Overall, the charge for bad and doubtful debts fell by 34 per cent, to
ADollars 604.2m, while the group's tier one capital ratio stood at 7.7 per
cent at the end of the year.
Mr Don Angus, managing director, cautioned that unless the world economy
picks up, growth in NAB's major regions would be subdued and competition
intense. However, analysts have speculated recently that the bank will use
its strong earnings performance to help fund acquisitions and diversify - it
recently indicated that it is looking to build up a life insurance operation
in the UK, for example.
Unlike NAB, Westpac continued to face significant abnormal items - ADollars
325.9m, against ADollars 351.3m in the previous year, including ADollars
226m for restructuring expenses. Profit ahead of these items and tax stood
at ADollars 548.1m.
Westpac also saw an improvement in the bad debt situation, although its
lending book remains much more troubled. The provision for bad and doubtful
debts was ADollars 1.29bn (ADollars 2.8bn) - of which ADollars 558m refered
to non-property related loans.
Looking ahead, Mr Robert Joss, Westpac's new chief executive, warned that
competition in the Australian market was likely to be intense and would put
pressure on net interest margins. Conditions in the commercial property
market would also be critical to the trend in bad and doubtful debt charges.

THE FORMER state-owned Bank of New Zealand, which was bought by the National
Australia Bank last year, yesterday announced a tax-paid profit of NZDollars
199.6m (USDollars 109.6m) for the 18 months to September 30. However, an
abnormal item of NZDollars 277.2m, relating to adjusting the BNZ's
accounting standards to match those of its new parent, led to a loss of
NZDollars 90.7m after abnormals and minority interests.
Operating costs were unusually high in the past six months as the National
Australia Bank's own branch network in New Zealand merged with the BNZ.
Total balance sheet assets at September 30 were NZDollars 18.9bn, a
reduction from NZDollars 20.7bn at March 31.
Before merging with the BNZ, the National Australia Bank NZ Ltd had recorded
a 53 per cent lift in operating profit after tax and extraordinary items to
NZDollars 18.9m in the 12 months to September 30.

AEGON, the Netherlands' second largest insurance company, said net profit in
the third quarter of 1993 rose by slightly more than 2 per cent to Fl 240m
(Dollars 126m) from the same period a year earlier, writes Ronald van de
Krol in Amsterdam.
The figures took net profit for the first nine months of the year to Fl
737m, an improvement of 5.6 per cent.
The company remains optimistic for the rest of 1993, and has maintained its
previous forecast that operating profit per share will show a modest rise
for the full year.
For the first nine months, operating profit per share was up 6.6 per cent to
Fl 6.15.
Overall, operating profit for the nine months rose by 9.3 per cent to Fl
624.4m, on turnover up 14.4 per cent at Fl 13.1bn.
Realised gains on investments in shares and property fell to Fl 112.4m for
the nine months from Fl 127m a year earlier.

<TEXT>
ORIX, the leading Japanese leasing company, saw a sharp plunge in parent
pre-tax profits due to the prolonged economic slump, but managed to prop up
after-tax profits thanks to proceeds from stock sales, writes Emiko
Terazono.
Pre-tax profits for the first six months to September fell 53.3 per cent to
Y3.2bn on a 4.9 per cent decline in revenue to Y309.8bn. After-tax profits
increased by 1.1 per cent to Y2.5bn.
Operating profits fell 14.3 per cent to Y8.1bn, and the company posted
special profits of Y1.5bn due to sales of its stock holdings.
For the full year to March, Orix expects a 5.3 per cent fall in revenue to
Y620bn, but foresees a decline in its interest burden and projects a 89 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits to Y9.8bn.

<TEXT>
YAMAHA Motor, a leading Japanese motorcycle maker, posted a sharp downturn
in interim earnings due to heavy foreign exchange losses following the
appreciation of the yen against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono.
The company said non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first half to
September fell 39.7 per cent to Y1.5bn (Dollars 13.9m) due to a Y12bn
currency loss. Half-year sales eased 0.5 per cent to Y223.6bn, while
after-tax profits plunged 37 per cent to Y780m.
Domestic sales fell 6.2 per cent to Y86.5bn while exports gained 3.8 per
cent to Y137.1bn thanks to brisk demand from China.
Sales of mainline motorcycles fell 0.7 per cent to Y107.8bn.
For the full year to March, Yamaha expects unconsolidated pre-tax profits to
fall 29.6 per cent to Y3.5bn on a 4.5 per cent decline in sales to Y450bn.

THE PROPOSED ADollars 100m (USDollars 66.7m) sale by Foster's Brewing Group
of a 45 per cent interest in Australia Meat Holdings, the nation's largest
beef producer, to ConAgra, the US food group, may face delays in gaining
government approvals.
In the federal parliament yesterday, Mr Ron Boswell, Queensland National
Party senator, asked if a decision by the Foreign Investment Review Board
could be delayed for up to a week to take into account a broader range of
submissions.
Local cattlemen have urged a delay, amid talk that the new Farmers
Investment Trust may bid for at least part of AMH. ConAgra stands to win 90
per cent of AMH.

AUSTRALIAN National Industries, the heavy engineering group which owns
Britain's Aurora group, yesterday announced that after-tax operating profits
rose by 5.7 per cent to ADollars 12.6m (USDollars 8.4m) in the three months
to end-September, the first quarter of its current financial year. Revenues
rose by 11.7 per cent to ADollars 345.3m.
But the company warned that, while the Australian operations showed an
improved performance, activity in the UK remained flat. 'Aurora's activity
remains depressed,' it said, 'with no sign of sustained recovery. Margins
continue to be under pressure as the group moves away from . . . defence and
aerospace.'
The upturn in profits, said the company, could be attributed to its
distribution operations - Steelmark-Eagle and Globe - and the service
businesses, which include Coates Hire and Container Care International.
The environmental engineering operations also contributed profitably.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bleak outlook for Japan's top
five trading houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE steep downturn in Japanese business activity and the surge of the yen's
value against the world's leading currencies took their toll on the results
of the country's five large trading houses in the first half of the year.
The trading houses, which depend on the flow of goods and services for a
large proportion of their earnings, were directly impacted by the slowdown
in activity among Japanese corporations as well as in third country trade.
At the same time, a favourable interest rate environment in which interest
expenses came down faster than interest income, helped many houses to
improve their financial balance.
Many trading houses have also liquidated unprofitable subsidiaries and
cancelled tokkin, or specified money trusts, and fund trusts in a bid to
minimise their losses on these instruments.
While the losses were in many cases offset by selling equity holdings or
real estate assets, the need to provide for falling asset prices and loan
losses as well led some, such as Mitsubishi, to post extraordinary losses.
The business slump hurt revenues, in particular from trading activities in
machinery, chemicals, energy and textiles.
The strength of the yen also had a substantial impact on the overseas
earnings of the trading houses, which are active traders in commodities and
other markets overseas. Mitsubishi said that the yen's rise had depressed
trading transactions by about Y600bn.
Uniquely, however, Mitsui was able to benefit from dealing in the domestic
market in non-ferrous metals which increased its revenues from domestic
activity by 14 per cent.
On the positive side, the falling interest rate environment worked in favour
of the trading houses, which derive considerable income from interest on
trade finance activities, loans made to companies and a range of financial
investments but also bear a heavy burden on borrowings made to finance their
investments.
Marubeni, for example, was able to increase pre-tax profits by 35 per cent
even though operating profits more than halved, as a result of a
significantly improved non-operating balance. While operating profits were a
modest Y6.6bn compared with Y13.5bn last year, Marubeni's non-operating
balance amounted to Y14.1bn against Y1.9bn previously, taking pre-tax
profits to Y20.6, against Y15.3bn.
But the outlook for the houses remains bleak as recovery is not expected
until the latter part of next year.

<TEXT>
TORAY Industries, Japan's leading synthetic fibre maker, saw a decline in
profits for the first half due to the higher yen, low industrial demand, and
the prolonged slump in consumer spending.
Non-consolidated pre-tax profits fell 18.9 per cent to Y20.3bn (Dollars
189.7m) while sales declined 7 per cent to Y275.9bn. After-tax profits fell
13.9 per cent to Y11bn.
Toray said it had cut Y10.8bn in costs during the first half through curbing
material costs. However, pre-tax profits were hurt by the yen's sharp rise
against the dollar, which eroded its export value by Y15.5bn.
Sales of fibres and textiles fell 13.8 per cent to Y143bn due to declines in
consumer spending and lower demand from the auto, construction and fishing
industries. Plastics and chemical sales fell 6.2 per cent to Y85.1bn.
However, new businesses, including pharmaceuticals, electronics information
equipment and construction materials saw firm sales.
For the 12 months to March, Toray revised down its earlier projections, and
now expects pre-tax profits to fall 17 per cent to Y40bn on a 5.1 per cent
drop in sales to Y550bn.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Merck role for Medco chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, the US's largest pharmaceuticals group,
said he planned to push through a rapid integration of Medco Containment
Services, the drugs distribution company which Merck is buying for Dollars
6bn.
He also outlined a role at Merck for Mr Martin Wygod, the Medco chairman,
which suggested that he will play a central position in the enlarged group.
Mr Vagelos' comments came as Medco shareholders voted in favour of the
takeover by Merck, completing the first large-scale combination of a drugs
manufacturer and distributor which has rocked the rest of the US drugs
industry.
At a Medco shareholders' meeting, Mr Vagelos refused to detail plans for
integrating the two company's oper - ations.
But he said: 'I can assure you the two companies are linking their major
elements very rapidly.'
Mr Vagelos' comments indicated that, rather than operate as a separate
distribution subsidiary of Merck, Medco will play a role in collecting
information on the usage and benefits of drugs and help to shape Merck's
drug development.
The Merck chairman added that he would work closely with Mr Wygod - who
built Medco into the US's biggest drugs distributor - to bridge the gap
between Merck's research and development laboratories and the patients who
use its drugs.
He added that Mr Wygod will play a key role in the group, adding to
speculation that the Medco chairman could be in the running to succeed Mr
Vagelos when he retires next year.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: State forces GM to call off sale
of Allison division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors yesterday called off the sale of its Allison Transmission
division in the wake of a legal challenge from the US Justice Department. It
also issued an angry rebuke to the Clinton administration's approach to
competition policy.
GM and ZF Friedrichschafen, the German company which had been in talks to
buy Allison, said the administration's move to block the deal had come after
18 months of talks between the two parties, and marked 'an excessively long
period of arduous government deliberation'.
Mr William Hoglund, executive vice-president of GM, and Mr Klaus Bleyer,
chief executive of the German company, said in joint statement: 'In our
opinion, the government took a very narrow view of competition in the market
and one that does not reflect commercial reality.'
The decision by Mrs Anne Bingaman, head of the anti-trust division, to file
a civil suit to block the deal marked one of the earliest signals of the
Clinton administration's intention of taking a tougher line than its
predecessor on competition policy.
Other recent Justice Department actions have also indicated a more stringent
approach to enforcement of anti-trust laws, though not a change in policy.
Mrs Bingaman had said the Allison sale would have seriously reduced
competition for automatic transmissions for buses and trucks.
The new entity would have had 78 per cent of the Dollars 50m market for
transit bus transmissions in the US, the department said.
Mrs Bingaman added that the department would focus increasingly on
protecting competition in technology.
Mr Hoglund of GM said the decision to take Allison off the market would
enable the division 'to develop a plan which will make it a successful
entity in the marketplace'.
The planned disposal had been part of GM's strategy of selling off
operations where it did not believe it could compete effectively. It was
part of the move to return its North American automotive operations to
profit.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pennzoil unloads further Dollars
720m in Chevron shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENNZOIL yesterday dumped more than Dollars 720m of its shares in rival US
oil group Chevron on to the stock market, further unwinding the near-10 per
cent stake it built up in 1989.
The sale of about 8.2m shares, representing almost 2.5 per cent of Chevron's
stock, prompted a sharp fall in its share price. They were sold at Dollars
89 each, pushing the market price down from Dollars 93 at Wednesday's close
to as low as Dollars 88 3/8 at one stage. Pennzoil said it would show a
Dollars 171m profit from the sale.
The company built its stake with more than Dollars 2bn of the Dollars 3bn it
received from Texaco in a settlement in 1988. The payment was made after a
Texas jury found against Texaco for acquiring Gulf Oil after Pennzoil had
already agreed to buy more than half the company.
Yesterday's sale is the latest in a series of disposals. A year ago,
Pennzoil swapped a block of shares representing 5 per cent of Chevron for a
number of the company's US oil and gas properties. It still holds 9m shares,
or 2.8 per cent of Chevron, and has issued bonds which are convertible into
these shares.
The sale follows a year-long run-up in Chevron's shares, which went as high
as Dollars 98 3/4 .

<TEXT>
LVMH, the French luxury goods group, has agreed to sell its Roc beauty
products subsidiary to Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US health care products group.
The French company yesterday refused to disclose the value of the sale, but
industry analysts said it was likely to be at least Dollars 150m. Last year,
Roc reported sales of about FFr677m (Dollars 114.5m) and net profits of
about FFr20m.
The sale of Roc, which makes products ranging from shampoo to skin cream and
lipstick, is part of LVMH's strategy of focusing on core brands and
businesses.
'We want to concentrate our efforts on perfume and beauty products, relying
on our Christian Dior, Givenchy and Kenzo brands,' the company said.
Roc's products are sold through pharmacies in more than 50 countries. LVMH
said the distribution channels for Roc's products were different from those
of other beauty goods, which was another reason for the sale.
The disposal of Roc comes as the group is working on plans to reorganise its
champagne interests.
LVMH, which suffered a loss of FFr100m from its champagne activities in the
first half of the year, denied reports in the French press that it was
considering the sale of it Pommery champagne house. However, it is expected
to place its Moet et Chandon and Veuve Clicquot houses under a single
management structure.
The reorganised champagne business is expected to be headed by Mr Yves
Benard, chairman of Moet et Chandon.
The stock market welcomed the sale of Roc to Johnson &amp; Johnson. Shares in
LVMH rose about 3 per cent, to FFr3,761, as investors forecast that proceeds
from the sale would help reduce borrowings, which resulted in financial
charges of about FFr1.85bn last year.
Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, expects the state-owned
flag-carrier to report a loss of around FFr7bn for 1993, Reuter reports from
Paris.
Previous estimates from the airline pointed to a deficit of more than FFr5bn
this year. The revised forecast was given at a board meeting this week which
also approved the appointment of new managing director Mr Rodolphe Frantz.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Former Lehman head recruited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR J. Tomilson Hill, the former co-chairman of US securities house Lehman
Brothers, has joined the Blackstone Group, the Wall Street mergers and
acquisitions boutique.
Blackstone, founded in 1985 by two former Lehman executives, said Mr Hill
would sit on the investment committee for the firm's merchant banking fund,
and play a key role in the development of its financial services business.
Mr Hill's return to investment banking is timely: after years of inactivity,
the M&amp;A business in the US is enjoying an impressive revival. Companies in
important industries, such as telecommunications, entertainment, health care
and banking, have been engineering a host of lucrative mergers and
takeovers.
Blackstone said it had been seeking to recruit a top Wall Street investment
banker since one of its senior partners, Mr Roger Altman, left the firm last
year to become deputy Treasury secretary in President Clinton's
administration.
Mr Hill made his name at Shearson Lehman as an M&amp;A specialist during the
1980s, advising a roster of blue-chip clients that included Pillsbury, Time
Inc and RJR Reynolds. His success as head of mergers took him to the top of
the firm in 1990, when he was made co-chief executive with Mr Richard Fuld.
After the Shearson broking and asset management business was sold to
Primerica last year, however, Lehman was left with two leaders, which the
firm's parent, American Express, felt was one too many.
The result was Mr Fuld's appointment as sole head of Lehman, and Mr Hill's
abrupt departure from the firm he had joined in 1982.
Since leaving Lehman, Mr Hill has worked as fund-raiser and adviser to Mr
Rudolph Guiliani, the Republican politician elected the new mayor of New
York City this month.

CAMPBELL Soup, the US foods group, yesterday unveiled higher first-quarter
earnings as sluggish US grocery sales were offset by gains in its bakery and
international businesses, Reuters reports.
Net operating income rose to Dollars 166m from Dollars 152m. Last year,
Campbell recorded a Dollars 249m charge in the quarter from the cumulative
effect of accounting changes, resulting in a net loss for the period.
Sales advanced to Dollars 1.76bn in the recent quarter, against Dollars
1.69bn last time.
US sales for Campbell Soup declined 3 per cent, to Dollars 1.07bn from
Dollars 1.10bn a year earlier.

CREDITO Commerciale, a leading north Italian regional bank controlled by the
Sienna-based Monte dei Paschi group, may be taken over by a big northern
savings bank.
Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza, the public-sector savings bank
covering the two cities, has offered L6,400 a share for the 64 per cent
stake in Credito Commerciale held by Monte dei Paschi.
After an obligatory tender offer for the minorities, the deal is set to cost
the buyer about L435bn (Dollars 260.6m). The offer is almost three times
Credito Commerciale's suspension price of L2,340.
Credito Commerciale, which specialises in trade finance, had total deposits
of L5,494bn at the end of last year. However, earnings have plunged because
of heavy provisions. Net profits in 1992 were just L3bn, while its
first-half 1993 loss was about L50bn.
If the deal goes through, it will mark the second attempted consolidation of
Italy's patchwork of regional banks in a matter of weeks.
Earler this month, Banca Popolare di Verona, a listed regional bank,
launched a hostile bid for Modena's big Banco San Geminiano e San Prospero.
After being rejected by the Modena bank's board, the Verona bank this week
increased its offer by L20,000 to L200,000 a share.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nissan Iberica's shares
suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Nissan Motor Iberica, the majority-owned Spanish subsidiary of the
Japanese carmaker, were suspended yesterday on the Madrid stock exchange.
The suspension was at the request of the company, and followed sharp
fluctuations in the share price in recent days.
Shares in the company, which is 70.3 per cent-owned by Nissan, Japan's
second largest carmaker, closed on Wednesday at Pta147. The price has
slipped from a high for the year of Pta434 as the company's financial crisis
has deepened.
The company announced earlier this week it would be forced to undertake a
drastic financial restructuring, including the write-off of around
two-thirds of its share capital, which currently totals around Pta60bn
(Dollars 436m).
It is suffering heavy losses, forecast to total around Pta40bn for the full
year.
In the first nine months of the year, it plunged to a pre-tax loss of
Pta28.01bn, against a loss of Pta5.44bn in the same period a year ago.
Accumulated losses for 1992 and 1993 are expected to total around Pta54bn.
These were to be funded by writing off existing reserves of around Pta13bn,
and an equity write-off, it said earlier this week.

car marque

<TEXT>
THE LAMBORGHINI sports car group, an icon of Italy's business heritage, has
been sold for an undisclosed price to Indonesian buyers.
The deal is the latest in a series of transactions this year to provoke an
outcry in Italy. Gucci was one of the better-known names to have passed to
new owners abroad.
The Lamborghini deal, greeted cautiously by union leaders yesterday, is
slightly different. The sports car group, founded in the 1960s by Mr
Ferruccio Lamborghini, was already in foreign hands, after having been sold
in 1987 to Chrysler of the US for Dollars 25m.
The new buyer is Megatech, a Bermuda-based holding company believed to be
owned by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, a son of Indonesia's President Suharto,
and Mr Setiawan Djody. Mr Djody already owns 35 per cent of Vector
Aeromotive, a Californian sports car maker, with which Lamborghini may now
co-operate.
Based, like its arch-rival Ferrari, in the the northern Italian engineering
region of Emilia Romagna, Lamborghini is best-known for sleek,
exotically-named sports cars such as the Miura and the Diablo.
The latest deal marks the second disposal of a specialised sports-maker by a
mass-market manufacturer in a matter of months.
Earlier this year, General Motors sold Lotus, the UK-based car-maker, to
Italy's revived Bugatti company.
Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman, said he hoped the sale would 'give the
best opportunity for the future to the company and its workers'. Chrysler is
expected to continue to collaborate with Lamborghini on various projects.
Mr Djody, who controls Indonesia's Setdco group, said the deal would enable
'Lamborghini (to) build prestigious cars which will excite the world'.
The resolution of a legal dispute between Chrysler and Mr Lamborghini's son
is thought to have opened the way for the deal.

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
DONNA KARAN, the New York fashion house, has poured cold water on the
over-heated market for initial public offerings (IPOs) by suspending its
plans to go public.
The company, known for its upmarket collections of clothing and accessories,
blamed the delay on disappointing sales and operating earnings in the third
quarter, due to 'a soft retail environment'.
Ms Donna Karan, the designer who founded the company in 1986, said: 'We
don't feel that a public offering at this time would reflect the potential
value of the company.' The decision to delay the offering comes as investors
are especially keen to invest in IPOs by companies with high-profile
businesses.
Last week, Boston Chicken soared 143 per cent higher than its offering price
of Dollars 20 a share on the issue's first day of trading on the Nasdaq
over-the-counter market.
The Donna Karan issue of 11m shares, or 57 per cent of the company, had been
expected on the market this month. However, in an amended registration
statement filed in October with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company hinted that a snag might develop.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HORSHAM, the investment holding company controlled by Canadian entrepreneur
Mr Peter Munk, has raised USDollars 550m through a debenture issue as part
of its groundwork for a major acquisition.
Mr Munk has indicated for some time that Horsham was eager to add another
leg to its controlling interest in gold producer American Barrick, its 100
per cent stake in Clark Oil, a US mid-west refiner and marketer, and its
most recent foray into property development on the outskirts of Berlin,
Germany.
Barrick, whose most important asset is the Goldstrike mine in Nevada, has
also indicated an interest in broadening its horizons. It has become
increasingly active in gold exploration in Latin America, and is also
seeking opportunities in Asia, including China and Indonesia.
The debenture issue has been structured in a way which enables Horsham to
use its stake in American Barrick to raise relatively cheap funds.
The 25-year securities carry an interest rate of 3.25 per cent, but are
indexed to Barrick's share price. They are convertible into Barrick shares
or redeemable for cash after five years, at the option of the company.
Horsham will retain its 20 per cent interest in Barrick for the time being,
but it has deposited one-third of its 60m Barrick shares in trust in the
event that it decides to allow debenture-holders to convert into Barrick
stock.
The debentures have been bought by an underwriting group led by RBC Dominion
Securities. They will not be distributed in the US.
Horsham has up to now had no debt at the parent company level. It also has
cash reserves of over USDollars 200m.
One US analyst suggested yesterday that the diversification drive has been
accelerated by disappointment at the progress of the German property
venture, which involves the development of a 600-acre business park.

<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA BANK, the state controlled Norwegian bank, is to be pushed more
fully into the private sector with share issues which will raise between
NKr1.8bn and NKr2.2bn (Dollars 297m).
The bank was taken over by the state two years ago following massive losses.
It plans a private placement of 118m ordinary shares with institutional
investors abroad and in Norway and a domestic public issue of 27m shares.
The issues will go ahead in December.
CBK is the second biggest bank in Norway. Private shareholders, which hold
about 9 per cent of CBK's capital, will be entitled to shares sufficient to
maintain their respective stakes, but will be given no pre-emptive rights.
An NKr850m subordinated state loan is to be converted into 121m shares at
NKr7 each, conditional on the success of the issues, thus reducing the
state's stake to 69 per cent.
The state has agreed that it will not dispose of any of its CBK shares until
six months after the conversion.
The issues will boost CBK's capital adequacy to 11.7 per cent from 8.6 per
cent of risk-weighted assets. Core capital will be lifted to 5 per cent of
total capital from 3 per cent.

Pre-tax profits amounted to FFr1.03bn (Dollars 174m), compared with

European car and truck markets do not at present show any indication that a
recovery might materialise between now and the end of the year,' the company
said.
However, motor industry analysts said Renault was coping better with the
fall in demand than most of its rivals. 'Renault is still in profit,' said
one analyst. adding that the sharp fall was partly a reflection of the
record 1992 profits.
Renault made no comment yesterday about its merger plans with Volvo. But it
said that existing shareholdings in the Swedish group's car and truck
operations made a loss of FFr344m in the nine months compared with a deficit
of FFr478m last year.
Renault said despite the 15.4 per cent contraction in the European car
market in the nine months it had maintained its market share at 10.5 per
cent.
The nine-month results included exceptional charges of FFr728m, largely
comprising restructuring costs but not including charges relating to plans
to cut 1,423 jobs at RVI, the truck and bus operation.

VOLVO, the Swedish manufacturing group planning to merge its core car and
truck operations with France's Renault, yesterday reported a pre-tax profit
of SKr1.06bn (Dollars 128.8m) for the first nine months of 1993, surging
back to surplus from losses totalling SKr707m in the same period last year.
Virtually all of the profit was attributable to a SKr1.05bn bonus from a
change in accounting of tool costs made to bring Volvo into line with
international automotive industry practice.
But a halt to the trend of sliding car and truck sales, a boost from the
devaluation of the krona and efficiency gains helped produce a result ahead
of most analysts' forecasts.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said the full-year currency effect would be
about SKr1bn. He said the positive earnings trend was expected to continue
for the rest of 1993.
Group sales rose to SKr73.5bn from SKr58.8bn, while operating income swung
to a profit of SKr445 from a loss of SKr1.5bn.
This profit was inflated by SKr570m from the accounting change, but still
reflec-ted an improvement in operating income of SKr1.4bn.
Volvo said all divisions showed an operating profit. Car sales increased in
value by 25 per cent to SKr39.8bn, with unit sales increasing. The truck
division posted an operating profit of SKr183m, compared with a loss of
SKr586m last time, and increased unit sales by 2 per cent.
Volvo's share of Renault's income stemming from its cross-holdings in the
French group fell sharply to SKr321m from SKr1.02bn but its share of income
from Procordia, the pharmaceuticals and food group it jointly controls with
the Swedish government, grew to SKr1.52bn from SKr887m.

VOLVO yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to the car and truck merger with

The Swedish motor group said 'further clarification' was expected shortly
from Paris to help it overcome a shareholder revolt.
'It is our conviction that the transaction with Renault is industrially and

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nutricia seeks recall damages
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NUTRICIA, the Dutch food group, will go to court to seek damages from a
supplier of meat that allegedly contained traces of disinfectant, prompting
the recall of more than 1m jars of baby food this week.
The Dutch company also said it will be looking for a new meat supplier.
The meat company, Hillegerbergsche Vee-en-Vleeshandel of the Netherlands,
declined to comment on the pending law suit.
On Tuesday night, Nutricia announced the recall of some lines of its Olvarit
brand of baby food because Dutch inspectors had found traces of a
disinfectant widely used in cleaning slaughterhouses and meat processing
plants.
The recall sent Nutricia's shares tumbling by Fl 13.80 (Dollars 7.25) on
Wednesday, but yesterday they recouped some of these losses to close up Fl
1.30 at Fl 139.50.
The rebound was helped partly by news of a proposed two-for-one stock split.
This move is part of wider measures to simplify Nutricia's ownership
structure and to limit its defences against potential hostile takeover
attempts, in line with new rules on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
Nutricia will, for example, drop its priority shares and liquidate a
bourse-listed vehicle which owns 18.5 per cent of the company.
At the same time, a separate class of shares will be created for Nutricia's
main shareholder, the UK foods group Unigate, in order to preserve Unigate's
existing rights and privileges as a major investor.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bull chief to unveil restructure
plans today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEAN-MARIE Descarpentries, who took over as head of Groupe Bull last
month, will today announce plans to restructure the loss-making French
computer group with the aim of returning it to profit next year.
The plans, which will be announced to employees, include the creation of a
new top executive board, the establishment of new operating divisions and a
shift in strategy towards computer services. The aim is to prepare the group
for privatisation as quickly as possible.
The reforms face a tough challenge. The group lost FFr1.98bn (Dollars 335m)
in the first half of 1993 and required an injection of FFr7bn of capital
from the state, announced last month, to help cover accumulated losses since
1990.
Mr Bernard Pache, who was replaced by Mr Descarpentries, had targeted 1995
as the date for a return to profit.
The new group structure will comprise three service divisions and four
product divisions. The service divisions, seen as the principal area of
development, include systems integration, computer services and systems
operations. These involve the expansion of maintenance and support
activities for Bull's clients as well as for clients of other computer
manufacturers and the outsourcing of computer services.
The product divisions will include Bull's activities in the manufacture and
distribution of personal and mainframe computers. The group will also seek
to expand sales of software through new sales teams. The new divisions
involve a substantial restructuring of the company. There will no longer,
for example, be a central R&amp;D organisation.
The top management structure is also being reformed. Mr Descarpentries will
preside over a 10-member executive board. This will bring four new members
to the top management, while two existing members of the executive board are
expected to leave.

ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday unveiled pre-tax
profits of SKr569m (Dollars 69m) for the third quarter of 1993, a nine-fold
increase from SKr63m in the same 1992 period.
Surging sales and intensive cost-cutting lie behind the upturn, which drove
up profits for the first nine months to SKr1.86bn from SKr122m.
A strong improvement in the company's performance is expected in the final
three months, when the impact of the 25 per cent drop in the value of the
krona will be felt more strongly as hedging programmes expire.
The company expects its 1993 result will be 'somewhat more than double' last
year's SKr1.3bn level.
However, many analysts had been more bullish, looking for profits of around
SKr3.5bn, and they were disappointed by the company's cautious tone. The
group's B shares dipped SKr1 to SKr412.
Nine-month sales jumped 41 per cent to SKr42.4bn from SKr30.2bn, while
orders climbed 30 per cent to SKr49.2bn.
The weaker krona accounted for 10 per cent of the orders increase, and 20
per cent of the sales rise.

FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sony first-half profits drop 53%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SONY, the big Japanese consumer electronics group, suffered a 53 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits in the six months ended September in the face of
weak markets in Japan and Europe and a sharp appreciation of the yen.
The company's poor business performance in the half year is a clear
indication of the extent to which consumers in two of its major markets have
been holding back on purchases of electronic products in the face of the
uncertain economic outlook.
Sony saw a sharp downturn in sales of audio-visual products, particularly
camcorders and video equipment for professional use, which could not be
offset by a rise in sales of electronic devices and information equipment.
Among its markets, Japan and Europe were depressed but the US and south-east
Asia were relatively buoyant, Sony said.
Some 65 per cent of Sony's turnover arises outside Japan and as a result the
group made heavy weather of the yen's strong rise this year. Sales overall
declined by 11 per cent to Y852.6bn (Dollars 7.97bn), compared with Y959.2bn
in the same period last year.
The yen's strength was also reflected in a sharp 83 per cent fall in
operating profits to Y2bn from Y11.7bn previously. Sony said that the yen's
rise had the effect of wiping out about Y74bn in sales.
However, non-operating income helped lift profits to Y17.13bn at the pre-tax
level, which was down 53 per cent from Y36.63bn. Sony also had an
extraordinary gain of Y1.08bn from the sale of part of its holding in a
telecommunications company.
The group is not looking for any quick recovery in the trading environment
given the weak economic situation in Japan and Europe and currency
fluctuations.
It is forecasting a 30 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the full year
to Y32bn on sales down by 6 per cent to Y1,760bn.
The company plans to accelerate overseas production. It's capital spending
for the year will fall by 12 per cent to Y220bn.
On a consolidated basis, first half 1993-94 sales were Y938.4bn, down 9 per
cent. On the same basis, pre-tax profits were Y18.0bn, up 41 per cent from
Y12.8bn as a result of gains on foreign currency hedging.
Sony's US business was particularly buoyant and on a local currency basis,
sales of electronic consumer goods were up by 17 per cent, record sales rose
by 30 per cent and sales of films by 22 per cent.

<TEXT>
AEGIS, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media buying and
planning group, expects to complete its Pounds 60m refinancing package by
Monday.
Some 14 per cent of its open offer of 231m new shares, at 20p a share, was
taken up. Of the 68.2m preference shares, 7 per cent were taken up.
Last month the group announced a rescue package that will dilute
shareholders outside the company's core backers who underwrote the issue.
Their holdings will now be cut from 57 to 13 per cent.
The shares not taken up by qualifying shareholders will be subscribed by
Warburg Pincus, Omnicom, Electra Private Equity Partners, SFEC, and SCP
Lagoon in accordance with the underwriting arrangements.
After the refinancing, Warburg Pincus will increase its holding from 11 per
cent to 28 per cent of the fully diluted equity. Electra and Omnicom, the
US-based advertising group, become new shareholders with 7 and 13 per cent
respectively. SFEC's holding is reduced from 32 to 14 per cent.
A further 25 per cent of the ordinary shares will be held by former holders
of convertible shares. New share dealings are expected to begin on Monday.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Millwall's lossmaking run continues with
Pounds 1.1m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLWALL, the USM-quoted football company, yesterday continued its
lossmaking run with pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.09m for the 12 months to May
31. However, this marked a significant improvement over the comparable
deficit of Pounds 3.64m.
Millwall, which this year opened a new Pounds 15.5m stadium for its first
division team, blamed part of the loss on the last fall-out from its
ill-fated foray into the pubs business.
It attributed Pounds 300,000 of the loss to the difference between its
holding in Leisuretime Inns - previously named Tavern Leisure - and cash
realised on disposal. Millwall bought Tavern in 1990 for Pounds 10m, but the
chain proved a drain on resources.
Mr Reg Burr, chairman, was confident that the company, which has had an
unsettled time since its flotation in 1989, had seen the worst. 'We have now
turned the corner.'
Millwall was floated at 20p a share. Yesterday the shares stood at 3p, a
fall of  1/4 p on the day.
Turnover was Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 3.38m). On an FRS 3 basis, losses per
share were reduced from 4.47p to 0.68p. Again there was no dividend.
Profits on the transfer of players were little changed at Pounds 1.09m
(Pounds 1.07m).
The value of Millwall's assets are far in excess of its market
capitalisation, which stands at Pounds 9.35m, and persistent rumours have
run through the market of a potential bid.
But Mr Burr, whose company was earlier this year in failed preliminary talks
concerning a cash injection, said he had had no approaches.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Apartment sales help Regalian to cut losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGALIAN Properties yesterday announced losses sharply reduced from Pounds
21.5m to Pounds 869,000 for the six months to end-September
Mr David Goldstone, chairman, said the outcome showed that the group had
survived recession and turned the corner.
While the situation remained difficult on the commercial side, 'there is
just that slight buzz in the residential market,' he said.
The improvement was chiefly attributable to the sale of 16 out of 20
apartments at Kensington Palace Gardens, the luxury block near Kensington
Palace. Sales of the group's London portfolio had made dramatic progress, he
said, adding that only seven apartments were now left to sell.
The recently announced joint venture to convert Alembic House, on the south
bank of the Thames opposite the Houses of Parliament, from an office block
to residential apartments marked a turning point in the group's fortunes, he
suggested.
Net debt at the end of September was down to Pounds 21m, compared with
Pounds 64.5m at the end of March. Net interest payable fell from Pounds
4.68m to Pounds 1.92m. There were no provisions against the portfolio,
compared with Pounds 18.3m last time.
Total turnover rose to Pounds 50.5m compared with a previous Pounds 48.2m.
Losses per share were 0.74p, down from 16.22p. Net assets per share were
35.76p (36.51p).
The shares rose 2p to 23 1/2 p.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Travel agency sale lifts Hogg Robinson to
Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>

   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOGG ROBINSON, the business travel, financial services and transport group,
yesterday reported that the sale of its travel agency chain to Airtours last
June helped boost half-yearly profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 14.3m.
A strong performance from the remaining business travel division outweighed
lacklustre performances in financial services and transport.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 fell to Pounds 78.8m (Pounds
89.3m). Operating profit from continuing operations rose to Pounds 5.55m
(Pounds 5.47m). The interim dividend goes up to 2.75p (2.6p), payable from
earnings of 17.28p (9.35p) per share.
The pre-tax profit figure includes a Pounds 6.7m net book gain from the sale
of the travel chain. The result includes only a three-month contribution of
Pounds 1.2m from the chain, compared with a six month figure of Pounds 3.45m
last year.
Mr Brian Perry, chairman, said the business travel division now had 34 of
the leading 100 UK quoted companies as customers. Business travel operating
profits increased to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 900,000).
Operating profits at the financial services division were only marginally
ahead at Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 2.34m). The group said the division had
suffered as companies had deferred decisions on pensions while they awaited
the outcome of expected legislative changes. The prospect of change is,
however, expected to boost demand for short-term consultancy work.
Operating profits at the transport division fell to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds
3.17m). European trailer and port operations performed well, but air freight
suffered from low volumes and reduced margins.
The group added that it had experienced a marked lull in cargo movements to
the Falkland Islands, which had adversely affected yields on its regular
shipping services to the South Atlantic.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: US gas sales offset tax changes at Hardy
Oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUOYANCY of the US market for natural gas helped lift half year turnover
at Hardy Oil &amp; Gas, the independent exploration and production company, by
40 per cent to Pounds 29.5m in the half year to September 30, compared with
Pounds 21.1m.
However, the negative impact of recent UK tax changes resulted in after-tax
profits sinking by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 4.63m).
The company yesterday confirmed that the government's removal of tax
concessions for exploration activities in last March's Budget was affecting
short-term cash flow and earnings. Its Petroleum Revenue Tax credit in the
period was Pounds 1.69m, against Pounds 4.1m.
Mr Douglas Baker, chairman, said the change had 'adversely affected the
risk/reward ratio of exploration in the United Kingdom continental shelf'.
He added that Hardy would continue to explore in UK waters, but
'opportunities there will have to be more rigorously justified'.
The effect of the UK tax changes were partially offset by Hardy's strong
position in the US, which accounted for half of group operating profits,
which almost doubled to Pounds 6m (Pounds 3.2m). The US contribution was
Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 984,000), the result of higher volumes, stronger US gas
prices and positive foreign exchange movements.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.14m (Pounds 527,000). Earnings per share were
3.8p (5p).
Mr Baker noted that Hardy's high levels of gas production, accounting for
two thirds of current output, had reduced its vulnerability to low oil
prices. He predicted that Hardy would continue to benefit from rising gas
production in the US, where prices remained buoyant because of seasonal high
demand.
'The group's operating cash flow, even at current levels, should
substantially exceed that for last year,' he added.
The company also pointed to exploration successes in Canada and Pakistan as
positive factors for future growth.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Merchant Retail falls into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult trading conditions and losses on disposal of businesses left
Merchant Retail Group with pre-tax losses of Pounds 31,000 for the half year
to September 25, against profits of Pounds 467,000.
The company said trading was particularly difficult at Normans, the
supermarket chain in the south-west of England.
Despite good performances by the two recent openings, sales declined by 1
per cent and margins remained under pressure.
Sales at Joplings, the north-east of England department store chain, were up
3 per cent and margins had firmed slightly.
The Perfume Shop, where the number of branches had doubled to 18, showed
losses of Pounds 202,000 which was lower than budgeted. However, the
expansion was making the group more dependent on second half trading.
There were losses of Pounds 223,000 on the sale of Barnums and Town and
Country Manner.
The shares fell 3p to close at 12p.
Turnover was Pounds 80.3m (Pounds 81.2m) for operating profits of Pounds
1.08m (Pounds 1.31m). Interest charges were lower at Pounds 887,000 (Pounds
1.2m).
Losses per share were 0.15p (earnings 0.44p). The interim dividend is cut to
0.2p (0.35p).

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Barratt urges Budget caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LAWRIE Barratt yesterday joined the growing number of construction
company chiefs to appeal to the government not to damage the housing market
in the Budget.
Sir Lawrie, chairman of Barratt, one of Britain's best known housebuilders,
told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that speculation about
measures in the Budget had dented the confidence of potential purchasers
during the past two months.
Construction companies and building materials suppliers are concerned that
the chancellor may damage one of the few markets showing signs of recovery
by further reducing the rate of mortgage tax relief. This is already planned
to fall from 25 per cent to 20 per cent from next April.
Sir Lawrie said that any further reduction could undermine the modest
improvement in house sales achieved this year. He said that the company had
increased house sale by 25 per cent since July 1 compared with the
corresponding period.
Comparisons, however, were against a severely disrupted trading period last
year following sterling's withdrawal from the ERM and the re-introduction of
stamp duty on house purchases.
Nevertheless, the group expected to achieve its target of 5,750 houses in
the current financial year, Sir Lawrie said.
The housing market in the US was also improving. Sales since July 1 were 15
per cent higher than during the corresponding period last year. Mr Peter
Parkin, chairman of Raine, the housebuilder and contractor, also reported a
rise in new house sales compared with 'the exceptionally low levels of the
comparative period last year.'
Mr Parkin, speaking at the annual meeting, said the group had experienced
its 'traditional autumn surge in interest from potential home buyers' with
strong rises in visitor levels and net reservations.
The southern Californian market, unlike other parts of the US, was still
experiencing difficulties, said Mr Parkin.
He added that if the UK housing market remained buoyant, borrowings at the
end of the financial year would be only slightly higher than at end-June
this year.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ugland starts trading at 108p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Ugland International, formerly Bristol Channel Ship Repairers,
started trading yesterday at 108p.
The shares were suspended in August at 8p pending the reorganisation of the
company which was completed on Monday.
The 80m 10p BCSR shares were consolidated into 4m ordinary shares with a
nominal value of 20p and an effective worth of 160p.
The company is offering a further 19.96m shares through a rights issue at
100p. The new company will have 24m shares in issue and a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 26m.
The rights, underwritten by Nomura International, will raise almost Pounds
19m net of expenses. Just over Pounds 16m will be used to buy Ugland
Brothers, a ship management business, UB Shipping, which owns nine general
cargo vessels, and a deep sea car-carrying vessel.
Mr Andreas Ugland, chairman, and his family interests hold some 30 per cent
of the shares and are taking up their rights in full.
The board believes that the combination of the former BCSR repair operations
in Swansea and the Ugland businesses will 'provide the foundations for a
significant integrated international shipping group.'
Joint stockbrokers to the rights issue, which closes on December 8, are
Kleinwort Benson in the UK and Fondsfinans in Norway, where the company will
seek a listing next month.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional helps lift CE Heath to Pounds
14.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CE HEATH, the insurance broker, yesterday reported a jump in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 4.19m to Pounds 14.9m for the six months to September 30.
Exceptional items accounted for Pounds 7.96m of the improvement - a credit
of Pounds 3.25m contrasting with a loss of Pounds 4.71m last time - but
rising insurance rates and the strength of the US and Australian dollars
helped boost brokerage profits by 59 per cent to Pounds 5.8m.
Earnings per share amounted to 9p against losses of 0.2p. Before exceptional
items, earnings rose by 43 per cent to 10.9p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 5p.
'Underpinning these results has been the rigorous expense control exercise
commenced earlier this year,' said Mr Michael Kier, chairman. Brokerage
turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 56.6m and by 3 per cent in underlying
terms. Expenses rose by less than 1 per cent and investment income fell by
27 per cent on underlying trends.
Some Pounds 2.7m of the higher turnover was due to currency factors.
Underwriting profits, which stem from Heath's minority stake in HIH, the
Australian insurer, increased to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 4.2m). Heath reduced
its stake to 25 per cent in August with the profit from the sale producing
an exceptional item of Pounds 3.25m.
The run-off at CE Heath Underwriting &amp; Insurance produced a loss of Pounds
800,000. Computer services performed well with pre-tax profits increasing to
Pounds 2.1m, compared with Pounds 1.7m. Peterborough Software produced
profits of Pounds 1.7m on turnover of Pounds 14.3m.
COMMENT
Heath is making positive progress in increasing brokerage revenues and
reducing expenses and the group looks set to produce pre-tax profits of at
least Pounds 30m for the full year. That would put the share on a
prospective multiple of more than 17, which looks reasonable for the sector.
Despite yesterday's positive exceptional item, the markets have become
accustomed to unwelcome surprises on that front recently, this year's
provisions against Australian aviation reinsurance losses being the latest
example. Investors may need a little bit more time to be convinced that
there is no more bad news in store, a fact which probably explains
yesterday's unenthusiastic response from the markets with the shares closing
unchanged at 399p.

Profits at Brockhampton Holdings, parent of Portsmouth Water, advanced from
Pounds 1.87m to Pounds 3.43m pre-tax for the six months to September 30.
Turnover of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 11.8m) reflected an 8 per cent lift in
charges. Earnings rose to 30.5p (15.5p) and the interim dividend is boosted
to 3p (2.2p).
Profits benefited from a surplus on the disposal of a site at Bognor, a
temporary shortfall in the annual investment in mains renewals (which will
be rectified in the second half) and control of operating costs.
A weaker second half was expected, but the group still looked for a
'satisfactory outcome' for the year. The shares rose 15p to 408p.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn cuts interim deficit to
Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY LOWER provisions enabled Porter Chadburn, the packaging, consumer
products and specialist distributor, to cut its losses from Pounds 5.3m to
Pounds 1.4m pre-tax for the half year to October 1.
However, the directors said the group's performance over the period had been
poor with operating profits last time of Pounds 2.2m pre-exceptionals being
turned into losses of Pounds 62,000.
They are omitting the interim dividend (0.85p) and said the level of final
would depend on the full year results and trading prospects at that time.
The shares fell 3p to 15p.
Turnover declined to Pounds 66.3m (Pounds 67.4m). Exceptional charges,
mainly provisions for withdrawing from certain lossmaking operations,
accounted for Pounds 675,000 compared with Pounds 7m previously.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Clydesdale advances 51%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDESDALE BANK, the Scottish bank owned by National Australia Bank,
increased pre-tax profits by 51 per cent to a record Pounds 89.2m in the
year ended September 30.
Sir David Nickson, chairman, attributed the improvement on last year's
outcome of Pounds 59m to a combination of improved trading volume and
reduced costs.
Operating profit was Pounds 127.4m (Pounds 96.3m) before a record charge for
bad debts of Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 37.4m).
The charge, which the bank said reflected the depth of the recession,
represented 0.9 per cent of total lending assets and the trend improved in
the second half.
Sir David said pre-tax profits would have exceeded Pounds 100m but for a
Pounds 12.3m restructuring provision relating to expected redundancies in
connection with the project to centralise back-office processing in two
centres, and to the opening of a single centre for dealing with telephone
inquiries.
The project, announced in September, entails the loss of 1,400 jobs, mostly
in branches, and the creation of 600 new jobs.
Mr Charles Love, chief executive, said net interest income had risen by 10
per cent, despite the fall in base rates, while commissions and other income
had expanded by 11 per cent.
The bank's mortgage lending grew by 16 per cent.
The cost/income ratio fell from 64.6 per cent to 57 per cent before taking
account of restructuring costs.
Clydesdale said the fall was mainly because of the coming through of savings
from the restructuring of the headquarters operations from 1991, which had
also involved job losses.
Overheads before restructuring costs fell by 3 per cent, comprising a fall
in staff costs of 5 per cent and a reduction in other overheads of 1 per
cent.
Mr Love, a former senior TSB executive who took over last year, has brought
in a number of new senior staff, including Mr Peter Aslet, finance director,
who came from British Petroleum.
He said the trend of business in Scotland was 'more positive than negative'
but the Scottish economy would improve more slowly than that of the south of
England.
Total assets were down 3.3 per cent at Pounds 5.56bn, reflecting lower
treasury activity in money markets.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lucas dismisses pay rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE Simpson, who takes over as chief executive at Lucas Industries,
the international engineering group, next May, will be paid the market rate,
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and current chief executive, said yesterday.
Talking after a tranquil annual meeting in Solihull yesterday, Sir Anthony
dismissed as 'rubbish' widespread suggestions that Mr Simpson's remuneration
package is worth millions of pounds.
'We are worshippers of the market. We live by the market,' he said. This
suggests that Mr Simpson will receive pay at or around the level received by
Sir Anthony - Pounds 355,000 a year.
It will be topped up by a performance bonus, which on the basis of past
practice at Lucas, could amount to between 10 and 12.5 per cent of his
salary.
Mr Simpson will also receive a so far unspecified number of share options.
When Mr John Grant last year became finance director he received options on
808,080 shares at what now looks a low price of 99p a share.
Mr Simpson can expect more shares but at a higher price. Sir Anthony owns
660,000 shares and has options on a further 948,714.
Mr Simpson's arrival at Lucas presages further management changes. The group
is splitting up the post of chief executive and chairman, with Sir Anthony
staying temporarily as non-executive chairman. The handover, said Sir
Anthony, 'will take some thinking out', but he expects Mr Simpson to decide
the order in which he wants to take over responsibilities.
'I've a vested interest in it working well. I have money tied up in the
company,' Sir Anthony added, referring to his shareholdings. 'The
understanding is that I would see in the new chief executive and then the
nominations committee (of the board) would get to grips with the appointment
of a new non-executive chairman. I'd be surprised if that's not sorted out
by the end of next year,' he said.
Although Sir Anthony observed that 'it would be a rash promise to say there
will be no more changes,' Lucas now appears to be within reach of greater
management stability.
There were three finance directors in four years.
The first retired, the second, Mr David Hankinson, 'turned out not to be
right for the sort of organisation we found ourselves having to have two
years later,' said Sir Anthony.
The meeting heard that elections in relation to the enhanced scrip dividend
alternative had been received in respect of holdings totalling 668.5m
existing shares (about 94.3 per cent). BZW has received acceptances of its
cash offer in respect of 193.6m existing shares (27.32 per cent).

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Increased premiums aid Willis Corroon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER PREMIUM rates and the strength of the dollar helped Willis Corroon,
the insurance broker, increase pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds
70.1m for first nine months of 1993, against Pounds 60.9m.
Profits in the third quarter, excluding discontinued underwriting operations
in the UK, rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 8.9m.
Turnover for the nine months increased to Pounds 536.4m (Pounds 472.4m)
including Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 15.9m) from discontinued operations. Earnings
per share were 10.4p (9.9p) a fourth interim dividend of 1.65p is declared
for a total of 6.6p (13.2p).
Reflecting higher rates in the reinsurance market and in UK direct insurance
business, brokerage and fee revenue grew by 3.5 per cent in underlying
terms. Willis warned, however, that 'in the US market most premium rates,
other than those for highly exposed property risks, are still depressed by
competition'.
Foreign exchange rate movements and in particular the strength of the dollar
contributed Pounds 6.1m to profits, offseting a fall in investment income to
Pounds 39.9m (Pounds 41.9m).

Bank

<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE BANK, the National Australia Bank subsidiary, yesterday disclosed
doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 133.3m, against Pounds 66.6m, after
raising its share of personal sector lending, and current and savings
accounts.
The bank reported a pre-tax return on shareholders' funds of 44.5 per cent
(18.1 per cent) in the year to September 30. Almost all the increase in
pre-tax profits came from the halving of loan loss provisions to Pounds
68.3m (Pounds 133,9m).
Net interest income rose marginally to Pounds 275.8m (Pounds 273m) and other
oper-ating income rose to Pounds 106.7m (Pounds 99.7m). Operating expenses
rose to Pounds 182.9m (Pounds 174.1m).
The bank said it had achieved volume and market share growth in several
markets. New account volumes increased by 9 per cent to 475,000, and retail
credit balances rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 2.4bn.
In common with other banks it raised the number of residential mortgages,
advancing 1,400 loans, a 49 per cent increase on 1991-92. The bank has
opened an additional five branches in the south of England.
Mr David Knight, chief executive, said the bank had produced 'excellent
results' despite difficult economic conditions.

Gaelic Resources, the Dublin-based oil group, reported a reduced net deficit
of IPounds 537,472 (Pounds 507,528) for 1992 partly reflecting its review of
exploration operations and moves into other oil activities.
The group acquired Interoil - which holds marketing rights to Vis-Breaker,
an unproven oilfield engineering process to reduce heavy crude viscosity at
the wellhead - in April. Mr Ian Forrest, chairman, said testing should be
completed by the end of next year. 'If successful . . . the Vis-Breaker will
enjoy a major international market, bringing significant benefits from
direct sales and related licence fees.'
Losses per share were 0.39p.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: QMH action group demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of shareholders in Queens Moat Houses yesterday wrote to the chief
executive of the heavily-indebted hotels company demanding copies of the
controversial property valuations which show a difference of some Pounds
500m in its assets.
The letter comes just five days before the extraordinary meeting which was
called when the company's net assets had fallen to less than half the
called-up share capital.
It is widely expected, however, that the EGM will be adjourned until the
annual meeting on November 29.
QMH recently announced a loss of Pounds 1.04bn, the second largest deficit
in UK corporate history, and is in talks with bankers over refinancing its
Pounds 1.18bn debt.
Mr Denis Woodhams, the former hotel manager who launched the QMH shareholder
action group earlier this month, said yesterday that he was hoping to force
an adjournment of the AGM until the valuations had been examined by
independent bodies.
'If we get enough support to vote against the 1992 accounts, it has to be
adjourned,' Mr Woodhams said.
Mr Woodhams wrote to Mr Andrew Coppel, the recently-appointed chief
executive, on behalf of the action group requesting copies of the valuations
by Weatherall Green and Smith and Jones Lang Wooton.
He also requested details of any properties identified for disposal by the
new management.
QMH refused to comment on whether it would comply with Mr Woodhams'
requests. However, it is thought unlikely the information will be made
available.
Mr Coppel said yesterday he shared the action group's concerns to protect
shareholders. 'We are acting in all shareholders' interests, large and
small, in trying to achieve a recovery of this group. To that extent our
interests are aligned,' he said.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: British Gas Pounds 225m in red for third
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has blamed regulatory pressures, leading to a loss of market
share to independent competitors and price cuts to consumers, as the main
reason for a sharp deterioration in its third quarter performance.
The net loss for the quarter, the period of lowest demand for gas, was
Pounds 225m on an historical cost basis against Pounds 190m last year. The
loss was higher than most analysts expected and was evidence of 'the
declining profitability of the UK gas supply business arising from the
regulatory squeeze,' according to Mr Robert Evans, chairman.
Losses per share for the quarter were 5.2p (4.4p). The poor performance
dragged down net profits for the first nine months to Pounds 409m, against
Pounds 447m.
Historical cost operating profits in the UK gas supply business fell to
Pounds 515m in the nine months to the end of September, against Pounds 592m
last time. This was despite colder weather during the year and a small
increase in the volume of gas sold, mainly to low-margin power generation
customers.
Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers Council, yesterday warned that
continuing losses could lead to price rises for mainly residential customers
if the government implemented the recommendation of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission that British Gas' trading arm be divested from the gas
transportation division.
'These increasing losses carry a political health warning. If the government
wants to divest British Gas trading as a profitable business, gas bills for
18m voters will first need to go up by several percentage points on top of a
17.5 per cent VAT increase.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is considering the MMC
recommendations, and is expected to decide by the end of the year or early
1994 whether to implement them.
British Gas yesterday called for an early decision to enable the company to
make decisions on large investments. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director,
said large-scale capital spending would remain on hold until the government
announced what the company's future structure would be.
The latest results highlighted the growing competition in the gas industry,
with British Gas's share in the firm contract market, which supplies gas to
large industrial and commercial users, falling to 34 per cent. Increased
competition has also led to lower prices being charged for large users.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tight cost control helps Grampian to 7.7%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAMPIAN Television, the Aberdeen-based ITV company, lifted pre-tax profits
by 7.7 per cent in the six months to August 31.
Mr Calum MacLeod, chairman, said the rise reflected 'the continuing tight
control of costs supported by some improvement in the advertising market'.
Profits rose to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.44m) on turnover down at Pounds 9.87m
(Pounds 10.1m). With operating expenses lower at Pounds 8.16m (Pounds
8.87m), operating profits emerged at Pounds 1.71m (Pounds 1.19m). The
Channel 3 licence payment/exchequer levy was Pounds 360,000.
Earnings per share advanced to 7.39p (6.17p) from which a raised interim
dividend of 1.5p (1.1p) is declared. The directors said they wanted to
reduce the disparity between the interim and the final payments.
Mr MacLeod said the advertising improvement had limited the fall in revenue
from the loss of Channel 4 sales, and that Grampian had increased its share
of network advertising revenue. It recently moved from TVMM, Scottish
Television's joint venture with HTV, to the Time Exchange sales house.
Glenburnie, the property investment and development subsidiary, lifted its
profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 463,000 (Pounds 405,000) through higher
rental income.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Whitbread tops City hopes with Pounds 136m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD, the brewing, retailing and leisure group, surpassed City
expectations with a 13.4 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits
from Pounds 119.7m to Pounds 135.7m.
Sir Michael Angus, chairman, said the results for the six months to August
28 were achieved with 'very little assistance from any economic upturn.'
Profit growth at the trading level was also held back by an Pounds 8m
contribution to the group's pension fund - the first for four years - and
the disposal of 450 pubs.
Sir Michael added: 'This gives us confidence that we are in a strong
competitive position when growth returns to our markets.' The shares gained
19p to 519p.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 13.8m. Basic earnings
improved to 20.89p (17.47p) and the interim dividend is raised to 5p
(4.75p).
Operating profits declined from Pounds 149.2m to Pounds 146.1m on turnover
marginally ahead from Pounds 1.16bn to Pounds 1.19bn.
Whitbread Inns, the group's managed pubs, increased profits by 9 per cent to
Pounds 51.2m, before a pension charge of Pounds 2.1m, on turnover 5 per cent
higher at Pounds 275.2m.
The best results came from pubs focused on the sale of food, with the 200
Brewers Fayre outlets achieving an 18 per cent growth in turnover. Average
sales per pub grew 14 per cent in food, 6 per cent in drinks and 7 per cent
in amusement machine income.
Overall profits from Pub Partnerships, the leased estate, fell from Pounds
30.8m to Pounds 25.2m as the number of pubs was reduced by 450. The
restaurants and leisure division raised profits by 22 per cent to Pounds
28.6m before a pension charge of Pounds 1.7m. Turnover was ahead 6 per cent
at Pounds 536.5m.
Beefeater improved turnover by 7 per cent and profits by 10 per cent. Pizza
Hut increased market share with a 10 per cent growth in turnover; Thresher's
maintained trading profit on a 3 per cent increase in sales despite
increasing personal imports of alcohol.
A stronger performance from the group's hotels was led by the budget Travel
Inns with a 27 per cent increase in turnover. Profits from beer and other
drinks fell from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 41.9m after a pension charge of
Pounds 3.2m and a Pounds 1.3m lower contribution from Britvic.
Overall beer volumes declined 5 per cent. Market share was reduced 0.5 per
cent in the free pub trade where margins were maintained despite competitive
discounting. However, strong volume gains, led by Stella Artois and
Boddington's, gave the group market leadership in the take-home sector.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Losses at 600 rise to Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With no sign of a recovery in the European capital goods market, pre-tax
losses at 600 Group, the engineering equipment manufacturer, increased from
Pounds 240,000, adjusted for FRS 3, to Pounds 1.59m for the six months to
September 30.
Turnover fell to Pounds 44.9m (Pounds 49.4m). Prof Michael Wright, chairman,
said it was due to a downturn in the European machine tool market,
particularly in Germany, and a further deterioration in the construction
related mechanical handling market in the UK.
The shares fell 6p to 36p.
The result was helped by a Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 846,000) credit from the
actuarial valuation of its UK pension scheme.
Prof Wright said that despite significant progress in rationalising and
restructuring the results remained disappointing.
Losses per share were 3.8p (1.3p). The dividend is halved at 0.5p.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti deficit surges to Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EUGENE Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, warned shareholders yesterday that
the defence electronics group was 'trapped in a vicious downward spiral.'
His warning came as Ferranti, the subject of a 1p a share rescue offer by
GEC, announced a sharp rise in interim pre-tax losses from Pounds 10.9m to
Pounds 19.4m.
'Our ability to win new business and efficiently to deliver systems and
products to our customers have been severely damaged by the company's
extremely tight liquidity,' Mr Anderson said.
'This has led to a progressive deterioration of the company's financial
position, leaving the directors no choice but to recomment a rescue bid from
GEC. The only alternative would be to ask the banks to appoint a receiver.'
The deficit for the six months to September 30 was struck from turnover
which shrank 17 per cent to Pounds 91m (Pounds 109.4m), including Pounds
1.3m (Pounds 9.3m) from discontinued operations.
During the period Ferranti won Pounds 66.2m of new business compared to
Pounds 90.7m a year earlier. Accordingly, the order book fell from Pounds
246.1m to Pounds 164.8m.
At the operating level costs fell to Pounds 96.3m (Pounds 112.3m) as the
group shed another 1,000 jobs. However, the operating loss grew to Pounds
5.3m (Pounds 2.9m).
Non-operating costs jumped to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 2.7m) including Pounds
2.4m to cover surplus property costs in the UK and US, Pounds 1m in
reorganisation and rationalisation costs and a Pounds 6.7m provision to
cover two legal disputes.
The group's share of profits from the Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems joint
venture doubled to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 300,000), and interest costs fell
to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 5.6m).
The after-tax loss continued to widen and losses per share increased to 2.1p
(0.95p).
At the end of September Ferranti's net debt stood at Pounds 98.6m, up from
Pounds 74.1m a year earlier.
In addition Ferranti has contingent liabilities of Pounds 38.1m and owes
creditors Pounds 18.2m in overdue payments pushing its total exposure to
Pounds 154.9m.
Meanwhile, its balance sheet has continued to weaken with shareholders'
funds shrinking to Pounds 34.9m at the end of September from Pounds 62.2m a
year earlier.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wentworth quote at risk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USM quote of Wentworth International could be cancelled following the
result of its recent rights issue.
The plastic packaging products group has received acceptances for 234.5m of
the 380.5m new shares offered at 2 1/2 p on a 7-for-2 basis.
However, the acceptances include some 233.2m shares (about 61.3 per cent)
which Monceau Investments, an arm of Banque Indosuez, had irrevocably
undertaken to apply for. Attempts will be made to sell the balance in the
market at a premium to the rights issue price. The shares closed unchanged
at 1 1/2 p.
If no further buyers are secured by close of business today Monceau and
Banque Indosuez will hold 91.15 per cent of the enlarged issued capital.
Under Stock Exchange rules an insufficient proportion of the share capital
will be in public hands and the company's USM quote will have to be
cancelled. A further announcement will be made 'as soon as practicable'.
Wentworth reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 4.05m) for the year
to March 31.

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Serif calls for Pounds 4.9m and applies for
full listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIF, the USM-quoted specialist printing and packaging group, is raising
about Pounds 4.9m via a 2-for-1 rights issue of 49.5m shares at 11p.
The company said that without the rights its ability to trade would depend
on the support of its bankers, which might not be forthcoming.
The shares fell 2p to close at 16p.
Serif also announced yesterday that it had applied to join the Official
List.
The rights, which will triple the issued share capital, is fully
underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing. To improve the liquidity and
marketability of the shares the directors intend to apply for just 300,000
shares.
Serif, which reduced its pre-tax loss to Pounds 494,000 (Pounds 571,000) for
the half year to June 30, has undergone a reorganisation and rationalisation
programme during the last two years. Non-core activities have been disposed
of and there are now two operating divisions, Cowells based in Ipswich, and
Spottiswoode Ballantyne, based in Colchester.
Although the second half was likely to produce a further loss, directors
said that efforts to control costs and improve margins were continuing. The
current investment programme was largely completed and they felt the outlook
for the company was improving.

of Pounds 329,000 for the six months to the end of September, against

FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Confident RPC shows 11% advance to Pounds
4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS first results since flotation in May, RPC Group, the rigid plastic
packaging company, showed interim pre-tax profits at Pounds 4.24m, an
increase of 11.2 per cent over last time's Pounds 3.81m.
Mr Lindsay Mackinlay, chairman, said during the first half, to
end-September, RPC had traded 'in line with expectations at the time of
flotation'.
The group remained 'confident' about prospects for the second half.
Group sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 36.5m. Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive,
said all the rise represented volume growth.
This sector accounted for 11 per cent of the group's total turnover last
year, and first half volumes had fallen by 23 per cent.
However, this was offset by strength in other markets, such as a 40 per cent
rise in mineral water bottles.
Operating profits were ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 4.39m. Interest charges
rose from Pounds 108,000 to Pounds 154,000 since the company raised less in
the float than it needed to repay preference shares used in part to finance
its management buy-out in 1991.
Earnings per share were 5.4p, after a 28 per cent tax charge, the rate
expected for the year.
A maiden interim dividend of 1p is declared.

FT  19 NOV 93 / New blow to Merrett as Archer talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN is growing at Lloyd's about the broader implications for the
insurance market of problems at the troubled Merrett Group, after news
yesterday that a rival agency had withdrawn from rescue talks.
In a terse statement Archer Holdings, one of the largest agencies at
Lloyd's, said: 'Senior executives of the Merrett Group approached Archer
with a proposal that the management of the Merrett on-going syndicates
should be assumed by Archer group companies.'
However, after 'brief discussions the chief executive of the Merrett Group
was told on Tuesday that Archer was not interested in taking the discussion
further'.
It emerged earlier this week that Travelers, the US insurance company, had
withdrawn a plan designed to provide backing for Merrett syndicates. These
have been hit hard by a fall in support from Names - the individuals whose
assets have traditionally supported the market. Travelers would have
underwritten business alongside the Merrett syndicates on a so-called
'consortium' basis and also intended to take a stake in the underwriting
agency.
At Lloyd's particular concern centres on one of the largest syndicates,
number 418, which may have insufficient backing to continue underwriting
next year and other syndicates could also be forced to close, putting the
future of the Merrett Group's underwriting agency at risk.
'It would leave a big hole in the market,' said a spokesman for Lloyd's. The
Merrett syndicates led some of the most important international business at
Lloyd's, especially in areas such as US liability, war risks and aviation,
he said.
There are also worries about the cost to Names of the 'run off' (paying
claims on existing policies) of Merrett syndicates if these were forced to
leave their accounts for the 1991, 1992 and 1993 years open. Members' agents
 -which handle the affairs of Names - have channelled only about Pounds 60m
of capacity (capital supporting insurance underwriting) to 418, an amount
equal to about a third in 1993 of this year's level and well short of the
minimum needed to continue. Other Merrett syndicates have also suffered a
sharp fall in capacity.
Merrett had sought a deal with Archer in order to persuade members' agents
to offer more backing.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Sugar warns of weak demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, warned
yesterday that there was no evidence of any pre-Christmas spending boom in
Britain's high streets.
Amstrad's often outspoken chairman told shareholders at the group's annual
general meeting in London yesterday: 'Contrary to what you may hear from the
government, trading conditions are not very good; people just aren't
spending money.'
Earlier Amstrad had issued a statement to the stock exchange warning that
'trading conditions in October have been poorer than anticipated,
particularly in the UK where volumes and margins have been under pressure'.
The statement, which led to Amstrad's share price plunging by 10 3/4 p or 20
per cent to 43p, added that the company expected November and December to
reflect 'relatively weak demand'.
While Amstrad acknowledged that the outturn for the Christmas season 'still
remains unclear', the board warned that sales and margins were likely to be
below last year's levels.
As a result, Amstrad said that current market expectations for the group's
sales and operating profit for the year to June 1994 were likely to be
over-optimistic.
Mr Sugar said that Amstrad, which once dominated the personal computer
market in the UK, was now losing money on its remaining high street personal
computer sales and had seen margins on its satellite television equipment
business plunge.
Amstrad's first-half results have traditionally been dependent on the
strength of its October to December trading. Early indications of trading
conditions can give advance warning of likely profit performance.
After hitting a low of 20p last autumn, just before Mr Sugar attempted to
buy back the company with a 30p-a-share bid, Amstrad's share price has risen
sharply in recent months, buoyed by hopes of the economic recovery and the
company's mounting cash balances, which stood at Pounds 167.1m at the end of
June.
Yesterday Mr Sugar rejected suggestions from a small group of dissident
shareholders that Amstrad should increase its dividend and distribute some
of its cash reserves - which have fallen to Pounds 140.5m at the end of
October, reflecting seasonal factors - to shareholders.
Mr Sugar said the cash would probably be used make further acquisitions that
fell outside Amstrad's core consumer electronics business.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Hong Kong aids C&amp;W advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, reported a 30 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 509m on the back of strong
performance by Hong Kong Telecom.
International traffic from the colony was up 24 per cent on last year, with
a net addition of 80,000 exchange lines. Traffic with China increased by 32
per cent, representing nearly half of total international traffic.
C&amp;W's results, for the six months to September 30, were lifted by exchange
rate movements, without which pre-tax profits were up about 10 per cent.
Turnover advanced 34 per cent to Pounds 2.33bn, with Hong Kong Telecom - 57
per cent owned by C&amp;W - accounting for nearly half, as well as most of the
advance in profits.
Mercury, C&amp;W's UK subsidiary, increased turnover by 24 per cent to Pounds
701m (Pounds 567m).
C&amp;W claimed that demand for Mercury One-2-One, its cellular mobile joint
venture with US West launched in the London area in September, was
outstripping the availability of handsets. Lord Young of Graffham, chairman,
said Dixons, the electronics retailer, had wanted 20,000 to sell in the
Christmas period.
However, at Pounds 99m Mercury's operating profit was only 5 per cent ahead
of last year. Profits were depressed by the building of networks, including
One-2-One, the cost of launching Mercury's fixed-wire service into the
domestic market, a Pounds 5m contribution to the pension fund, and failure
to agree a inter-connect deal with BT, which will provide Mercury with a
rebate backdated to June 1992.
Lord Young said Mercury intended to pioneer a wireless local network,
linking existing 'fixed-wire' subscribers to its long-distance network. At
least two pilots are scheduled for next year. If successful, the initiative
could enable Mercury to by-pass BT entirely, intensifying UK competition.
Hong Kong Telecom will trial a video-on-demand service next year, which also
has implications for the UK market, where BT plans a video service.
Lord Young said China remained C&amp;W's medium-term priority.
Earnings per share rose to 11.1p (9p). An interim dividend of 2.6p per share
was declared, a 9 per cent increase on last year.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Storehouse surprises City with rebound to Pounds 11.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the retail group comprising BHS, Mothercare and Blazer, shrugged
off City fears that its recovery might be faltering as it unveiled interim
pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.6m compared with a Pounds 27.3m loss.
Both figures were distorted by exceptional items. Last year's was hit by a
Pounds 30.4m charge to cover losses on the sale of the Habitat and Richards
chains and this year's was depressed by a Pounds 6.4m provision from the
sale of the US Mothercare business.
Stripping out exceptionals, profits rose almost six-fold from Pounds 3.1m to
Pounds 18m.
The shares, which had fallen after rival group Burton announced
disappointing results last week, recovered 17p to 200p.
Sales in continuing businesses were up 5 per cent in the 28 weeks to October
9, with operating profits up 45 per cent. Storehouse expected a
'significant' increase in year-end profits.
But it warned consumer confidence remained 'delicate and easily disturbed'.
Mr Keith Edelman, chief executive, said: 'We are very concerned about the
possibility of VAT on children's clothing, which accounts for a quarter of
turnover.'
Gross margins have also fallen slightly, with the margin at BHS down almost
one percentage point as a result of a price promotion, and Mothercare's
margin down about one point after a repositioning on price.
Total group turnover fell from Pounds 617.4m to Pounds 484.9m, as last
year's figures included sales from Habitat and Richards.
Sales at BHS increased from Pounds 323.4m to Pounds 337.2m, and operating
profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 15.4m. Mr Edelman said BHS was
under-represented in many parts of the country and would step up its opening
programme.
Sales at Mothercare increased 6 per cent to Pounds 140.9m, with profits at
Pounds 2.1m, from Pounds 1.7m. Sales improved 6 per cent at Blazer, with
losses down slightly. Mr Edelman said One-Up, the discount format which has
replaced some of BHS's poorly-performing stores, had traded satisfactorily
in its first three months.
The interim dividend was unchanged at 2.5p, with earnings up to 1.4p,
against a 6.9p loss, after exceptionals. Mr Edelman hinted at a possible
dividend rise next year.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Volvo renews commitment to merger with Renault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO yesterday issued a strong restatement of its commitment to merge its
car and truck operations with state-owned Renault of France.
The Swedish motor group said 'further clarification' was expected shortly
from Paris to help it overcome a shareholder revolt.
'It is our conviction that the transaction with Renault is industrially and
commercially correct and should be implemented,' said Mr Soren Gyll, chief
executive, after a board meeting in Stockholm.
This was the first full board meeting at Volvo since the company was forced
to postpone a shareholder vote on the merger because of the strength of
opposition.
Swedish institutions have demanded that Volvo win stronger commitments from
the French government on the timetable for the privatisation of Renault and
on excluding Volvo from the terms of a golden share the state intends to
retain as a way of blocking any hostile takeover of the merged company.
Mr Gyll, who this week held talks with Mr Gerard Longuet, the French
industry minister, said discussions were under way 'to clarify the (merger)
terms'.
The French government has ruled out changing the terms of the merger
agreement but is considering issuing a clearer timetable for privatisation
and may be prepared to give written guarantees concerning the use of the
golden share.
Volvo officials made clear yesterday they would press ahead with the
rescheduled shareholders' meeting on December 7. The company believes it can
still win a clear majority for the deal.
Volvo this week brought in analysts and consultants it used in its own
assessment of the merger to impress on shareholders the bleak future facing
Volvo's car operations if it does not proceed with the Renault deal.
'Further substantial investments are required for Volvo, single-handedly, to
be able to achieve the profit levels that are demanded long-term in the
automotive industry,' Mr Gyll said.
Volvo, the prospective junior partner in the merger, showed a robust return
to profit in results for the first nine months, published yesterday. Renault
pre-tax profits fell steeply.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Predators get on their marks: Manoeuvres over ITV ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission has warned that if the UK government
liberalises the rules on ITV ownership, deal-making of 'scramble for Africa'
proportions could break out in the commercial broadcasting system.
The scramble could begin today. All the signs are that the government has
accepted the argument that there should be a measure of consolidation among
the 14 ITV companies and that the nine so-called 'large' ones should be able
to take each other over. By international standards most ITV companies are
tiny. For instance, HTV - with a market value of Pounds 58.5m - is defined
as a 'large' company under existing broadcasting legislation.
Protection for the regional interests of Scotland and Wales will mean that
HTV and Scottish are to be excluded from takeover by one of the big nine,
although they could be taken over by another EU company.
Limits will also be set to prevent too great a concentration of power in any
one pair of hands, in particular ensuring that no one company will be able
to own both the London weekday and the London weekend licence. This could be
done by specifying the licences that could be available for ITV takeover or
setting advertising market share limits.
At least half the ITV system is waiting nervously for the starting pistol to
be fired. Some are predators waiting to pounce, others are already flinching
from the expected attack.
However, if the new rules are drawn tightly, very little might happen. If,
for example, takeovers are banned that push combined advertising market
share over 25 per cent of total ITV revenues, neither Carlton Communications
nor Granada could acquire Central, and Carlton could probably not take over
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
If it is decided that no company can hold more than two licences,
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees would be safe from predators because the merged group
already holds two.
Under such a restrictive scenario the only certainty would be that Anglia
Television would be gobbled up by someone.
On the other hand, Mr Leslie Hill, chairman and chief executive of Central,
believes it would be 'quite farcical' if after so much debate, the
government decided to make little change.
To open the way for significant changes of ownership, the rules would have
to allow a single company to own two large licences plus one small one. It
would also have to set the market share limits at 25 per cent of all
conventional television advertising. By including the revenues of Channel 4
and GMTV, the breakfast company, all the large companies would be able to
take each other over, apart from the restrictions in London.
If, as seems likely, the Government has avoided going for the most
restrictive stance, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - which recently issued a profits
warning - could be the key to a multi-dimensional puzzle.
LWT, which in May bought 14 per cent of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, may decide that
its only chance of an independent future lies in carrying out a pre-emptive
strike on the Leeds-based company. The aim would be to buy two licences in
one swoop, thereby preventing any other ITV company mounting a takeover. The
hope would be that enough cost cuts could be made to cope with the Yorkshire
group's payments to the Treasury, which run at more than Pounds 1m a week.
However Granada, already the owner of 20 per cent of LWT, may also make a
pre-emptive move on the London station.
Mr Guy Lamming, an analyst at James Capel, foresees 'horrendous situations'
where companies launch takeovers financed by shares, while the value of the
paper keeps being driven upwards by bidding for the bidders. Ms Katherine
Pelly, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, believes the whole television sector
will rise because even 'ring-fenced' companies such as HTV can be taken over
by predators from outside ITV.
Granada and Carlton both have the financial muscle to be dominant players.
Granada would like either LWT or Central, and would rather have Yorkshire
than nothing. However, Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, is
understood to be reluctant to pay any more of a premium than has already
been injected into share prices by the pre-liberalisation leaks.
Carlton would obviously like to own Central, in which it already holds 20
per cent. Second prize would be Anglia. Central itself, which many analysts
see as undervalued, is planning acquisitions of its own, while even lowly
Anglia is not above a tilt at its big neighbour Central.
When the music stops, a form of chaos might reign with most of the major
players owning bits of each other and, rather like the game of Monopoly,
further swaps and rationalisation may be necessary.
ITC chairman Sir George Russell would have preferred a further period of
calm before the 'scramble for Africa' began. Given that this calm is now
unlikely - barring last minute changes of mind by politicians - Sir George,
it is believed, would like to see three or four dominant players emerge,
each taking a small ITV company under its wing.
One thing will not change, however. The ITC is determined to hold all the
owners of ITV licences to their programming obligations, and that will
impose limits on the savings that can be achieved through rationalisation.

FT  19 NOV 93 / OECD urges US rate rise to combat inflation: Government
likely to oppose further tightening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US should launch a 'pre-emptive strike' against inflation by raising
interest rates substantially over the next 12 months, officials at the
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development have urged.
The OECD believes the Federal Reserve should begin tightening monetary
policy before Christmas and raise short-term rates to almost 5 per cent by
the end of next year. The key federal funds rate has been 3 per cent,
abnormally low by historical standards, since September last year.
The call for higher rates came from senior officials who were in Washington
for the release of the latest OECD report on the US economy. The OECD has a
lower profile in the US than Europe and its call for rate rises is unlikely
to embarrass the Clinton administration. But its remarks come at a delicate
time for the Fed and financial markets.
There are signs that US economic growth is accelerating and US bond yields
recently moved back above 6 per cent on fears that a faster expansion would
put upward pressure on inflation. Fed policymakers met this week to consider
whether any adjustment of policy was required.
The White House and congressional leaders are likely to oppose a significant
tightening of monetary policy. They regard the recovery as sluggish and
worry about the lack of jobs. Such worries may increase in the new year when
a revised method of estimating unemployment could boost the official rate by
half a percentage point to over 7 per cent.
The OECD, however, believes an increase in US rates is needed to prevent a
resurgence of inflation in 1995 and 1996. Because monetary policy takes
effect only with a lag, much of the tightening needs to occur in the first
half of next year, while there is still some slack in the economy.
'The fundamental message we wish to transmit is that there will have to be a
tightening of non-trivial proportions,' an OECD official said.
The organisation regards the current level of short-term interest rates  -
roughly zero in real terms - as a highly stimulative policy that is 'clearly
unsustainable' in the medium-term. A neutral monetary policy would require
rates of 4.25 per cent or more, officials said.
Many US forecasters expect the Fed to begin tightening monetary policy next
year. Few expect - or recommend - as swift or as large an increase in rates
as the OECD.
If and when the Fed decides to raise US interest rates, the impact will be
felt globally. The dollar will probably rise sharply and the recent bull
market in bond and share markets might be sent into reverse.
The OECD report, which would have required the Clinton administration's
approval, uses more reserved language, arguing that 'an early monetary
tightening would be called for if inflation has indeed bottomed out'.
However, it predicts short-term rates will rise before the end of this year
and will average 4.5 per cent in the second half of next year.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Experts top up their pensions in time for the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE principle of following what the experts do and not what they say,
people should get their pension contributions up to date before the Budget
speech at the end of this month.
In anticipation of what they believe the chancellor will announce on
November 30, leading tax practitioners are accelerating pension payments -
and even taking out loans to do so.
Partners at the UK's largest accountancy firms, including Coopers &amp; Lybrand
and KPMG Peat Marwick, are being urged to top up their pensions before the
Budget statement. Price Waterhouse is considering similar action. Their
action reflects concern that the government has decided to remove tax relief
on pensions.
Mr Peter Wyman, a tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'We are
suggesting to partners that they think very seriously about getting up to
date before the Budget.'
The chancellor may remove upper-rate tax relief on pension contributions or
eliminate tax-free lump sums when a pension matures. A third and more likely
option - which would have a less immediately visible impact - would be to
impose capital gains tax or remove advance corporation tax relief on pension
funds.
As self-employed taxpayers, many partners in professional firms would
normally not pay their contributions for the last tax year until next April,
but may now try to pay both last year's and this year's before the end of
this month.
Mr Ian Barlow, a tax partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said yesterday: 'We are
certainly taking precautions.' He had urged corporate clients to do the
same.
The gamble is that if the chancellor does not remove tax concessions but
instead raises the rate of income tax, they will not be able to claim the
additional tax reliefs generated at this higher level of tax.
But Mr Wyman said that this option was unlikely, and that the additional
interest on accelerated contributions would in any case partially partly
compensate.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A crisis of confidence has shaken the Storehouse recovery story as the
market has fretted about September's warning of a slowdown in BHS's sales
growth and the latest disappointments at rival Burton. But Storehouse helped
soothe the doubters with its strong profits progress at the half-way stage.
Unlike Sears and Burton, shackled with tired old chains, Storehouse
yesterday showed there is life left in its BHS and Mothercare chains after
all. Ironically, its failure to exploit these businesses in the past has
left scope to expand them in future.
BHS plans to open 40 more sites and now has the financial muscle to fund its
ambitions. Mothercare is also growing better at peddling pushchairs to the
cooing classes. Yet its operating margins languish below 1.5 per cent and
can only head one way. That latent promise, though, will take longer to
fulfil than previously assumed. Pricing and margin pressures are
unrelenting, with the resurgent Marks and Spencer being beastly to others on
the high street. Moreover, it will prove far trickier for BHS to raise
profits by growing sales than by hacking at its distended cost base. The
remote threat that the chancellor may extend VAT to children's clothing
could further unsettle Storehouse in the short run.
Yet the management appears to have the measure of the challenge with
stability becoming its watchword. It would certainly help if the new finance
director, once found, did not disappear out the revolving door as fast as
the previous four have done.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Relief over Nafta's passage through Congress is not confined to the Clinton
Administration. Financial markets, too, have been spared a nasty shock, but
that does not give them much of an excuse to forge ahead as yesterday's Wall
Street reaction showed. Nafta will not change the perception that US equity
ratings are stretched or that bond prices are vulnerable to signs of
inflationary pressure. Indeed, given the existing trade agreement between
the US and Canada and the low average Mexican tariffs on US imports, Nafta
will do little to alter short run US growth expectations. Its main impact is
psychological. Inevitably, expectations for a successful Gatt deal will
grow. Ironically, though, Nafta - and regional trade policies generally -
were always seen in the US as an alternative to the Gatt. With such a
fall-back in place, the US Congress may have less incentive to accept a Gatt
agreement, which in any case depends heavily on an end to French
intransigence.
The big winner ought to be Mexico. The relative impact of Nafta on its
economy, which is only 5 per cent that of the US and Canada combined, will
be considerable. But Mexican equities had already risen sharply in the
run-up to the vote and the overvalued peso is a cloud on the horizon. As the
excitement wears off, there may be a temptation to sell on the good news
south of the Rio Grande too.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Whitbread
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One must beware of Whitbread's tendency to strip pension fund contributions
out of its margin calculations. Since the holiday appears over for good,
they will be a regular feature from now on. Even so, its interim results
show its focus on strong brands and retailing paying off handsomely. There
is evidence of organic growth to compensate for the failure to bag Chef &amp;
Brewer at a reasonable price, although that also increases the regret that
it missed out on the chance to apply its skills to such an enticing
opportunity.
For the time being, Whitbread should be buoyed by economic recovery, though,
again, it may be overstating the prospects in the southeast where some sales
must have been lost permanently to parallel imports. Sooner or later, more
strategic decisions loom. The stakes in big companies such as Grand
Metropolitan, which it is acquiring with the Whitbread Investment Company,
will clearly be sold. Such is the strength of its balance sheet that, were
it to sell the regional brewers as well, it would have virtually no net
debt.
The natural response might be for Whitbread to buy one of these regional
companies such as Boddington or Marston outright. But the purchase of WIC
was less a matter of strategic design than a bi-product of the decision
fully to enfranchise 'A' shareholders. Whitbread's true intentions remain
obscure. While it stays in brewing - which may be necessary to secure cask
ale brands - any addition to its pub estate will be complicated by
competition rules. Whitbread is adding to its network of budget hotels. It
may move more into leisure. Happily it need not hurry to decide.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of the dollar against sterling heavily flattered Cable &amp;
Wireless's profits in the first half. It also reinforced the importance of
Hong Kong Telecom, which is driving not only the company's p&amp;l, but also its
stock market valuation. The market value of C&amp;W's properties outside Hong
Kong is now at its lowest level for five years. That is a reflection not of
the poor prospects for Mercury and the Caribbean but of the overheated level
of the Hang Seng index.
C&amp;W is making efforts to diversify, the One-2-One cellular service in London
being the latest example. Yet effort over the past two years has been
directed at tidying up the balance sheet and staunching cash leakages. Now
that C&amp;W is more watertight, and has earned some credibility with the
market, it is well placed to take advantage of the opportunities in global
telecoms. Since it seems to have a hit with One-2-One, an accelerated roll
out might demonstrate that the company is not only capable of housekeeping,
but also of putting its full weight behind winners.
Perhaps C&amp;W has been circumspect because the options are so broad. Basic
telephony concessions will open up in developing countries, as will
opportunities to provide sophisticated services as a second force in western
Europe. China remains a great prize on the horizon. In technology, the
possibilities range from the expansion of radio services to multi-media.
Faced with such a range, a little caution may be in order. C&amp;W is only a
medium-sized player. The time is approaching when its management will have
to prove it can apply the company's limited muscle where it counts.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Eddie George sets out criteria for supporting troubled banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE, governor of the Bank of England, last night disclosed in
detail for the first time the Bank's principles for deciding whether and how
to give financial assistance to troubled banks.
Mr George defended the Bank's role in launching a series of financial
'lifeboats' for a number of small and medium-sized banks in 1991 and said it
was essential that no bank, whatever its size, expected automatic support.
He denied the common assumption that some banks such as the large clearing
banks were 'too big to fail'. There was 'nothing automatic about our acting
as lender of last resort', and no bank that it helped would be immune from
penalty.
His lecture was the second in an annual series at the London School of
Economics. He said the measures taken to protect 40 banks in 1991 had
prompted the Bank to update its principles on such operations.
The Bank intervened to support four small banks during the incident, the
largest such operation since the 1973-74 secondary banking crisis. It later
made provisions of Pounds 115m to cover losses on loans to the banks.
The potential for one bank's failure to affect others, Mr George said, had
increased with the evolution of the financial system. 'Crises can spread not
just from bank to bank, but also from country to country,' he said.
The Bank's principles were that:
It would explore every option for a commercial solution before committing
funds. It would always ask large shareholders to supply support, and,
failing that, would encourage the bank to try to find a buyer 'even at
knock-down prices'.
If it did provide support, it would try to structure it 'so that any losses
fall first on the shareholders, and any benefits come first to us'. Support
would also be 'on terms as penal as we can make them' without leading to
collapse.
It would provide only short-term liquidity, and would not 'in normal
circumstances' support a bank known to be insolvent. It would 'look for a
clear exit.' The company may be required to run down or restructure
operations under the Bank's surveillance to the point where it could survive
unsupported within a given period.
It would try to keep systemic support secret at the time. Disclosure could
damage confidence and the Bank might be drawn into 'a position where we were
in practice underwriting all the liabilities of the banking system'.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Africa's axis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS from Nigeria and South Africa dramatically illustrates the delicate
balance between crisis and recovery in Africa. The army reasserts itself in
Nigeria and General Sani Abacha removes the country's civilian head of state
on the very day democracy wins in South Africa. Both events have profound
importance for the two countries, but their significance is broader.
If sub-Saharan Africa is to recover from the disastrous post-independence
era, it needs to co-ordinate its efforts and find common interests - whether
breaking down internal trade barriers or tackling shared concerns, such as
the continent's external debt burden and the need to promote Africa's cause
in a more competitive world than greeted newly independent states some three
decades ago.
Apartheid's end opens up the prospect of a Pretoria-Abuja axis, linking
sub-Saharan Africa's two heavyweights, able to play such a co-ordinating
role: putting life into the Organisation of African Unity or presenting
Africa's case at the United Nations.
Yesterday's effective deposing of Chief Ernest Shonekan, a former
businessman who was attempting to revive a lapsed economic reform programme,
is likely to prove not only a setback to Nigeria's prospects for democracy
and growth. As one political crisis follows another, the country's economy
declines further. The northern partner in Africa's potential axis is
becoming an increasingly enfeebled giant, governed by generals from the
ranks of a corrupt, politicised army.
Mr Shonekan, who was forced to resign, did not enjoy a legitimate claim to
be head of state. If any one can make that claim it is Chief Moshood Abiola,
victor of the annulled presidential poll last June. Yet even that process
was a dubious exercise in democracy. Would-be presidential candidates were
banned, and only two government created parties were permitted to campaign.
But the army's decision to abort the poll and extend Chief Shonekan's term
in office had less to do with democracy than a reluctance to surrender
power. Although General Ibrahim Babangida, who seized office in 1985, stood
down, Gen Abacha took his place, albeit in the background. He now has to
explain why he has taken centre stage. He has no viable new economic
strategy to offer, for there is no alternative to the one pursued by Chief
Shonekan. If Gen Abacha proclaims that he is at heart a democrat, President
F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela have shown there are better ways of
demonstrating it. Only when Nigeria takes South Africa's route can their
potential partnership become a reality.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Where trade winds blow: Latin America's steps toward
integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now the North American Free Trade Agreement is as good as ratified, the
dream of a hemispheric free-trade zone looks a step nearer to reality. But
is it?
The vision of a western hemisphere free-trade area was first raised by
former President George Bush in 1990 - and strongly supported by most Latin
American governments.
It appeared to herald a less confrontational foreign policy relationship
between the US and Latin America than was traditional. In trade terms, it
was viewed as an insurance policy in case the world evolved into trading
blocs.
In the three years that the US, Canada and Mexico have been negotiating the
first step towards that vision - Nafta - the rest of Latin America has not
stood still. The region has evolved into a patchwork of free-trade zones and
customs unions, overlaid with various bilateral free-trade deals.
Two developments made this possible. First, Latin governments embraced
market economics and rejected 50 years of protectionism. Second, the
unseating of military governments permitted elected successors to settle
border and other rivalries with their neighbours.
So, as the industrialised world has had cold feet over free trade, Latin
America has embraced it, unilaterally cutting tariffs to the outside world
and its neighbours. Whereas in 1985 the average tariff level in Latin
America was 56 per cent, in 1992 it was 16 per cent.
Trade in the region - traditionally low because of high tariffs, import
barriers and poor communications - has rocketed. The value of trade among
Latin American countries jumped 28 per cent in 1992, reaching a record
Dollars 19.4bn, following a 24 per cent rise in 1991.
This is already evidence of de facto economic integration. What is less
clear is how the formal process of economic integration in the hemisphere
will be advanced.
For the US, the idea that in a world of trade blocs it can depend solely on
the western hemisphere as its main area of economic influence is
far-fetched, as Mr Clinton's talks this week with Asian leaders in Seattle
suggest. The US economy is five times larger than all of Latin America's
combined GDP of Dollars 1,250bn.
Some observers also now believe that the idea of the US as the centre of a
hemispheric integration effort has been weakened by the process of passing
Nafta. 'The Nafta vote has advanced Latin American integration, but not
hemispheric integration,' said Mr Wolf Grabendorf, head of the Institute for
European-Latin American Relations in Madrid. The political capital spent by
the Clinton administration in securing its passage through the House of
Representatives could make it unwilling to pursue further free-trade deals
in Latin America for some years.
Questions have also been raised about the benefits of free-trade agreements
with the US to most Latin American countries. A 1992 study by two World Bank
economists found the only Latin American countries to make significant trade
gains from agreements with the US would be Mexico and Brazil.
For the other countries, the main benefits would flow from increased
investment and insurance from unilateral trade measures taken by the US. Mr
Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean finance minister, said yesterday he had been
assured two weeks ago by Mr Clinton in New York that Chile would be the next
on the US free-trade agenda, but there was no rush to reach a deal. US
officials have also cited Argentina and Venezuela in that order as those
most likely to follow Chile.
Even though he has kept Chile out of the main South American free trade
areas, Mr Foxley said Latin countries should seek greater economic
co-ordination to deepen integration within Latin America.
Poorly co-ordinated economic policies in regional groupings have led to
friction, for instance, between Brazil and Argentina. Argentina is pursuing
an anti-inflation strategy which has brought annual inflation down to single
digits, but which has led to an exchange rate appreciation in real terms.
Brazil's projected inflation rate this year is about 2,000 per cent and the
government has been keeping the exchange rate competitive to encourage
exports. The result has been a widening trade gap in Brazil's favour: Brazil
now exports to its southern neighbour twice what it imports.
The Andean Pact - grouping Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia -
in September 1992 set up the developing world's first customs union. But not
before Peru 'temporarily' pulled out, citing in part the competitive
advantages that cheap energy offered to industries, particularly in
Venezuela. The Central American Common Market has been hindered by Costa
Rica's objections to moving closer to its neighbours.
Despite such obstacles, Latin America is unlikely to give up on integration.
'We have to follow a two-track process: fighting for a multilateral trade
system but building our bargaining power in case the industrialised
countries abandon their commitment to Gatt,' said Mr Foxley.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Monkey business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST controversial aspect of yesterday's largely anodyne Queen's Speech
may turn out to be its deregulation bill. Cutting red tape is important if
business is to flourish. But repealing regulations, particularly those
covering sensitive matters such as health and safety, could run into a host
of difficulties. The GMB union has already condemned the deregulation
initiative as giving business the 'freedom to kill'.
It is therefore perhaps not surprising that ministers apparently intend to
take so-called Henry VIII powers to scrap regulations without having to
debate each change endlessly in the House of Commons. Mr Neil Hamilton, the
rumbustious junior industry minister in charge of the deregulation
initiative, says: 'We are planning to clear out the accumulated dross of a
number of bills without seeking primary legislation which would clog up
parliament.'
Mr Hamilton, who describes himself as Mr Michael Heseltine's chief monkey,
is to be commended for his enthusiasm. But his apparent desire to sweep away
regulations with only scant reference to parliament is more questionable. It
is not just that anything which smacks of rule by decree would in principle
be objectionable. Ramming through deregulation in sensitive areas without
effective parliamentary scrutiny could endanger the whole initiative if even
a single death or serious injury could be plausibly traced to unthinking
deregulation.
Much, of course, depends on the details of the deregulation bill which is
not yet public. While the new ministerial powers will be subject to some
form of parliamentary process, the exact nature of that scrutiny is not
clear. In particular, it is uncertain whether the government plans to use
orders to repeal regulations which are written in primary legislation and
whether a parliamentary debate would be automatic or only take place if a
sufficient number of MPs called for one.
One way of meeting the constitutional concerns might be to establish a new
select committee or standing committee for deregulation. This would ensure
more effective scrutiny than the current practice, where ministerial orders
are debated in the middle of the night, if at all. It would also prevent the
parliamentary timetable being snarled up by thousands of small measures. The
government might still be concerned that populist MPs would insist on
keeping regulations which it believed onerous and unnecessary. But that
would be a small price to pay for putting the deregulation initiative on a
solid footing.

And well done to Price Waterhouse itself for its Budget Christmas cracker
which has landed on Observer's desk. Instead of the usual weak jokes, such
as why couldn't the leopard escape from the zoo? (answer, because he was
spotted), PW's tax specialists have filled the cracker with famous sayings
from Tory chancellors. Bound to raise a few titters are: 'Henceforth a zero
PSBR will be the norm' (Nigel Lawson, March 1988); 'We are likely to see the
temporary re-emergence of a public sector borrowing requirement' (Norman
Lamont, March 1991). However, Observer's favourite is Anthony Barber's
observation in his 1972 budget that VAT has been 'deliberately designed with
the interests of low income families in mind'.
Hope this little cracker doesn't jeopardise PW's chances of winning any more
juicy privatisations.

Good and bad tidings for Companies House, the repository of 1m sets of
company reports and accounts every year.
Yesterday its own annual report won the Price Waterhouse award for the best
annual report produced by a government agency. And the bad news? Accepting
the award, Companies House chief executive David Durham ruefully
acknowledged his report would not have been acceptable if submitted by one
of his customers. It lacked the auditor's signature - the most common reason
his agency rejects accounts submitted.

Now that universities and colleges are almost as preoccupied with
fund-raising as they are with learning, it was inevitable that someone would
publish a book measuring their comparative financial performances.
Thus we have the somewhat pricey - Pounds 125 a copy - Higher Education
Financial Yearbook, the work of Noble &amp; Co, the small Edinburgh issuing
house, which has produced it with the Times Higher Education Supplement.
Noble &amp; Co compiled its data base on higher education through giving
colleges financial advice and running business expansion schemes for student
accommodation.
The company has always been one of the most imaginative of the small
Edinburgh finance houses. It was founded in 1980 by Sir Iain Noble, who
earlier launched the Edinburgh merchant bank Noble Grossart with Angus
Grossart. The chief executive is Sir Iain's brother Tim.

So where exactly is the much-trumpeted British supermarket war taking place?
Certainly not in the advertising trenches, where the battle more closely
resembles formal jousting than tooth-and-nail struggle.
Take the latest advertising campaigns by J Sainsbury and Safeway.
Sainsbury's has recently cut the price of 300 popular own-label products.
Naturally, arch-rival Safeway has quickly followed suit.
But this is a war of total emulation. So, Sainsbury launched its price-cuts
with the slogan 'Sainsbury's - essential for the essentials'. Meanwhile,
Safeway's breathtaking innovation was: 'Safeway  - low prices on everyday
essentials'. We are further informed that Sainsbury's gives 'low prices
every week' and Safeway offers 'everyday low prices'.
Ah, the whiff of cordite among the shopping trolleys . . .

Britain's cliquey book trade will be agog at hearing that Terry Maher,
recently ousted as boss of Pentos, owner of Britain's second biggest
bookstore group, is already at work on his memoirs.
Mind you, putting pen to paper is the easy bit. Finding a publisher could be
more difficult, given Maher's long crusade against the publishing industry's
biggest perk - the 100-year-old Net Book Agreement.
And if Maher is as rude about rival booksellers as he is about the NBA ('an
organised conspiracy against the public's interest') then he might find it
hard to get prime place on the shelves.
Early days yet, admits Maher, 58 next month. He has only written 4,000 words
and has yet to come up with a snappy title. However, he already has two
tomes to his credit - Counterblast (1965) and Effective Politics (1966) -
which date back to when he stood (unsuccessfully) as a Liberal candidate for
parliament. Maher's enemies in the City and the book trade may be unnerved
to hear that he is finding the writing . . . 'very therapeutic'.

There will be knowing smiles at BP headquarters at the news, expected today,
that Sir John Cadogan, who retired last year as BP's research director, is
to be director general of Research Councils - the key job in the
government's new structure for running British science.
It means that Cadogan, a 63-year-old organic chemist who will be responsible
for dishing out more than Pounds 1bn a year to support university science,
will be reunited with another old BP hand. Bob Malpas, chairman-elect of the
Natural Environment Research Council, was a BP managing director during the
1980s.
Former colleagues will be interested to see how Cadogan's super-confident
management style goes down in Whitehall. One of his achievements at
Britain's premier oil company was to introduce a system of cost-benefit
analysis to justify R&amp;D spending to the BP board. Hard to believe that the
Treasury will be taken in by such high-falutin' figuring when he tries to
extract more money for science.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Another one under his belt: Nafta was a lesson for Clinton
on the power of his office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spinmeisters are having a field day now that Nafta is over and won.
President Bill Clinton's fans say he alone pulled it off, demonstrating
toughness with his own Democratic party, persuasiveness in argument and
shrewd tactical sense in understanding that this was a victory that could
only be gained late in the day. He displayed, they said, the sort of
resilience against all odds that characterised his election campaign and
this means broad sunlit uplands ahead, even in the Washington political
swamp.
His detractors are dismissive, saying he was too slow to realise that Nafta
might lose, bought it with give-away deals, was bailed out by his
vice-president, Al Gore, conqueror of Ross Perot in televised debate, and
only survived on the backs of a Republican vote he can never again take for
granted.
The truth is an amalgam of some of the above, and more besides. Perhaps the
most objective assessment has come, surprisingly, from Senator Bob Dole, the
Republican leader, a Nafta supporter but normally the most partisan of
politicians.
'I have to say I am impressed,' he said hours before the House voted but
when victory seemed assured. 'I had my doubts but it has become clear that
he understands it is important to win and he has not just stuck with it but
fought hard and realised what would happen to his presidency he if he
failed.'
The same could have been said for the budget battle in July and will
doubtless be said again when healthcare reform comes to congressional crunch
next year. The Clinton presidency, it seems, is destined to live or die on a
handful of hard-won votes. It may be a rum way to run a railroad but from
Tokyo to Paris these are the tracks on which democratic governments are now
consigned to run.
The clear lesson from Nafta, certain to be duplicated over healthcare, is
the extent to which most of the tough domestic issues, taxation only partly
excepted, cut completely across party lines. Success or failure depends on
amassing a series of shifting coalitions, often with unlikely bedfellows.
Most of the Democrats who sustained Mr Clinton over the budget deserted him
over Nafta. A majority of the Republicans, who voted as a bloc against the
budget because of its tax increases, supported him on Nafta. Already on
healthcare there are more glimmerings of an alliance between the White House
and moderate Republicans than with conservative Democrats. Liberal members
of the president's own party somehow have to be brought on board, if only to
offset the certain opposition of the Republican right wing.
The fault lines in both parties are now very deep. Democratic wounds,
especially with organised labour, will take some repairing. But Mr Clinton,
always good at political healing, was conciliatory in victory on Wednesday
night, as was Mr Thomas Foley, the Democratic Speaker of the House, in the
last speech of the great debate. With time the unions will probably retract
threats to work against Democrats who supported Nafta. They will fight Gatt,
if it comes to them, but with small expectation of success and thus much
less effort.
It is no exaggeration to say that Nafta might prove to be the last great
stand of the old left. Deprived of the demonology of the Reagan/Bush
presidencies and with tenuous peace prevailing in central America, it has
been pushed to find great causes around which to unite. Working with Ross
Perot and the 'America First' brigade cannot have been a pleasant
experience, especially since it came up short.
Divisions in the Republican party, contemplating a ferocious contest for the
1996 presidential nomination, are perhaps more profound now that the Cold
War no longer provides cohesion. Jack Kemp, who probably will run, and Pat
Buchanan, who says he will not again, slugged it out on TV this week
offering two very different visions of what the party should look like - and
both come from its right wing.
One of the more fascinating spectacles of the past two weeks has been the
performance of Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the chief Republican
attack dog and almost certain to be its next leader in the House. Not only
was he seen co-operating closely with President Clinton, a prospect once
considered unthinkable, but he was even nice to some of his less
conservative colleagues. He also delivered the goods, in the shape of 132
Republican votes for Nafta. It is a larger question, however, if this
bipartisan approach will extend to other issues, above all healthcare.
A clear loser in Nafta was Ross Perot, increasingly perceived as not only
just another politician but also a most bad-tempered one. Both parties,
especially Republicans, will be relieved at this, but the well of discontent
he tapped last year as an independent presidential candidate has not
evaporated and there is every chance that he will continue to throw his vast
financial resources at issues which catch his fancy, including healthcare.
But it is Bill Clinton who gets the most attention. Here he is, 10 months
into his presidency, with two big victories under his belt and a long list
of lesser ones yet still unable to command the heights of respect that his
record might seem to warrant. This month's off-year elections showed no
regard.
Polls this week, admittedly taken before the vote, put his approval rating
at generally below 50 per cent. This is the lowest of any president after
nearly a year except, curiously, Mr Reagan. Since Nafta seemed so dimly
understood by most Americans there is no assumption that Clinton will get a
lasting bounce up again. His poll standing seems to rise most when little is
happening - as in the summer.
In a TV interview this week, Mr Clinton was typically philosophical. 'Any
time you try to change as many things as we do, you put yourself on the
line. But that's the kind of person I am. I didn't run for president to
husband my popularity or to be very limited in my aspirations.'
What he might have learned from this struggle, though, is a lesson in the
power of his office. All along, even when it appeared well ahead, the
anti-Nafta coalition confessed a fear of what might happen if Mr Clinton
woke up to this fact, not simply because of the patronage at his disposal
but also because of the force of argument he could bring to bear.
He had been pondering this, too, though for non-trade reasons. A few weeks
ago, he held a White House dinner for a small group of intellectuals,
including William Julius Wilson, the black sociologist from the University
of Chicago. Their advice was the imperative of using the presidency once
again as a 'bully pulpit', as Theodore Roosevelt once called it and as
Ronald Reagan so effectively used it.
Thus, last weekend, at Rev Martin Luther King's old church in Memphis, Mr
Clinton delivered a powerful sermon on crime and on the responsibilities of
black citizens to arrest the decay of their families and communities. Dr
Wilson probably was nodding in approval.
It is a far cry from this message to the legislative complexities of
anti-crime legislation and healthcare. Some White House officials already
think Mr Clinton spreads himself in public too thinly, others want him to
impose himself with greater authority on the political culture. Both seem
difficult to achieve, given his intellectual and political eclecticism.
Meanwhile, business will go on. Nafta digested and the instant spin spun
out, it will be back to healthcare, Bosnia and Haiti, a possible Cabinet

<TEXT>
ONE MIGHT have expected the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development to have steered clear of the dangerous world of macroeconomic
forecasting and short-term policy advice. Its recent forecasting record has
been far from impressive, while the world economy seems peculiarly
unpredictable at present. Yet, undaunted by past difficulties, the OECD has
once more stuck its neck out, using this year's annual report on the US
economy to advocate a pre-emptive increase in US interest rates before the
end of this year and a two point increase by the end of 1994.
Is the threat of inflation in America's seemingly sluggish economy really
that alarming? US administration officials, buoyed up by Mr Clinton's
victory on Nafta, will be disinclined to take the advice seriously. For, as
the OECD itself points out, America's two-year old recovery has so far
occurred at half the rate of the average of the previous five. The OECD
expects growth next year to rise to 3 per cent, half the pace of a normal US
rebound. Domestic inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, is actually
expected to fall from 2.6 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent next.
But might the OECD have a point? The lags in US monetary policy are long and
unpredictable, while US short-term interest rates are unusually low for this
stage of a recovery - three month money market rates adjusted for inflation
are barely positive. If Mr Greenspan, chairman of the board of the US
Federal Reserve, wants to beat an upsurge in inflationary expectations, he
must be prepared to move at the first sign that expectations are rising.
While the recovery may be sluggish, there have been clear signs of
acceleration in recent months: manufacturing output rose 4.4 per cent in the
year to October, retail sales were 6.2 per cent higher and house prices are
accelerating. Economic growth is, as a result, expected to be above an
annual rate of 3.5 per cent this quarter, compared to only 1.3 per cent in
the first half of the year.
Yet so far, there is little evidence to suggest that inflationary pressures
are building. Long-term interest rates have risen slightly recently but
remain low by historic standards. Credit growth is sluggish, wage inflation
is subdued and unemployment high for this stage of the cycle. The annual
rate of consumer price inflation did rise 0.1 percentage points to 2.8 per
cent in October, but producer prices fell 0.2 per cent.
In short, the case for an immediate increase in US rates is hardly
compelling. As the OECD also points out, there are a number of reasons to
think that growth may remain slow next year. These include the burden of
outstanding debt in the personal sector, next year's tax increases, defence
cuts, and continued slow growth in US export markets.
If slow growth remains the immediate problem, the same is doubly so for
Britain. The UK economy has grown by a mere 2 per cent since the trough of
the recession at the beginning of 1992, less than a third of the US rebound
after a much deeper recession. Unemployment is falling, but other labour
market indicators - wages, vacancies and employment - all suggests that
deflationary pressures remain strong. Inflation is both low and falling, and
UK short-term real interest rates are not only above 4 per cent but actually
higher than they were a year ago.
Mr Greenspan can afford to wait before raising rates. Assuming that the
British chancellor is prepared to tighten fiscal policy in his forthcoming
budget, Mr Greenspan's British counterparts at the Bank of England can
safely cut.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Chancellor should end food VAT
anomaly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL POYNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'Food industry split on VAT lobbying aims' (November
17), Guy de Jonquieres lists many of the anomalies which exist between those
food products which are subject to VAT and those which are not. He rightly
observers that new product development has made a nonsense of the original
decision to exempt all essential foodstuffs from VAT and only charge it on
luxury goods. But he concludes that, given political sensitivities and
contradictory lobbying from powerful manufacturers, the present all or
nothing (zero or 17.5 per cent) system 'for all its faults' will survive.
However, in Britain we already have, in effect, an intermediary rate of VAT
on food. In 1992, the VAT contributions of Kwik Save - Britain's leading
food discounter, not a purveyor of luxury or inessential goods - amounted to
more than 7 per cent of its VAT-inclusive food and drink turnover. On food
alone, it is in the region of 5 to 6 per cent.
Most British consumers fail to realise that they are paying VAT on any, let
alone many, of their food purchases. The chancellor should remove the
anomalies and impose a single rate. He may well be tempted, in so doing, to
set it one or two points higher than the effective current rate but it
should be uniform. To suggest that this would harm the less well-off is
unproven; why should Kwik Save's customers or, indeed, those who shop at
Fortnum's, pay 17.5 per cent more for their chocolate biscuits than for
their chocolate cakes?
With a uniform rate of VAT on food we would also be more in harmony with the
rest of Europe. In France, for example, the standard rate on all food items
is 5.5 per cent. Now that the pace of European food retailers' cross-border
moves has begun to quicken - Tesco into France: Aldi, Netto, Erteco, Rewe
and Lidl into the UK - such harmonisation makes more sense than ever.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial agents' regulations are
not so easy to avoid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S L SIDKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the new commercial agents' regulations which implement
European laws in the UK on January 1 ('Agents lose jobs ahead of EU laws',
November 15) draws attention to the action which is now being taken by many
British companies in order to avoid being caught by these regulations.
This action, however, may itself lead companies engaging agents out of the
frying pan and into the fire. The reason for this is that some companies are
encountering a particular problem when giving notice to terminate.
Unless the notice brings the agency contract to an end before December 31
1993, the commercial agents regulations will apply to the contract. In this
case manufacturers, suppliers and importers will be stuck with the benefits
provided to agents under existing contracts, plus the consequences which the
regulations entail.
In particular, these will be the minimum period of notice to be given to
agents and compensation payable on termination. Failure to have given the
requisite notice will itself trigger a claim for damages.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord HEALEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Observer's talk of 'an impressive volte face' in my speech to the
Ireland Fund on Wednesday, is odd ('Troops in or out?'). As I said in my
speech, we put the troops into Northern Ireland in 1969 to protect the
Catholics against the B-Specials. When I walked through cheering crowds down
the Falls and Crumlin Roads a few weeks later, I was accompanied by two
leading members of the IRA.
The terrorist problem developed in 1970 when Labour lost power. In March
1972 I supported Harold Wilson's decision to talk in Dublin with Joe Cahill
of the IRA, and I supported William Whitelaw's official talks with Gerry
Adams and Martin McGuiness in July 1972. Perhaps Observer was asleep during
this part of my speech. Too much Bushmills?

Sir, I wonder which bureaucrat dreamed up the requirement for Britain's
already over-worked general practitioners to report twice-yearly on the
number of alcoholic drinks consumed by each of their patients?
It could, of course, be a cost-cutting exercise. As the moderate consumption
of alcohol can be beneficial to health, perhaps the objective is to
encourage increased consumption, thereby decreasing the necessity for visits
to the surgery and lowering prescription costs?

FT  19 NOV 93 / Why farmers feel hedged in: Conflicts over access to the
countryside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Oliver Walston, who farms 2,000 acres in Cambridgeshire and is an
iconoclast in the agricultural industry, adopts an earthy tone to explain
the antipathy of many farmers towards those who enjoy walking across their
property.
'The ownership of land is the second most basic human feeling after sex,' he
says. 'Anyone who interferes with that is playing with very strong emotions
indeed. Farmers get terribly, terribly upset.'
This sense of defensiveness largely explains why some farmers block
footpaths on their land by ploughing them up, growing crops over them,
building fences or walls across them, or placing a bull in the adjacent
field.
And it also explains why yesterday the Countryside Commission, which advises
the government on rural issues, launched its 'milestones' initiative. Local
councils will be asked to set out what action is needed if the commission is
to achieve the target it set six years ago of opening and making usable all
120,000 miles of footpaths, bridleways and byways in England by 2000.
According to the commission's last survey in 1988, walkers have a 67 per
cent chance of being unable to complete a typical two-mile country hike
because footpaths have been obstructed.
Since then, the commission believes local authorities, farming and
landowning organisations have been won over to the principle of improved
access, but this has not yet been translated into practical steps by all
farmers.
A survey last year by the Ramblers' Association found that a large number of
farmers were ignoring provisions of the 1990 Rights of Way Act, which made
it an offence not to restore public paths and bridleways promptly after
ploughing.
Protecting existing rights of way touches a sore spot for some farmers. But
Mr Walston goes further. His suggestion is that farmers should allow people
to beat new paths of their own choice across agricultural land, provided
they close gates and steer clear of crops and livestock.
Mr Walston has posted signs on his farm which welcome walkers and
horseriders subject to these conditions. Other farmers, he argues, should
follow his lead to overcome the bad image farmers have in the public eye
largely because of the scale of grants they receive from the European Union.
Direct payments to UK farmers this year will total more than Pounds 1.6bn,
including Pounds 130m for 'set-aside', under which farmers have to withdraw
land from cultivation to cut overproduction.
'What are you going to say when someone asks what you're doing to deserve
this?' Mr Walston asks his fellow farmers. 'You've got to have a rather
better reply than: 'We're being very nice, we're producing food.' '
The response from many farmers to proposals as radical as Mr Walston's has
been one of horror. Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers'
Union, accepts that 'there are farmers who won't allow people to exercise
their rights of way'. But, he says, granting total public access would lead
to abuse of the countryside by irresponsible elements such as mountain
bikers, jeopardise farm safety, disturb farmers in their homes and interfere
with nature conservation.
If landowners refuse access on their own terms they could have 'very
unpleasant' legislation forced on them to strengthen the rights of ramblers,
Mr Walston warns. But, at least in the immediate future, punitive
legislation seems unlikely. The government's policy is currently to promote
greater access and 'green farming' largely via the system of agricultural
grants.
The Countryside Stewardship scheme, for example, will pay out Pounds 10.6m
in the 1994-95 financial year to farmers who use more environmentally
friendly production methods and allow public access where there was none
before. Launched by the Countryside Commission in 1991, the scheme has
opened some 200 miles of footpaths and bridleways and about 37,000 acres of
land to public access.
Similarly, under plans drawn up by the government in response to reforms of
the European Common Agricultural Policy, farmers will be eligible for grants
for introducing and maintaining public access to their land in
environmentally sensitive areas and in set-aside. That could mean aid for
upgrading paths or restoring hedgerows.
Trying to change the behaviour of farmers via subsidies is well tested - and
highly successful. Mr Peter Pemberton, of Bidwells, the Cambridge-based land
agents says: 'It is incredible sitting here in the green 1990s to think that
there were substantial grants for pulling out hedges, grubbing out woods,
ploughing up pasture, draining marshes, and here 20 years later is the same
level of grant for putting them all back again.'
It may be that taxpayers are happy to see their money spent in ways that
make farming less intensive. A Newcastle University survey published this
month suggested that people would be prepared to pay much more for
environmentally sensitive areas in which farmers are rewarded for
'environmentally beneficial' farming.
But there are potential pitfalls in paying for public access, as the
Countryside Commission acknowledges. It accepts that some farmers,
particularly in remote uplands, who have no qualms about allowing walkers
over their land without being paid a subsidy, might resent payments suddenly
being made to encourage others to do same.
Moreover, if public access depends on receiving subsidies, landowners could
withdraw that right of access if at a later date the subsidies were phased
out.
That partly explains why the Ramblers' Association is pressing for a
statutory 'right to roam' across open country so that access, once granted,
could not be withdrawn at will by the landowner, or when an environmental
scheme comes to an end.
'Being a landowner doesn't give you the exclusive right of enjoyment of that
land. It's not the same as someone's back garden,' says Mr David Beskine,
the Ramblers' campaigner on rights of way.
The association is adamant it is not disputing ownership. 'We're concerned
with having the right to walk over the land, without impinging on domestic
privacy or depriving the owner of any income-bearing potential of that
land,' says Mr Beskine.
The growth in the association's membership from 38,000 to 94,000 in 10 years
illustrates the increasing influence of recreational walkers. Mr Beskine
says members are increasingly frustrated at the siege mentality of some
landowners. Some of their members, and others who have met obstacles during
country walks, might prefer more extreme measures - such as the withdrawal
of CAP subsidies if public access is not provided to land where it could do
no harm.

FT  19 NOV 93 / With respect, ma'am
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,' the Queen might as well have
read out yesterday, 'My Government will work day and night, in the hope that
if it survives for another year it can float on an incoming tide of economic
recovery for long enough after that to win the next general election. To
this end, My Government has decided on a holding operation, while it waits
for prosperity to return. Meanwhile My Prime Minister has bravely set out to
find a political solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.
'To keep you occupied while these processes work themselves out My
Government has chosen 13 bills to put before you. Each has been rigorously
selected according to a single criterion - 'Will it command Conservative
backbench support?' The new laws may not do much good, but, with luck, they
should do little harm. Most of the important bills  - on Deregulation, for
example, or Law and Order, or Education - constitute a tacit admission that
policies pursued by My Government during the past 14 years have failed. Much
of the proposed new legislation is designed to put right mistakes made
during that period. For example, the lion's share of the 3,500 regulations
identified as unnecessary or stifling to enterprise have been promulgated
since 1979. What does My Government think it has been doing since then?
'In spite of the revelation by my Secretary for Wales that the Health
Service reforms have created new managers at many times the rate of addition
of nurses and doctors, My Government proposes to add 'management' to the
police services, tinker with the administration of the magistrates courts,
and create a new quango to oversee the allocation of funds for training
teachers. It does not expect these measures to reduce crime or improve
education, but they may serve two useful purposes. They will provide
ammunition for populist declarations by Conservative ministers, and they
will strengthen My Government's control over traditionally local functions.
The revitalisation of local government is not a basic to which My Government
intends to go back, although its policy of annual tinkering with local
authorities will be pursued with vigour, this time in Scotland and Wales.'
Of course Her Majesty could not have said any of the above. Her script was
written for her by Mr John Major, whose first ambition it is to reunite his
party after a session during which it nearly split irrevocably over the
Maastricht treaty. The new parliamentary programme  - the speech she
actually read - is merely one component of the prime minister's strategy for
success. Success? It would be a triumph if the prime minister brought the
Tories together and restored the confidence of the electorate in his
govern-ment.
Your guess as to his chances of pulling it off is as good as mine. We may,
however, usefully list the other elements of his strategy for political
recovery. Step one: the pro and anti European wings of the party are
expected to settle around the concordat that he negotiated in the summer and
published as an essay in The Economist. The essence of it is to accept the
Maastricht deal, but obstruct any further moves towards a European Union
that could be remotely mistaken for an embryo super-state. It was carefully
prepared. Mr Michael Portillo, the most powerful of the antis, was shown the
text a fortnight in advance.
Step two: Mr Major's speech at the Conservative conference last month told
the audience what it wanted to hear: that Tories are tough on criminals,
severe on 'trendy' teachers, and purveyors of common sense. He pursued this
line again, to some effect, in his speech in the Commons yesterday. It is
not noble, but some voters may fall for it.
Next, we have the economic recovery. Last week's trade figures were less
awful than expected. Inflation has been held below 2 per cent for long
enough to be convincing; this week's surprise fall in the rate of increase
in the retail prices index is a boost for the government. Unemployment has
been falling for most of this year. The figures announced yesterday suggest
an accelerated improvement in the jobs market. People are still hesitant
about the end of recession, but Mr Major puts that down to pre-budget
blight. The hesitant mood should pass when Mr Kenneth Clarke announces his
tax and spending plans in 11 days.
The chances are that the increases in taxation, and the cuts in expenditure,
will have been discounted by the electorate before November 30. Mr Clarke is
known to favour getting bad news out of the way as early as possible in a
government's term of office, but it would be surprising if his package
turned out to be as severe as people seem to fear. The prime minister, who
is responsible for the Budget judgement alongside his chancellor, must
balance the need to keep his own job next year against the party's need to
fight an election before April 1997. Mr Major is out of urgent danger, but
he is not likely to pile on unnecessary bad news now.
That leaves Northern Ireland. Here the prime minister has been bold. He has
put himself before the voters as the man in charge of the peace process. He
did so in Brussels a few weeks ago, in his Guildhall speech on Monday, in
the Queen's speech yesterday morning and, a few hours later, in a careful
passage in the debate that opened the new parliamentary session. He has
stuck to his tactic of putting the extremists on both sides on the spot. The
recalcitrant unionists led by the Reverend Ian Paisley are on notice that if
they sulk outside the conference chamber, that is where they will be left.
Yet the unionists can veto any new constitutional arrangement. The IRA, and
Sinn Fein, its political wing, have been told that it is they, and not the
British government, who must blink first. If the IRA renounces violence,
then in due course it can be included in the talks.
With that made clear again yesterday Mr Major will now pursue a deal with
Dublin, and, through one-to-one conversations, the leaders of the legitimate
parties in Northern Ireland. It is the sort of thing he does best. Nobody,
not even the prime minister, can gauge his prospects. Gladstone failed. So,
in the end, did Lloyd George. Yet Mr Major's brave initiative must be taken
seriously. He deserves all-party support for trying. If he succeeds, he will
deserve much more than that.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not a distinguished policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERALD HOLTHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Readers are accustomed to the Financial Times's support for an
independent central bank. International evidence is that fiscal policy is
more subject than monetary policy to electoral manipulation. Some economists
who favour independence of the central bank face up to the implications of
that evidence and call for constitutional restrictions on the ability of
politicians to run budget deficits. The Maastricht treaty, with its
restrictions on government deficits and debt, is a large step in that
direction.
Now, Michael Prowse ('What Nafta says about democracy', November 15) invokes
the authority of Hayek to argue that policy on international trade should be
insulated from 'perverse short-term' political pressures. Mr Prowse prefers
Nafta, which he regards as the epitome of 'rational' policy, to democracy.
I had not noticed that the numerous undemocratic regimes, of all ideological
stripes, that the 20th century has produced were particularly distinguished
by their rational economic policy. But the tide is clearly against me and
such observations. The British government, in its eagerness to reclaim the
benefits of the 19th century, continues with privatisation and proposes the
abolition of health and safety legislation. From the FT, I infer that the
process will be complete only with the repeal of the Reform Acts. After all,
what is the point of universal suffrage to elect a government that must then
be restrained from doing anything?

FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Regulation of satellite TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID ELSTEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Hargreaves, in an otherwise thoughtful article, repeated a number
of misconceptions about satellite television ('Why the BBC should be
privatised', November 13).
First, that satellite broadcasters are not regulated at all. In fact,
UK-based satellite broadcasters are subject to Independent Television
Commission regulation on programme content and sponsorship, and advertising
content and breaks. They are also subject to the Broadcasting Standards
Council and Broadcasting Complaints Commission, and to EU directives such as
Television Without Frontiers. It is true that ITV faces tighter
requirements, but in return receives direct access to 99 per cent of UK
homes, inherits a 40 per cent share of TV viewing, and is granted a monopoly
on the sale of regional television advertising. This is a trade-off
voluntarily accepted by each ITV franchise applicant in 1991.
Second, that ownership rules do not apply equally. In fact, all national
newspaper groups are free to set up as many satellite channels as they like,
but may not hold more than one 20 per cent stake in an ITV company. This
rule applies as much to Lord Blakenham and Conrad Black as to Rupert
Murdoch. Similarly, ITV companies may not control satellite stations, nor
vice-versa.
Third, that the UK faces a mounting deficit on its broadcasting trade
account. In fact, if investment in the 120 ITC-licensed cable and satellite
programme services, and in building the cable television network is
included, the UK enjoys a huge surplus, and will continue to do so this
decade. The source of Mr Hargreaves' flawed statistics clearly excluded this
massive investment, but seems to have included satellite movie channel
payments to Hollywood studios, which any sensible categorisation would list
under film, not broadcasting, in trade calculations.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Jansons and the St Petersburg Philharmonic - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search for hard currency keeps Russian musicians on the road. It is
remarkable to think back a decade to a time when the great Russian opera
companies of the Bolshoy and the Kirov were virtually unknown in Britain,
whereas now their work is the most familiar here of all foreign companies.
To see the St. Petersburg Philharmonic again - Russia's single indisputably
great orchestra - is like embracing a close friend after a brief absence.
Hardly any British musical venue of importance has failed to welcome it at
some point over the last few years: the Proms, the Edinburgh Festival,
Symphony Hall in Birmingham - they have visited them all. This was the
orchestra's second visit to the Barbican this year alone. Further concerts
in 1995 are already planned.
Overkill, perhaps? No, one never tires of playing at this level and with
this individuality of character, the latter always the sign of a aristocrat
among orchestras. Such a description might once have seemed incongruous. On
record in the 1960s and '70s (those raw Russian Melodiya recordings) the
orchestra was recognised by its virtuosity and brassy force, a somewhat
brash alloy. Now that we have come to know the orchestra in the flesh, the
sound seems quite different.
At the Barbican it comes across as unexpectedly cultured. Berlioz's Roman
Carnival Overture was sharp and detailed, but also well balanced, no
overplaying from the brass. The smoky luxuriousness of divided strings in
Rakhmaninov's Symphonic Dances came from the exemplary blend of parts. In
all this I assume the players had an influence, as the conductor Mariss
Jansons has on occasion allowed other orchestras (notably the Royal
Concertgebouw) to be too loud in this hall.
In Sibelius's Violin Concerto the interplay between soloist and orchestra
was perfectly judged. Maxim Vengerov does not have a particularly big sound
(Anne-Sophie Mutter, in this same concerto recently, was prodigious with
tone and colour by comparison) but he feels the music from the inside, knows
how to shape a phrase, gives character and meaning to everything he plays.
It was a performance that kept eyes and ears on alert.
From Jansons himself one expects nothing less. For decisiveness there is no
conductor today to touch him. Every rhythm in the Rakhmaninov was absolutely
exact, clipped into place or punched out, as the occasion demanded. The
athletic leap in the air that he does on the last chord of each piece only
added to the dance-like quality of the playing - a thrilling, dynamic
performance that would be difficult to beat. Electricity sizzles from the
tips of this man's fingers.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Lucia Popp - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world of music is mourning the premature loss of one of its most-loved
artists, the soprano Lucia Popp, who has died at the age of 54. A particular
favourite of British audiences, whether in the opera house (she was a
regular feature of Covent Garden casting for 22 years) or concert hall, she
made herself known across the globe as one of the warmest and most endearing
of musical performers, with a voice, face and stage personality to match.
Czech-born, with a full, clean, silvery high soprano that initially allowed
her to draw notice as Mozart's Queen of Night, she quickly moved from a
youthful debut (1963) at Bratislava to permanent engagement in Vienna, and
thence to the most important international stages. As her voice filled out,
the coloratura soubrettes were abandoned and it was as an exponent of the
Mozartian and Straussian light-lyric roles - Popp was the most delightful of
Susannas and Zerlinas - that she won so many hearts.
With maturity came a range of more weighty, serious characters (Strauss's
Arabella and Marschallin, even Wagner's Eva and Elsa), to whom she responded
with the depth and naturalness of feeling that was her special
characteristic. Though hampered in the later stages of her stage career by
hip problems, her dignity and communicativeness were left unscathed.
Popp also blossomed into a recitalist who could grip an audience with her
powers of narrative, charm them with a simple lyric or comic portrait, and
transport them willingly into territories (Czech, Hungarian and Russian
song) beyond the confines of the safe, predictable Liederabend. Many records
remain to show the breadth of her range as well as the more familiar
qualities of her art.

At 9.30 BBC1 begins five hours of American movies with Rain Man, the 1988
film which won Oscars for best film, best original screenplay and best
direction. Some may think it does not seem that good: a rather static road
movie in which a car dealer discovers that his autistic brother has a gift
for memorising numbers. Moreover the BBC, as is now its habit, has censored
it, so that no serious film enthusiast will want to see it.
April Fool's Day, which follows (11.45), sounds like a latterday American
version of the Agatha Christie classic 'Ten Little Niggers'. The invitations
to the sinister house on the island are the same, and although there are
eight guests instead of 10 the general idea is remarkably similar.
Cat's Eye (1.10am) is categorised as a horror movie, though it is a trio of
Stephen King stories which, by modern standards, are pretty mild.
Casual Sex? (BBC2, 11.45), yet another movie, was made five years ago and is
very much in the modern mould: feminist, post-Aids attitudes to sex from two
women who visit a health spa looking for romance

FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Zender's 'Don Quijote' - Opera in Stuttgart and New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Happy New Ears'. The greeting comes from the 56-year old German
conductor-composer Hans Zender, an increasingly vociferous member of his
country's musical avant-garde. As the title of a book of recent essays, it
represents not just his disillusionment with traditional forms of opera, but
his desire to set music theatre on a radical new course.
Zender's first opera - heavily influenced by his mentor Bernd Alois
Zimmermann - was Stephen Climax (1986), in which two separate plots unfold
simultaneously. Now comes Don Quijote de la Mancha, in which Zender isolates
five components of opera - speech, song, instrumental music, action and
scenery - and subjects them to the maximum number of permutations. The
result is '31 theatrical adventures', premiered at the Wurttemberg State
Theatre in Stuttgart and already scheduled for a second staging at the 1995
Salzburg Festival.
This is deconstruction writ large. The 31 scenes unfold like revue sketches,
each lasting three to six minutes - except the 16-minute finale to the first
half, the only scene in which all five components come together. You have
speech without song or action; sound without scenery; action without sound;
scenery alone - and so on. Zender gives precise instructions on decor,
gesture, timing and rhythm, but says the order and number of scenes can be
changed. The only leitmotif is Cervantes' eccentric, flamboyant knight, who
emerges as little more than a comic cartoon-strip character.
As just one of five equal components, the music is marginalised. It is most
effective at its most conventional, as in the flurry of staccato trumpet and
horn calls accompanying the windmill scene. Elsewhere, Zender's serialism is
unremittingly arid and cool. Voices - including three 'readers' - often
swamp each other. To sustain interest, the piece relies on visual variety,
requiring spans of concentration no longer than a pop video programme.
But in contrast to today's pop videos, Don Quijote de la Mancha is all
intellect and no feeling. Content is secondary to technique; unity and
harmony are replaced by bloodless dissection; art is reduced to a
mathematical formula. We have been up the same cul-de-sac before - with
Cage's Europeras among others. Such experiments, aimed at shaping the future
of opera on a super-rational basis rather than organically, serve only to
trivialise the human and technical resources of a traditional opera house.
Don Quijote might have more to say in a production showing less respect for
theatrical norms. The Stuttgart producer and designer Axel Manthey made no
attempt to break the barrier between stage and auditorium, relying instead
on a few electronic sound-effects and a sequence of eye-catching stage
pictures inspired by Pop Art. Some of the action had a Pythonesque touch, as
when Don Quixote and Sancho Panza tried obsessively to duel with their
shadows. David Pittman-Jennings and Dieter Bundschuh made a heroic leading
pair, backed by 16 other singers and a small orchestra under Bernhard
Kontarsky. None of their efforts could mask the work's blatant tedium.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Face lift for Portrait gallery - The new Wolfson
gallery's inaugural show at the NPG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of the death of the portrait are greatly exaggerated. The works now
on view at the the inaugural show in the new Wolfson Gallery of the National
Portrait Gallery offer proof of non-extinction. But are they any good? That
is another question.
The exhibition, called The Portrait Now, celebrates the conclusion of almost
two decades of discussion about the development of the gallery and includes
works from around the world produced since about 1980. It represents an
attempt by the gallery to do the most natural thing in the world after a
major refurbishment - to show off, drawing on its own and other public and
private collections. Unfortunately, however, it offers rather more than it
delivers - the parts being greater than the sum, although it also offers a
chance to see the great improvements made to the gallery itself.
About Pounds 8m was raised from private charitable funds, trusts and
individual benefactors, to which the government added a further Pounds 4m
for the expansion of the gallery. Founded in 1896 as the first purpose-built
portrait gallery in the world, then NPG had long out-grown itself.
Throughout the 1980s there was talk of moves and extensions, as
opportunities came and went, but at last, in 1988, the issue was resolved by
the acquisition of the premises across the road from the Gallery.
The new site houses a new Archive and Library (funded by the Drue Heinz
Foundation), and a new Conservation Studio (Headley Trust) and gallery
offices. In the main building, the old basement has been converted into an
Education Centre (Baring Foundation, Pilgrim Trust, Marks &amp; Spencer), Studio
(Clore Foundation) and Darkroom.
The most evident change, however, is to the old Level 1 where the offices
and boardroom were, which is now remodelled and made over entirely to the
display of the 20th century collection, photography, and temporary
exhibitions. The new entrance on the corner of Orange Street at last affords
proper access for the disabled (Hayward, and Sports &amp; Arts Foundations).
The temporary exhibitions gallery has been used for this inaugural
exhibition. It shows that, whatever may have been said about the demise of
portrait painting, the human presence and identity will always be a fit
subject for the artist, no matter whether or not he sets himself up as
Portrait Painter complete with brass plate on the studio door. But does
portrait painting have any vitality left in the late 20th century? The
evidence of this selection is that so many of those artists who achieved
international fame and fortune in this late period are simply not very good.
While the roll call sounds impressive - Baselitz, Penck, Fetting, Schnabel,
Clemente, Salle, Bevan, Hamilton . . . need I go on? - too often the works
are less so.
It is one thing to indicate a human face or figure, quite another to resolve
it to the point of invoking a unique identity. Such particularity is not
necessarily a matter of long and detailed scrutiny, for much may be achieved
quickly and with little. Here Bacon and Auerbach, and the less well-known
Stephen Finer and Tom Wood, all show works in which the face, the presence,
is not so much described as conjured out of the paint. From the Baselitzes
and Schnabels we have only infantile indulgence. The less well-known, and
those more modest in the face of the task they have taken, on infinitely the
more successful and supply the chief pleasures of the show.
Sara Raphael's Gary Sobers is comparatively tiny and densely worked, but
none the less powerful and monumental for that. She is as good a portraitist
as any we have. Michael Andrews (Serena), Tai-Shan Schierenberg (John
Mortimer), John Wonnacott (Ian with Renown IV), Peter Edwards (Seamus
Heaney), Avigdor Arikha (Lord Home) all show distinguished works, and Glenys
Barton's ceramic bust of Jean Muir is the outstanding sculpture, so
deceptively simple, and so profound. The portrait is alive and well after
all.
The re-display of the later 20th century collections is a wonderful relief
after the cramped regime of recent years. The hang is now, if anything,
over-spacious, but a little such self-indulgence quite forgivable for the
moment. The arrangement is more or less by category of sitter - politicos,
clerics, artists, scientists and so on - and inevitably wonderfully
intriguing in its conjunctions, for it is in the very nature of the
collection that the aesthetic quality of the work in question is not always,
or even, a consideration. One gratifying quality, however, is the way in
which the long-term benefit of the annual Portrait Award, sponsored first by
John Player and now by BP, is becoming ever more apparent, as its
commissions come in to strengthen the collections.
Several of the rooms have been specially endowed, including the Kaye Gallery
for science and technology and the Porter Gallery, which is to be given over
to recent acquisitions and commissions. The latest include Lord Annan carved
by Glynn Williams, Lord Whitelaw by Humphrey Ocean and the Rev Chad Varah by
Sara Raphael. The Photography Gallery has been funded by the Elm Trust, and
is kicks off with The NPG Collects (sponsored by British Gas), a prime
selection of recently acquired images from the 1930s to the present day,
from Paul Tanqueray to Helmut Newton, and, as subjects, from Evelyn Waugh to
French and Saunders.
Dr John Hayes, who has been its director since 1974, retires at the New
Year. The present state of the National Portrait Gallery, at last full of
works of art and full, too, of life, is a worthy tribute to him and a
magnificent legacy to his successor.
The Portrait Now: The National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place WC2,
until February 6.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: A Rackham-ish 'Rusalka' at the Met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Pountney's production at the London Coliseum taught us that Rusalka is
a white opera set in a Victorian nursery; at the Met it looks rather
different. The company has taken over from Vienna and Houston a version by
set designer Gunther Schneider-Siemssen and director Otto Schenk. The stage
looks vaguely Arthur Rackham-ish, though with all the poetry dissipated by
the colouring and the 3D enlargement. There is a good deal of flouncing
about in gauzy costumes, and a good deal of rising up from or descending
into a pool of glittering plastic. With bumpy follow-spots that emphasize
the staginess, this is not a pretty show to look at.
Nor does it sound pretty. John Fiore, who conducts, does so brashly, so that
one hears the broad strokes Dvorak borrowed from Wagner, not the delicacy he
supplied himself. The unfortunate score is made to appear pretentious,
exerting itself in directions it cannot pursue - though one can well
understand thatwhen the conductor has to spend three long acts looking at
heavy Slavic twilights on stage.
Unhelped by conductor, director or designer, the cast are doomed souls,
except for those who use a bit of vigorous character-acting. Among the
latter are Wendy White as the arms-akimbo Kitchen Boy, and Dolora Zajick and
Sergei Koptchak, whose performances as Jezibaba and the Water-Gnome are
strongly drawn. Janis Martin as the Foreign Princess is not in good voice,
and Neil Rosenshein never seems a likely Prince. At the opening performance
he was in trouble from the start, weak and wayward in pitch, and in the
closing scene he almost disappeared from hearing.
Gabriela Benackova in the title role offers much pleasure, but not quite
enough. The creaminess in her singing, though lovely, is too material for a
water spirit, and the voice grazes itself when it has to touch to the bottom
note or two. She is at her best in the song to the moon, which this
ramshackle production leaves standing as a solitary set-piece. All the rest
 -two and a half acts of it - seems, at best, unnecessary.

FT  19 NOV 93 / People: Stone sinks from Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The departure of the old guard at travel group Owners Abroad continues with
the news yesterday that Geoffrey Stone, the finance director, has resigned
with immediate effect.
Callers to his office at the group's headquarters were told that he had
already left. He could not be reached for comment.
Stone's departure caused few flurries in the travel industry. Two other
senior figures had already left earlier this year; Howard Klein, chairman,
and Roger Allard, managing director, announced their resignations last July
after warning that profits this year would be half market expectations.
One industry observer says of Stone's departure: 'I think he felt the
writing was on the wall. He felt the new management wanted a clean sheet of
paper.'
Errol Cossey, one of the few survivors of the old Owners regime, is now
deputy chairman and heads both the group's airline and relations with Thomas
Cook, with which it has an alliance.
But the top job has so far eluded Cossey.
Michael Julien, former chief executive of the Storehouse retail group, was
brought in as non-executive chairman.
Last month, Francis Baron, chairman of Anglo-Saxon Television, was appointed
chief executive.

FT  19 NOV 93 / People: Schroders' young guard advances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the turn of two younger men to head the investment banking division at
Schroders, as David Challen, who has run that side for the last four years,
moves on with effect from April of next year, acquiring the new title of
group director of corporate finance. He does not move onto the main board.
'It is a pretty pressurised kind of business,' the merchant bank's chief
executive Win Bischoff remarks, adding that executives typically run the
area for about four or five years in their early to mid 40s. Challen turned
50 this year.
Challen will continue to be responsible for key UK corporate clients, and
will also work on expanding the group's Far Eastern business.
In a surprise move that sees corporate finance director Gerry Grimstone
passed over in this round of promotions, 41-year-old Will Samuel and
48-year-old Derek Netherton become joint heads of the investment banking
division.
The splitting of the job reflects the overall growth of business and the
gathering importance of continental Europe.
The division will now be managed by an executive committee, on which will
sit, in addition to Netherton and Samuel, Richard Broadbent, John Reynolds
and Robert Swannell.

<TEXT>
Walking the city streets is a wearing experience for the fittest, not to
mention those with ailments which cause painful joints.
James Taylor, of London, the bespoke shoemaker, has devised a shoe heel
which the company believes greatly reduces the shock of heel strike while
walking.
The patented cantilever heel which can be fitted to all men's shoes and to
ladies' shoes with wider heels, is made from hard-wearing moulded rubber
with a semi-circular groove around the back of the heel. In the groove are
nine small wedges, or cantilevers, each about half the depth of the groove,
which prevent the foot from twisting. As the wearer moves, the air-filled
groove acts as a cushion. James Taylor: UK, 071 935 5917.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Technology: Pin-sized chip pricks thieves - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tiny microchip, just the size of a pinhead, could help police identify
stolen vehicles, computers or mobile telephones.
Developed by Selectamark Security, of Kent, the Selectatag is programmed
with a unique identification code - in the case of a car that could be the
chassis number. Once programmed, using a hand-held reading and writing
device, the tag cannot be changed without the appropriate authorisation.
If a car is then recovered the police can use the hand-held device to read
the number. The tiny chip, which is circled by its own antenna, can be read
through glass, wood, plastic and in metal from distances of up to seven
inches. Selectamark: UK, 0689 860757.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the big drawbacks of cordless telephones can be poor sound quality,
which is hard to eliminate because the telephone is usually tuned to a
specific channel. But the latest Southwestern Bell cordless telephone, sold
by Audioline, can tune in to one of eight channels, choosing the one with
the clearest signal.
The eight-channel selector on the IQ FF800 automatically memorises the three
strongest channels. Then if the signal suffers, the caller can select the
second-best channel, then the third. The caller is even able to change
channels during a call. Audioline: 0527 584584.

<TEXT>
The information technology departments in Britain's blue-chip companies are
failing to serve the rest of the organisation because of their lack of
commercial know-how, according to the latest report from Research
International, of London.
The report, 'The Changing Role of the IT Manager', identifies the need for
IT managers to show more business acumen, and the authors believe there is a
need for IT managers to become increasingly involved as a consultant in
other areas of the business. The authors interviewed IT and non-IT managers
in manufacturing, service and public-sector organisations in the UK.

US military technology combined with British computer expertise helped Lotus
cars bring home the Beaujolais this week.
As the race got under way to bring the Beaujolais Nouveau from Lacernas,
north of Lyon, to Margate on the UK's south coast, one of the 55 cars
carried a notebook PC which had the ability to plug into US military
satellites to help navigate.
The Lotus Esprit S4 was equipped with a Carrera Technology notebook PC with
navigation software from Nextbase. Trimble Navigation provided the plug-in
equipment to enable the Lotus navigator to pinpoint the car's position on
the map of France to within 100m. Carrera Technology: UK, 071 830 0486.

FT  19 NOV 93 / People: Tague travels onwards with Storehouse group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail group Storehouse accompanied its interim results yesterday with the
news that it had finally appointed Stephen Tague, currently trading director
of Allders department stores, as store operations director of BHS.
Tague, 38, is the first permanent appointee to the post since Ann Iverson
moved across to become chief executive of Storehouse's Mothercare chain in
June last year, although Steve Bedford, group development director, has been
standing in for the past year.
Tague began his retailing career with Debenhams as a graduate trainee. He
held a number of store management positions before becoming sales controller
of menswear, boyswear, luggage, sports and men's shoes.
He then moved on to join Allders International in 1986, first as retail
operations director of UK airports. He then spent four years as group buying
and merchandising director before becoming trading director of the
department stores.
Tague is going to take up his appointment in January, from whence he will
have responsibility for BHS's 123 stores, at a time when Keith Edelman,
chief executive of Storehouse since August, is keen to expand the chain.
Keith Edelman said yesterday he was aware of the need to strengthen the top
management of the group and restore stability after a number of departures
and changes.
Interviews are currently taking place for a new group finance director after
the resignation of Graham Rider last month. Storehouse expects that an
appointment will be made in the new year.
Storehouse is also looking for a new property director - another function
that has been fulfilled recently by Steve Bedford - to speed up its store
opening programme.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Technology: Better supplies for the troops - A look at why
Europe's manufacturers are unhappy with their information technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE PALFRAMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's manufacturers are unhappy with their suppliers of information
technology. They want IT equipment which meets their needs more effectively,
enabling them to speed up their processes and link up systems at different
sites.
Determined to put pressure on their suppliers, leading automotive and
aerospace companies have banded together in a project aimed at producing a
new generation of IT systems for manufacturers. It is expected to last for
more than six years and involve an investment of more than Ecu424m (Pounds
330m).
The consortium involved in the project contains 17 companies from six
countries and is headed by Daimler-Benz, the German automotive and aerospace
company. The others are Deutsche Aerospace, Mercedes-Benz vehicles and AEG
electronics (all part of Daimler), the Volkswagen group and BMW from
Germany; British Aerospace and the Rover Group from the UK; Aerospatiale,
Dassault Aviation, PSA and Renault from France; Alenia, Fiat and component
supplier Magneti Marelli from Italy; Saab Aerospace from Sweden; and CASA
from Spain. All use IT extensively for design and manufacture.
By collaborating and keeping suppliers at arm's length, the companies
believe they can reach a consensus on their future IT requirements. They
also believe they carry sufficient weight to persuade the IT vendors, such
as IBM and Computervision, to develop the products to meet those
requirements, an important one being the need for integration of different
systems.
The companies' objective, says Horst Soboll, the project's manager and
Daimler's vice-president for IT strategy, is 'to improve the competitiveness
of European manufacturing'. Soboll believes this can be achieved both by
developing innovative technology more closely matched to the requirements of
users and by using existing technology more innovatively.
In the initial phase of the project, which started this month, the
consortium will specify its IT requirements including any de facto standards
it wishes to adopt and set priorities for the research and development
projects that will follow in the main phase. This will take up to 18 months.
IT vendors and academic institutions will be consulted for suggestions.
Among those stressing the importance of this, to keep users up to date with
emerging technology, is US-based Computervision. A leading supplier of
software to the European automotive industry, it reluctantly admits that IT
suppliers could do better.
The cost of the pilot phase will be Ecu24m, half of which will be provided
by the European Commission and the rest by the consortium. Although the
Commission is funding the project under its Esprit IT research and
development programme, it is unlike any previous Esprit project.
Advanced Information Technology (AIT) in design and manufacturing - as the
project is called - only includes IT users and is focused on one of the main
problems facing most industries today: bridging the gap between IT needs and
IT offerings.
The project has not gone through the normal lengthy Esprit project approval
mechanism. It was proposed in response to the Commission's request to
industry for more user-driven, less technology-orientated, projects. (The
Commission has often been criticised for the lack of returns to industry
from its research spending.)
The initial idea came from Daimler, which approached Europe's aerospace and
automotive companies (and some leading US companies in the same industrial
sectors). In less than a year, the consortium was formed and funding
approved for the pilot phase.
Rover backed the project from the first. 'It brings together the expertise
of the best people in the European automotive industry to develop a
strategic framework for all IT requirements for design and manufacturing,'
says Paul Towers, Rover's manager of computer integrated engineering
strategy.
The company is confident that despite some big differences between the
sectors (such as the rate of manufacturing output), the consortium will
reach agreement on common problems and how to address them. If it does, the
next Ecu400m phase will follow, for which Esprit funding will also be
sought.
This level of proposed European financial support reflects the scale and
importance of the project. The Commission's proposed total spending on
research and development into information and communications technologies
(of which AIT is a part) is Ecu3.9bn for 1994-98.
In the main development phase of AIT, the work will be split into individual
projects in which selected IT vendors will be involved. The vendors need not
be European but if they are to receive Esprit funds, they will be regarded
more favourably if they have research and development facilities in Europe.
These IT projects will cover three areas:
Product and process modelling (for example, the creation of digital
mock-ups);
Simultaneous engineering for the development and manufacture of new
products, especially where the development is being carried out at several
different sites;
Production control and logistics support.
By the end of the 1990s, it is expected that many of the new developments
will be demonstrable at user sites. Rover is looking forward to the next
generation of IT systems for design and manufacturing. They will have
modules specially tailored to the needs of the automotive and aerospace
industries, but have the same core.
'One of the benefits of this project is that we can start addressing the
necessary organisational and cultural changes that the new systems will
require ahead of their implementation,' says Towers. 'This way we're likely
to reap more rewards from the systems.'
In the past, technology has often been installed with little thought about
users and the organisation. Towers admits that 10 years ago, Rover invested
heavily in computer-aided design without a detailed implementation plan.
Only recently has it started to re-engineer its business processes and
introduce techniques such as team-based, concurrent engineering to make
better use of the systems.
One of the biggest problems, however, with existing design, engineering and
manufacturing systems, is integrating them so that the information flow from
one to the next is fast, reliable and accurate. At the start of important
aerospace projects, for example, the partners still invariably specify the
use of a common computer-aided design system to overcome the difficulty of
exchanging data between different systems.
This inability to integrate systems from different vendors is one of the
biggest causes of complaints from IT users in the manufacturing sector,
according to a report on prospects for computer-integrated manufacturing
(Cim) in the European Community produced by consultants Computer Aided
Technologies Network (CATN).
User dissatisfaction with software suppliers, the report found, was higher
than 25 per cent in some cases. Since a score of 5 per cent is regarded as
cause for concern, this is extremely high. While there were few complaints
about specific functional solutions, users felt that suppliers lacked the
skills, experience and vision to integrate these.
Cultural changes are required by many IT vendors, insists Paul Drath, a
consultant with Cambashi, the UK partner in CATN; otherwise, they risk
losing business in the fastest growing market across all Cim applications.
According to the report, manufacturers in the EC will invest Ecu1.7bn in
systems integration in 1995 against Ecu970m in 1991.
Spending on all Cim applications - technical (design and engineering
systems), process automation, logistics and integration - is expected to
rise from Ecu9bn to Ecu12bn. The manufacturers want more of this spending to
go on satisfying their own needs rather than computer companies' desire to
shift their products.

FT  19 NOV 93 / People: Tax man scores at accountancy firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Barlow, 42, plans to get his fellow partners out on the road to boost
their profile, in his new role as head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick, one of
the final appointments of the new senior team at the UK's second-largest
accountancy firm.
He intends developing a strong marketing strategy and is considering ways of
exploiting the growing trend towards self-assessment in tax returns.
He also wants to explore means of using the 'balanced scorecard', the
management technique to measure business performance using a variety of
indicators, which he helped introduce to the firm.
Roger White, his predecessor, remains senior UK partner and chairman of
firm's international tax committee, but will increasingly concentrate on
professional indemnity work at KPMG.
Barlow will take responsibility for strategy, management and other executive
functions.
He has a degree in engineering sciences from Cambridge University, and is a
chartered accountant with the Institutes in both England &amp; Wales and Canada.
Finance partner for the firm's south east region in 1991-93, he first joined
in 1973 and became a partner in 1985. His tax clients have included Granada
Group, MFI Furniture Group, Nestle and Ratners.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Management: Why it's hard to be a good parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few issues generate so much heat within companies as the relationship
between headquarters and the rest of the organisation. Not for nothing do
managers still chuckle cynically at the old jibe: 'I'm from head office and
I'm here to help you.'
So it is surprising that there has been little useful business school
research into how the relationship can be made more effective.
Six years ago academics, Michael Goold and Andrew Campbell of the Ashridge
Strategic Management Centre, produced a book which delved deeply into the
way head offices advise, control and otherwise add value to their
constituent businesses - or 'parent' them. Called Strategies and Styles, it
examined the 'parenting' styles of 16 leading British companies and analysed
whether their methods were appropriate to their portfolios of businesses.
The book proved influential in several respects. It established that it is
hard for a head office (or 'corporate centre', in current jargon) to be good
at more than one distinct parenting style. It demonstrated that the
sustained success of Hanson and BTR has been partly because their styles
have been better matched to their types of businesses than those of past
conglomerates such as ITT.
It underlined that the hands-off style used by GEC and other UK companies in
electronics was inappropriate and had hindered the creation of globally
competitive businesses. And it showed that shifting one's style is harder
than changing one's business portfolio.
But, to judge from their recent public statements, several of the companies
most praised in the book have forgotten its lessons and seem to be drifting
towards a muddy and ineffective middle-of-the-road style. The most notable
nascent offender is Hanson, with BTR not far behind.
In 1987 Goold and Campbell identified three parenting styles.
'Financial control' companies, epitomised at the time by Hanson and BTR,
along with Tarmac and GEC, tend to delegate strategic decisions to the
managers of a diverse portfolio of business units, which have few if any
dealings with each other. The centre's main role is to agree demanding
short-term financial targets for the businesses and to monitor them
ruthlessly.
'Strategic planning' companies, exemplified by BOC, Cadbury Schweppes,
United Biscuits, BP and others, focus on only a few 'core' businesses. The
centre participates actively in formulating their strategies, aiming to help
them make better decisions. It often initiates strategies which involve
inter-related businesses.
'Strategic control' companies, including Courtaulds, ICI and Vickers, sit
squarely in the middle. They have a strong commitment to decentralisation
and they control their businesses against demanding targets. But they also
have extensive strategic planning processes through which the centre seeks
to add value by reviewing, challenging and monitoring the strategies of each
business.
Goold, Campbell and a colleague, Kathleen Luchs, have revisited the original
material in the light of the companies' experience since 1987. Their
two-part review, published in the October and December issues of Long Range
Planning journal*, makes instructive reading.
They find it 'ironic' that Hanson has said repeatedly over the past year
that it will focus on seven 'core' businesses and that BTR has claimed it is
successful in global as well as regional businesses. Just as odd is BTR's
declaration that it intends to share technology across businesses.
These pronouncements have obviously been meant to reassure investors that
neither company is losing its way. But that is precisely what they seem to
be doing - again assuming they mean what they say.
As the Ashridge trio points out, the essence of the financial control style
remains its ability to improve performance in autonomous businesses. It 'is
much less suited to a portfolio of 'core' businesses, or to (ones) engaged
in fierce global competitive battles, in which different national businesses
must co-ordinate strategies to achieve success'.
The academics warn financial control companies explicitly 'to avoid blurring
their strategies by claiming that they can also handle the sort of
businesses that require a strategic control or even a strategic planning
style'.
For admirers of Hanson and BTR, a further concern must be Ashridge's new
evidence of how hard it is to make effective use of strategic control, the
centre ground towards which the two companies seem to be drifting. All five
of the original study companies in this category have had trouble, mainly
because their portfolios were too diverse for it to work well.
'The old idea that a decentralised structure, coupled with a modern
budgetary and planning system, could allow a competent corporate management
team to add value to almost any business fails to stand up,' concludes the
Ashridge team. Hence, in part, the decisions of Courtaulds and ICI to
demerge themselves.
Strategic control also requires a difficult balance of tightness and
looseness. To strike that balance, head office needs to know a lot of detail
about its various businesses.
None of this is to argue that the boundaries between the three styles are
watertight and that limited aspects of strategic control cannot be grafted
on to either of the other styles. But a company's parenting style is usually
based on a set of deeply embedded attitudes and practices which are mutually
consistent. Alter one of them and you may reduce the effectiveness of the
whole system.
Changing a parenting style is a far more complex and risky process than most
companies and investors seem to think. Head offices are not leopards, but
nor are they chameleons.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Management: In from the cold - Electrolux is delighted with
its Hungarian purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux is that rare breed: the contented multinational investor in
Hungary. The Swedish white goods producer bought Hungarian refrigerator
maker Lehel outright in 1991 and already has results to show for its
acquisition.
'We can't complain,' says Anders Scharp, chairman and chief executive of the
Electrolux group, which this week reported better-than-expected
third-quarter profits. At Lehel, Electrolux managed to boost pre-tax profits
by 16.6 per cent to Ft950m (Pounds 6.4m) in 1992 and held sales steady.
Production, 665,000 units in 1992, is expected to hit 1m by mid-decade.
Each employee produced about one unit a day in April 1991. By October 1993,
volume per man-day was 1.8, not far short of a west European worker's daily
output of about two. 'The potential for productivity improvement was
amazing,' says Heikki Takanen, a senior Electrolux manager and deputy
chairman of Lehel.
Electrolux agreed in March 1991 to buy state-owned Lehel and its factory
complex at Jaszbereny on the Hungarian plain for about Dollars 50m (Pounds
34m). It was part of the Swedish group's effort to be as strong in eastern
Europe as in western, where it is the largest producer of white goods.
At the most brutal level, Electrolux has improved productivity by cutting
the Lehel workforce from 4,800 at the time of the takeover to 3,200. The
Swedish company has divested non-core businesses and dismissed employees
from the central fridge-making activities, too.
Administrators have borne the brunt: Electrolux has reduced its number from
250 to 120. As Lehel's extended hierarchy has shrunk, top managers and
shopfloor workers have come into closer contact. Tibor Kertesz, managing
director of Lehel, queues with manual workers at the canteen. His
predecessor rarely visited the shopfloor.
But Electrolux executives must still penetrate a thick layer of distrust
accumulated over decades of secretive management. Employees used to learn
what the company was up to through speculation and the media. Electrolux has
resorted to any means to communicate: newsletters, meetings - and even the
truth. Electrolux appreciates that top management, however passionately they
communicate, cannot run everything. 'Sometimes you have to tell people that
you don't know,' says Kertesz.
Electrolux therefore places as much emphasis on 'horizontal' as on
'vertical' communication. 'What we brought here was a culture - a culture of
openness and cross-functional communication,' says Takanen. Marketing and
production departments now have monthly meetings, for example. Before, in
the first quarter of 1992, demand dropped. Sales did not inform production.
Lehel's managing director remembers: 'They went on producing without
realising what had happened.'
Electrolux has delegated, too. Managers, while fewer, have gained more
freedom to manage. The company has committed more to training than is
customary in its acquisitions. Takanen claims the policy has unlocked
potential, particularly among middle management.
Electrolux executives privately believe they have managed Lehel's
transformation effectively. More so, for example, than General Electric of
the US at Tungsram, which experienced something of a culture clash. Outright
ownership helped. Electrolux was the first western investor to take 100 per
cent of a Hungarian state company. That gave the firm the freedom to tackle
restructuring as it saw fit. Takanen is convinced: 'It makes all the
difference. I would be very reluctant to enter into a minority position. To
make the changes we are making you need to be in full control.'
But disguising this iron fist is a velvet glove. Electrolux has grown
through takeovers and its experience has taught it one lesson above all. 'Be
humble,' Leif Johansson, president of the Electrolux group, advises. 'People
do things differently in different countries. One has to be humble to adjust
to that - and even like it.' Electrolux's modesty led it to rely heavily on
task forces composed of Hungarians and foreigners to decide on
restructuring.
Electrolux kept expatriates in supportive positions beside Hungarian
managers. 'Instead of putting lots of people in from outside, the Swedes
that we have added have been in 'shadow' places,' says Johansson. Of 22 top
decision makers, all but two are Hungarians. True, Electrolux brought
Kertesz, a Swedish executive, to head the Jaszbereny operation. But he is of
Hungarian origin, an emigre who fled after the 1956 uprising against
communist rule and Soviet occupation.
Electrolux focused first on these structural and cultural changes. 'First
come the soft investments,' says Takanen. 'You have to get the values in
place.' This intangible investment has not always impressed Electrolux's
Hungarian employees. They initially doubted Electrolux's commitment. It took
the introduction of a facility assembling vacuum cleaners to restore
confidence.
Skill has been part of Electrolux's success, but it owes much to
circumstance. Lehel has supplied the Electrolux group with fridges since
1979. A part of the Hungarian company's exports to the west, which make up
two-thirds of production, has therefore been insulated from the decline in
Hungary's competitiveness.
As the market has recovered Lehel's share has also rebounded. Electrolux has
broadened Lehel's range and taken it into new markets. Fridges are doing
well and Lehel has kept about two-thirds of the market. Hungarian consumers
flirted with imports after they were liberalised. But many have been burnt
by fly-by-night operators and have returned to established suppliers whose
service can be trusted.
The most pleasant surprise has been consumer loyalty to Lehel. Reliance on
demanding western markets acted as a healthy discipline even in communist
times and Lehel earned a reputation for quality. That is now paying off.
Lehel is still in many Hungarian ears synonymous with refrigerator. The
badge has proved far more resilient than most Hungarian brands in the face
of import competition. 'We have been successful or perhaps just lucky,' says
Scharp. Electrolux may be overly modest. Insofar as western investors select
what they acquire in eastern Europe, they make their own luck.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (9): Big ticket
players take the risks - Robert Alldis finds that companies are now being
made more aware of the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT ALLDIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE directors of small and medium sized companies are not fully aware of
the benefits of leasing, believes Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the Finance
and Leasing Association and vice-chairman of Hambros Bank.
The FLA reckons leasing and hire purchase represents around 23 per cent of
total investment in fixed plant and machinery. But the association is now
working hard to make companies more aware of its industry.
The FLA is currently circulating, through Department of Trade and Industry
sponsored outlets, information on the benefits of leasing. But more can
still be known - so what can finance and leasing companies do and offer?
The major league ('big ticket') players are led by Lombard North Central,
part of the National Westminster Bank group. Mr Peter Torrance, its director
of marketing of business finance, estimates his company's asset base is
worth around Pounds 8bn. But though Lombard North is big - and with the
largest leasing sales force in the UK - Mr Torrance emphasises the value of
maintaining a specialised and customer-based service: 'Nearly all our work
is done direct, face-to-face and we do relatively little via brokers. We see
our strength as coming from the specialist coverage offered by our sales
force.'
Lombard North offers customers a full range of lease/purchase packages
(currently it helps finance a wide number of specialist contract hire
services including vehicle hire, fork-lift truck hire and PC systems hire).
But on the finance leasing side and bigger ticket deals, the size of Lombard
North's asset base means that it has a tax capacity big enough to enable
clients to get their tax allowances early.
More recently, Lombard North has linked up with GATX (Asset Residual
Management) - an UK offshoot of GATX of the US - to help companies lay off
their residual risk profile. Mr Torrance explains: 'In car contract hire for
example, you are providing not just the finance, but also the ordering of
the vehicle, servicing and maintenance and so on. But at the end of the
contract, the car is returned, and the contracting company now has to get
rid of it either at a profit, break-even or loss.'
If the lessor, when initially negotiating the contract, overestimates the
value of the car at the end of the contractual period, he or she will be out
of pocket. The accuracy (or otherwise) of the estimate is the lessor's
'residual risk'.
As such estimates are difficult in nearly all but a few sectors where there
is sufficient volume or a healthy second-hand market (such as motor cars and
some printing products), leasing companies are reluctant to take on that
risk profile. So, Lombard North Central and GATX are now offering residual
risk guarantees to lessors as a form of insurance. Mr Torrance says that
this should eventually make it easier for leasing companies to extend their
product leasing portfolios into new sectors.
At Barclays Mercantile Business Finance (BMBF), Mr John Callender, the
managing director, estimates his risk profile is worth around Pounds 250m
out of an overall small-ticket portfolio of Pounds 1.5bn. The bank arranges
for this risk to be taken on either by itself or by a third party. BMBF also
has 50 per cent of the agricultural leasing market through its Highland
business, which, including its big ticket operations, brings the total
portfolio nearer Pounds 5bn.
As a big ticket finance company, 'BMBF is one of the few leasing businesses
that focuses entirely on the corporate market,' Mr Callender says. Like
London North, he is aware of the need to be conscious of his client's needs:
'Our principal aim is to get closer to the customer and structure the lease
accordingly.'
Leasing companies are therefore tetchy when accused of offering an
inflexible package which will tie a client into an investment (echoed by
dubious practices in the photocopier leasing market) that he or she has not
really thought through.
Rather, leasing companies - by developing sales forces - reflect the
specific requirements of the client. 'The lessor can structure the risk on
the residual so it is shared, with the risk on credit being taken by the
financier,' says Hambros' Mr Mallin. Leasing companies now offer a
tailor-made product which includes all elements of its services to the
client in a single deal. But this does not mean you have to be big to offer
a flexible product.
ING Lease (UK) is one of a number of foreign leasing companies operating in
Britain. ING's basic product area is in the block discount market, explains
Mr Roy Royer, senior manager in charge of its market department in London.
The company is run separately from ING Bank's London operations, reporting
directly to Amsterdam.
ING Lease opened its doors in London three years ago and has built the size
of its UK portfolio to around Pounds 260m pounds. Mr Royer says his
company's leasing business now covers the UK, with most of its clients
coming through referral by intermediaries, vendors or other banks. As they
are not restricted to a set package or rate charge, ING's 33-strong asset
finance team (all skilled in every part of the leasing deal) can perhaps
offer a total and less bureaucratic service than a big UK leasing company.
But foreign banks are unlikely ever to become big players in the UK finance
and leasing market since, says a lessor at another foreign bank: 'To have
the UK tax capacity, the lessor has to be incorporated there.'
However, it is not just the banks that are making the running in the leasing
market, a number of manufacturing companies have also set up their own
leasing operations to help sell their product.
Two leaders major players have been Kodak and Rank Xerox. Both offer captive
lease products and avoid using any dealer network in the niche photocopier
market. According to Mr David Melville, manager of Kodak Finance, his
leasing book is now worth around Pounds 50m since it started finance leasing
in 1989. And like Kodak, Rank Xerox is offering a range of packages from
straight rental, cost per copy to lease/purchase. Mr Roger Eves, general
manager at Rank Xerox Finance, estimates that 80 per cent of his sales are
now financed through leasing.
Similar growth in the captive leasing market has also been happening in the
automobile sector. Mercedes-Benz Finance, for instance, since it started
operations in late 1990, now finances one in four of its passenger car and
commercial vehicle registrations.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (10): Where bankers
fear to tread - The Leasing Professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT ALLDIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK leasing industry has turned into a highly professional and
entrepreneurial operation.
It thrived on the financial deregulation of the 1980s and has adopted
innovative practices developed in the US leasing market.
Since the merger of the Finance House and the Equipment Leasing Associations
at the start of 1992, the full membership of the new Finance Leasing
Association (FLA) is 106, accounting for around 80 per cent of all leasing
companies.
Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the FLA and vice-chairman of Hambros Bank,
believes that, for small and medium sized companies coming out of recession,
leasing offers a cheap and stable form of asset finance. 'Leasing is one of
the few forms of finance that is fixed to the total cost of the asset and
covers a reasonable period of time,' he says.
Banks would rarely lend small companies funds for 100 per cent of the asset
value, over say, a five-year period. But the leasing industry specialised in
doing this for the full working life of the asset, he said. When the going
got tough for a small company, a bank could quickly call in the overdraft,
and put it into receivership. But, says Mr Mallin, 'we are committed for the
life of the project.'
Mr Mallin has seen the business change dramatically in the last 15 years. In
1978, he joined the leasing department at Hambros Bank as a member of its
marketing and business development operations. In 1981, he moved to
Australia to develop an asset finance and leasing unit in Sydney, and worked
on the last leverage lease in the country - a Boeing 747 leased to Cathay
Pacific.
By 1985, he was back in the UK and was made managing director of Hambros
Leasing. And by 1991 he was made vice chairman of the bank and in May 1993
chairman of the FLA.
'The industry is moving towards service-oriented financing,' he says.
Previously (in the period of 100 per cent capital allowances) it was mostly
passive finance. The loss of the full tax allowance made lessors far more
pro- active in taking on residual risk. Now they were 'embracing service
into the financing of an asset'.
The industry's best years were in the mid-1980s despite sombre forecasts
that the industry would never recover from the loss of the full allowance.
Mr David Melville, managing director at Kodak Finance, agrees: 'I remember
seminars then with people saying that this would be the end of leasing as
the tax-based incentives weren't there. But, instead we went into our boom
years.'
As the economy turns, the professional lessors are confident that they are
best placed to re-equip the small and medium-sized manufacturers
cost-effectively. According to Mr John Callender, managing director of
Barclays Mercantile Business Finance, 'the middle business market is a very
important area for us  .. Demand, though not storming ahead, has picked up a
little bit mainly in the north, north-west and the midlands.'
Kodak's Mr Melville goes further, saying that if the UK did not have a
leasing industry, 'it would be in serious difficulties in respect to the
amount of investment, as banks have not been prepared to lend to small or
medium-sized businesses to the extent necessary'.
All the professionals, however, have been chilled by the experience of
questionable practices in the photocopier market and recognise it has
tarnished - unfairly they say - their image.
'In the financing market you will always get fringe operators who will
indulge in excesses. But the job of the industry is to regulate itself. Once
we are aware of the problem it will be dealt with efficiently,' says Mr
Mallin. The FLA has now set up an independent tribunal and conciliation
service to hear complaints against its members. If the member is found to
have breached the guidelines, the FLA will revoke its membership.
Recent proposals by the Accounting Standards Committee to decide which
leases are included on the balance sheet are also a bone of contention among
professionals. And pointing to the failures of operating leasing companies
such as Atlantic Computers, Blackspur, ICS and GPA, Mr Mallin says the real
problem lay with income recognition and not whether the lease was on or
off-balance sheet. 'If the accountancy profession starts to put stringent
rules on leases, this will cause banks and financial institutions to rein
back just at the time when the economy is picking up,' he warns.
For the future, the leasing professionals are watching developments in the
public sector privatisation. They want their share of the action - but know
that, despite promises, the government has so far been slow to act. British
Rail privatisation still remains fraught with difficulties. Many
professionals are worried by how the government is going to help ease any
'sweat points' that arise from a change in franchisee. 'Everyone would like
to see it work, but I think there are still a number of issues to be ironed
out,' says Mr Peter Torrance, director of marketing of business finance at
Lombard North Central.
But more immediate is the November 30 Autumn Statement, and Mr Mallin has
his own list of proposals for the chancellor:
Relax the restrictive legislation on export leasing to enable lessors to
lease off-shore. He believes the Inland Revenue's current legislation was 'a
sledgehammer to crack a nut' - ie it was far too restrictive. The FLA had
now made several proposals aimed at preventing leakage but also leave room
for UK manufacturers to set up leasing agreements with overseas customers.
Deregulation to be extended in the financial markets, because restrictive
practices in the corporate sector had a 'dampening' effect on the growth of
the leasing industry.
Allowances for research and development would be 'very helpful', Mr Mallin
says. There are already allowances for scientific research, but small and
medium-sized companies lack the tax base to absorb the full costs of R&amp;D.
To continue the 40 per cent tax allowance, and consider 'an enhanced
incentive package for manufacturing industry'.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (7): In the shadow of
the recession - Office equipment is feeling the squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT'S a slow move out of recession; we're not seeing huge increases in new
business,' says Mr Roger Gazzard, managing director of Lloyds Bowmaker,
Business Technology Finance. The sector is greatly dependent on small
businesses, who in their turn have been particularly heavily hit.
Hard information on this market segment is difficult to come by. According
to statistics from the Finance &amp; Leasing Association, 6 per cent of the
whole leasing market is represented by photocopiers, vending machines and
fax machines. Other major categories of office equipment are personal
computers and post room equipment.
Last year's total for new leasing business in office equipment and computers
written by FLA members is Pounds 1.76bn, down from Pounds 2.48bn in 1991.
However, included in these totals are sizeable computer installations which
cannot really be regarded as office equipment in the same way as personal
computers.
Business is mainly small ticket with consequent diseconomies of scale.
These are partly overcome by lessors dealing with lessees through equipment
suppliers, hence the tag 'sales aid leasing'. According to Mr Gazzard,
'negotiating direct with the customer would put up the cost considerably'.
Careful management is crucial. 'While it's asset-based finance, the
underlying depreciation is high on the assets so there isn't very much by
way of security covering you if a contract goes wrong,' he explains.
Schroder Leasing has been in the market for 33 years, with around 60 per
cent of turnover coming from office equipment. 'It is a profitable market
for lessors as long as they play the game properly,' says Mr Jeff Addison,
managing director. His company has minimised costs by developing
sophisticated transaction processing and support systems - he calls it 'the
lifeblood of a small ticket sales aid leasing company'.
Photocopiers have one of the biggest market shares, with around 160,000 UK
installations each year and leasing a popular method of acquisition. But
this area of the business has been embroiled in controversy for the last
couple of years. There are stories of small businesses driven under by the
onerous lease requirements.
The sector may be soon due for tighter regulation. The Office of Fair
Trading has conducted an inquiry and will publish a report in the near
future. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general, is unhappy with what he
describes as 'misplaced ingenuity' on the part of a number of dealers and
finance houses.
The Finance &amp; Leasing Association, which represents around 80 per cent of
the industry, took its own steps to try and solve the problems some time
ago. Guidance notes on sales aid leasing were issued to members in April
1992. The intention of the notes is to ensure that lease documentation is
clear and that the customer is fully aware of the financial obligations
under a lease.
'While I wouldn't say that the practices of all the lessors were of a
reasonable enough standard they certainly have moved forward dramatically,'
says Lloyds Bowmaker's Mr Gazzard, who is also chairman of the FLA's small
ticket leasing group. 'The sorts of contracts you see now are clear, are
unequivocal.'
Mr Charlie Blacklock, manager of the Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts,
launched in February last year, agrees that the industry has made progress.
. 'The cost-per-copy contract is disappearing, people have realised that it
is open to abuse,' says Mr Blacklock. Cost-per-copy contracts have
frequently overestimated a lessee's likely use of a machine and pushed up
costs accordingly.
'My own company will only write cost-per-copy contracts for customers of a
reasonable size and with a constant copying requirement,' says Mr Gazzard.
He adds that throughout the industry cost-per-copy contracts are now
generally used only for larger customers, and comprise less than 20 per cent
of all contracts.
However, Mr Blacklock still receives an average of three calls a day from
people who have fallen foul of copier contracts, some of which were signed
with FLA members after the guidance notes were introduced. 'There has been
improvement but we still feel that there is a long way to go,' he says.
Mr John Chapman, assistant director of the OFT's consumer affairs division,
says that the report is likely to highlight continuing areas of concern. As
well as photocopier contracts, to a lesser extent agreements for faxes,
franking machines and vending machines are also causing disquiet.
'We've got about eight different areas where we still think there's quite a
bit more to be done,' he says. These include price escalation clauses,
lengths of contracts, settlement conditions, cost-per-copy contracts and
upgrading Clauses. The OFT is also likely to call for greater overall
transparency in contracts.
The OFT also has a consultation document out exploring the possibility of
changes of the relationship of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to businesses.
At present it applies to sole traders and partnerships. One option is to
extend its protection to companies, though removing businesses from its
scope altogether is also being considered. In addition, a wider review of
the content of the Act itself is in progress, with one prospect being to
raise the limit on transactions within its remit from Pounds 15,000 to
Pounds 30,000.
Lessors are not keen on extending the Act to cover companies. 'I think that
would be extremely bad for the small business user because it's going to put
leasing companies in a very difficult position,' says Mr Addison of Schroder
Leasing. 'It's going to take a huge amount of finance out of the market.'
The FLA says some of the clauses would reduce the extent of finance
available to businesses from its members, notably for small ticket leasing.
For example, a borrower has the right to settle a regulated credit agreement
early and some regulated hire agreements can be terminated after 18 months.
Others see some advantages. Mr Blacklock of the Campaign to Clean Up Copier
Contracts thinks the 'cooling off' period under the Act would be of benefit
to businesses. The FLA, for its part, says that this could prevent
businesses getting vital equipment quickly since lessors would be reluctant
to supply until after the cooling off period.
In the meantime, included in the FLA sales aid guidance notes available from
lessors is a check list for lessees which is well worth reviewing before
entering into office equipment leases.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (8): Field is not
worth playing on - The problems UK companies face in export leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SPENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RECENT years the UK government has faced increasing pressure from
exporters for greater support for their efforts, particularly as they claim
that they often have to compete on an international playing field which is
far from level.
To some extent, their appeals have been heard with, for example, government
providing additional re-insurance support to buttress the services offered
by short-term export credit insurers and by improving the cost and scope of
medium-term cover offered by the country's official export credit insurer,
the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD).
This has gone some way towards levelling the playing field for exporters who
argue that insurance and other official supports are often greater in
competitor countries. However, one area where UK exporters continue to
remain at a major disadvantage is in export leasing.
Here, it is not a question of an unlevel playing field; the UK tax regime
relating to cross-border asset leasing is such that it is scarcely worth UK
exporters taking to the field at all.
Fundamentally, the problem is that only 10 per cent writing down allowances
(WDAs) are available for assets leased on a cross-border basis, compared
with 25 per cent on domestic leases. Moreover, as the UK Finance and Leasing
Association (FLA) points out, the eligibility of even this low level of WDAs
is heavily restricted.
The current tax treatment of export leasing transactions has been in force
since 1982. The previous year, members of the FLA wrote new leases for
overseas customers valued at Pounds 572m - much of which represented leases
to back sales of UK exports.
At current prices, the 1981 figure translates into business amounting to
around Pounds 1.2bn - an amount which if, indeed, it had been transacted
this year by FLA members, which include such major financial institutions as
Kleinwort Benson and Hambros, would perhaps have involved support of between
Pounds 700m and Pounds 800m for UK exports, according to Mr Andy Thompson,
the FLA's secretary.
The 1982 rules were introduced by the government as a reaction to the
perceived abuses of export leasing which the Inland Revenue believed were
giving rise to a significant leakage of tax revenue.
Not only do the rules involve a low writing down allowance of only 10 per
cent, but the eligibility requirements for even this level are very strict.
Leases, for instance, cannot be written for longer than 13 years, while
lease payments must be evenly-spaced and similar in size. They cannot be
altered to take account of the lessor's own borrowing costs - though changes
can be made if indisputably linked to shifts in base rate movements.
In short, current tax legislation relating to export leasing provides no
'sensible kick' for UK overseas sales, according to Mr Barry Sutton of
London-based lease-structuring experts New Boston Partners, partly owned by
the Bank of Tokyo.
For UK exporters and institutions connected with leasing, the absence of
cross-border leasing as a mechanism for facilitating sales is particularly
irksome, given the favourable climate for leasing fostered by governments in
key competitor countries, such as the United States and Germany.
As Mr Sutton points out, favourable provision for the use of export leasing
is written into the US Tax Code which permits companies exporting goods with
a US content of greater than 50 per cent to structure leasing deals through
an offshore domiciled special purpose company known as a Foreign Sales
Corporation (FSC).
The economic benefits of utilising such a structure can result in savings
equivalent to around 7 or 8 per cent of the price of the asset, says Mr
Sutton. This can either be used to boost competitive advantage or profit
margins, or both.
Meanwhile, in Germany, for example, the value of an asset can be written
down at between 20 to 25 per cent annually, though rates can vary
significantly depending on the nature of the assets involved. Moreover, the
terms of leases qualifying for such writedowns are generally considered much
more flexible, according to the FLA's Mr Thompson.
The FLA is continuing to campaign for a change in the UK law on export
leasing, which it says results in a significant loss to the UK balance of
payments in terms of net earnings on leases and international market
penetration by UK-manufactured goods.
An FLA delegation led by its chairman, Mr Tony Mallin of Hambros, has had
three meetings with the Inland Revenue in recent months to discuss the
situation. The FLA describes the meetings as 'useful' and feels that the
Revenue is seriously considering ways in which cross-border leasing can be
made into a viable export facilitation technique. But the impression is that
no significant change in tax treatment of export leases is imminent.
Another body which may become involved in lobbying the government for change
is the British Exporters Association (Bexa), which groups together
manufacturers and bankers. Mr Keith Johnson, its chairman, says that Bexa,
which has been instrumental in, for example, lobbying for increased
government support for export credit insurance, may apply its own pressure
if UK exporters remain at a competitive disadvantage in this area of export
funding.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (6): Initiative
proves a damp squib - A look at the impact on the public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was jubilation in much of the UK leasing industry following the launch
in last November's autumn statement of the government's private finance
initiative.
The initiative, announced by Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, included a
series of measures designed to encourage the private sector to finance
public expenditure. These included new rules to encourage greater use of
leasing by civil service departments, government agencies, nationalised
industries and the health service.
Jubilation has been shortlived, however, with little so far to show in the
way of new leasing business apart from one large and rather unusual deal
involving railway rolling stock. While many in the industry still hope to
see big opportunities open up in the public sector, progress so far has been
painfully slow.
Until last year, Treasury accounting rules provided an almost insuperable
obstacle to leasing in central government. Apart from property and some
specialised leases, the capital value of the asset had to be deducted from
the expenditure total of the department or agency in the first year of the
lease. Thus, even operating leases offered no significant benefits in
smoothing expenditure across the life of the asset.
This contrasted with local government where most councils now finance much
of their non-buildings capital expenditure through leasing, according to Mr
Andy Thompson, secretary of the Finance and Leasing Association. Local
authority leasing of vehicles and other movable equipment accounted for the
bulk of the Pounds 844m of public sector business recorded by the
association last year.
The autumn statement offered new hope for leasing in the civil service,
health service and nationalised industries. The chancellor opened up the
possibility of greater opportunities for the public sector to use leases
where they offered the best value for money.
As in the rest of private finance initiative, the key was the transfer of
risk. Where the 'great majority of the risk' stays with the lessor, only the
leasing payments would count against public expenditure allocations.
This ruled out finance leases, as was made clear in a subsequent Treasury
note on leasing, issued in May. With access to finance at gilt rates, it
will usually be cheaper for central government to finance purchases of
capital equipment directly.
However, the potential for converting capital projects into current spending
through operating leases could now be explored for public bodies such as the
health service and British Rail.
The initial stumbling block has proved to be the requirement for a
substantial transfer of risk, according to Mr Thompson. 'The government is
looking for something extra in the form of residual values or the
maintenance of the leased assets,' he says.
On assets worth less than Pounds 1m, the only requirement imposed by the
Treasury is that the lease should count as an operating lease under the
relevant accounting standard SSAP 21.
And with assets worth more than Pounds 1m but less than Pounds 10m, the
Treasury has devised a simple rule of thumb for determining whether the
great majority of the risk has been transferred to the lessor. The
requirement will have been satisfied if the present value of the lease
payments amounts to less than 70 per cent of the value of the assets.
But if this test cannot be satisfied, the Treasury will require convincing
that risk has been substantially transferred through a detailed risk
analysis. Such an analysis will always be required for assets worth more
than Pounds 10m.
In practice, these onerous requirements have largely limited new leasing
business to smaller projects below Pounds 1m. Detailed project opportunities
have been slow to come in, according to the Finance and Leasing Association.
Interest in finding ways of satisfying Treasury criteria has also been
dampened by the additional requirement to open public procurement contracts
to competitive bidding. In this notoriously secretive business, leasing
companies have been reluctant to come forward with innovative forms of
leasing which will then be exposed to competitors through tendering.
The main exception in this lack of progress has been in railway equipment.
In the autumn statement, the chancellor gave British Rail the go-ahead to
lease Pounds 150m of rolling stock in the run-up to privatisation. The two
main UK manufacturers, ABB and GEC Alsthom, were invited to compete for the
money to ensure maximum value for money.
The battle to win the contract raged for much of this year, spurred on by
rivalry between the two BR divisions which stood to benefit from the new
order. Last month, ministers announced that ABB had won the competition,
with a contract that includes responsibility for financing, building and
maintaining the trains - in addition to accepting the risk involved in the
residual value of the rolling stock at the end of the deal.
This residual risk could have been a considerable one, given that once BR is
privatised, passenger franchises are expected to be awarded for five to
seven years, much less than the expected life of railway rolling stock.
However, the actual risk may have already been diminished by the creation of
three new leasing companies to take over BR's existing rolling stock and
lease it back to the franchisees. The franchise director will be able to
direct franchisees to use particular types of rolling stock, so that it will
be possible to write off investment in new equipment over a reasonable
period.
The chance of ABB, or any other lessor, being left with new rolling stock at
the end of a franchise period has thus been considerably reduced.
These changes to the rail privatisation structure will make rolling stock
leasing much more attractive, according to Mr Ian Henley of NatWest Markets.
'There is an enormous appetite in the market for big ticket opportunities,'
he says. 'Bankers who have had their fingers burnt on aircraft leasing are
now doing rail business across Europe and are looking to finding similar
opportunities in the UK.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (5): Standards give
cause for concern - A look at prospects for the reform of existing
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS may seem abstract and obscure, but to the leasing
industry, they could spell life or death. Current reforms under discussion
are causing considerable concern within the sector.
The existing standard on leasing is Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice 21 (SSAP 21), which was introduced in 1984. It echoed Financial
Accounting Standard 13, first issued in the US in the mid-1970s. Pressure
for the development of the standard was driven by concerns over financial
collapses involving leases in the past.
'Leasing was very much a means of off-balance sheet financing, leaving you
with very healthy gearing and disclosure of the commitment in a note to the
accounts,' says Mr Paresh Mashru, a partner with accountants Arthur Andersen
in London and head of the firm's asset finance practice.
The standard defined two types of leases:
Finance leases, which were purely financing transactions with contracts at
the end of which the lessee had paid for most of the value of the asset. In
the lessee's accounts, the asset is treated as a purchase, with the asset
shown on the balance sheet, and both the costs of borrowing and the
depreciation of the asset shown in the profit and loss account.
Operating leases, which are allowed to remain off-balance sheet, meaning
that the lessee is not required to show any impact in the balance sheet of
the lease, but merely has to show a charge to the profit and loss account on
servicing it.
As a rule of thumb, both FAS 13 and SSAP 21 drew the distinction between the
two types of leases with an illustrative figure that a finance lease was any
in which the present value was at least 90 per cent of the asset's fair
value - the so-called '90 per cent test'.
But the legal and financial industries seized on the figure, and devised
mechanisms to ensure that the lease contracts drawn up would be just below
the limit. 'The industry mushroomed - especially for big ticket leasing,'
says Mr Mashru. 'Investment bankers spent a lot of time engineering leases
to be off-balance sheet at 89 per cent. A whole industry grew up doing
clever structuring to get what would normally be on, off.'
In general, the two accounting requirements of the two types of leases are
the inverse or mirror image for the leasing company itself: placing
operating leases on and finance leases off-balance sheet as merely income.
But similarly complex structures have also evolved so that even the lessor
can remove the impact of the lease from the balance sheet.
The strategies used include introducing a third party which also takes part
of the risk. 'That keep the lease off-balance sheet of all three parties, so
it floats somewhere around between them,' says Mr Mashru. 'Nobody claims
ownership.'
Now this cosy two-way split in the accounting standard is under threat -
partly because the standards-setters believe this manipulation does not
truly reflect the obligations of a company in a variety of financing
arrangements. Suddenly there are two principal challenges to the existing
structure:
Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 4 (Fred 4), which deals with all
off-balance sheet instruments and stresses the importance of recording the
true nature of transactions - emphasising a portrayal in companies' accounts
of their real economic substance, not simply their legal form. This would
destroy the tactic adopted by the avoidance industry in exploiting the 90
per cent test.
The statement of principles, the basic framework that underlies the new
financial reporting standards being developed. This clearly defines the
nature of assets and liabilities, which should be adhered to in all the
specific standards that spring from it.
While both specifically exclude leasing, they contradict SSAP 21, raising
the argument that the standard will need revision to bring it into line.
That said, the industry has been on considerable notice: the proposals have
been around for some time - and represent the evolution of two previous
exposure draft standards produced by the old Accounting Standards Committee
(ASC).
But the Finance and Leasing Association argues that the changes would be
extremely harmful to the industry. Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the
association, says: 'Companies will find leases less attractive. They will
move to other forms of financing. That will be a negative move.'
He also dismisses the focus as 'irrelevant', and stresses that there have
been no significant leasing scandals related to the off-balance sheet
presentation since the collapse of Court Line in the mid 1970s.
Mr Mallin argues that far more important is the need to develop standards on
income recognition, to ensure that leasing companies do not recognise
profits too early during a leasing contract without adequately assessing the
residual value of an asset at the end of a lease.
'Traditionally, companies front-end profits,' says Mr Mashru. 'That works in
a bull market when there are new leases being arranged. But in a downturn,
there is less income and more bad debts.'
The FLA argues that it is these issues which have triggered most of the
financial collapses and difficulties in recent years such as Atlantic
Computers. The association has issued its own guidelines on the topics,
urging conservatism.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), which
replaced the ASC three years ago in the UK, acknowledges that SSAP 21 is
inadequate. The same message of limitations in their own requirements came
from a group of standards-setters from around the world who gathered in
London earlier this month.
But it is likely to be a number of months before the ASB begins to tackle a
project comprehensively to revise SSAP 21. In the meantime, the only
prospect of reform is likely to be through a pronouncement from the body's
urgent issues task force, which deals with relatively-narrowly defined
matters of public concern - notably in the abuse of existing standards.
The question is whether the leasing industry can develop proposals on these
grounds or will have to wait for more fundamental reform at a time when it
can be squeezed into the ASB's current frenetic activity.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (4): Effects will be
hard to predict - Britain's company car market, the largest in Europe, faces
a new tax regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S vehicle leasing and contract hire industry, thanks in no small
part to the size of the company car market in the UK, is Europe's largest in
terms of business volume and most sophisticated in terms of the variety of
financial products on offer.
While outright purchase remains the most popular method of acquiring new
company vehicles, according to statistics collated in the Monks Partnership
Company Car Policy UK 1993 report, nevertheless 11 per cent of new company
cars are on finance lease or HP; 18 per cent on contract hire; 6 per cent on
contract purchase; and 1 per cent on other methods.
The reasons given by those companies that choose lease purchase, HP or
contract hire are chiefly ease of administration, tax advantages and the
fact that costs are largely fixed for the duration of the contract, so
budgeting is made far more straightforward.
The specialist contract hire and leasing companies also tend to argue that
companies using their services often gain financially, because professional
fleet management operations benefit from economies of scale and so can buy
vehicles cheaper than individual companies may be able to, can negotiate
lower servicing and repair labour rates, and can usually manage to achieve
higher prices for the used vehicles at the end of the contract.
However, widespread publicity about the new company car tax regime which
comes into play next April - combined with the increases in personal
benefit-in-kind scale rates announced by Mr Norman Lamont when chancellor
last April - has prompted renewed debate on the thorny subject of cash v.
cars.
The difficulty is that without going in some detail into individual
circumstances, it is virtually impossible to generalise as to whether
employees would be better off choosing cash instead of a company car. Some
will certainly face a hefty tax increase next April - but many more will
find they are paying less tax.
To make matters more complicated, there could well be instances in which an
employee may wish to change his car in order to reduce his or her personal
tax bill - but that change could end up costing the employer far more.
Cowie Interleasing, the UK's largest company car leasing operator, provides
a typical example: A Pounds 19,600 Toyota Celica 2.0GT could land its driver
with a tax increase of Pounds 950 next year, so he may be tempted to choose
instead an Alfa Romeo 155 2.5V6 which is over Pounds 1,600 cheaper, delivers
a comparable performance and, after April 1994, will see a tax reduction of
up to Pounds 260 a year for the driver.
However, Cowie's figures show that when list price, maintenance, insurance
and other running costs are taken into account, such a move would actually
cost the company over 4p a mile more to run the Alfa than the Japanese car -
or over Pounds 2,500 more if run over three years.
'The responsible fleet manager should always focus on the total running
costs of any vehicle,' says Mr Neil Pykett, Cowie Interleasing managing
director. 'There are several models which have an attractive list price and
may be the preferred choice of tax-conscious company car drivers, but these
could cost the company dear in the long run.'
There are similar difficulties when one begins to discuss the level of cash
to compensate an employee for turning in a company car: should the cash
alternative be set at the cost to the company of providing the car, or the
cost to the employee of providing a similar car privately? Indeed, the two
figures can be many thousands of pounds per year apart.
'Offering a cash option could either cost companies a fortune or leave their
drivers, if they take up the option, hopelessly out of pocket,' says Mr
Geoff Becque, director of Leasecontracts.
He quotes the annual operating cost, including insurance but excluding fuel,
of a Ford Mondeo 1.6i LX, at Pounds 4,185, on which the typical driver would
pay benefit-in-kind tax at the rate of Pounds 725 a year.
'But even if the employer paid him Pounds 4,613 extra a year (Pounds 4,185
less Pounds 725 grossed up to a before-tax figure), the employee could not
afford the same new car. It is highly unlikely he could obtain insurance as
cheaply as under a fleet policy, nor would he benefit from corporate buying
and borrowing power, nor professional maintenance and disposal expertise,'
says Mr Becque.
The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association says there will be no
clear advantage in opting for cash instead of a company car unless benefit
in kind taxation is increased dramatically. It also makes the point that
individuals are unlikely to be VAT-registered and so cannot reclaim VAT paid
on petrol, spare parts and servicing. In addition, says Mr Terry Nunn, the
BVRLA chairman, 'the ex-driver of the company car may find the income tax
levied on the salary increment may leave him worse off and, more
importantly, unable to finance a privately owned replacement vehicle.'
However, the leasing industry is taking seriously the potential growth of
private purchases by ex-company car owners. Such motor manufacturers as
Vauxhall, Ford, Volkswagen and BMW have all launched private leasing schemes
during the past year, aimed at keeping the monthly costs of car use at a
sensible level. Generally, a deposit is paid and monthly payments are then
made for two or three years, after which the driver can return the car, pay
an agreed residual value to retain ownership, or change to a new car with
adjusted monthly payments.
There is also increasing interest in contract purchase schemes, though,
explains Mr Norman Donkin, until recently chairman of A&amp;T Norfolk Finance
and now an adviser to the BVRLA, the advantages are mainly enjoyed by fleet
users which are exempt or partly-exempt for VAT purposes, and also for users
of cars with a retail price over Pounds 12,000 where a proportion of rentals
under leases and contract hire agreements is permanently disallowed for tax
purposes.
Under contract purchase the user pays instalments to the finance company
covering repayment of the capital plus interest followed, at the end of the
contract, by a predetermined balloon payment, after which ownership passes
to the user.
Some companies have also recently launched personal contract purchase
products, aimed at individuals whose employers have switched to providing
cash allowances in substitution for cars, often made available under
arrangements set up in co-operation with the employer, to ease the financial
problems of the transition to employee-provided cars.
'The take-up of personal contract purchase facilities has, not surprisingly,
been very slow,' says Mr Donkin. 'For the vast bulk of company car drivers
it does not make sound financial sense for cash to be substituted for their
cars.
'Added to this, few employers are willing to face the substantial cost
(grossed up for tax purposes) of ensuring that the driver is no worse off in
net-of-tax terms than he was with his company car.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (2): Lots of kick,
little start - UK capital tax breaks are still needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE IS mounting on the UK government to renew the special tax breaks on
capital spending announced in last year's public spending statement as part
of an effort to boost investment and economic recovery.
The measures include a first-year depreciation allowance of 40 per cent on
investment in plant and machinery undertaken in the 12 months to October
this year. Thereafter the normal rate of 25 per cent would apply. A similar
allowance of 20 per cent instead of the normal 4 per cent was established
for spending on industrial buildings. Both measures run out at the end of
this month.
The aim was to encourage industry to move investment forward into this
period in the hope of additional spending that would help kick-start the
economy. But there are strong doubts about how effective the changes have
been and such tinkering with the incentives remains highly controversial.
One of the problems is that it is impossible to tell what would have
happened if the reduction had not been in place. Some, such as the
Confederation of British Industry, argue that investment could have been
even lower without the concession. Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the
Institute for Fiscal Studies, argues, though, that the reduced rates 'appear
to have been a signal failure'.
He told a conference on the forthcoming budget organised jointly with
Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, that he was opposed to their being
renewed. 'If we were to do it, the greatest impact would be to give money to
large companies who were going to invest anyway, rather than to stimulate
new investment.'
According to the IFS, the incentive to bring investment forward would also
be reduced if the higher allowances were extended, because industry would
start to think that more generous allowances were a permanent feature of the
landscape.
Yet, cancelling the concession has its drawbacks too. According to Mr Sudhir
Junankar, deputy director of economics at the CBI, 'it would be
counter-productive to take it off just when the recovery seems to be under
way, when it's more likely to have an effect.'
Indeed the CBI would like to see higher first year capital allowances made
permanent. It sees this as a targeted way of promoting investment. As an
accompanying measure it would like a 100 per cent capital allowance applied
to the first Pounds 200,000 of investment which would be a special help for
smaller companies.
Such a change would not be an alternative to the more general stimulus of
cutting interest rates, Mr Junankar says. That, as well as a determined
attempt to cut public spending, is at the top of the CBI's general budget
shopping list. But confirmation of a more generous approach to capital
allowances is at the top of its list of more focused specific measures.
Not surprisingly, the CBI's approach finds favour with Mr Neil Johnson,
director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation. His organisation,
too, wants increased capital allowances made permanent. 'The taxation bias
we have against investment is crazy and internationally uncompetitive, ' he
says.
Other countries allow for a shorter payback period in their approach to
depreciation and some developing countries target specific industries for
assistance, he says.
This approach is markedly different from that underlying the former
chancellor Mr Nigel (now Lord) Lawson's reform of corporation tax, launched
in 1984. That held that a lower overall rate of corporation tax was more
beneficial to industry than specific breaks for individual sectors. Mr
Johnson argues that such an approach lacks focus. Everyone benefits, but in
relative terms it is of greater advantage to labour intensive service
industries and works against the interests of capital intensive
manufacturing.
It remains to be seen whether such arguments convince the Treasury to extend
the benefit. There has not been much tangible evidence so far that it has
stimulated investment. One possible reason cited by the IFS is that most
companies finance new investment from retained earnings rather than from
borrowed money. The interest on borrowings is tax-deductible, but increased
capital allowances do not help in cutting the cost of using internally
generated capital.
Admittedly, it is possible that figures for the third quarter of 1993 will
show some resurgence as companies rush to beat the eligibility deadline.
In that case, there may also be a risk of the recovery appearing to falter
around the turn of the year as investment levels fall back.
It is more likely, though, that increased allowances have failed to
stimulate activity primarily because companies simply have not felt
particularly inclined to invest much over the past year. Not only is there
generally a large surplus of capacity in industry; the course of demand has
been difficult to forecast and confidence has been low.
So perhaps the concessions were simply introduced in the wrong year. The
experience of 1984-86, when time-limited concessions on capital investment
were also in effect, was rather different. The evidence then was that they
did stimulate investment, although it is less clear whether this simply
involved bringing forward investment that was already planned.
Leaving them in place for another year might finally do the trick, now that
confidence is recovering. The flaw in this argument, though, is that it
suggests concessions on capital allowances will have an impact only when
companies are planning to invest anyway.
'So far capital spending is proving to be one of the last things in the
domestic economy to turn round,' says Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at
Warburg Securities. There is a large amount of unused capacity in the
economy, but real rates of return are relatively high for this stage in the
cycle and corporate cash flow is improving.
That might mean the chancellor does not need to extend the special
allowances. 'We do still see the capital expenditure accelerator kicking in
at some stage,' Mr Gardiner says.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (3): Whether to
lease, whether to buy - Peter Carty examines a typical dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES planning acquisitions of new capital items are typically faced
with the dilemma of whether to lease an asset or to take out a bank loan and
purchase it.
The extra security afforded to a lessor by potential repossession of the
leased asset should mean that more favourable terms are on offer than those
for a bank loan. In practice, a bank may obtain a charge over a capital item
bought through a loan, negating this apparent advantage.
In addition, many leased items depreciate rapidly and provide limited
security. 'The lessor is taking very little asset risk,' says Mr Paresh
Mashru, head of management consultancy Arthur Andersen's asset finance unit.
'For that type of lending really what he is doing is taking a credit
decision. On the margin the comfort that a leasing company looks for when it
leases is not dissimilar to what a bank looks for when it makes a
medium-term loan.'
In particular, high technology items such as computers do not give lessors
good asset backing. 'We take more of a lending approach rather than an asset
finance approach there,' agrees Mr Derek Pridmore, marketing director of
Barclay's Mercantile Business Finance. 'They will mostly be finance leases.'
Leasing can display other similarities to loans and other credit facilities.
A lessor might look for a large up-front payment, most commonly with smaller
companies, say a third of the value of an asset, in much the same way as for
a hire purchase transaction. It may not feel comfortable with the lessee's
credit rating for the item's whole cost.
Although leases sometimes may not offer superior payment terms for rapidly
ageing asset categories, this can be more than compensated for by their
potential flexibility. The lessee can avoid being lumbered with obsolescent
equipment by taking out a lease with built-in upgrading clauses.
This facility cannot be so extended through a loan which only enables a
one-off purchase - there are some swiftly depreciating capital items which
do offer good asset backing, so that leasing should give a marginal
advantage. 'The average period for leasing cars is just over 30 months.
Residual values for cars at three years are typically 35 to 40 per cent of
original face value, so there is good security of value in the asset
itself,' confirms Mr Pridmore.
Assets with longer lives which are easily removable and re-marketable are
commercial vehicles, machine tools, printing presses, agricultural
machinery, production lines and aircraft. 'If it's a genuine asset-based
decision then I think the leasing company might well be cheaper,' says Mr
Mashru.
A crucial factor in the lease or buy decision is, of course, tax - and in
particular, capital allowances. At present many companies emerging from a
lengthy recession may not have profits against which to set off capital
allowances. 'If you don't pay any tax that benefit is just lost to you,'
says Mr Mashru. A lessor can utilise the allowances and pass them on to the
lessee. This is a permanent source of advantage to some non-profit making
organisations such as local authorities.
Leasing can also offer a source of additional funding that may not be
available through bank loans. Assets acquired under operating leases can
often go off-balance sheet so that key ratios do not deteriorate and banking
covenants remain unbreached. The scope of this practice may be soon
restricted by the Accounting Standards Board.
Another factor to weigh up in the lease or buy decision are the perks that
are often built into the leasing contract. These can include servicing and
maintenance. A wider variety tends to be available for computers frequently
encompassing installation, training and help hot-lines.
Finding the notional cost within the lease of each extra for comparison
purposes can be problematic. 'If they're bundled, it's difficult to
determine what the individual elements are,' says Mr Alan Jones, managing
director of Copernicus, a company producing lease evaluation software.
Disentangling the charges for the extras from the actual cost of the
equipment under a lease is made more difficult because the lessor may be
able to buy it on more preferential terms from the manufacturer than the
lessee. Of course, if the lessor does get a manufacturer's discount, the
benefit can be passed on to the lessee.
Leases have become more sophisticated and often incorporate treasury
instruments for big ticket items. Variable rate leases can be hedged with
various instruments so that they have a fixed repayment profile. But
treasury instruments can be dangerous in the hands of the inexperienced.
'Like anything else, it can be effective if it's properly managed,' comments
Mr Mashru, emphasising the importance of laying down clear objectives for
the use of instruments.
A disadvantage of leasing is that lessees can lose out on government grants.
If they do not have legal title in the asset, they may not be eligible for a
relevant award. It may not be available to the lessor, so that benefits
cannot be passed on.
It is on the spreadsheet that many lease or buy decisions are made. The two
common quantitative evaluation techniques both compare the cash flows from
alternatives. The net present value (NPV) method involves discounting the
flows back to get amounts of money representing equivalent values at the
inception of the lease or loan. Under the internal rate of return method
(IRR), the discount rates which give NPVs for each decision of zero are
compared and ranked.
Occasionally it is not possible to calculate an IRR for some cash flows and
others might have more than one IRR. Many companies also feel more
comfortable with aggregate amounts rather than rates and opt for the NPV
method.
'The point about the NPV is that you can get a value in today's terms, it
gives you a total,' comments Mr Jones of Copernicus. 'The IRR might be a
rate applied to a small amount in which case the interest element is small,
but if you've got a present value you can see that leasing in today's terms
costs you, say, Pounds 100,000 and buying costs you Pounds 105,000.'
It may be easier, but many financial professionals use incorrect discount
rates when comparing the cash flows. A common error is to insert a
before-tax discount rate into the spreadsheet rather than the after-tax
rate. 'It's amazing how unsophisticated some corporates are, particularly
the small to medium-sized,' says Mr Mashru.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (1): Owning 'is not
really necessary' - Against a background of continuing slow growth, the
regulators are posing new pressures on the leasing industry. Also, the
government's efforts to lure private finance into public sector projects
have not so far borne much fruit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THESE ARE turbulent times for the UK leasing industry, one of the less well
understood mechanisms for raising finance. Not only are the effects of the
recession lingering, but government and regulators are posing new pressures
on the sector
Leasing's role as a source of financing for assets has long been
underplayed. Its origins may be ancient, but it is over the last 30 years
that it has developed in the UK on the back of tax allowances for capital
investment and the influence of the sector in the US.
It provides an important source of financing for equipment and other assets
to supplement the equity markets, as well as loans and internally-generated
cash for companies, public sector bodies and the non-profit sector alike.
Leasing contracts are financing everything from office equipment and cars to
heavy public infrastructure projects and satellites. But, as Mr Michael
Maberley, director for business finance at Lombard North Central, which
provides National Westminster Bank's leasing services, puts it: 'We are a
very low profile industry. We need to get up and talk about ourselves more.'
According to figures from the Finance and Leasing Association, the leading
trade body, last year leasing accounted for Pounds 11.8bn in financing - or
some 27 per cent of all UK investment in equipment.
By total value, it is most dominant in the acquisition of cars, plant and
machinery, and computer and office equipment. It also plays a leading and
high profile role in aircraft financing, as well as commercial vehicles and
property.
Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the FLA and a vice president of Hambros, says:
'Leasing has grown with the realisation that you don't need to own things on
your balance sheet to make your business work, that you can separate
economic use from economic ownership.'
Mr Maberley says: 'If we are seen as direct competition with the banks, we
have failed. Leasing provides a structured, term facility linked to the
working and earning life of an asset. It is tax efficient,
competitively-priced and shaped and structured around a variety of needs.'
In spite of the attractions, leasing seems to have suffered
disproportionately during the recession. 'We have seen demand pick up a
little during the year,' says Mr John Callender, managing director of
Barclays Mercantile, optimistically. His view that the worst may be over is
shared by others in the sector.
Nevertheless, the FLA's latest figures for the first nine months of 1993
show leasing down by 3 per cent to Pounds 5.5bn compared with the same
period last year. For September alone, leasing activity amounted to Pounds
813m, against Pounds 874m in September 1992.
Mr Maberley puts the decline down to the recession, which powerfully cut
back on business investment. While companies may extend existing bank
overdrafts during difficult economic times, new investment such as new lease
contracts - which the FLA figures highlight - is minimal.
He adds that many lessors were also heavily stung by bad debts, and have
tightened up credit controls considerably at the expense of new business.
Meanwhile, the industry is beginning to lose patience with the government's
efforts to lure private finance into public sector projects - the so-called
private finance initiative announced in the budget last year by Mr Norman
Lamont.
Provisional guidelines were issued in May, and there have been meetings with
Whitehall officials. This week Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor as
chancellor, affirmed his support for the idea at the Confederation of
British Industry's annual conference and announced a working group to tackle
the subject. 'You've been hearing about the theory for a year now,' he
conceded.
So far, little has happened. 'It seems to be difficult to get projects up
and live,' says Mr Mallin. 'It is not moving at the rate which was expected.
There seems to be a very purist approach by the Treasury.'
He highlights the potential in transport and the health care sector, where
he believes leasing would be ideal for hospitals seeking to use
high-technology diagnostic equipment. There would also be scope among local
authorities in waste management and environmental protection.
But objections seem to include the way in which the leases can be accounted
for, and a traditional resistance to the erosion of public sector
expenditure control and accountability.
More generally, the leasing companies concede that their industry still has
something of an image problem, triggered by the high-profile collapses of a
number of their peers such as Atlantic Computers, Blackspur and Court Line;
as well as more recently publicity over the financial difficulties at GPA
and Tiphook.
Lessors have also suffered particularly bad publicity in the last two years
as a result of misrepresentations in the photocopier leasing industry - a
subject now under scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading, which is expected
to report back shortly.
'A lot of people still have to overcome a desire to own assets. It is
amazing how many feel that owning is really necessary,' says Mr Callender.
'The word 'leasing' conjures up unsavoury memories, all tarred with the same
brush. Sometimes our reputation is our biggest enemy. We have a
responsibility to improve the name and brand image.'
Mr Callender adds that the industry is still relatively cumbersome and
unresponsive. 'We have to get our act together and move towards
understanding the customers' needs and being focused less on the technical
side.'
The FLA has attempted to tackle the criticisms with its own guidelines:
notably some issued last year which called for far greater clarity in lease
contracts, with the principal conditions prominently displayed to reduce
misunderstandings.
It has also held discussions with some of its members to urge them to be
responsive to complaints, though it says many calls it receives relate to
non-members.
Attention in the industry is currently focused on the outcome of an inquiry
by the Office of Fair Trading into extending the requirements of the
Consumer Credit Act to small businesses and to financing transactions of up
to Pounds 30,000.
'We're very keen that the OFT doesn't push government to put any further
barriers on business in the small company sector,' says Mr Mallin. He argues
that changes in the existing regulations are not favoured by these companies
and would be 'totally misconceived'.
The leasing industry's hope is that any such recommendations will be
overtaken by another of the government's efforts, the deregulation
initiative.
Other concerns for lessors include the threat of new accounting standards
that could jeopardise the advantages to companies of being able to keep
off-balance sheet many of their leases.
Both the statement of principles and Fred 4, two of the documents issued by
the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), threaten to bring back all leases onto
the balance sheet, dissolving the distinction between finance and operating
leases.
The FLA, by contrast, argues that far more important is addressing the issue
of aggressive income recognition in the accounts of lessor companies, which
has been responsible for most of the collapses and financial difficulties.
The call has been heard with some sympathy by standards-setters, but it
could be many months before the ASB squeezes the topics onto its agenda.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Number of strikes falls to record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POOR international image of Britain as a strike-prone country is waning.
The latest labour dispute figures of the Department of Employment suggest
that Britain has nearly attained the low levels of industrial conflict
enjoyed by Switzerland and Sweden.
The latest provisional total of strikes released yesterday by the government
reveal that only 16 strikes took place in September, the lowest number since
such statistics began a century ago.
In the 12 months to this September, 188 disputes took place. Only 8,000
working days were lost in September as a result of strikes, the smallest
total recorded in official statistics since December 1937.
As many as 622,000 working days were lost due to strikes up to last
September. That is more than the 526,000 lost working days recorded for the
same period to September last year, but it represents the second smallest
figure since official figures began in 1893.
The cumulative total of workers involved in disputes which began during the
12 months to this September was 241,000, with only 3,000 in September alone.
The 12-month figure is higher than the 154,000 recorded for the previous
period to September 1992 but still represents the second lowest figure since
1934.
The latest comparative strike statistics for last year, published by the
Geneva-based International Labour Organisation, suggest that Britain lost
far fewer working days from strikes in 1992 than Germany, France and Italy,
its main European competitors. Only paradigms of industrial harmony such as
Sweden and Switzerland recorded much lower figures for lost working days.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Decline in unemployment accelerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprising fall of 49,000 in unemployment last month brought the total
to 2.85m and suggests that the jobless total is now on a downward trend.
Although the figures have been erratic since February when monthly falls
first started to occur, the three-, six- and 12-month averages of the
monthly change in unemployment are all negative.
Over the past six months the jobless total has fallen on average by 14,100 a
month, while over the past three months it has fallen on average by 20,400.
The seasonally adjusted rate has dropped to 10.2 per cent, compared with
10.3 per cent in September and a peak of 10.6 per cent at the beginning of
the year.
The unadjusted unemployment total fell in October by 118,534 to 2.79m. This
compares with a fall of 32,954 in October last year.
There were big falls in the male jobless total. This dropped 31,700 on the
month, taking the male rate of unemployment to 13.7 per cent. For women, the
rate was 5.5 per cent following a drop of 17,300 on the month.
These falls were spread fairly evenly across the regions, but were
relatively smaller in the north of England and Northern Ireland.
Other indications that the labour market is benefiting from recovery include
a 7,100 rise in the stock of vacancies at job centres, which account for
about a third of all vacancies. This is an 18.4 per cent improvement on a
year ago.
Also encouraging was a 9,000 month-on-month rise in manufacturing
employment, the second highest increase since August 1989 and the first rise
for two months. The Department of Employment said most of the new jobs were
in clothing and footwear and mechanical engineering.
The number of hours lost through short-time working has in recent months
fallen to the same levels as during the boom of the late 1980s. Overtime
hours worked, at 9.08m, were the lowest since April.
'The speed with which the labour market is responding to the economy's
recovery appears to reflect a rebound from rapid job cuts during the
recession,' said Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers. 'The
recent faster drop in unemployment suggests that overall employment in the
economy may now be rising, whereas the drops in unemployment earlier this
year mainly reflected a shrinking workforce.'
Other figures from the department show that the workforce in employment in
the UK was 29.934m in June this year. This represents a rise of 42,000 in
the second quarter but a fall of 523,000 over the year to June.
The number of people on youth training in August in England, Wales and
Scotland dropped by 1.5 per cent compared with a year ago. Starts on youth
training over the three months to August were 5 per cent lower than over the
same period a year earlier.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Average earnings growth down to 3% in September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERLYING growth in average earnings fell to a historic low of 3 per cent
in September, Department of Employment figures showed yesterday.
The government's figures follow reports from independent research
organisations, including Incomes Data Services, that basic pay settlements
have bottomed out and may be set to increase again.
However, the official figures cover more than basic pay settlements. For
example, they include overtime payments, which after a slight increase in
July fell back in August and September.
The government figures show that underlying average earnings growth for the
12 months to the end of September fell to 3 per cent from 3.25 per cent in
August.
Separate sector rates were 2.5 per cent for services (from 2.75 per cent on
August), 4.5 per cent in production industries and 4.5 per cent in
manufacturing. The latter two were stable.
There are two main influences on this fall in earnings growth, which is at
its lowest since a temporary incomes policy in the late 1960s.
First, the public-sector pay ceiling set at 1.5 per cent by Mr Norman
Lamont, the former chancellor, is depressing average pay settlements and
reducing the overall service sector average. Workers covered by the ceiling
make up about one quarter of the sector.
The second factor was that manufacturing output faltered in the third
quarter of 1993, resulting in a decrease in overtime working in
manufacturing.
Manufacturing output per head in September grew by 4.9 per cent in the three
months to September compared with the same three months a year earlier, down
from 5.2 per cent in the three months to August.
Unit wage costs dropped 0.6 per cent over the same period, a lower fall than
in the three months to August, when they fell 0.8 per cent.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Building society net inflows soar in 'depressed' market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies attracted Pounds 258m in a net inflow of funds last month
 -just over double the net inflow in September, which itself ended three
months of net outflows.
But Building Societies Association figures for October underlined the
fragility of the housing market as net new commitments fell slightly on the
previous month.
While some of the rise in funds was caused by savings for Christmas and the
end of the holiday period, the association believes it also reflected
societies' success in broadening their product range.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the association, highlighted the
success of postal savings accounts, for which slightly higher interest rates
than those on offer in branches are available.
With mortgage demand low, one main concern is to maintain the existing pool
of savings in the face of fierce competition from banks and other forms of
savings such as unit trusts.
But Mr Coles warned that the continuing subdued level of new commitments
implied that net lending for the year would be below 1992 levels. Net new
commitments came to Pounds 2.5bn last month compared with Pounds 2.6bn in
September. 'The housing market is still very depressed,' he said.
He added that transactions would be higher than in 1992 only because of the
government's package of measures for housing associations at the start of
the year, and urged the government to use the Budget 'to reaffirm its
commitment to home ownership in order to strengthen the recovery'.
There was also modest cause for encouragement among societies at the fall in
repayments of principal as borrowers remortgage.
Other recent figures suggest that building societies have been losing out to
banks when people remortgage, as borrowers have taken advantage of banks'
fixed-rate mortgages. October's figure for repayments was Pounds 1.8bn,
slightly down on September's Pounds 1.9bn.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Property: Building on trust - The impact of property owning
charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development trusts are treading where private sector property companies dare
not venture. The trusts - property owning charities - are making a big
impact in the regeneration of urban and rural areas, traditionally no-go
areas for property companies. But the trusts are a fragile breed: of about
100 in England and Wales, probably 10 are financially self-sufficient.
In many cases trusts behave like property companies, trying to develop and
exploit assets to generate income. But the purpose behind the creation of
trust assets is infinitely varied.
A trust may be set up to support the business plans of young people, as in
the case of Foothold Trust in Llanelli, south Wales, to hasten improvements
on a housing estate, as in the case of Queens Pythian Development Trust in
Liverpool, or to encourage wealth creation, as in the case of Moss Side and
Hulme Community Trust in Manchester.
Instead of distributing profits to shareholders, the trusts funnel their
surplus back into the community in the form of grants or new schemes. The
majority of trusts are registered charities. They reflect local ambitions
and aim to respond to local needs.
Because social and economic needs are more acute in poorer or derelict
areas, the opportunities to tap potential investment targets are not
immediately obvious to private sector companies: a town office development
points towards easier profits than a mixed development in a bleak suburb or
on a ramshackle estate.
The existence of a trust frequently reflects a community group trying to
fill a business gap in a way which provides a spin-off for the locality.
In Birmingham, for example, the St Peter's Urban Village Trust started when
a local group organised a financial package in 1985 to buy a Church of
England training college and its grounds, which could not find a commercial
buyer.
Other trusts started because of historical quirks. The largest and oldest
with about Pounds 20m of assets is the North Kensington Amenity Trust. It
started in 1970 when local authorities sought to placate a community angered
by the building of the overhead A40(M) in west London by offering to give
over for community use 23 acres of land beneath the motorway. Similarly,
community opposition to office development plans on the south bank of the
Thames eventually led to Coin Street Community Builders - a coalition of
local residents - winning ownership of 13 acres of riverfront land from the
Greater London Council.
Ownership of land and buildings is the key to financial self-sufficiency for
trusts. The problem for younger trusts is the difficulty of setting up an
adequate asset base. Ms Angela Monaghan, director of the Development Trusts
Association, which brings together about half the trusts in England and
Wales, says there are three main problems.
First, it is now more difficult for local authorities to dispose of land at
less than the highest price offered; authorities have to sell to the highest
bidder unless the environment secretary agrees otherwise.
Second, some types of grant aid, such as regional selective assistance, are
not available to registered charities. This may prove of less significance
following the government's announcement this month that it is to consolidate
its urban spending programmes.
Third is the shortage of development finance. Trusts are not taken seriously
by financial institutions. 'There is a finance gap,' she says.
The gap has widened since the collapse of the property market in 1989 and
does not look like improving until the market revives and banks overcome
their ambivalence towards property lending. It is doubtful whether today it
would be possible to obtain a 100 per cent mortgage of the type provided to
St Peter's by National Westminster in 1985.
As a result, trusts have been pushed back on to an increasingly financially
constrained public sector for support, encouraging them to win a role in
established programmes such as City Challenge, which funnels government
funding into closely defined geographical areas. If trusts can hang on they
may find their futures secure as the successors to such programmes, which
generally are of limited duration.
'They are operating in marginal areas where they require some public-sector
finance to make them work,' Ms Monaghan said. 'If they're not given support,
through revenue or capital assets, they won't become self-sufficient.'
Even when self-sufficiency has been achieved, the line between failure and
financial stability is slim. North Kensington Amenity Trust, for example, is
negotiating with the Department of Transport, its freeholder since the
demise of the Greater London Council, on its ground rent. The department is
obliged to charge a commercial rent. Previously the trust paid peppercorn
rent. Payment of a commercial rent would wipe the trust out.
St Peter's trust in Birmingham has been in modest financial surplus, Pounds
40,323 in the year to last April; it makes its money from workshops,
offices, student accommodation, a youth hostel, shop and social club, while
providing a centre for sports and cultural activities. But St Peter's trust
has to find Pounds 74,000 to meet new environmental health regulations on
its student accommodation. It is still searching for the cheapest finance.
Such demands for higher expenditure have come when market conditions have
increased the vulnerability of the trusts. Like their private sector peers,
they have had to cope with a shift in the balance of power from the property
owner to the occupier as demand for space has dropped during the recession.
At North Kensington trust, rental income for the year to last April was
marginally higher than the year before at Pounds 866,778. At St Peter's,
income for the 12 months to April was slightly lower than the previous year
at Pounds 323,491.
These overall figures hide big changes. Office rents at North Kensington
trust are down to Pounds 9 a square foot from a high of Pounds 20 sq ft in
the late 1980s. The trust has a waiting list for craft workshops, but
instead of being able to lease the space, it is obliged to license the space
for six- or nine-month spells. At one stage St Peter's had a third of its
workshop space vacant as small companies succumbed to recession. Now it has
only one, but it has refused to discount its Pounds 3.50 rental.
The trusts need a revival of economic activity and a return of business
confidence, the necessary precursors of a wider demand for space, as much as
any property company.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Credit demand growth below expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK DEMAND for credit across the personal and corporate sectors was
reflected in Bank of England figures yesterday.
Lending to the private sector by banks and building societies was a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.8bn last month, slightly below economists'
expectations.
The year-on-year growth rate dropped to 3 per cent from 3.3 per cent in
September. It stood only marginally higher than the 30-year low of 2.9 per
cent reached in July.
Although bank and building society lending - M4 lending - is expanding, the
growth rate has slowed considerably since the beginning of the year when it
was about 4 per cent.
'In the medium term these figures are encouraging because they do show
credit demand expanding,' said Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities.
'But they are starting from a very weak base, a clear sign of the fragility
of the recovery.'
In the three months to October, M4 lending grew a seasonally adjusted 3.9
per cent while in the latest six months it was 3.5 per cent higher.
M4 itself - the broad measure of money supply - also rose in October. It was
up 1 per cent on the month, the largest monthly rise since November 1990.
The year-on-year rate picked up from 3.9 per cent in September to 4.3 per
cent, to remain close to the floor of the government's monitoring range of 3
per cent to 9 per cent.
The Bank said the rise in M4 appeared to reflect a big inflow of overseas
capital into the UK.
Other figures yesterday - from the British Bankers' Association - showed
that total sterling lending to the private sector by the main banking groups
rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.949bn in October following September's
fall of Pounds 183m.
The bulk of the lending was to the financial sector. Borrowing by the rest
of the company sector fell, even though October was a corporation tax-paying
month. Mortgage lending continued to grow steadily but demand for consumer
credit was weak, the association said.
The figures suggested that lending to securities dealers continues to
inflate credit growth. Last month loans to securities dealers and money
brokers by the major banking groups jumped by Pounds 1.3bn, the biggest rise
since figures began in 1986.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Rolls-Royce to shed 1,000 more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and industrial power group, is to shed an
additional 1,000 jobs in its UK aerospace operations next year because of
continuing difficult trading conditions in its civil and defence aero-engine
businesses.
The latest restructuring, confirmed yesterday by the company, will increase
the total of job cuts in its aerospace activities to 3,000 next year on top
of the 3,000 jobs it is losing this year.
The company announced last year that it planned to shed 5,000 jobs in 1993
and 1994 in the face of the prolonged recession in the civil aerospace
market and the post-cold war downturn in the defence sector.
It said the need to make additional reductions at its aero-engine plants in
Derby, Bristol, Sunderland, East Kilbride and Hillingdon, near Glasgow,
followed a continuing review of requirements.
The company has not ruled out compulsory redundancies.
Although Rolls-Royce this week announced new civil aero-engine orders worth
about Pounds 150m, it said overall conditions in the civil aircraft market
were not improving.
It added that the Pounds 230m provisions it made in its 1992 accounts to
cover the two-year 1993-94 restructuring programme would also cover the
additional 1,000 job cuts next year.
In total, the company will now see its aerospace workforce reduced from
29,000 people at the end of last year to 23,000 by the end of next year.
The additional cuts are expected to involve about 350 jobs at Bristol, where
the company's military engine business is concentrated, about 140 jobs at
Derby, the centre for civil engines, with the rest spread around the
company's other UK plants.
The UK group is facing intense commercial pressures from its two bigger US
competitors, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, which have also been
engaged in heavy restructuring.
All three big aero-engine makers are fighting to win new business in a
diminishing market depressed by airline losses, overcapacity and defence
spending cuts.
Rolls-Royce, whose aero-engine activities mustered a profit of only Pounds
5m on aero-engine sales of Pounds 1.078bn in the first half of this year, is
also facing heavy research and development spending on its new generation of
high-thrust Trent engines. These are to power the new large wide-body
aircraft being developed by Boeing of the US and the European Airbus
consortium.
Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce chairman, recently said he did not expect to
see any recovery in the civil aircraft market before 1995 or 1996.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Redundancy terms accepted at pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS at the Calverton colliery in Nottinghamshire yesterday agreed to
accept enhanced redundancy terms in a move which suggests that British
Coal's pre-privatisation pit closures programme will meet less resistance
than ministers had feared.
The vote among the more than 550 men is the first in favour of accepting
closure proposals since British Coal began closures among its 30 remaining
pits two weeks ago.
It is likely to influence similar votes expected at five other pits where
British Coal has already called for talks on prospects with union leaders,
usually a prelude to closure.
British Coal yesterday confirmed closure plans for one of them, Hatfield in
South Yorkshire, amid criticism from management of the pit's performance.
The company also wants to close Frickley and Bentley in South Yorkshire.
The Calverton miners had been advised by leaders of the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers, which represents them, to resist closure by referring the plans
to the industry's review procedure which can delay closures for nine months.
However, in a pithead ballot they voted by 367 to 131 for an enhanced
redundancy package which could mean the longest serving miners receiving
Pounds 44,000 pay-offs.
The terms are thought to be the best received by miners leaving the
industry. They would have been jeopardised if the miners had fought closure.
Mr John Breward, Calverton branch secretary, said he was disappointed by the
result but added that British Coal would have closed the pit whatever miners
had voted.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Hurd touts European credentials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, will today outline the government's
'wholehearted' commitment to the European Union in a move designed to
outline the party's pro-European credentials.
In a speech to the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce tonight, Mr Hurd will
attempt to set a new pro-European agenda and implicitly urge Euro-sceptics
to accept that the party's damaging battle over Maastricht is over.
A draft of his speech says: 'We have no doubts about our place at the heart
of Europe. The United Kingdom decided on its European destiny almost a
generation ago. There is no need to fight that battle over again. Nor do we
need to re-enact the battle of Maastricht.'
Mr Hurd's speech follows remarks by three key economic ministers at this
week's Confederation of British Industry conference in Harrogate, at which
they attempted to regain ground lost to the right at the party conference.
The left of the party were dismayed by speeches by ministers such as Mr
Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, which had drawn applause for
attacks on the European Commission.
Mr Hurd is determined that the party should unite round a policy that is
'wholeheartedly committed to the European Union' but which is not afraid to
argue Britain's interests within the Community.
He will tell his audience that the battle to convince Britain's European
partners that economic problems will not be solved by increasing regulatory
burdens on businesses will continue.
But the draft goes on: 'The fact that we argue with our partners in Europe,
that we disagree with them on many things, most obviously about the
prospects for early movement towards monetary union, does not mean that
Europe is irretrievably divided. The days of a divided Europe are over.'
The foreign secretary will also argue for an enlarged Europe expanding to
the north and east which is in tune with business opinion and public
opinion. And he will claim that the government 'is second to none' in its
idealism on Europe.
Meanwhile, Mr Geoffrey Martin, head of the European Commission's UK offices,
has warned of a 'democratic deficit' in Westminster about the UK's future in
Europe. He defined the 'deficit' as a 'lack of transparency and
accountability' and a gap between what people needed and what was negotiated
on their behalf.
He said at Hull University that unless MPs recognised their
responsibilities, 'the dangerous democratic deficit about Europe will
continue to exist'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership,
gaining eligibility for European Union intervention funding subsidy looked
brighter last night.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, yesterday met Mr Karel Van Miert, EU
competition commissioner, and argued for the first time that Swan Hunter
should be eligible alone, rather than as part of funding for all the UK's
warship yards.
Mr Sainsbury said it had been a positive meeting and expected a decision
within the next month.
Access to intervention funding, which provides a 9 per cent subsidy on
merchant shipbuilding orders, would enhance the sale prospects of the yard,
which has been in receivership since May.

Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, said
yesterday.
He told the autumn conference of the pensions industry trade association
that the government should give benefits to those most in need.
At present those whose only income is the state pension are considered to be
eligible for supplemental social security benefits.
Mr Amy said that when the state pension was introduced the link between old
age and poverty had been much clearer. Now, roughly a third of pensioners
were well off relative to the working population, making the case for a
universal pension provision less convincing. Mr Amy also said that any
increase on taxes on pension schemes in the Budget will reduce benefits for
7m scheme members and run counter to the government's policy of encouraging
private pension provision.
Professor Roy Goode, chairman of the government's advisory pension law
review committee, told the conference that undue alarm had been created
about proposals to require pension schemes to meet minimum solvency
standards.
The committee had recommended that schemes be required to have assets
sufficient to meet 100 per cent of their liabilities if they were wound up
immediately, a measure which some actuaries have warned could force schemes
to sell up to Pounds 150bn in equities and buy gilts instead.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Pair of commodes sold for Pounds 991,500
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAIR OF mahogany commodes made in the 1750s, probably by the royal cabinet
maker William Vile, sold for Pounds 991,500 at Sotheby's last night. The
buyer was a private collector and the price was more than twice the
estimate.
The commodes were the highlight of a successful auction of English furniture
which totalled Pounds 4.85m - against a Pounds 2m pre-sale forecast. The
collection was acquired in the 1940s and 1950s by Eric B. Moller, the
shipowner, who settled at Thorncombe Park in Surrey. It is regarded as one
of the finest collections of English furniture to appear on the market in
recent years and the prices paid suggested that the best 18th century
English furniture is approaching in value French furniture of the same
period.
A pair of rococo mirrors, carved by Matthias Lock and, as the commodes,
created to furnish Hampden House in Buckinghamshire, made Pounds 397,500,
also way above target.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Wholesale electricity prices rise 23%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES IN the wholesale electricity market for England and Wales were 23 per
cent higher in the first half of the year than in the same period last year,
an analysis published yesterday by the consultancy group Caminus Energy
shows, Michael Smith writes.
The findings will fuel demands from heavy electricity consumers for Offer,
the electricity regulator, to take action to stem the price rises.
Offer is already considering whether to refer National Power and PowerGen,
the generators, to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over their role in
the increases.
Caminus found that uplift payments that are levied to pay for the
administration of the market, called the pool, rose by 80 per cent in the
first half. The average pool selling price was Pounds 28.50 per MWh between
January and June.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Community day of peace takes place in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TENS of thousands of people took part in a community day of peace in towns
across Northern Ireland yesterday in a powerful call to loyalist and
republican terrorists to abandon their campaigns of violence.
Up to 30,000 people participated in the biggest demonstration, in Belfast.
Thousands more attended 11 rallies held in other towns.
The event was organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in response to
a perceived groundswell in the community in favour of a fresh effort at
reconciliation.
The Confederation of British Industry encouraged companies to allow
employees to attend demonstrations. A 'vote for peace' telephone line
received more than 100,000 calls.
In Dublin Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, led members of the Dail in
observing the minute's silence. At about the same time shops, offices and
businesses throughout the republic halted for a minute's silence.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Ministers step up Ulster efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is poised to step up efforts to secure agreement on a form of
devolved government for Northern Ireland by holding new talks with the
province's leading politicians.
Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, plans to use a new round of
bilateral meetings to pave the way for the government to table its promised
outline of the most likely route for reaching a settlement.
The aim of the new round will be to gauge how the province's four
constitutional parties can be coaxed closer to consensus on the form that
devolution will take and how relations between Northern Ireland and Dublin
are to be managed. The eventual outline would form a large part of the
proposals promised by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons
yesterday.
One possibility would be the revival of an assembly for Northern Ireland
with the rights of the Roman Catholic minority protected by mechanisms such
as weighted majority voting and a right of appeal to Westminster. It is
unlikely that any assembly would have powers to draft legislation, at least
initially.
It is unclear whether such an outline could secure the backing of the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party.
Whitehall officials know they only have one chance to devise an outline that
the parties would be prepared to use as a basis for negotiation if the
prospects of a settlement are not to be set back.
Mr Ancram's initiative follows his completion of a series of exploratory
meetings at which the four constitutional parties mapped out their
positions. The move underlines the government's determination to press on
with the talks process in spite of doubts over the participation of the Rev
Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist Party.
The DUP has said it will not return to the talks until Mr John Hume, leader
of the SDLP, calls a halt to his meetings with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president. But DUP officials indicated privately this week that they had not
ruled out further meetings with the government if they focused on the
party's Breaking The Logjam peace plan.
Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein yesterday insisted he had spoken with UK
government representatives in a series of meetings ending last summer. He
said he hoped the dialogue - which the government has bluntly denied - would
be renewed 'now that the ice has been broken'.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Prison officers' dispute curbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, yesterday won a High Court injunction
preventing the Prison Officers' Association from stepping up its industrial
action next week.
The association had threatened to stop accepting most admissions to prisons
for three days starting on Monday - a move the Prison Service management had
warned would represent a serious threat to law and order.
A High Court judge, Mr Justice May, yesterday accepted the government's
arguments that, because prison officers hold the office of constables, they
are not protected under employment law if they take industrial action that
breaches their contracts.
However, the judge agreed with lawyers for the association that the logical
consequences of his ruling meant the association could no longer effectively
act as a trade union.
He added that it was 'remarkable' that it had been treated as a union for so
long without the issue of its protection under employment law being
challenged.
Mr John Bartell, the association's chairman, said the union was certain to
appeal against the injunction and would continue the legal fight as long as
necessary.
He said: 'The home secretary now has a major problem on his hands. This
ruling is only part of a long legal process.
'In the long run, the courts will vindicate the fact that we are a trade
union. I do not believe the public will allow this shabby recourse to the
courts to create another GCHQ.'
The association's national executive was last night meeting to discuss its
next move.
Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, welcomed the
injunction. He denied it had been sought as a back-door means of breaking
the association, saying the management wished to have constructive relations
with prison staff.
The injunction had been sought 'with the greatest of reluctance' and only
because of the seriousness of the action threatened.
Had the action gone ahead, an extra 1,700 prisoners would have had to be
accommodated in police cells by next Wednesday.
A ballot of the association's membership last month approved action short of
an all-out strike to protest against the government's market-testing
proposals. It has already begun limited action in the form of a
work-to-rule.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Strike shipyard may lay off 750
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YARROW Shipbuilders on Clydeside proposes to lay off half of its 1,500
manual workers from Monday and cut back production in the face of an
official strike by the company's 600 white collar staff which has lasted 10
days.
Staff belonging to the MSF general technical union are demanding pay rises
equal to the 3.7 per cent plus Pounds 300 deal secured by manual workers at
the yard in February after a bitter dispute.
The company has withdrawn a 'final' offer to the staff of a basic 1.8 per
cent wage rise plus a further award of up to 2.6 per cent based on the
introduction of a performance-related pay scheme.
Talks were going on last night over the lay offs, but the two sides were not
in pay negotiations.
Yarrow said it would try to keep the shipyard open through rotation of its
manual workers, but pointed out that the skilled supervisors were on strike
and only 30 managers were available to do their work.
The yard is building three Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy and two
frigates for Malaysia.
Ms Jane Lindsay, one of the white collar staff strike leaders, called
yesterday for a return to the negotiating table. 'We have been negotiating
with the company for the past two-and-a-half years and management has
offered nothing new,' she said.
'All we want is equal treatment with the manual workers.
'Surely it is not too much to expect a little bit of social justice for the
workforce so we can carry on with the business of building ships and getting
more orders for the yard?'
Union officials said they would like Acas, the conciliation service, to
intervene, accusing Yarrow senior management of being too abrasive.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Miners' consortium in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Monktonhall Mineworkers, the consortium of miners who lease a
British Coal pit near Edinburgh, was uncertain last night after the miners
decisively rejected a takeover offer from RJB Mining, the quoted
Nottinghamshire mining company.
Monktonhall also dismissed Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh-based merchant bank
which was the consortium's financial adviser. There were indications that
the consortium was holding talks with another, unnamed, investor.
RJB Mining had offered the 167 miners Pounds 1,000 each for their shares,
for which each had paid Pounds 10,000. Quayle Munro had warned the miners
that if they refused the offer, and in the absence of a rival bid, the
company would be likely to go into liquidation.
Monktonhall has net liabilities of Pounds 2m and lost Pounds 3.7m in the
year ended May 1993.
Although RJB Mining was approached by Quayle Munro for Monktonhall, and its
offer was recommended by the consortium's board, it was seen by many of the
miners as a hostile takeover. RJB, which had been guaranteeing the workers'
wages since September, insisted on 90 per cent acceptance. RJB said last
night it would not extend the offer. The number of acceptances was not
revealed.
The rejection means the mine will not get the Pounds 3m investment RJB had
offered, while an offer of finance from the Department of Trade and Industry
could also lapse. But Lothian regional council said last night its own
package of assistance would be available 'to support any credible proposals
that are acceptable to the men'.
Mr Ian Jones, Quayle Munro's chief executive, said there had not been 'the
necessary close liaison with the directors of Monktonhall and ourselves'.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Bonuses at Goldman point to City bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN, ANTONIA SHARPE and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN SACHS, the US investment bank, kicked off the annual round of bonus
awards in the City yesterday, at the end of a year when record profits at
many securities houses and investment banks have fuelled hopes of hefty
rewards.
'The level of bonuses in the City this year will be very varied - it ranges
from 20 or 25 per cent of basic (salary) to multiples of basic,' said Mr
Roger Steere, director of executive recruitment at Jonathan Wren. For
traders earning a basic salary of Pounds 50,000, this could mean total
remuneration of Pounds 200,000 or more.
At the top of the bonus league are the proprietary traders - also known as
arbitrage dealers - who use their bank's own capital to take large positions
on the market, which can generate massive returns: some of them are
expecting bonuses of Pounds 1m or more.
One beneficiary of additional emoluments at Goldman is Mr Michael Sherwood,
28, an executive director in charge of new bond issues, who will be given
some of the credit for Goldman's leap to the top of the Eurobond league
table. As well as a huge bonus which other dealers reckon could top Dollars
1m, Mr Sherwood could be in line for a partnership, when new partners are
next appointed in November 1994.
The level of Goldman awards will fuel expectations at other houses: in a
memo to London staff, the partnership announced a 30 per cent year-end bonus
for all locally hired employees. This is on top of personal bonuses awarded
for individual performance, about which the firm started to inform staff on
Monday.
Goldman's November year-end means it is ahead of the field in deciding bonus
levels. Some companies do not pay out until March or April next year.
City traders are particularly optimistic about bonuses this year because the
bull market has helped them exceed the targets which were set at the
beginning of the year.
But banks and securities houses are becoming wary about the size of payouts.
Some are trying to defer some payments of bonuses by offering shares, or
options on shares, so that employees have a stake in the company. This is
particularly true at senior levels: for example, the highest-paid employees
at Salomon Brothers may get up to half their bonuses in shares.
But traders and sales staff without any management responsibility are keen
on cash. 'Dealers tend to get pretty substantial cash bonuses, and that's
what they are working for,' said Sir John Trelawny, senior partner at GKR,
the headhunter. He pointed out that bonuses are seen as compensation for
working in a demanding and risky business, without long-term prospects.
One 27-year old German government bond trader said: 'Most people live off
their basic and save their bonus . . . they realise things may not last for
ever.'
The bonus bonanza has also made it more difficult - or more expensive - to
recruit staff. Those in line for big bonuses effectively 'have a price on
their head,' says Mr Steere. 'They expect to be given upfront compensation
for bonuses' they will miss if they move to another job.
This year's bull market has revived the jobs market in the City, and upped
the stakes. For example, in a recent spate of hirings in the gilts market by
houses which are planning to become gilts marketmakers, Yamaichi
International (Europe), and Merrill Lynch have had to to pay dearly for
qualified staff, with market rumours circulating of seven-digit salaries and
three-year guaranteed contracts.
The size of bonuses and the number of calls which traders have been
receiving from headhunters may have brought back memories of the heady days
of the 1980s.
However, this time round most City pros are playing safe. Bonus cheques are
being deposited in the bank or used to pay off mortgages. 'It's the sign of
the top of the market, and there's no doubt that next year will be very
tough,' said one syndicate manager.
However, some Goldman employees were making more exciting, but still
relatively conservative plans: 'I'm going for a two-week skiing holiday  -
skiing is the best way to escape,' he said. 'Things are a bit different. In
the 1980s, people would have gone out and bought a Porsche 911.'

<TEXT>
SOUTH YORKSHIRE Passenger Transport Authority yesterday announced the sale
of Mainline Group, its bus company, to an employee buy-out but complained it
had been done under pressure from the government.
Mr Jack Meredith, chairman, said: 'The authority has fought long and hard
for seven years to keep Mainline a publicly owned company but
ever-increasing government pressure has forced our hand.'
The buy-out team is understood to be paying Pounds 1m for the company spread
over five years. Mainline has a fleet of 880 vehicles and 2,640 employees
and is the main bus operator in Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Scots enterprise bodies to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS committee on Scotland is to inquire into the workings of
Scottish Enterprise, the network of enterprise agencies in Scotland set up
in 1991.
The inquiry, to include Highlands and Islands Enterprise, will look into
recent claims by the Scottish media and opposition politicians that the
network is ineffective.
Scottish Enterprise has also attracted criticism over potential conflicts of
interest involving board members of the local enterprise companies.
Scottish Enterprise sees the select committee inquiry, which will take place
in the new year, as a chance to rebut criticism and to present its record to
detailed scrutiny.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Finance director at Independent is asked to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDEPENDENT newspaper has asked for the resignation of Ms Suzanna
Taverne, its finance director, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Ms Taverne, who was appointed finance director in March 1992, is eight
months pregnant and was about to take maternity leave. The Independent is an
Opportunity 2000 employer - part of the campaign to boost the position of
women in the workplace.
It is believed that Ms Taverne, who joined The Independent in 1990 from
merchant bank SG Warburg as a strategic planning executive, was told that
her job was to be offered to Mr Graham Luff, managing director of Newspaper
Publishing, the company that publishes both The Independent and the
Independent on Sunday.
The changes flow from a restructuring of management following the arrival of
Mr Patrick Morrissey as chief executive.
Mr Luff, a qualified accountant, is now expected to return to the finance
role while Ms Taverne has been offered the opportunity of working out her
one-year notice at the paper in her original post of strategic planning. It
is believed she is in negotiations over severance terms.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Small business package aims to tackle late payers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE PAYMENT of debts has become such an important issue for small
businesses that Lloyds Bank has made advice on dealing with delayed payments
a key feature of its package for new business clients.
The package, which will be launched today, includes a free subscription to
the Dun and Bradstreet business development service. This element, worth up
to Pounds 1,500, offers information on assessing the credit-worthiness of
potential trading clients, and a fast invoice collection service, including
payment reminder letters and a debtor-tracing service. The package launch is
the second move by Lloyds in the small business market recently. In October
it announced that it was cutting the charges on its standard tariff for
small businesses.
However, small organisations believe that banks are more interested in
attracting new clients than in giving a better deal to their existing small
business customers who have survived the recession.
New clients with Lloyds-approved business plans will also have access to a
two-year fixed rate starter loan of 9.5 per cent. Those in credit or within
a Pounds 100 overdraft will receive a year's free banking. 'Young businesses
are often so keen to make sales that they do not stop to consider the risks.
All too often these only become apparent when it is too late,' said Mr Mike
Shaw, the bank's head of business banking.
Lloyds recognises that the new offer means there may be some new clients on
more favourable arrangements than existing customers, but says it wants to
give new companies a better chance of survival.
Dun and Bradstreet says that on average UK companies wait 20 days longer
after the due payment date than their French counterparts the next-worst
payers in Europe.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Graphology 'a waste of money'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN MCGOOKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES which use handwriting analysis as part of their recruitment
process are wasting their money, a leading psychologist claimed yesterday.
Dr Donald McLeod, a corporate psychologist with the Independent Assessment
and Research Centre at Ashridge Management College, said: 'If you're using
graphology as an indicator of people's effectiveness in the workplace, you
might as well throw a sheaf of application forms out the window and choose
those that land face up.'
In a report for the British Psychological Society, Dr McLeod - previously
chief psychologist for the Civil Service Commission - points to recent
research which he says indicates that a full-scale psychometric test is the
most effective way of studying a potential employee's suitability.
Graphology is firmly at the bottom, producing 'zero predictive
effectiveness', Dr McLeod said.
But the report was attacked as 'alarming' by Ms Mary Nicholson, head of the
London-based Graphology Business, which provides a handwriting consultancy
service to corporate clients.
'Graphology is based on a very precise theory, with practitioners needing to
use their psychological knowledge to be able to understand very precise
signs,' she said.
While the use of handwriting analysis is not widespread in the UK - in some
US states it is prohibited for recruitment purposes - some notable employers
do use graphology tests. For example, all applicants to merchant bank SG
Warburg must submit handwriting samples for anal-ysis.
The bank stresses it takes the results seriously, but says the handwriting
test comes towards the end of a lengthy selection procedure and that a
candidate would not be rejected solely on the basis of it.
Analysis in recruitment seems to be accorded more credibility in France, but
may be less significant than in recent years.
For example, Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, says that while it once
used handwriting analysis to sift application forms in the first instance,
it now only refers to a graphologist where there might be a doubt about a
candidate, and even then the candidate would be called back for a further
interview.
'We never make a decision based on a graphologist's comments,' says the
company's human resources department, calling the analysis 'a tool' used to
contribute to the overall picture of a candid-ate.
French headhunters would tend to use a graphologist's services, but other
testing methods are also employed.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Corporate funds for arts down 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS sponsorship of the arts fell by 13 per cent to Pounds 57.69m in the
year to the end of March, the Association for Business Sponsorship of the
Arts said yesterday. It is the first annual decline the association has
recorded.
Company expenditure on events such as concerts, art exhibitions, opera and
dance performances was only slightly down, from Pounds 45m to Pounds 44.4m.
But contributions to capital projects fell to Pounds 5.4m from Pounds 12.5m.
This was due partly to the near-completion of the new Glyndebourne Festival
Theatre, the largest privately funded arts project in the UK.
Involvement in corporate membership schemes - an important source of revenue
for large arts companies such as the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden - and
the Royal National Theatre, marked time in 1992-93 at Pounds 7.9m. It
remains a considerable retrenchment on the Pounds 12.5m that companies paid
for guaranteed seats at the opera and ballet in 1990-91, before the
recession forced many to economise on corporate entertaining.
Mr Colin Tweedy, the association's director-general, said the main reasons
for the fall in expenditure were the disappearance of the Japan Festival and
the Glyndebourne factor.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR PRODUCTION in October fell 1 per cent from the same month a year before
as declining sales of new cars in continental Europe affected UK output for
export markets.
Export production in October fell 20.6 per cent to 55,001 while output for
the domestic market rose 27 per cent to 61,425 according to the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Overall, UK car output in October totalled
116,426 compared with 117,647 in the same month a year before. Production of
commercial vehicles, still depressed, fell 4.1 per cent in October to 18,687
from 19,486 a year before.
Commercial vehicle production in the first 10 months of the year has fallen
by 25.2 per cent to 160,218.
UK carmakers continue to perform much more strongly than most of Europe.
Output in the first 10 months of the year, at 1,160,193, was 7.5 per cent
higher than a year before compared with steep falls in Germany, France,
Italy and Spain.
UK car output is being increased by production at the new plants under
development by Honda and Toyota. Recovery in domestic new-car demand has
also helped.
UK sales of new cars have risen 12.1 per cent in the first 10 months of the
year compared with a 15.3 per cent decline in the overall west European
market.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Watchdog reassured on power reliability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OVERALL reliability and security of the electricity transmission and
distribution systems in England, Scotland and Wales have been maintained
since privatisation, Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry
regulator, said yesterday.
In his annual report on the industry, he detailed the performance of
individual electricity supply companies by supplying data on the number of
interruptions and the time taken to restore supplies.
These showed wide variations, with London Electricity suffering fewer than
50 supply interruptions per 100 customers while South Wales Electricity
(Swalec) and Hydro-Electric suffered about four times as many. But several
of the regional electricity companies in England and Wales reported
exceptional weather conditions which added to operating difficulties.
Prof Littlechild said many electricity companies were now targeting the
high-voltage system as the best way to increase overall performance at
lowest cost. He said he would ensure that customers gained the best value
for money.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Aim is for more police efficiency -
Criminal justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT stages of the government's pledge to give priority to fighting
crime will be contained in a wide-ranging Criminal Justice Bill.
It will address an array of issues, from providing stronger powers to detain
young offenders to abolishing suspects' right to silence and applying
tighter restrictions on the granting of bail.
A separate Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill announced in yesterday's
Queen's Speech is designed to make the police service and administration of
local courts more efficient.
The Bill will:
Abolish the suspect's so called right to silence, allowing courts to draw an
inference from a suspect's refusal to answer questions at the police station
or during court proceedings.
Tighten the bail laws by giving powers of immediate arrest for breach of
police bail, allowing the prosecution to apply for bail to be revoked and
removing the presumption in favour of bail for people alleged to have
offended while on bail.
Introduce powers to send children as young as 12 to a new generation of
secure training centres for persistent offenders for up to two years
Strengthen the criminal law and introduce a new procedure for evicting
squatters within 24 hours.
Tighten the trespass laws to deal with hunt saboteurs and New Age
travellers.
The Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill contains measures to streamline the
administration of magistrates' courts in England and Wales, by consolidating
management areas and giving the Lord Chancellor power to approve important
appointments, including those of justices' clerks, and to vary their
standard terms of employment - a decision which the clerks say threatens
their judicial independence.
The bill will set a core of national objectives for the police service,
while at the same time giving chief constables greater managerial and
financial flexibility. Its most controversial proposal is to streamline
police authorities, reducing local authority representation and giving the
home secretary powers to appoint members.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, announced a 27-point programme against
crime at the Conservative Party conference last month and has since declared
repeatedly that 'prison works'.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Councils and water to be reformed -
Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to reform Scotland's local government and restructure its
water industry.
It will not be transferring water industry ownership to the private sector.
Council reform involves moving from the present two-tier system to a
single-tier system.
In a white paper in July the government proposed that the nine regional and
53 district councils be replaced by 25 unitary authorities. The three island
councils - Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles - would remain largely
unchanged.
The white paper proposed scrapping the Strathclyde region, centred on
Glasgow, which would be broken up into 10 councils.
It also proposed the break up of Lothian region, centred on Edinburgh.
Highland region, however, would remain intact while the eight district
councils within it would disappear.
Responsibility for water and sewerage would pass from the nine regional and
three island councils to three publicly owned water authorities, likely to
cover the east, west and north of the country.
The authorities will be expected to involve the private sector in the Pounds
5bn capital programme, thought to be needed over the next 15 years to bring
the system up to date and to meet higher European Union standards.
The new water and sewerage plants are likely to be provided by private
sector companies on a build, own and operate basis, which has the advantage
to the Treasury of not adding to the public sector borrowing requirement.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: DTI given powers to abolish 'red tape' -
De-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, ROLAND RUDD and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR said yesterday the government would 'sweep away red tape' by
repealing legislation in the biggest package of de-regulation since the
fifties.
The de-regulation bill will give sweeping powers to the Department of Trade
and Industry to abolish hundreds of regulations without having to refer to
parliament.
Labour yesterday criticised the government for trying to extend the power of
the executive by seeking to repeal existing instruments without specifying
in advance the legislation covered.
It also fears that the government will try to use a so-called Henry VIII
clause - allowing ministers to repeal primary legislation by order. The
clause gets its name by providing dictatorial powers similar to those of the
Tudor king.
Charter 88, the constitutional pressure group, said contemplation of the
Henry VIII clause 'heralded an elective tyranny' and warned of a new
authoritarianism in government.
Mr Stephen Alembritis of the Federation of Small Businesses said the
far-reaching powers were the key to giving momentum to the de-regulation
process.
He said: 'The de-regulation bill has been a long time coming, but its
inclusion in the speech reflects the priority the prime minister has given
to the initiative.'
Consumer organisations warned, however, that cutting red tape could sweep
away laws which protect health and safety, enforce standards across
industries and provide essential information for consumers.
'If ministers can do things virtually by decree,' said Mr Phillip Cullum of
the Consumers' Association, 'there will be a temptation to act without
consulting all interested parties.'
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, urged the
government to ensure that its de-regulation initiative continued beyond the
bill by taking other steps such as simplifying the valued added tax system
and strengthening the machinery for deregulation.
'One bill cannot put right the accumulated mistakes of decades and even
centuries of legislation,' he warned. He also called for abolition of the
statutory audit requirement for small firms.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, told union
members in Newcastle yesterday: 'Safety laws and regulations are not red
tape or burdens on business, they are the hallmark of civilisation and
contribute to high quality businesses.'
Seven business task forces are reviewing all regulations in everything from
health and safety rules, which label some common household products as
dangerous substances, to the regulations setting standards for outside
recreation.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the bill would lead to an
accumulation of changes and a significant cost reduction to business.
The bill will also include measures to remove obstacles to market-testing of
civil service work and contracting out in local government. These will make
it easier for ministers and local authorities to delegate powers to
contractors where that is barred by legislation.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Harsher penalties signal shift in
emphasis - Analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRIMINAL justice is a centrepiece of the government's legislative programme
for the second time in three years, but with an entirely different political
emphasis.
Three years ago, the bill leading to the 1991 Criminal Justice Act was
hailed as a progressive attempt to reduce Britain's relatively heavy use of
prison and shift to community-based penalties.
To the dismay of penal reformers, rising public concern about crime has
altered the government's priorities. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary,
announced a 27-point programme against crime at the Conservative Party
conference last month.
This session's criminal justice bill will give courts new powers to send
12-14 year old persistent offenders to secure training centres for up to two
years, and double from one to two years maximum sentences for 15-17 year
olds.
Ministers want to develop new-style training centres for 12-14 year olds,
concentrating on education and training and trying to break patterns of
offending behaviour.
A high proportion of crime is committed by the young. But penal reformers
believe that extending the use of custody for young people would aggravate
the youth crime problem. Mr Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of
the National Association of Probation Officers, described the forthcoming
bill as a 'miscellanea of counter productive ideas.'
The government's proposals came under immediate criticism from penal reform
groups, civil liberties organisations and lawyers. Liberty, the civil rights
group, said it would challenge the ending of the right to silence in the
European Court of Human Rights.
Ministers apparently now feel they must display unflinching willingness to
be tough on offenders, while trying to strengthen the fight against crime.
One way they propose stepping up the fight is through improved police
efficiency.
A police and magistrates courts bill will increase chief constables'
managerial flexibility, and make police authorities smaller and more
businesslike.
The police authority proposals, which will reduce local authority
representation and give the home secretary powers to nominate some members
and appoint chairmen and women, will face strong parliamentary opposition.
Chief constables and local authority representatives say the plans would
reduce public accountability.
The Law Society expressed dismay that the government did not propose any
measures to implement the central recommendations of the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice which reported in July. It had recommended the urgent
establishment of an independent criminal cases review authority to
investigate alleged wrongful convictions. The cost is thought to have been
too high for the Treasury.
But the likelihood of the government fighting crime while locked in a battle
with the police about pay and conditions has been reduced. The Police and
Magistrates' Courts Bill will implement some of the Sheehy inquiry proposals
for the police, but not the most controversial ones such as fixed-term
contracts for lower ranks and Sheehy's complex performance-related pay
formula.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Commons to vote soon - Sunday shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BILL to reform the outmoded Sunday shopping laws of England and Wales is
likely to be among the first to be introduced and could be one of the most
fiercely debated of the session.
The first reading is expected within days. The date being tipped for the
second reading is November 29, when MPs will vote on the principle of
reforming the 1950 Shops Act, and on the controversial issue of whether the
Bill provides adequate protection for Sunday workers.
A free vote on the three options for reform could be as early as December 8.
Following the decision by Keep Sunday Special Campaign and Retailers for
Shops Act Reform to combine their two options, the four choices in the draft
bill published in July have been reduced to three. They are:
Total deregulation.
Partial deregulation (proposed by the Shopping Hours Reform Council), with
small shops allowed to open at will, but larger shops restricted to six
hours.
Strict regulation (the KSSC/RSAR option), with large stores allowed to open
only on the four Sundays before Christmas, but DIY and garden centres, and
some small shops able to open every Sunday.
If no option gained an overall majority in December, the Bill would proceed
through standing committee and report stages with all options in place, and
MPs would get another opportunity to select one option at the third reading,
probably in February or March.
A group of lawyers involved in litigation on existing Sunday trading law
warned recently that some of the changes proposed by lobby groups would
create confusion and uncertainty for retailers, shoppers and the courts.
They warned that attempts to allow small shops to open for longer than large
ones might lead to long disputes about the sizes of shops.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Scots hazy on who supplies which service
 -Analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BILL to reform Scottish local government and to re-organise the water
and sewerage industry brings to parliament an issue that has already
generated intense controversy in Scotland.
The bill, likely to have more than 150 clauses, will be fought hard by the
opposition parties, and parts of it could even attract opposition from
Conservatives.
The aim of reforming Scottish local government, last reorganised in 1974, is
to make it simpler and easier to understand. Many Scots are still hazy about
which council - region or district - is responsible for which service.
Some of the regions have never supplanted the old counties in the public
mind.
Opinion polls suggest that there is a degree of acceptance of the idea of
moving to single-tier authorities, though there is argument as to whether it
will produce the financial savings in the medium term that the Scottish
Office expects.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is officially opposed and has
refused to co-operate with the Scottish Office, though some councils have
breached this embargo.
The map of the new councils has aroused intense controversy. It is widely
seen as favouring the Conservative party, where possible, in its drawing of
the new boundaries, and in some cases ignoring local loyalties.
The charge of gerrymandering has been made against the boundaries of South
Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, Stirling and Berwickshire and East Lothian.
Some of the new boundaries can expect strong challenge in committee, and the
government has hinted that it may be prepared to make some concessions.
The government's proposals on water, outlined in the July white paper, back
away from the idea of privatising and possibly floating the water industry
on the stock exchange.
This was one of the options in the original consultation document but would
have been difficult to achieve within this parliament. In any case, it
provoked such an outcry in Scotland that the government had to back off.
There will be objections in parliament to the lack of democratic
accountability of the three proposed water authorities, which are seen by
the opposition parties as likely to be Conservative-dominated quangos.
The government's proposals in the white paper still involve very substantial
private sector involvement in the restructured industry.
Private-sector companies will, if the legislation goes through, be asked to
build, own and operate the new installations required as part of the Pounds
5bn investment in water and sewerage installations over the next 15 years.
This system does not involve transferring the installations back to the
publicly owned authorities at a later date, since this would count as
leasing and thus be counted in the PSBR, which the Treasury wants to avoid.
They would instead remain in private ownership.
Thus Scotland may still end up with a substantially privately owned and
privately run water industry, without privatisation actually taking place.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: New councils by 1995 - Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is pressing ahead with plans to reform the structure of local
government in Wales by holding shadow elections to new unitary authorities
as early as next year. It intends that these councils should take over in
April 1995.
The bill announced in the Queen's Speech is expected to follow closely
proposals in a Welsh Office white paper last March. This described plans to
replace the existing eight county councils and 37 district councils with 21
unitary authorities.
The white paper followed more than 18 months of consultation which found
support for the principle of unitary authorities, although the county
councils and Labour party argue there should be no re-organisation without
first creating an elected Welsh assembly. The government rejects this.
Mr Russell Goodway, chairman of the Assembly of Welsh Counties, said
yesterday that without such an assembly the current system should remain. 'A
very expensive reorganisation will not result in a better system and
improved services.'
The district councils, however, are broadly in favour. Mr Tom Williams,
chairman of the Council of Welsh Districts, said: 'A new structure of at
least 21 unitary authorities will lead to a renewal of local democracy at
considerably less cost than at present. Such a structure will save at least
Pounds 100m over the next 10 years.'
Mr Harry Jones, leader of the CWD's Labour group, said: 'We will be
monitoring the bill closely with a view to opposing, when necessary, those
proposals which might undermine the independence of local government.'
About 150,000 people work for Welsh councils and the biggest part of the
transitional costs will be redundancy payments. The white paper made no
estimate of the likely level of redundancies.

The Sunday trading bill, which is expected to be tabled in the Commons today
will be the first of the 13 bills to be debated. It will be followed shortly
by the Scottish and Welsh local government, national insurance, education,

The coal privatisation bill is also expected to be introduced before
Christmas, but the criminal justice and deregulation bills - the centrepiece
of the programme - are still being worked on, and are unlikely to appear
until next year.
The other bills are the European Community amendment bill - which will
increase Britain's contribution to the EC budget - the police and

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Environment measure will allow agency to
recruit - Other measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans for a new environment agency, first announced in 1991, took
a small step forwards with yesterday's announcement Bronwen Maddox writes. A
paving bill will allow planning and recruitment while waiting for
legislation to create the agency itself.
The proposed agency for England and Wales, which has been one of the central
planks of the government's environment policy, will bring together pollution
regulation in a 'one-stop shop'. It will unite the functions of the National
Rivers Authority, the Inspectorate of Pollution, and the waste regulation
carried out by local authorities.
Environmentalists have criticised the government for allowing creation of
the agency to be pushed down the queue of forthcoming legislation by more
politically pressing issues.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, said that 'the pledge to bring
forward paving legislation is a small step in the right direction' but added
'the procrastination continues' on creating the agency itself. If
legislation to set up the agency is announced in next year's Queen's Speech,
the agency could begin operating by spring 1995.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: National Insurance increase will bring
extra Pounds 1.9bn - Other measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASE in National Insurance contributions by employees announced in
the speech will add Pounds 1.9bn to the National Insurance Fund, the
Department of Social Security said, Andrew Jack writes.
The main rate of contributions will rise from 9 per cent to 10 per cent from
next April, as first announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor, in
the March Budget.
Contributions will rise by 1 per cent from employees earning between Pounds
56 and Pounds 420 a week. There will be no change to the rates either side
of this range. Employees' earnings are taxed at 2 per cent below Pounds 56 a
week, and there is no contribution on earnings in excess of Pounds 420 a
week. Employers' contributions remain unchanged under the proposals, ranging
on a sliding scale from zero for those earning less than Pounds 56 a week,
up to 10.4 per cent for those paid any more than Pounds 195 a week.
The Treasury said the increased revenue from the change would reduce the
expected deficit of the National Insurance fund for 1994-95, and also the
size of the Treasury grant paid from general taxation. The deficit this year
was Pounds 7.5bn.
Total National Insurance collected in 1993-94 was Pounds 14.5bn from
employees and Pounds 19.6bn from employers.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Registration to be simplified -
Trademarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday gave a much-needed boost to London's chances of
being chosen as the home of the European Trademarks Office by announcing a
long-awaited overhaul of UK trademark law.
The bill will simplify the system for registering and protecting trademarks
and will implement the 1989 EC Trademarks Directive.
It will become easier for a trademark to qualify for registration, allowing
companies will be able to register distinctive three-dimensional shapes,
such as bottles, and placenames which form part of a brand or company name.
The bill will improve protection for trademarks by making it unlawful to use
one to sell goods and services similar to those covered by the registered
trademark. It will also simplify procedures for registering them, abolishing
the distinction between between trademarks and service marks.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Mum's army of teachers on the advance -
Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department for Education is courting further direct conflict with the
education establishment by pressing on with plans to reform university
student unions and teacher training in schools.
Both plans were announced earlier this year and the government has consulted
on them.
The reform of teacher training would allow a heavy shift away from
universities and colleges and towards purely school-based training. It would
involve creating a new quango, to be called the Teacher Training Agency,
which would replace the Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education,
and also take some powers from the Education Department, and the Higher
Education Funding Council, the university quango.
The new agency would decide grant allocations to institutions for teachers'
initial training, research into education, and teacher education.
An announcement is expected in the next few weeks on the government's most
controversial proposal, to create a 'mum's army' by allowing non-graduates
to qualify as teachers of infants. It does not require primary legislation
and so was not included in yesterday's speech.
Teachers' unions have already stated a strong opposition to the proposals,
and the normally moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers says that it
will not co-operate with any of the measures.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL, described the proposal to
allow schools to employ 'unskilled' teachers as 'insulting to parents'. He
said all children deserved teachers who were 'fully trained and properly
competent'.
The proposals on students' unions would restrict them to a narrow list of
activities. Public funding would not be available for anything else.
The proposal is aimed at student unions which use public money for political
campaigning, but university vice-chancellors expressed sorrow that the
government had continued with the measure. The Committee of Vice-chancellors
and Principals said the government should have provided a list of proscribed
activities, rather than attempting to define what student unions could do.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Good news for the Coke bottle - Analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COCA-COLA bottle may largely have been replaced by the can in the UK,
but its distinctive shape is still inextricably linked to Coke's name and
brand image. However, that link is not recognised under UK law.
The government's proposed bill on trademarks aims, through one of its
measures, to remedy that. In future a distinctive-shaped bottle will be able
to be registered in the same way as a brand name.
The proposed reforms were welcomed yesterday by anti-counterfeiting
campaigners, retailers and trademark consultants. The bill is almost certain
to become law - it is unlikely that opponents to the principles of the
reform will emerge, even if lawyers want to pick over the details.
Mr Bill Bryce, head of trademarks at international drinks group Guinness,
who chairs the Anti-Counterfeiting Group, said he was 'highly delighted' and
that at last the law would reflect 'business as it is in this century'.
The current trademarks act dates from 1938 and proposals for reform have
been on the books for nearly 20 years. The act states that a mark 'includes
a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter,
numeral or any combination thereof'. While the wording does not specifically
rule out shape, a House of Lords ruling against Coca-Cola in 1986 made clear
that the law as it stands now cannot allow a shape, however distinctive, to
be registered as a trade-mark.
Manufacturers have to resort to common law actions for 'passing off' if they
want to prevent others stealing their designs - a difficult and
time-consuming process, says Mr Bryce. Guinness will now be able to register
its distinctive Haig's dimple and the Johnnie Walker square bottle.
Ms Janet Fogg, managing director of trademark consultancy Markforce
Associates, said the bill, by implementing a European directive on the
subject, would also allow the move towards a Europe-wide trademark system.
Beyond Europe, it would allow the UK to ratify an international treaty,
known as the Madrid Agreement, which should eventually provide protection
for trademarks more widely, particularly in the develop-ing markets of
eastern Europe.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Prime minister looks to staunch internal
opposition - John Major hopes he has found an agenda that few Tories can
quarrel with
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTENT of the Queen's Speech was decided long before one of Mr John
Major's aides coined the government's latest catchphrase, Back to Basics.
But details like that do not count when a prime minister is searching for a
new political rhetoric.
The original plan was to tailor the new legislative programme to the
instincts and prejudices of the Tory back benches and of the party's
footsoldiers in the constituencies. That, it is now said, will also catch
the mood of the country by favouring a return to traditional values.
After the civil war over Maastricht and the catastrophic by-election defeats
in Newbury and Christchurch, it was time for a battered prime minister to
concentrate on what united the Tory party rather than on what divided it.
So whatever its broader appeal the central planks of the Queen's Speech have
one simple objective: to win back for Mr Major's government the confidence
of Conservatives.
As one cabinet minister put it yesterday, winning back the rest of the
electorate can wait. The point, he added, was that no Tory could quarrel
with a promise to crack down on crime, to overturn the liberal establishment
in teacher training colleges and to lift the regulatory burden on business.
More dangerous legislation - London bus de-regulation, equalising the
pension age at 65, privatisation of the Post Office - has been put to one
side. There will be occasion enough for rebellions on taxation and spending
without provoking the disgruntled and disenchanted on the Conservative back
benches.
Unveiling the programme in the Commons, Mr Major was in confident mood. He
has had a good few weeks. The economy looks better than he dared hope even a
month ago. His willingness to take risks in the search for peace in Northern
Ireland has won him deserved plaudits. He looks comfortable talking about
the 'commonsense' values his programme is designed to reassert, and about
the promised return to suburban Conservatism.
The backbenchers like it too. Whether Mr Michael Howard's massive criminal
justice bill will actually curb crime is neither here nor there. Promising
to jail teenage hooligans, tighten bail conditions, increase jail sentences
and scrap the right to silence is judged to be popular as well as populist
stuff.
Teacher training colleges were a similarly obvious target. So too was the
ever-increasing burden of regulation from Whitehall and Brussels.
But if those three bills can justifiably be bracketed as part of the return
to basics, the rest of the legislative programme is an uncomfortable
hotch-potch. The Sunday trading bill was forced on the government. It will
be controversial, but ministers are determined to remain as neutral as
possible.
Coal privatisation is designed to draw a permanent line under last year's
near-disaster over pit closures. Local government reform in Scotland and
Wales is a precursor to wider changes in England.
The bill to put MI6 and GCHQ on a statutory basis is a left-over from the
promised post-election drive to create more open government.
From Mr Major's perspective the programme represents an intelligent
political strategy. After the battering he has taken over the past year he
needs to rebuild the trust of his own party. He needs to do it before the
expected electoral battering expected by the Conservatives in next summer's
local and European elections.
But he is aware also that the mood of the present parliamentary session will
be set not by yesterday's Queen's Speech but by the Budget in two weeks, and
perhaps by the success or otherwise of his Northern Ireland initiative.
The finance bill, a perfect target for Mr John Smith's Labour party, will be
more difficult than any in recent history. Spending cuts will provide ample
scope for another collective nervous breakdown on the Tory back benches.
A planned squeeze on invalidity benefit and the transfer to employers of
more of the burden of statutory sick pay will both need legislation. The
still-seething rebel opponents of the Maastricht treaty will not miss the
irony that those bills will run in parallel with legislation to authorise
higher British contributions to the Brussels budget.
Mr Major, of course, hopes that another issue will define his prime
ministership during the next year.
For the second time in a week he again yesterday put his personal authority
behind the drive for peace in Northern Ireland. Cynics in the cabinet see
little chance of a breakthrough.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, offered a warning to the prime
minister of the risks he will run with his own party if he leans too far in
the direction of Sinn Fein. But Mr Major appears determined. Success would
represent a huge political prize. The prime minister needs one.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Smith ridicules 'back to basics'
campaign - Reaction in the Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'back to basics' theme set out by the prime minister in the Queen's
Speech was yesterday attacked by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, as an
attempt to hide the failure of 14 years of Tory government.
However, Mr John Major received strong backing from conservative MPs in the
House of Commons when he described the government's forthcoming legislative
plans as 'a realistic programme that would meet the concerns of the
country'.
In the traditional Queen's Speech debate, Mr Smith's dismissal of the prime
minister's 'back to basics' idea set the tone for an opposition campaign to
pin responsibility for rising crime and social problems on the government.
Mr Smith also sought to embarrass the government by highlighting the bill to
increase National Insurance contributions. 'So much for Tory promises at the
last election not to increase taxes on income,' he said.
The Labour leader said millions of incredulous electors were trying to work
out what Mr Major meant by his campaign to take the country back to basics.
'The Conservatives have been in government for the last 14 years. If now we
have to go back to basics, what on earth has been happening over 14 years of
Conservative government?' he asked.
Mr Smith said the campaign was 'no more and no less than an appalling
admission of failure'. The government had clearly reached the conclusion its
record was indefensible.
'They would have us wipe out from our own consciousness the fact that they
have been in power for the longest single period since the second world war.
They want us to forget that they, and they alone, after all these years are
responsible for the state of Britain today,' he said.
Mr Smith said the real problem facing the country was persistent
under-investment in industry, the regions, and the skills and education of
the workforce. 'Instead of back to basics, it should be back to the drawing
board,' he said.
In his speech, Mr Major hit back by attacking Labour's opposition to
government measures such as education reforms, privatisation and tougher
punishment for criminals.
He said Labour was 'out of touch with the values and instincts of the
British people', and promised that the planned legislation would 'provide
the foundations for a successful, tolerant, responsible society'.
The prime minister clashed several times with Mr John Prescott, the shadow
employment secretary. Mr Major told him: 'No wonder you are against back to
basics; you are pretty basic yourself. You make Neanderthal man look chic.'
The prime minister was also optimistic about the outlook for the UK economy
against a background of falling inflation and unemployment and a shrinking
trade gap.
'As other countries remain in recession we are emerging from it,' he said.
'We now have the opportunity of a long period of sustained growth with low
inflation. There has been a great deal of pain and effort to get inflation
down, but now we see the rewards.'
Conservative MPs said the relatively light programme was likely to achieve
the government's aim of unifying the party after the divisions over
Maastricht in the last session.
However, some warned Mr Major against moving too far to the right. Ms Emma
Nicholson (Devon West and Torridge) said such a move would be resisted by
centrist MPs.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal leader, said the government had announced a
series of 'small measures', but many were 'deeply offensive'.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: MPs will scrutinise MI5 and GCHQ -
Secret services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is taking another step towards more open government by
submitting the intelligence services for the first time to parliamentary
scrutiny.
According to Foreign Office officials, the Intelligence Services Bill
announced in the speech yesterday is still being fine-tuned before its
expected introduction in the House of Lords later this month. But there is
now agreement that it should contain a provision for a parliamentary
committee responsible for oversight and accountability of MI5, the Secret
Intelligence Service, M16, and GCHQ, the government's intelligence-gathering
communications centre.
Parliamentary scrutiny is widely viewed as the most controversial aspect of
the new bill. It also places the SIS and GCHQ on a statutory footing - as
M15 was in the Security Service Act 1989.
The bill will enable all three intelligence services to be investigated by
complaints tribunals outside parliament.
But the government has decided to test parliamentary opinion as to whether
it should go further in meeting the recommendation of the Commons home
affairs committee last year that it should be entrusted with scrutinising
the activities of all three intelligence services.
The government had earlier aired the suggestion that the supervising
committee - whether extra-parliamentary or parliamentary - should be made up
of privy councillors.
However, MPs have argued that the inclusion of privy councillors who have
sworn allegiance to the crown would dilute the critical function of the
committee and turn it into a creature of government.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is also understood to be facing pressure
from within his own party and intelligence officers who believe that the
open-government policy may already have gone too far.
Sir Ivan Lawrence, Tory chairman of last session's Commons home affairs
committee, said last night: 'I was against opening up the intelligence
services in the first place . . . I think you have more to lose than to gain
by it.'
The intelligence services fear that the government's policy of bringing them
increasingly into the public eye risks compromising the security of
individuals.
Over the past year, the names of all three heads of the intelligence
agencies have been published by the government, and the head of M15, Mrs
Stella Rimmington, has allowed herself to be photographed. It emerged last
night that one of the main speakers in the Lords on the Intelligence
Services Bill will be Baroness Park, who retired from a senior SIS post in
1980.

FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Mines sell-off bill may come within
weeks - British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected to publish a bill to privatise British Coal
within weeks as ministers press ahead with controversial plans to sell off
the industry by early 1995.
The legislation to enact what Lord Parkinson, former energy secretary,
described as the ultimate privatisation, comes as British Coal presses ahead
with a programme of closures expected to shut more than half of its
remaining 30 pits.
The legislation, which could come as early as next week, will attempt to
resolve the contentious issues of pensions and concessionary coal for
employees. The Labour party and pit unions are likely to concentrate on both
subjects in their campaign to keep British Coal in the public sector.
Potential buyers will have to wait some months, possibly until the middle of
next year, before the government decides which pits are for sale and at what
price. Ministers have already announced that British Coal is to be split
into five parts for privatisation. The composition of the areas, to be
grouped around Scotland, north-east England, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and
Wales has yet to be determined.
There is uncertainty about which pits will be closed before privatisation.
British Coal has indicated to unions a cut in the number of deep-mine pits
to 23, but a further reduction to at most 15 is likely before privatisation.
The long-term market is unlikely to sustain more than 12 deep mines.
Last year British Coal sold 65m tonnes of coal to the England and Wales
generators, but by the late 1990s the total annual market for power station
coal is likely to fall to about 30m tonnes.
The privatisation should also pave the way for privatisation of British Coal
subsidiaries including Coal Products, which sells smokeless fuels, British
Fuels, the retail distribution arm, Compower, the computer services company,
and the Coal Research Establishment.
Unions are opposed in principle to privatisation, but the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers is part of a consortium which is considering bids and
British Association of Colliery Management is looking at the possibility of
management buy-outs. The government is offering financial help for employee
teams interested in buying pits.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'History will charge this
government with the murder of the British coal mining industry. Now, in the
ultimate insult, they are seeking to sell off the dismembered body.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / Apec Meets in Seattle: Export fears hit prospects for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH prospects for the economies of the Asia-Pacific region have dimmed
significantly over the past six months as a result of the worsening outlook
for exports, according to economic forecasters from around the Pacific Rim.
The Pacific Economic Co-operation Council, grouping businessmen and
academics from the 15 countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum as well as from Mexico, Chile and Peru, now predicts an average growth
rate of 3.5 per cent for the region this year, rather than the 4.2 per cent
rate it forecast in May.
For 1994, the group expects a slight acceleration to 3.7 per cent, compared
with an earlier forecast of 4.2 per cent.
The inflation outlook for the Pacific region, however, continues to improve,
the council says. Despite inflation problems in individual countries such as
China and Indonesia, consumer prices are expected to rise by only 3.5 per
cent this year and to slow further to 3.3 per cent in 1994.
China remains the fastest growing economy in the region, despite the
government's efforts to prevent overheating.
'The critical question is whether they are able to do it gradually or
whether there will be a hard landing. Our forecasters believe there will be
a soft landing,' said Professor Lawrence Krause, the leader of the
forecasting team.
The council expects growth of 13.5 per cent in China this year, slowing to
10.2 per cent in 1994, with inflation slowing from 11.8 per cent in 1993 to
9.8 per cent next year.
Excluding the US and Japan, the two biggest economies in the region, the
council projects average growth of 5.6 per cent both this year and next,
with inflation averaging 5.4 per cent in 1993 and 5.1 per cent in 1994.
The council has official observer status at Apec meetings, and its forecasts
are used as a consensus basis for discussion by member governments.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Apec Meets in Seattle: Cool response to proposal for closer
ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL

<DATELINE>
   SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS from Pacific countries appeared last night to be giving a lukewarm
response to a set of recommendations for much closer economic co-operation
presented by an eminent persons' group.
The group, headed by Mr Fred Bergsten, a US economist, submitted its report
for consideration at the opening session of the annual ministerial
conference of the 15-member Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping.
It called for creation over time of a 'true Asia Pacific Economic
Community', and asked members to declare immediately 'an ultimate goal of
free trade in the Asia Pacific region'. They should agree now that in 1996
they would set a target date and timetable for achieving this goal, it said.
The group suggested specific measures to facilitate regional trade including
an Apec investment code, a new mechanism for settling trade disputes,
regular meetings of officials responsible for macroeconomic policies and
co-operation on competition policy including anti-dumping.
The report stressed that 'we are not proposing creation of another European
Community, with full economic integration and a single internal market, let
alone a common currency. We are not even advocating a customs union.' It
also said that any regional trade liberalisation had to be consistent with
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Nevertheless, the recommendations seemed too far-reaching for many Apec
members to swallow. Most prefer a gradual evolution of Apec - now a loose,
informal grouping - into something more formal as a consensus for greater
co-operation develops. All feel the groups's energies should be concentrated
on concluding the Uruguay Round of Gatt.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister of Australia, Apec's keenest advocate, said
it 'heartily subscribes' to free trade in the region. 'But just how to get
there and by what time is a subject which in my view is too early to
determine.'
Japan's reaction was similarly mixed. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister,
told ministers the report should be 'put to good use' to strengthen Apec.
However, members should 'give due consideration to the diverse stages of
development among the region's economies. Co-operation should be promoted
incrementally.'
Mr TH Chau, Hong Kong's secretary for trade and industry, said the concept
of an Asia Pacific Community was 'as a very long-term vision probably not an
objectionable idea'. But he said Hong Kong was not able to endorse all the
group's recommendations.
Mr Victor Fung, chairman of Hong Kong's Trade Development Council and a
member of the eminent persons group, defended its recommendations as seeking
a discussion forum with a minimum of bureaucracy. 'What we are really
talking about is a family of like-minded economies that are oriented and
dedicated towards free trade,' he said.
Apec ministers reached a compromise yesterday on the sensitive question of
Chile's application for membership. As expected, they allowed Mexico and
Papua New Guinea to join this year. But Chile, which applied later than they
did, is being asked to wait until next year.
There will then be a moratorium on new membership for three years so that
Apec, still only four years old, can be allowed to develop without becoming
too unwieldy. It began with 12 members and admitted China, Hong Kong and
Taiwan in 1991. Russia, India, Pakistan and Peru are among other countries
which have expressed interest.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Apec Meets in Seattle: Christopher puts stress on human
rights - US secretary of state ties economic relations with Pacific nations
to questions of democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>

   SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS ITS name implies, Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation was established to
discuss economic and trade issues.
But from the moment that Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
kicked off the 15-member grouping's annual ministerial meeting in Seattle on
Wednesday, the impossibility of isolating trans-Pacific economic relations
from political issues was clear. So, by implication, was the limited scope
for true regional co-operation.
Mr Christopher chose to make a tough statement of US policy on Asia, firmly
tying economic progress to human rights and democracy. 'Just as security is
the bedrock for the pursuit of prosperity, so democracy is the foundation
for security,' he said. 'Democratic nations make better neighbours and
better trading partners.'
The US approach is at odds with the views of almost all other Apec members,
who resent its insistence on democracy and human rights as an intrusion into
the affairs of Asian countries.
The secretary of state, who is hosting the ministerial meeting which ends
today, made clear that the US saw its economic future as a Pacific nation
and that it was committed to retaining a strong military presence in order
to deter aggression between Asian countries.
But he also said that 'great areas of Asia' were lagging behind in
introducing democracy. 'The yearnings for freedom are not a western export,'
he said. 'They are a human instinct. All across Asia, the US is working to
respond to those yearnings.'
Mr Christopher said human rights were a key issue in relations with two Apec
members - Indonesia and China - and issued the most explicit statement yet
that China's most-favoured nation (MFN) trading status would not be renewed
next year unless there was 'overall significant progress' on human rights.
It is only to be expected that linkage of MFN to human rights is vehemently
rejected by China. But tying trade issues to politics is also opposed by
many other Asian countries - most vocally Malaysia, whose prime minister, Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, is boycotting the Seattle meeting.
Asian countries tend to fall in with China's view that economic development
is the top priority and personal freedom secondary. At the least, they
believe that human rights should not be linked to trade.
Mr Rizalino Navarro, the Philippines trade minister, said: 'We're as
concerned about human rights, but in the case of a number of countries, the
lower level of per capita income does not provide the majority of people
with decent food, clothing and shelter. That's the first priority.'
Mr Navarro saw the different concepts of human rights as a cultural
difference across the Pacific which, together with differing degrees of
economic development, meant that Apec should proceed only slowly towards
becoming a closer community.
Mr T H Chau, trade and industry secretary of Hong Kong - which would be
severely affected if the US revoked China's MFN status - said: 'We believe
that trade issues should not be politicised and that MFN is the wrong tool
for pursuing other aims that the US has.' Bodies such as the United Nations
existed to deal with political issues.
Australia also indicated that it came close to espousing the Asian view. Mr
Peter Cook, trade minister, said his country did not shirk the issues of
human rights and democracy, but took a broader view of what constituted
human rights.
He said that while the population of Asia had grown by two-thirds over the
past 20 years, the number of people living in abject poverty had halved. 'In
human rights terms, that means more people have clothes on their backs, food
on their tables and shelter,' Mr Cook said.
Concerns about the US approach are likely to mean that most Asian countries
will favour keeping Apec as a looser, informal grouping for the foreseeable
future. The visionary report of an eminent persons group, which calls on
Apec ministers to decide now that that they will agree in 1996 on a
timetable for achievement of an Apec free trade area, is expected to be
largely shelved.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S tourism industry is recovering from the effects of Islamic extremist
attacks, with 100 per cent hotel occupancy rates in the Red Sea and Sinai
resorts and 49 per cent occupancy in Luxor, Mr Mamdouh Ahmed Beltagui, the
country's new tourism minister, said yesterday.
He said the figures for September augured well for the main season just
starting after a year in which arrivals have been down 20 per cent on 1992
and receipts down by almost Dollars 1bn on last year's Dollars 3bn.
Mr Beltagui, in London to sign a regional tourism agreement with Turkey and
Israel, said a number of travel agencies which had dropped Egyptian packages
from their promotional literature had agreed to resume publicity.
The revival of Egypt's biggest foreign exchange earner had been confirmed,
he said, by EPounds 4.7bn of new investment in the industry through the
official tourism agency alone, 80 per cent of it private enterprise.
Almost 2m visitors had been recorded between January and September against
the 3.2m for all of last year.
He attributed the upturn on a successful clampdown on fundamentalists, in
which at least seven militants have been hanged for the murder of three
foreign tourists, but said Egypt was still suffering from adverse media
coverage. There was less danger for visitors to Egypt than to Londoners from
the Irish Republican Army.

help, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
'There has been an increase in troop strength but it's nonsense,' an Israeli
security source said. 'You know and I know that more troops don't prevent
these kind of attacks.'
On Wednesday, an Arab stabbed a soldier to death in the occupied Gaza Strip,
bringing the death toll since the signing in September of the Israel-PLO

<TEXT>
LEBANON'S main labour confederation yesterday rejected a 69.5 per cent
government pay increase and called on unions to declare a general strike,
agencies report from Beirut.
If the unions heed the call in their meeting next Thursday they could
threaten Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri's efforts to speed recovery from the
effects of the 1975-90 civil war.
The Lebanese Labour Union Confederation (CGTL) has also called for
demonstrations in all regions of Lebanon as part of a phased plan of action
until thepay offer is increased.
The government's proposed increase fell well short of the 120 per cent
boost, backdated to January 1, that the CGTL had demanded for 350,000
private sector employees and 110,000 public sectorworkers.
Riots in Beirut on May 6, 1992, over Lebanon's economic decline toppled
then-prime minister Omar Karami.
The Hariri government, hoping to satisfy the hard-pressed workers without
throwing post-war economic recovery plans off track, agreed a raise which
takes the basic monthly minimum wage to LPounds 200,000 (Dollars 116) from
LPounds 118,000.
But the union argued workers needed more because prices rose 120 percent in
1992 as the Lebanese pound plunged.
Mr Fuad Siniora, minister of state for finance, said the pay rise would cost
the treasury up to LPounds 215bn pounds in 1994 but meeting the CGTL's full
demands would have doubled the cost to the treasury and hit private
employers hard.

CONSERVATIVE black leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday warned President F
W de Klerk he would fight South Africa's new interim constitution and reduce
it to 'the rubble of passing history,' Reuter reports from Durban.
Chief Buthelezi, who quit the constitutional talks five months ago, said Mr
de Klerk and African National Congress leader Mr Nelson Mandela had decided
'to go it alone' without his participation or approval.
'We will meet the present draft constitution. . . with determined
resistance,' said Chief Buthelezi, who demands autonomy for the Natal
KwaZulu region where he has his power base.
'I want to point out that when it comes to the implementation of the new
constitution and the whole transitional phase, nobody should expect us to be
faithful and diligent in assisting.'
Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela and 17 other leaders approved an interim
constitution early yesterday providing for non-racial elections next April.
Black and white right-wing groups reject the document as a recipe for ANC
domination.
Chief Buthelezi said he would not take part in the election if it meant
legitimising a flawed constitution. 'I would rather go into the political
wilderness,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week, a small number of prominent Jewish settlers in the occupied
territories got together to form a new group. Called Settlers for Peace,
they marked their formation by issuing a brief statement.
Claiming to represent the overwhelming majority of settlers, they called on
their fellow 130,000 Jewish residents of the territories 'to exercise
restraint,' despite the latest spate of Palestinian attacks.
Jewish settlements, said their chairman, Eli Cohen, could serve as 'bridges
to peace between Jews and Arabs.' The world should know, he added, that most
settlers genuinely sought peace and reconciliation.
Unfortunately for the Settlers for Peace, their initiative coincided with
settler unrest in the centre of the West Bank town of Hebron. Two
Palestinians had attacked father-of-ten Avraham Zarbiv as he made his way to
morning prayers at the Cave of the Patriarchs, leaving him wounded in the
head but still able to fire a shot from his pistol that killed one of his
attackers.
Led by Rabbi Moshe Levinger, one of the founders of the West Bank settlement
movement, a group of settlers burst into Hebron's main market area,
overturning piles of vegetables, throwing stones - even ordering Arab
traders to line up against a wall while they demolished piles of their
produce. Car windows were smashed. Some traders claimed later to have been
beaten.
The Israeli army maintains a sizeable deployment in the area. Military
sources do not dispute that there were soldiers on hand. Palestinian
witnesses insist that the soldiers made no effort to intervene, but simply
watched and waited until the settler rioting was over.
Amnon Shahak, the army's deputy chief of staff, who is also heading the
Israeli delegation to autonomy negotiations with the PLO, admitted yesterday
that the army has a problem combating the increasingly militant settlers.
'It's hard for 18-year-old Israeli soldiers to deal with the settler riots,'
he said. 'But we will find an effective answer."
General Shahak is not the only man looking for a solution. Israel's Justice
Minister David Libai has said that the government must not allow the settler
riots to go on, but has offered no specific means of countering them. The
Attorney-General, Michael Ben-Yair, has been holding meetings with various
security officials with a view to banning some of the most extreme settler
organisations, including factions loyal to the anti-Arab views of the
assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane.
But the Israeli authorities are anxious not to force the most dangerous
activists underground. The police and army insist that they have been making
arrests, but although several dozen settlers have been taken into custody
following violent protests in the territories and outside government offices
and residences inside Jerusalem, few spend more than a night in jail.
The Palestinians, however, have an obvious solution. When the Israeli army
begins its phased pullout from the Gaza and Jericho areas early next year,
they should take the settlers with them. In an interview last month, Nabil
Sha'ath, head of the PLO team at the autonomy talks, spoke of the need for
Gaza's 4,000 settlers to be gone within two years.
But while Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin may well have long-term plans to give
up sovereignty over all the settlements in Gaza and many in
heavily-populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank, he is telling his
negotiators that, in the short term at least, not a single settlement will
be uprooted, that settlers must be protected, and that the army will have to
find the means to minimise settler-Palestinian friction.
The problem for Mr Rabin, however, is that the settlers' fight against the
whole Palestinian autonomy programme appears to be winning support among the
rest of the Israeli public. Shortly after the Israel-PLO accords were signed
in Washington two months ago, opinion polls showed two thirds of Israelis
backing the peace deal. Latest surveys indicate that figure has slipped
below 40 per cent, and it seems to be falling with every new Palestinian
attack on a Jewish target. The Settlers for Peace initiative seems destined
to fail: Militant settlers are not exercising restraint, the army has found
no way to stop them, and the Israeli public seems increasingly sympathetic
to their cause.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Nigeria's new ruler orders clampdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S new military ruler yesterday swept aside the democratic process
and abolished all elected bodies, including the two main parties, in a
fierce clampdown aimed at stifling any political opposition.
General Sani Abacha, in his first broadcast to the nation since he seized
power from Chief Ernest Shonekan on Wednesday night, promised to set up a
strict military regime to restore stability. All political meetings and
associations were banned with immediate effect.
The former defence minister said he had set up a Provisional Ruling Council
of senior army officers and some former ministers, with himself as chairman.
He gave no names and did not say how long his government intended to stay in
power.
He announced the dissolution of the interim government, the abolition of all
national and state assemblies, state governments, local government councils,
the National Electoral Commisssion (NEC) and the two political parties
created by the military regime of former president General Ibrahim
Babangida. State governors are to be replaced by army brigade commanders or
police chiefs.
Gen Abacha appealed to the west for understanding, but his speech was a
severe blow to western critics and Nigerians who had hoped he would
institute moves toward democracy.
In his speech he said a constitutional conference would be set up soon to
'determine the future constitutional structure of Nigeria,' but gave no
timetable or any indication he favoured an early return to civilian rule.
'This regime will be firm, humane and decisive. We will not condone nor
tolerate any act of indiscipline. Any attempt to test our will, will be
decisively dealt with,' he said.
He urged trade unions which have paralysed much of the country with a
nationwide strike over fuel price increases to return to work immediately.
Nigeria's new military strongman hinted at the possibility of wide-ranging
reforms to much criticised national institutions such as the armed forces,
police, judiciary and customs service, as well as three nationalised
industries renowned for corruption - oil, telecommunications and
electricity. But in a ten-minute speech he gave no details.
In the only concrete move likely to appeal to democrats he said the four
newspaper publishing houses banned by Gen Babangida in July would be allowed
to re-open. He did not refer to tough registration laws which the press
claim will drive many of them out of business. The newspaper groups include
Concord Press owned by Mr Moshood Abiola, the deposed winner of the
presidential poll earlier this year.
Gen Abacha's takeover arose out of the political crisis left by Gen
Babangida after he annulled the democratic presidential election held on
June 12 when Mr Abiola looked set to become the clear winner. Yesterday Gen
Abacha made no reference to the poll or to Mr Abiola.
Few in Nigeria had been happy with Chief Shonekan's performance and his
removal came as no surprise. 'If  you are going to rule Nigeria you have to
have either a mandate from the people or a gun in your hand. Shonekan had
neither,' said a leading banker in the commerical capital.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL has agreed to limit its military presence in the Gaza Strip to
positions inside Jewish settlements there, Mr Nabil Sha'ath, the chief PLO
delegate to autonomy negotiations with Israel, said in Cairo yesterday.
Speaking at the end of three days of intensive talks, Mr Sha'ath added that
he was optimistic that a detailed autonomy deal would be ready for signature
as scheduled by December 13, so that the Israeli military withdrawal from
the Gaza and Jericho areas could begin on that date.
Israel's minister of police, Moshe Shahal, visiting Egypt for a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak, confirmed that he too expected the December 13
deadline to be met.
Mr Sha'ath said that, originally, Israel had wanted to maintain military
positions outside the Gaza settlements, but that the Israelis had backed
down. He added that initial agreement had also been reached on many aspects
of the transfer of civil authority to the Palestinians and on matters such
as fishing and aviation rights, and access to radio and television
frequencies. Mr Sha'ath also said that he expected PLO chairman Yassir
Arafat to move from PLO headquarters in Tunis to the territories in January.
The main sticking points now, he said, were the control of border crossings,
the size of the Jericho area to be transferred to Palestinian control, and
the release of Arab prisoners. While Israel is prepared to release the
majority of the 10,000-plus Palestinian prisoners it holds, it has so far
refused to consider freeing several hundred who have 'Israeli blood on their
hands.'
Mr Sha'ath said no deal would be signed 'without a scheduled and written
commitment for the release of prisoners. This is a long overdue issue. They
should be released now.'
The Israeli and PLO teams are to hold another three days of talks starting
next Monday, and might schedule longer sessions as the December 13 deadline
draws near.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Farmers protest at rice imports

<TEXT>
A THAI vessel carrying a shipment of Japan's first import of foreign-grown
rice since 1984 into Yokohama port was met by boatloads of Japanese farmers
yesterday, protesting against emergency imports to cover the country's
severe shortage, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Japan plans to bring in 1.1m tonnes (10 per cent of its domestic
consumption) of rice from Thailand, China and the US, as it faces the worst
rice crop in post-war history.
Some analysts forecast a need for extra imports, as the shortage may be up
to 2m tonnes.
The emergency shipment arrived as Japan's rice import ban is debated in the
Gatt multilateral trade talks in Geneva.
The Japanese officially deny changing stance over opening the rice market on
the one hand, and trying to work out a compromise over tariffs on the other.
Mr Akio Kyoya, vice-minister of agriculture, yesterday denied reports that
Japan and the US had reached a compromise agreement in Geneva.
However, in October, US trade officials revealed that the two countries were
negotiating terms to include a six-year moratorium on rice imports, during
which a minimum access level of 3-5 per cent of Japan's domestic rice
consumption will be imported.

China will abolish its different exchange rates next year and set one single

Zhang Xiao, president of the International and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC), made the announcement on a trip to Singapore.
'Zhang said the exact timing depends on a number of conditions, including
how rapidly exports increase,' China's official Xinhua news agency quoted
him as saying.
'The scrapping of foreign exchange controls must be taken in steps, rather
than in one fell swoop.
The central committee of the ruling Communist Party on Sunday adopted a plan
calling for wide-reaching reforms, including a restructuring of China's
financial system to adopt Western-style macro-control levers such as
interest rates and reserve requirements to help control liquidity.

Taiwan, in an attempt to deter the hijacking of Chinese airliners to the
island, yesterday decided it will send hijackers back to China after
sentence or finishing their jail terms, Reuter reports from Taipei.
Seven Chinese airliners have been hijacked to Taiwan since April. Taipei has
rejected China's demands to send the hijackers back to China immediately and
detained them for trial on the island.
The aircraft, other passengers and the crew were sent back to China on the
same day.
The decision to repatriate hijackers was reached by a cabinet-level
anti-hijacking committee headed by Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung, state
radio said. But the final approval of Premier Lien Chan is still needed.

THE United Nations' operation in Somalia is a mess, with little hope of its
efforts there ever bearing fruit, the medical charity Medecins Sans
Frontieres said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'It's a dead end and I am very pessimistic about Somalia. It's such a mess
and there is no possibility of it working,' Mr Alain Destexhe,
secretary-general of the medical charity, said.
There had been no improvement in Somalia since the UN dropped its
high-profile hunt for Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, Mr Destexhe said.
The UN had confused its humanitarian and political roles in Somalia and
other crisis areas such as former Yugoslavia. 'After two years, the track
record in Bosnia and Somalia is negative on both a humanitarian and a
political level.'

CONSERVATIVE black leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday warned President F
W de Klerk that he would fight South Africa's new interim constitution and
reduce it to 'the rubble of passing history,' Reuter reports from Durban.
Chief Buthelezi, who quit the constitutional talks five months ago, said in
a statement that Mr de Klerk and African National Congress leader Mr Nelson
Mandela had decided 'to go it alone' without his participation or approval.
'We will meet the present draft constitution ..with determined resistance,'
said Chief Buthelezi, who demands autonomy for the Natal/KwaZulu region
where he has his power base.
'I want to point out that when it comes to the implementation of the new
constitution and the whole transitional phase, nobody should expect us to be
faithful and diligent in assisting,' he added.
Mr De Klerk, Mr Mandela and 17 other leaders approved an interim
constitution early yesterday providing for non-racial elections next April.
Black and white right-wing groups reject the document as a recipe for ANC
domination.
'Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela will in the end know that the best that they
could do together will end up ..incurring the wrath of such a large
percentage of South Africans that (it) will be reduced to the rubble of
passing history,' Mr Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, said.
He told Dutch Foreign Minister Mr Peter Kooijmans yesterday he would not
take part in the election if it meant legitimising a flawed constitution.
'I would rather go into the political wilderness,' he said.
The International Labour Organisation yesterday resumed technical assistance
and co-operation in South Africa after a boycott last three decades.

JAPANESE money supply continued its gentle rise last month, but at exactly
the same rate as previously, further evidence of the sluggishness of demand.
The broadly defined aggregate of M2 (cash in circulation and time and demand
deposits) plus certificates of deposit rose by a preliminary 1.9 per cent in
October, against the same month last year, the Bank of Japan said.
That was the seventh monthly increase in a row, but exactly the same as the
final figure recorded in September and below most economic forecasters'

FT  19 NOV 93 / Hosokawa achieves go-ahead for political reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa yesterday scored a political
victory by winning parliamentary clearance for the first political reforms
since the second world war.
The lower house of parliament gave a bigger-than-expected 270-226 majority
to four government bills to change Japan's discredited multi-seat
constituency system to a mixture of single-seat constituencies and
proportional representation.
Donations to political parties will be strictly controlled, in an attempt to
halt the financial scandals which have swept Japanese politics over the past
few years, and corrupt politicians will be barred from office.
The bills now pass to the government-controlled upper house for final
agreement, expected by the end of the year.
Yesterday's vote exposed further splits in Japan's two largest parties,
which used to be the post-war political establishment - the opposition
Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party, the biggest
partner in the seven-party coalition.
Thirteen mainly young LDP members defied party instructions and voted for
the bills.
Six more abstained, including former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, leader of
one of the two LDP governments to fall because of failure to enact political
reform, and former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu Gotoda.
Five Socialist dissidents ignored instructions to support the government and
voted against the bills, on the ground their party will do badly under
proportional representation.
The Socialist split could widen as the bills pass through the upper house,
where the Socialists have a greater number of rebels.
The lower house vote was a remarkable departure from the political tradition
of reaching consensus on important laws in backroom negotiations.
Attempts at compromise between the ruling seven-party coalition and the
government collapsed on Tuesday, despite compromises offered by Mr Hosokawa,
obliging him to resort to a parliamentary showdown.
Once the bills have gone through the upper house, an independent panel will
draw up new electoral districts for future elections.
The timing of the next general election is up to Mr Hosokawa, but most
political analysts expect it to come in the second half of next year.
Mr Hosokawa's victory augurs well for his meeting with US President Bill
Clinton, a keen advocate of political reform, in Seattle this afternoon.
The Japanese leader is also expected to use the meeting to confirm plans to
cut income tax, due to be tabled by a government panel today.
This step could relieve American pressure on Japan to stimulate domestic
demand for imports, a way of curbing Japan's politically irksome trade
surplus.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Calm greets Nigerian takeover
</HEADLINE>

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Sani Abacha, Nigeria's former defence minister who assumed power on
Wednesday, was last night expected to announce the formation of a new
military-backed government.
But army officials suggested that Gen Abacha, who deposed Chief Ernest
Shonekan, the civlian head of state, would seek a broader base of civilian
support especially amongst elder statesmen than that enjoyed by the interim
government. The strikes and protests of early this week gave way to calm in
the half empty streets of Lagos yesterday as Nigerians awaited the outcome
of talks between the top military officers.
Even in Lagos, where the dominance of the mainly northern military elite is
deeply resented, there was cautious optimism over Gen Abacha's takeover. It
may reflect, however, a resentment that Mr Shonekan agreed to serve the
military administration which last June deprived a fellow southerner of the
presidency. Chief Moshood Abiola won the poll which was annulled by the
military. Lagos is the home state of both men.
'Shonekan's government was just getting in the way of any resolution of the
political deadlock,' said a pro-democracy campaigner.
'If you are going to rule Nigeria you have to have either a mandate from the
people or a gun in your hand. Shonekan had neither,' said a leading banker
in the commercial capital.
The interim government lacked credibility from the start being handpicked by
Gen Ibrahim Babangida after his resignation at the end of August. It was
handicapped by its inability to legislate by decree or to govern through the
National Assembly.
Last week's high court ruling in Lagos that the interim government had no
legal basis and the popular protest at the rise in the fuel price damaged Mr
Shonekan's standing.
The police have declared demonstrations illegal and the Campaign for
Democracy, which led the opposition to extended military rule through civil
protests in July, has called off its two-day demonstration in Lagos.
Crowds burning barricades in Lagos' main road were dispersed in the morning
but apart from the detention of several civilians there was little tension.
There were minor protests in the northern city of Kaduna and serious
disturbances at the country's main petrochemicals and refinery complex in
Eleme near Port Harcourt, where angry crowds blocked access to the plant and
protested against the central government for diverting oil revenue from the
region.

FT  19 NOV 93 / A decisive push against Japan's old system: Parliament's
vote for new electoral laws that stunned the LDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEERS broke out yesterday afternoon in the normally sedate Japanese
parliament as 10 opposition Liberal Democratic party members filed up to the
podium to vote with the government.
Each man solemnly handed in a white tile, signifying that he had flouted
party instructions and supported the government's four political reform
bills designed to sweep aside the scandal prone political system which kept
the LDP in power for 38 years until last July.
Clapping broke out on the coalition benches, where the prime minister
Morihiro Hosokawa was seated, faintly smiling, surrounded by his rag-bag
seven-party coalition, stretching from religious right through liberal to
socialist.
Silence hung over the other side of the house as grim looking Mr Yohei Kono,
LDP president, reflected on his party's second humiliation since losing a
vote of no confidence in June. With the help of those LDP defectors, the
reform plans swept through the lower house yesterday with a majority of 270
to 226, far larger than expected.
The vote was another decisive push against the remains of the old structure
of Japanese politics, clearing the site for a re-alignment of parties and
politicians.
With the LDP now fearing that it will go down for a third time, perhaps at
an election late next year, Mr Hosokawa's pledges to transform the style and
substance of Japanese politics are gradually being fulfilled.
The manner of his victory yesterday was a departure from the tradition of
consensus-seeking on important legislation, and will add to a personal
popularity based on the public perception that he is at least trying to be
honest.
But Mr Hosokawa's power is linked to the continuation of his diverse
coalition, united only by the desire for political reform. Other coalition
members have their own visions of the political realignment that will
follow.
These visions do not necessarily include Mr Hosokawa and could transfer the
drama of politics back from the public stage of parliament to the backrooms
of the Tokyo political district, where a fine public image does not count
for much.
The legislative reforms, still to be passed by the upper house of
parliament, will end the present multi-seat constituency system, blamed for
encouraging corruption by promoting intense competition among and within
parties to raise campaign funds.
Under the old system, politicians courted construction companies with
promises of huge public works investments that would be directed towards
them, as a result of which more than 20 executives and local politicians are
being questioned by public prosecutors.
The proposed system is a mix of UK-style first past the post single-seat
constituencies and continental European-style proportional representation.
There will also be tough controls on corporate donations, and a fixed system
of public donations.
The dangers ahead for Mr Hosokawa come not from a crippled LDP, but from the
power struggle that will now take place within the coalition. He has reason
to fear Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the main power broker in the coalition who was
co-founder of the LDP splinter group that brought down the former
government.
Mr Ozawa was a valuable ally earlier this week when he used his knowledge of
the LDP to undermine its unity. Now he wants LDP defectors for his party,
the Japan Renewal Party.
There is talk of a JRP merger with another coalition member, Komeito, the
Clean Government Party, linked to an influential but murky Buddhist
movement, the Soka Gakkai, to form a mainstream centre-right grouping. The
ambitious Mr Ozawa has never hidden his desire for a system of two
conservative groupings.
But for now, the wily Mr Ozawa needs the honest Mr Hosokawa's popularity. Mr
Ozawa has been forced to wait behind the scenes because of a poor public
profile, stained this month by his confirmation that he, too, had received
large but, he insists, legal donations from contractors.
Mr Ozawa's second problem is that few mainstream voters would be keen to
vote for Komeito, which relies for political support on the religious
faithful.
Alternatively, an election could produce another hotch-potch coalition of
parties able to put aside differing ideologies and religious beliefs for the
sake of holding power.
But before then, an independent body, under the prime minister's office,
will have to draw up new single-seat electoral districts. The boundaries
will be the subject of intense inter-party bargaining for at least six
months.
But on one thing, most political analysts agree. The next election should
encourage real debate from a previously impassive public. It will put
pressure on politicians, elected in the past because of their powerful
political alignments, to provide distinctive policies or style.
The seismic upheavals of the past few months have shaken out a large
floating vote and narrowed the differences between parties. Undecided voters
account for 35 per cent of the total according to a recent survey, which
shows no clear leaders among the other main groupings.
'The last election already showed that organisation was not everything,'
says Jeff Young, political analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia.
All this coincides with, or could be a consequence of, a general cultural
change among people at large, away from general adherence to the communal
discipline symbolised by four decades of one-party LDP rule, and towards an
eagerness to pursue individual ideas.
This shift is visible in a number of odd ways. Companies and employees are
starting to rethink the traditional social contract of a job for life in
return for absolute loyalty.
Political chat shows are becoming popular on television and sober suited
'salarymen' can even be seen wearing coloured ties instead of the ubiquitous
pearly grey.
Mr Hosokawa cannot claim credit for changing Japanese fashion, despite his
fondness for Armani ties. But the success of his personal style of politics
has ensured that political change has swept onwards. The sober-tied veterans
of the LDP will spend longer in the opposition benches than they had ever
imagined.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, Japan's second biggest car maker, plans to close four of its
Japanese factories for two days next month in an attempt to trim output and
cut costs, it said yesterday, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
The decision reflects the severity of Japan's economic slowdown and its
impact on the car industry. Nissan has already announced plans to close one
of its main factories on the outskirts of Tokyo.
The move will affect about 15,000 employees, to be given extra days off with
90 per cent pay, to be funded partly from government employment adjustment
subsidies. The closures, which will cut output by about 4,000 vehicles,
follow a similar move this month affecting over 2,000 workers.
The company's domestic production declined by 13 per cent in the first half
of the fiscal year. The decision also reflects the downturn in the European
market, where exports have fallen 47 per cent. Nissan has already revised
its production forecast by 12 per cent to 1.8m units.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Nafta vote raises Gatt deal hopes - US
decision means just half of the battle is won, says Sutherland

TRADE officials urged yesterday that US congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement should be used to secure a successful
completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, praised President Bill Clinton's success, but noted that the
234-200 vote in the House of Representatives was 'just half of the battle
won'.
The priority would now necessarily turn to successful completion of the
Uruguay round.
'Nafta and similar enterprises - no less the European Union - cannot thrive
in isolation. They are not economically self-sustainable and must be part of
a broader world trading system under the aegis of the Gatt,' he said.
'The other half of the battle, making the Nafta a genuine positive force in
the world economy, must be the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.'
The Nafta vote cast a shadow over Gatt talks in recent weeks, tying US
negotiators' hands when the time remaining for completing the round has been
perilously short, and difficult deadlock-breaking compromises have been
urgently needed.
Amid rising optimism that a long-elusive trade-liberalsing package is
finally within negotiators' grasp, expectations have run high in Geneva that
the success of the Nafta vote would free top US and EU trade negotiators
meeting in Washington early next week to provide long-awaited impetus.
Mr Sutherland's comments came during a briefing intended to underline trade
liberalising moves that have already been provisionally agreed in Uruguay
Round negotiations, and to focus on what is at risk if the small number of
outstanding differences result in failure.
'What is in the bank is still capable of being lost,' he said.
In Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, welcomed the House
vote in favour of Nafta, saying it would remove a big distraction for the
Clinton administration and allow a final drive for agreement in Gatt talks.
However, Sir Leon sounded a note of caution, telling reporters that he
needed to look at the 'small print' to see what the White House may have
offered members of Congress to get their vote and how it might affect Gatt.
With only four weeks remaining to the December 15 deadline for a Gatt deal,
Sir Leon is due to hold talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, in Washington next week.
Meanwhile, France said it was now up to the US to produce 'new proposals' to
bring the Gatt negotiations to the same successful conclusion as the Nafta
accord.
Mr Gerard Longuet, France's foreign trade minister, said the the Clinton
administration could and should henceforth 'devote itself fully to the
Uruguay Round'.
Mr Sutherland warned that 'if what is currently on the table is now lost,'
then 'the threat from unreconcilable disputes will be intense'.
Mr Gijs de Vries, a Dutch member of the European Parliament speaking for the
body's liberal group, hailed the Nafta vote as a 'victory for common sense'.
'The only 'sucking sound' Americans will hear is the sound of exports going
south,' he said, referring to Mr Ross Perot's oft-quoted description of
Americans losing their jobs to Mexico as a result of Nafta.

PASSAGE of the North American Free Trade Agreement by the House of
Representatives was applauded by the US business community yesterday and
roundly condemned by trade union officials.
Business leaders from many industry sectors praised the agreement, saying it
would boost exports by US companies to Mexico and Canada, create jobs for
American workers and enhance the role of the US an advocate of free trade.
In remarks that captured the general tone of the reaction, Mr John Smith,
chief executive of General Motors, said: 'By saying Yes to Nafta, the House
had made good on a great window of opportunity for America. For the first
time, American-made products will be able to compete fairly in Mexico
without the burden of tariffs and other barriers.'
Most union officials vowed to continue their fight against the agreement and
repeated warnings to legislators who supported it. 'American workers will
not forget. . . those succumbed to the pressure,' said Mr Jack Sheinkman,
president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
'We need an agreement that affords workers the same protections which Nafta
affords corporations.'

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Salinas sees his big gamble vindicated -
Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas's huge gamble in embracing the North American Free
Trade Agreement more than three years ago has been vindicated by the
decision of the US House of Representatives to support the agreement, but
the costs of ratification have been higher than he could have ever have
imagined.
The agreement - still to be ratified by the US and Mexican Senate but
certain to be passed by both - is widely considered the most important
economic and foreign policy initiative taken by Mr Salinas in his five-year
administration, and possibly by any Mexican president in decades.
The pact formally reverses generations of Mexican nationalism, and would in
all likelihood lock in the pro-market economic reforms of the Salinas
government for the fore seeable future.
'It is a turning point for Mexico,' says Lorenzo Zambrano, the chief
executive of Cemex, the giant Mexican cement company. 'It guaran tees the
change from a closed protected economy to an open, competitive one.'
Other Mexicans see the treaty in almost metaphysical MEXICO terms. 'Nafta
buries the Mexican revolution,' says Mr Homero Aridjis, a poet and
ecologist. 'It is the end of an epoch and a new economic revolution will
start.'
The agreement's approval would come as a personal boon to the president, who
had staked much of his personal prestige on the treaty. It should also make
next year's presidential election easier for Mexico's ruling party, from
which Mr Salinas is prevented from standing.
Nafta's passage should also help Mexico in its quest to join the
Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation. Standard &amp; Poors,
the US rating agency, said that the agreement combined with conservative
economic policies could help Mexico earn investment grade status and revised
its outlook for Mexico from stable to positive.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Chile 'ready to become Nafta member'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONDITIONS are in place for Chile to join the North American Free Trade
Agreement, Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister, said in Santiago
yesterday. He had been assured two weeks ago by President Bill Clinton that
once Nafta was approved, Chile would be next in line for a free trade pact,
he added.
Mr Jean Chretien, the new Canadian prime minister, had also indicated his
interest in a free trade accord with Chile, while one was already in place
with Mexico, which calls for the mutual elimination of tariffs on most goods
by 1998.
Mr Foxley had no opinion whether the best route would be to secure bilateral
trade pacts with the three Nafta members or seek accession to Nafta.
Acknowledging Mr Clinton had other priorities, he said there was no rush to
sign an accord. 'It's not for us an extremely significant economic event, in
the short term at least.'
Latin American countries should continue to move ahead with their
integration efforts. In a world of managed trade, negotiating clout was what
counted and Latin countries could only achieve that by banding together.
Chile could eventually become a partner in the 'Group of Three' of Mexico,
Colombia and Venezuela, which are expected to finalise a free trade accord
shortly.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Anti-dumping issues given priority -
Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA is urging the US and Mexico to set up a high-profile mechanism to
negotiate new anti-dumping and subsidy rules within a specific time frame
under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, is expected to tell President
Bill Clinton when the two men meet in Seattle today that Canada's
implementation of Nafta on January 1 is conditional on the creation of
working groups, or similar bodies, to deal expeditiously with these issues.
Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's trade minister, yesterday indicated however, that
the new Liberal government, which came to office last month, was unlikely to
delay Nafta's implementation.
CANADA US anti-dumping and countervail actions have been at the heart of
several acrimonious trade disputes with Canada over the past few years,
including softwood lumber and pork. Most recently, Washington has threatened
to act against alleged subsidies on Canadian durum wheat.
'At the very least, the government wants to ensure that the anti-dumping
issue is front and centre,' a senior government official said yesterday.
Nafta already provides for a working party on trade and competition policy,
and for further examination of subsidies.
Canada's concerns on subsidies would be substantially addressed by a
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations. But the Uruguay Round would do little to reform anti-dumping
rules.
Nafta's approval by the US House of Representatives had little impact on
Canadian financial markets yesterday. Mr Michael Manford, chief economist at
ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, said that Nafta had been overshadowed by concerns
about widening federal and provincial budget deficits.
Nafta is expected to have a far smaller impact on the Canadian economy than
the four-year-old US-Canada free trade agreement. Canada's trade with Mexico
totals about CDollars 3bn a year, a fraction of its trade with the US.
Mr Manford said that Nafta might be mildly damaging to Canadian business in
the short term, as some labour-intensive sectors, such as textiles and shoe
manufacturers, moved production facilities to Mexico. But these losses are
expected to be offset later by rising exports to Mexico.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gore up front and deals in the backrooms -
What turned the tide in the fight for Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOCIFEROUS opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement first
surfaced three years ago when a coalition of US labour, environmentalists,
consumer groups, farm and church organisations formed to oppose extension of
the 'fast track' authorisation, under which Congress agrees to vote on trade
pacts such as Nafta without amendment.
These groups comprise the worker bees of the Democratic party, so it was
with trepidation that the supporters of then Governor Bill Clinton watched
their candidate endorse Nafta during the primary and general election
campaigns last year.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman and now US trade representative,
said Mr Clinton immediately recognised that Nafta would not be 'politically
viable' - with either the electorate or the Congress later on - without the
side deals ultimately negotiated on labour, environment and unexpected
import surges.
The big business backers of the trade pact perceived that Nafta was in deep
trouble when, during the presidential debates, Mr Ross Perot, the
independent candidate, repeatedly raised the threat of a 'giant sucking
sound' drawing US factories south of the US-Mexico border. The phrase found
resonance in the steady drumbeat of corporate cutback announcements,
fuelling worker insecurity as the US economy restructures.
Organising against Nafta continued as negotiations over the supplemental
pacts dragged on for seven months. The administration was in a squeeze;
business, Mexico and Canada were resisting a strong deal guaranteeing the
right of Mexican workers to organise and strike. It was not clear that the
US unions would support any Nafta at all.
Just as Republicans and the business community were grumbling that President
Clinton did not have his heart in Nafta and Congress returned from its
summer recess alarmed about the pact's unpopularity, the White House put on
a spectacular launch ceremony. On the bill were President Clinton at his
most passionate (inexplicably, he is always his best on Nafta) and the
endorsements of former Presidents George Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter,
all of which came to symbolise the extraordinary bi-partisanship which in
the end got Nafta through the House.
Thereafter, a succession of White House events, including Nafta endorsements
by practically every living former cabinet official and economist,
presidential trips and speeches, just barely moved public opinion on Nafta.
'Four weeks ago not one person, outside a few, thought we could pass this
Nafta,' Mr Kantor said.
The president was eating with, jogging with and pressuring congressmen, but
making little apparent headway until Vice President Al Gore suggested
debating Mr Perot.
It was a brilliant strategy, because it personalised Nafta in the form of an
arrogant, secretive and peculiar Texas billionaire. Mr Perot's televised
threats - and those of labour - that they would eject from office all Nafta
supporters in the House was a big miscalculation. It caused resentment among
congressmen and a determination by some not to be seen as being in labour's
pocket.
Implicitly acknowledging that backroom deals would be key to passage, the
administration brought in as 'Nafta czar' Mr William Daley, son of the late
Chicago mayor 'Boss' Richard Daley and brother of the current mayor. It was
a series of deals that Mr Daley was involved in and which were detailed in
presidential letters to congressmen, and a turnaround in public opinion
after the debate, which brought a flood of endorsements just before the vote
and clinched the 234-200 victory.

JAPAN yesterday welcomed the US vote for the North American Free Trade
Agreement, but warned that it will watch closely to ensure there is no
discrimination against countries outside the region.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who himself won parliamentary passage of
important plans for political reform only hours after the US vote, praised
the US govern JAPAN ment for getting Nafta through the House of
Representatives.
Nafta will avert protectionist moves in the US Congress, predicted Mr
Terusuke Terada, foreign ministry spokesman. However, Nafta should be
implemented in accordance with Gatt rules and must not raise obstacles to
foreign countries, he added.
The foreign ministry's warning was echoed by the Keidanren business
federation. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, its chairman, said the Keidanren would
closely monitor the fair enforcement of rules of origin under Nafta.
Separately, banking officials predicted that the accord could encourage more
Japanese companies and banks to invest in Mexico.
Shares in Tokyo rose sharply just before the Nafta vote, partly in
anticipation of success, but the Nikkei 225 average fell back later in the
day, to end up 57.61 points at 18,166.32.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Clinton got his backing at a bargain price
 -The administration won the support it needed in congress for Nafta without
tying its trade negotiating hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a deal the president could not refuse: support for his tax programme
from the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee in exchange for
approval of a sugar price support scheme.
That was the bargain made in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, the proclaimed
free trader, with Senator Russell Long of Louisiana.
The effects are still being felt. The tax cut added billions to the US
budget deficit and the sugar programme curbed developing country exports to
the world's most lucrative sugar market.
The deals cut by the administration of President Bill Clinton to get House
approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement pale in comparison. As
set out in a letter to various congressmen, they are long on expressions of
concern but carefully hedged by conditions which ought not tie US
negotiators' hands in the Uruguay Round. They could result in some industry
protection, but mostly the pacts appear useful in providing political cover
for pro-Nafta congressmen.
On textiles for example, the president promised to dedicate an additional
Dollars 15m for enforcement of Customs regulations and the hiring of 136 new
Customs Service employees to detect transhipment and other illegalities. He
reassured congressmen that China would get no quota increase from the
Uruguay Round until it becomes a signatory to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade 'and agrees to open its markets to US textiles and
apparel'.
He vowed to negotiate the longest possible phase-out of textile quotas. If
the six-country Association of South East Asian Nations, the Caribbean
countries and Ireland will support a 15-year phase-out period, the US will
seek to re-open the current text 'to negotiate acceptance of such a
proposal'.
With respect to textile tariff cuts - a key to the tariff reduction talks in
Geneva - the president says these should be staged over a period 'at least
as long as the phase-out of the MFA (the Multi-Fibre Arrangement)'.
Furthermore, he promised not to include 'sensitive products', such as wool,
until the end of the phase-out period, and to work with the industry and
Congress to determine which products are the most sensitive.
In talks between the US and European Union industries, the president 'would
not anticipate going substantially beyond our current proposals on sensitive
products'.
On another deal concerning imports of peanut products from Canada, the
president ordered the agriculture secretary to begin talks with the Canadian
government 'to remedy the increase in imports'.
He also requested the US International Trade Commission, an independent
bipartisan agency, to investigate the imports to see if they are undermining
the US price support programme. This ultimately could lead to higher tariffs
or quotas against Canadian peanut butter.
Congressmen involved in a deal over citrus would not release their
presidential letters. However, one said it contained a promise not to cut
the US citrus tariff by more than 15 per cent in the Uruguay Round.
Backers of beef producers were also reluctant to release their letters.
However, one said the president had promised to abide by an established
US-Mexican agreement, predating Nafta, which would allow US meat inspectors
to visit Mexican facilities during on-going investigations without advance
notice. He also agreed to boost the number of inspectors from 250 to 350.
One of the most satisfied deal makers was the Florida Congressman Clay Shaw,
who had demanded extradition from Mexico of a man wanted in California for
the rape of a child.
He said he had received assurances from the Mexican government that the
extra-dition treaty would be honoured.

Ministers and officials at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in
Seattle expressed relief at President Bill Clinton's Nafta victory in the
House of Representatives on Wednesday night, George Graham reports from
Seattle. Although delegates have avoided saying that a Nafta defeat would
turn Mr Clinton into a lame duck host for this 15 country gathering,
officials clearly believe the US president will now be in a much stronger
position to give leadership to Apec.
'He'll come here as a stronger duck,' said Mr Peter Cook, Australia's trade
minister.
'Certainly, it seems to me to strengthen President Clinton's presentation of
himself as a man committed to freer trade and liberal trade on a global
basis,' said Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's minister for international trade.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Clinton hails Nafta vote by Congress - US
now has 'economic, political and moral standing' to push for conclusion to
Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A JUBILANT President Bill Clinton flew off to his Asian summit in Seattle
yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in Congress and promising new
initiatives to liberalise word trade.
Approval on Wednesday night by the House of Representatives of the North
American Free Trade Agreement was, he declared on the White House lawn, 'a
long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous
international competition.
The Nafta vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to
make its case, he said, not only with the Asian leaders but also in the
final push successfully to conclude a new Uruguay Round of global trading
talks. Vital Gatt talks are to be held next week in Washington between Mr
Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC
commissioner.
The US Senate is expected to approve Nafta next week, as is its Mexican
counterpart. Mr Clinton said President Salinas had invited Vice President Al
Gore for the Mexican side of the ratification process.
The new trading bloc, which also includes Canada, is to take effect on
January 1.
The House victory, on a vote of 234-200, was far more comfortable than had
appeared likely even as the House debated the agreement until late in the
evening. The majority was composed of 132 of the 175 Republicans and 102 of
the 258 Democrats, with the sole independent voting against.
Before he went to bed, Mr Clinton signed letters of thanks to all who had
voted in favour and hoped that the bipartisan spirit that had carried the
day could be applied to other great upcoming issues, such as health care
reform.
But the president also went to great lengths to compliment the opposition
and to heal the open wounds in his own Democratic Party, especially with
organised labour. He promised new initiatives on education and worker
retraining, while Mr Gore said the administration was 'uncomfortable in
being in disagreement with the folks we normally fight along with, side by
side.'
Trade union leaders, however, were unmollified. The full hierarchy of the
AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation, held a press conference to regret
Nafta's passage.
'It has little to do with the national interest,' said Mr Lane Kirkland,
AFL-CIO president, but was 'a secure means of escape' from US laws for US
and multinational corporations. Mr Bill Bywater, head of the electricians,
warned those Democrats who voted in favour: 'We're gonna make sure we get
even at the polls.' Mr Owen Bieber, of the car workers, said Senate votes
next week would be duly noticed, too. Mr Ross Perot, a loser in the Nafta
debate, also threatened retaliation by his independent movement.
Mr Jim Jontz, director of the Citizens' Trade Campaign against Nafta,
promised similar scrutiny of a Uruguay Round agreement. 'I feel we already
won because clearly Nafta could not be sold on its merits and the president
had to start dealing to get votes.'
Republican leaders were generally pleased with the co-operation with the
White House over an accord first negotiated by President Bush. Several said
Nafta would have failed without overwhelming Republican support and that,
therefore, the party could no longer be accused of perpetuating 'gridlock'
in Washington.
But a Congress staff member predicted 'serious disagreements' with Mr
Clinton on health care and spending cuts.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Strike disrupts American Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FLIGHTS operated by American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, were
severely disrupted yesterday as the airline's flight attendants started an
11-day strike over changes in working conditions.
The company kept most services running with the help of non-striking
attendants and employees seconded from other duties.
But at least 40 per cent of flights from its Dallas/Fort Worth hub had to
leave without passengers because of crew shortages.
Other carriers took passengers to their destinations.
The flight attendants' union, the Association of Professional Flight
Attendants, has called out its 21,000 members at American Airlines following
the breakdown of talks on new labour contracts.
The company is seeking to cut costs by reducing staffing levels on some
flights and changing holiday and pension arrangements.
In return, it is increasing the attendants' pay by amounts averaging 7.8 per
cent a year for the next four years. The flight attendants' union says the
changes in conditions are unacceptable.
American Airlines believes it can ride out the dispute and has told strikers
that they will lose their jobs.
Yesterday it announced it had started recruiting new flight attendants at
Forth Worth and would shortly start doing so in 30 other cities.
The dispute is casting a cloud over attempts by the beleaguered US airline
industry to restore profitability by securing employees' agreement to cuts
in labour costs.
All the large carriers are under pressure to change working practices
because of the entry into the domestic market of rapidly-expanding carriers
like Southwest Airlines which operate at far higher levels of productivity.

FT  19 NOV 93 / World Bank economists give warning on Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INSTABILITY in Brazil threatens the deregulation of the economy achieved
since 1990, two World Bank economists warn in a report published today. The
report, The State and Private Sector in Brazil, by Geoffrey Shepherd and
Paul Holden, argues that experience in other countries suggests
microeconomic reforms rarely survive for long in unstable conditions.
'If instability remains at current levels or worsens, the deregulation
achieved since 1990 will be threatened,' it says. Inflation in Brazil is
running at about 35 per cent a month and mostly above an annual 800 per cent
since 1987.
The economists point to dangers of using the exchange rate as an
inflation-fighting tool. 'The danger is that in these circumstances,
governments may lower the cost of foreign exchange to cheapen imports and
provide some short-term inflation relief.'
This could lead to a balance of payments deficit and consequent import
controls to preserve foreign exchange reserves. Instability would make it
difficult for companies to restructure to compete with new imports. Reform
in this context would therefore be viewed as a failure.
Brazil's stock market has risen this week on reports that the government
would create a new inflation index, to be adjusted in line with the exchange
rate. Such an index, to replace existing indexes for taxation, public sector
tariff and interest rate purposes, would be interpreted as a first step to
some kind of exchange-rate anchor.
The report, to be presented to a conference organised by the World Bank in
Sao Paulo today , views the prospects for stabilising the economy as poor,
in the short-term at least, because of political uncertainty.
The report concludes that economic instability, and in particular the
repeated attempts since 1986 to tackle inflation through shock programmes,
is severely impeding the private sector.
Brazil's foreign debt negotiator Mr Andre Lara Resende is expected to leave
the post in the coming weeks, Angus Foster reports from Brasilia.
Mr Resende wants to return to the private sector, and has told finance
minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso that he will resign once initial
agreement is reached with the country's creditor banks.
Mr Resende is thought to be frustrated with political opposition to reforms
needed to combat inflation, now close to 2,000 per cent a year.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Inflation still enemy of US economy, says OECD: Report views
policy today as stimulative rather than neutral, even as it forecasts
moderate growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's advocacy of
higher US interest rates may seem surprising given its relative optimism
about the US inflation outlook and its projection of growth, moderate by the
standards of past business cycles.
The Paris-based research body of the industrialised countries is forecasting
a slight decline in US consumer price inflation to 2.7 per cent next year
against 2.8 per cent this year. Gross domestic product growth, meanwhile, is
expected to accelerate slightly, to 3.0 per cent against 2.8 per cent this
year. This would reduce the jobless rate (on the present definition) to 6.4
per cent by the end of next year, high enough by most economists' reckoning
to sustain downward pressure on wage inflation.
Had the OECD been using the US labor department's new series for
unemployment, however, it might have forecast a jobless rate of close to 7
per cent by the end of 1994.
Many economists will argue that such an outlook does not warrant more than a
light touch on the monetary brakes. Yet OECD officials say the Federal
Reserve should raise short-term interest rates from 3 per cent today to
close to 5 per cent by the end of next year. Much of the increase, moreover,
should occur in the first half of next year.
The OECD starts from the assumption that inflation of about 3 per cent is
too high. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is taken at his
word when he says he wants to reduce inflation to the point where it no
longer influences business decisions. That, argues the OECD, means a rate of
about 2 per cent. Reducing inflation significantly while a business upswing
is under way requires a significant tightening of monetary policy.
OECD officials argue that US policy today is stimulative rather than
neutral. They estimate that inflation-adjusted short-term interest rates
have averaged about 1.25 per cent since 1960. A neutral monetary policy
would thus require short-term rates of about 4.25 per cent rather than 3 per
cent. The issue is thus when to 'rein in the stimulus'.
Then there is the problem of policy lags. The US needs to raise interest
rates, argues the OECD, not to fight inflation next year, but to ensure that
it does not get out of hand in 1995 and 1996. The longer the Fed postpones a
policy adjustment the larger will be the required increase in rates.
Economists at the OECD argue that if short-term rates are raised to about 5
per cent by the end of 1994 and held there for a year, no further tightening
would be needed. The peak of interest rates in this cycle would be a
relatively benign 5 per cent, compared with about 9 per cent in the late
1980s. A reduction in rates might be feasible in 1996 - which would be
politically convenient as that is an election year.
The OECD's overall assessment of US trends is positive. It notes that
projections of 3 per cent growth and only a modest decline in the jobless
rate will strike many Americans as disappointing. But 'it is actually rather
satisfactory, given the weakness of export markets and the ongoing
structural adjustments that must be faced . . .'.
It expects a cyclical increase in the US current account deficit, from 1.1
per cent of GDP in 1992 to 2 per cent in 1994, but does not view this with
alarm because it reflects faster growth of demand in the US than elsewhere.
Despite the bigger deficit, 'the very favourable cost position of US
manufacturers ought to boost the US share of export markets'.
The OECD praises the Clinton administration's efforts to reduce the budget
deficit, but it warns that the big increase in tax rates on high earners may
raise less revenue than expected. And it notes that the ratio of debt to GDP
will continue to rise. In 1997, when the economy is expected to be at full
employment, the deficit will be 'disappointingly large, at over 2 1/2 per
cent of GDP'.
In a lengthy assessment of US productivity trends, the OECD concludes that
the US is still easily the world's most productive economy. But it warns
that 'the US productivity standard is likely to be surpassed in the next
decade or so by a number of countries' because most other industrial
economies are saving and investing more of national income than the US.
The OECD claims there is no convincing evidence as yet that the recent wave
of corporate restructuring has significantly raised the US trend rate of
productivity. And it warns that 'growing skill-based disparities in
employment and earnings have the makings of a major social problem'.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Bosnians agree safe passage for aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the three warring factions in Bosnia yesterday promised to end
interference with United Nations humanitarian aid supplies on which over 3m
people depend for survival.
They signed a 'joint and solemn commitment' to allow safe passage for UN
convoys, after Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, called
them to Geneva in what was described as a 'last ditch' effort to unblock the
UN aid effort in Bosnia.
This has been increasingly paralysed by fierce fighting between Bosnian
Croats and mainly Moslem government forces in central Bosnia, and by
deliberate attempts on the part of all sides to hinder supplies getting
through, including attacks on UN workers. The UNHCR has also been concerned
at the refusal of local militias to let through clothes, fuel and shelter
materials.
The accord calls for a suspension of hostilities along aid supply routes
when convoys are passing, free and unconditional access to the best routes,
safety for UN and other humanitarian workers, the right of the UN and the
International Committee of the Red Cross to decide what supplies should go
to whom, and respect for international humanitarian law.
At a news conference afterwards, Mrs Ogata described the accord as 'the
minimum' required to avert disaster this winter, but added that without
peace 'I don't know whether a humanitarian catastrophe can be avoided'.
Mindful of the many broken promises in the past, she earlier told the
meeting she was 'not asking for new promises, but for deeds'.
The accord was signed by Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, for the
Bosnian Croats, who were accompanied by senior military commanders. The high
commissioner said that, significantly, it was the first time all three
parties had signed a joint assurance on security for aid deliveries.
Mrs Ogata said she would immediately recommend a resumption of UN aid
convoys into central Bosnia, suspended nearly four weeks ago after a Danish
driver was killed and nine other UN personnel wounded in what seems to have
been a deliberate attack by Bosnian Moslem forces.
In a toughly worded opening address to the meeting, which was also attended
by the head of the ICRC, Mrs Ogata told the Bosnian leaders that they alone
bore the responsibility for the suffering in their country.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Bonn seeks to patch up an ailing social state: Unification
and recession have brought matters to a head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three weeks ago, more than 100,000 building workers descended on Bonn to
protest against the loss of a crucial social benefit, in the largest mass
trade union protest in the city for more than a decade.
They were up in arms over the pending abolition of their 'bad weather
money', a state subsidy given to the building industry to ensure workers are
not simply sent home when snow falls in winter.
A few days before, it was the turn of the steelworkers in the Ruhr. They
took to the streets over tough new rules on unemployment benefit being
introduced by Bonn.
In future, earnings-related unemployment benefits (at around two-thirds of
previous income) will not be available for the rest of one's normal working
life. They will be restricted to a maximum four years' duration; then
jobless workers will have to exist on subsistence-level social assistance.
Both demonstrations revealed the tide of anger sweeping the German labour
movement over what unions see as the demolition of their prized welfare
state. They also underlined the remarkable generosity of the German system
in recent years, and one of the reasons why it is now under unprecedented
pressure.
For 20 years, the crisis of the social system has been under debate. The
demographic pressures of an ageing population, combined with a falling birth
rate and shrinking workforce, have been clear. Today, one in five of the
population is 20 or younger, and one in five is 60 or older. By the year
2000, the over-60s will total one in four. By 2030, 38 per cent will be over
60, and only 16 per cent of the population under 20.
In less than 30 years, a declining working population will have to finance
the social costs of roughly the same number of people who are either too
young or too old to work.
Two developments have now brought matters to a head. Not only the
conservatives and liberals in the ruling coalition, but also the social
democrats in opposition, are looking for ways to reform the social state.
The first change was unification. Suddenly, almost 17m potential new
claimants have been brought into the social state in east Germany, expecting
full benefits, but only now beginning to make their contributions. Total
social spending rocketed from DM744bn (Pounds 295bn) in 1990 to DM1,001bn
(Pounds 397bn) in 1992 thanks to huge new demands on the pensions and
unemployment funds.
Second has come the sharpest recession since the war, and with it new levels
of unemployment in both halves of the country, forecast to reach more than
4m next year, or over 10 per cent. That has reduced social insurance
contributions just as the costs shoot up.
A third factor has also served to concentrate the minds of the political
establishment on the financing of the welfare state: the campaign to
introduce a new pillar in the social system, called nursing care insurance.
The scheme is intended to provide guaranteed residential care for some 1.65m
old and handicapped people needing constant nursing care, at a cost of some
DM13bn a year. It is supposed to stand alongside the existing pillars:
pensions, health care, and unemployment and accident insurance.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his labour minister, Mr Norbert Blum, have staked
their political reputations on getting the scheme made law before next
October's elections. It is, in a way, a defence against the charge that they
are seeking to dismantle the welfare state.
Everyone agrees that such a system is desirable. But practically no one can
agree on how to finance the costs, which seem certain to soar in line with
the demographic trends.
It has focused attention precisely on the way in which social welfare is
paid for - through employers' and employees' contributions, not through the
central exchequer.
The result of this is that rising welfare costs are reflected instantly in
rising labour costs, and thus in the fraught question of German
competitiveness on the world market. Combined social insurance costs have
rise from 26.5 per cent of gross wages in 1970, to a forecast 40.2 per cent
next year (assuming the 1 per cent nursing care insurance premium is
introduced).
The entire business community is up in arms over those rising 'ancillary
costs' of labour, and in particular over the plan to impose the further 1
per cent for nursing care next year. As a result, the government has
promised to find some way of compensating them for the extra cost.
The alternatives - either to abolish two of the 10 national holidays, or to
cut holiday pay by 20 per cent - have in turn infuriated the labour
movement. Mr Kohl cannot win.
Yet the unions and the Social Democrats agree the system's financing needs
changing. They say that because it is based on direct contributions, only
registered workers - excluding the self-employed and public sector workers -
are bearing the full cost of unemployment, retraining and job creation in
east Germany. The answer, they believe, is to switch that burden to the
taxpayer.
It would be more fair and would remove the immediate visible pressure on
wage costs. The SPD proposes that the tax burden should be borne by the
highest income-earners, and possibly by a wealth tax.
On the other hand, the contributions-based system means that workers and
employers are acutely conscious of the costs of the social state, and
therefore exert political pressure to keep it under control. Shifting part
of the burden to taxation would not bring the real costs of the system down.
Mr Johann Eekhoff, state secretary in the economics ministry, argues that it
is essential to extend working lives, and counter the trend to early
retirement. 'We need more income for the social security system,' he says.
'That need not come from higher contributions, if we can reverse the current
trend, and actually extend normal working lives.'
He also argues in favour of a longer working week, and a restriction on the
normal time spent in higher education: the average German university
graduate is 29.
But at a time of rising structural unemployment, those are solutions
bitterly opposed by the labour movement, which wants working time cut to
create more jobs. Employers are also keen to use early retirement as a
relatively painless way to reduce workforces.
Meanwhile, the government is seeking to cap its social spending commitments
 -for example by a 3 percentage point cut in unemployment benefits,
abolishing the 'bad weather money' and putting a time-limit on
earnings-related benefits - in a small way, without tackling the underlying
challenge.
It did the same with the package of health reforms introduced last January,
restricting benefits in the short term, but not changing the open-ended
structure of a system whose costs are geared to rise inexorably with an
ageing population.
So far, the problems in the social state have been all too clearly
identified. Long-term solutions are in desperately short supply.

THE Czech Republic has extended the registration deadline for a voucher
privatisation which aims to sell shares in up to 770 companies with a book
value of Kcs145bn (Pounds 3.3bn), writes Patrick Blum in Vienna.
Companies now have until the end of December to register for privatisation,
and citizens until December 8 to register for voucher books, compared with
an original deadline of December 1 for both.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister, said the main reason for the extension was
to avoid companies having to close their annual accounts twice in one month
to provide the full accounts necessary for registration.

Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the former Ferruzzi group executive against whom Milan

police shortly, according to his defence lawyer, writes Haig Simonian from
Milan.
The warrant against Mr Cragnotti, who left Ferruzzi in 1990 to set up his
own merchant banking group, is part of a new sweep against suspects,
including Mr Enrico Braggiotti, the former chairman of Italy's prestigious
Banca Commerciale Italiana. Both are being sought in investigations into the
affairs of the troubled Ferruzzi group. Mr Cragnotti was a close aide to Mr
Raul Gardini, the former Ferruzzi boss who shot himself last July. Mr
Braggiotti his main bankers.

SOME 40,000 Romanian union members yesterday marched through Bucharest

Virginia Marsh from Bucharest.
The march, organised by the CNSLR-Fratia confederation, which represents a
third of the workforce, was one of the largest such demonstrations since the
overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in 1989.
An 11-point statement demanded that the government - a left-wing minority
which includes many senior former communists - begin real privatisation and
restructuring of the state sector; invest in public works and infrastructure
projects; take concrete steps to fight corruption; develop a better social
security system; and establish the minimum wage at 60 per cent of the
average wage.

<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian parliament yesterday ratified the strategic arms reduction
treaty (Start-1), but stopped short of approving President Leonid Kravchuk's
promise to become a non-nuclear state.
In closed session, deputies voted 254-9 to destroy 42 per cent of the
country's 1,656 warheads immediately, but to dismantle the rest of the
weapons 'gradually' after certain conditions had been met.
Parliament did not set a time-frame for total disarmament.
Ukraine is looking for Dollars 2.8bn in western aid for dismantlement,
western security guarantees and financial compensation for the short-range
tactical weapons it transferred to Russia last year.
On Wednesday, Mr Kravchuk stressed the need to ratify the nuclear arms
treaty - to fulfil his October assurances to Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state - ahead of his forthcoming visit to Washington.
Ukraine is the world's third largest nuclear power with 176 inherited
long-range strategic weapons, a larger arsenal than those of France, China
and the UK combined.
Earlier yesterday, Ukrainian deputies adopted a Soviet-style election law,
which is likely to favour the Communist majority in voting next March.
After weeks of contentious debate, insults and scuffles on the floor,
parliament approved the right of influential labour collectives to place
their factory bosses on the ballot and rejected a plan to reserve a portion
of the seats for political parties.
Moderates and liberals denounced the law as another throw-back to the Soviet
era.

MORE than 10,000 French public sector workers demonstrated in Paris
yesterday against plans by Mr Edouard Balladur's government's plans to
privatise their companies.
Leading the protest march from the Eiffel Tower to the prime minister's
office were workers from Air France, where the recent strike forced the
government to back away from an austerity plan, and from other state-owned
companies slated for eventual sale. These include Renault, the motor group,
Bull which makes computers, Giat Industries, a defence company, and Seita,
the state-owned tobacco concern.
Air France's new chairman, Mr Christian Blanc, warned this week that
full-year losses for 1993 could be as high as FFr7bn (Dollars 1.19bn),
compared with earlier forecasts of more than FFr5bn.
An equally large number of workers from Aerospatiale demonstrated in
Toulouse, the base of the state-owned aerospace group.
Trade union leaders had called the protest after state-owned companies in
September announced planned redundancies of up to 15,000 workers in an
effort to make themselves more attractive for sale.

<TEXT>
MR Rudolf Scharping, the youthful leader of Germany's opposition Social
Democrats (SPD), yesterday won vital support from his party conference for
his middle-of-the-road platform to regain power in next year's national
elections.
After a debate lasting into the early hours of the morning, he persuaded his
wavering supporters in the SPD to back a resolution to allow electronic
eavesdropping of private homes in the campaign against organised crime.
He won clear endorsement of the use of German troops in UN peacekeeping
operations - although equally clear rejection of any use of the military in
combat operations outside the Nato area.
He also gained a big majority for a tough economic programme, focused on the
fight against unemployment, but stressing heavily the need for strict
control of state spending. The three vital resolutions, on the economy,
internal security and foreign policy, represented a clear move by Mr
Scharping to present his party as a pragmatic alternative to the ruling
conservative-liberal coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Mr Scharping had himself argued strongly in favour of tougher measures to
combat organised crime.
He did so in the knowledge that concern over law and order stands second
only to unemployment in the worries affecting German voters.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Opel signs cost-cut deal: German car group could save up to
DM1bn

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS and management at Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors,
yesterday signed a far-reaching agreement designed to reduce the company's
wage costs dramatically over the next four years.
Mr David Herman, Opel's chief executive, put no figure on savings although
it is likely costs will fall by between DM600m (Pounds 238m) and DM1bn over
the period. The agreement, which will be studied carefully by other
companies seeking ways to reduce wage costs without large-scale
redundancies, is Opel's response to a steep decline in the German car
market.
'It is a way of introducing long-term cost-savings without shock therapy,'
Mr Herman said yesterday, alluding in disparaging terms to Volkswagen's
plans to cut costs by introducing a four-day week coupled with reductions in
wages and fringe benefits.
The Opel agreement has four central points:
Pay rises will be kept to two-thirds of the industry-wide settlement if the
pay-rise is more than 2 per cent. Assuming industry-wide pay increases of
3.6 per cent on average between 1994-97, Opel is likely to save DM500m
through this measure.
The 13th month of income will be partially subject to productivity
increases.
Employers and employees will together try to cut absenteeism from 7.5 per
cent to 6 per cent, the European average.
In return, Opel has postponed a decision to contract out work and has also
guaranteed to build the successor to its Vectra model at its Russelsheim
factory.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Bundesbank sends out mixed signal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE policy-making council of the Bundesbank teased the financial markets
yesterday by unexpectedly fixing the 'repo rate' - the rate which determines
money market interest rates - at 6.25 per cent for next week, fractionally
lower than the 6.29 interest rate set in money market operations earlier
this week.
The small reduction in the repo rate coincided with the decision to leave
the official discount and Lombard rates unchanged at 5.75 and 6.75 per cent
respectively, thus providing mixed signals about the timing and scale of
future rate cuts.
Markets are expecting money supply and inflation data due next week to
provide the Bundesbank with grounds for further cuts before the end of the
year.
The Bundesbank's move to fix the repo rate contrasts with the more usual
procedure by which interest rates are set by bids from banks via a tender
procedure. The fixing usually indicates the Bundesbank's desire to give a
definite steer to money market developments. In recent months this has
served to push rates decisively downwards following cuts in the discount
rate.
Yesterday's announcement provided ambivalent signals. It indicated interest
rates were still on the way down, although the cut was minuscule, following
a fall of 9 basis points from 6.35 per cent in the tender operation earlier
this week. Some economists interpreted the move as an indication that the
pace of further cuts is set to slow down.
The council meets on two more occasions this year. Future cuts will depend
on the development of money supply. Economists believe M3 broad money growth
will slow in October to 6.6 per cent, close to the Bundesbank's 4.5-6.5 per
cent target range for 1993.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Employers remain hostile to work-sharing idea: Companies and
economists have cast doubt on the latest plan to tackle rising unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE renewed interest among European governments in work-sharing as a means
of combating unemployment has been greeted with scepticism, if not downright
hostility, by many of Europe's large employers.
'It is tinkering with the symptoms, not dealing with the disease itself,'
says Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of the European employers' body, UNICE.
Such scepticism is shared by many labour economists, but it is unlikely to
stop momentum building up behind the idea. Interest in work-sharing tends to
revive when unemployment is high, but has usually been confined to parties
of the left.
But this time there are signs of support for work-sharing from centre-right
governments in western Europe - France and Germany in particular - and,
crucially, a tentative readiness on the part of workers to countenance pay
cuts in line with cuts in working time.
One of Europe's largest companies, Volkswagen, for example, is currently
discussing with its employees plans to cut working time, and pay, by a fifth
to avoid reducing its workforce from 100,000 to 70,000 by 1995.
VW is not necessarily a typical employer: the voice of labour is perhaps
stronger at the company than elsewhere because of the strong three-way
relationship between VW, IG Metall, the German engineering union, and the
Social Democrat-led state government of Lower Saxony, where the company is
based.
But the VW case illustrates that work-sharing takes many different, and
often familiar, forms. The VW plan is a dramatic form of short-time working
introduced in response to a slump in demand and designed to prevent the loss
of jobs rather than to create new ones.
Most large manufacturing companies in Europe occasionally revert to
short-time working when orders fall.
Placing employees on short time is usually cheaper than lay-offs because it
is often subsidised by the state and there is no cost in terms of lost
skills.
Another important way in which individual working time has been reduced and
employment spread among more people is through part-time work, which has
grown rapidly, especially in Britain and the Netherlands, in the 1970s and
1980s.
But employers appear to dislike the idea, being promoted by some
governments, of reducing the working time of full-time workers, by, for
example, cutting one day per week, in order to create more jobs. The French
senate, for example, has recently approved proposals to give companies a 40
per cent cut in social charges if they move staff to a four-day week and
increase their payroll by at least 10 per cent.
'Of course we all worry about unemployment,' says one British employer, 'But
it is not our function to create jobs. We must concentrate on being as
competitive as possible, and these proposals will make competitiveness more
difficult.'
Mr Peter Reid, of the British Engineering Employers' Federation, says the
idea of work-sharing cannot be dismissed out of hand, but he is sceptical
about whether unions will agree to corresponding cuts in pay. Mr Steve
Palmer, of the Confederation of British Industry, also says that even if
workers did accept pay cuts the result would not be neutral for unit labour
costs. 'There are all sorts of hidden head-count costs from having a larger
workforce doing the same amount of work - the extra training, the cost of
recruitment, and so on,' he says.
Mr Tyszkiewicz of UNICE points out that employers would have to buy more
equipment if they took on more workers on a shorter week.
Supporters of shorter working hours acknowledge some of these difficulties
but argue that these extra costs would be a legitimate subject of state
subsidy, especially if the state is going to save on unemployment benefit.
Ms Pam Meadows, director of the Policy Studies Institute in London, says the
state could pay a one-off subsidy, for example, for taking on an extra
person.
Supporters also claim that productivity would improve if people were working
only four days per week. Mr Tyszkiewicz disagrees, saying he believes
productivity would actually suffer.
It is easier for governments to encourage work-sharing in the public sector
than in the private sector. The government of the Netherlands has done so by
decreeing that no new employee in the public sector will work more than 32
hours per week.
European unions may not like the choice, but work-sharing could be an
important test of their commitment to the principle of solidarity.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Italy holds out on steel plan

ITALY was last night resisting attempts to reach an overall agreement on the
restructuring of the European Union's state-owned steel producers.
Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, rejected a compromise on
subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker, put
forward by the European Commission at a meeting of EU industry ministers in
Brussels.
The Commission has asked ministers to give their political blessing to
Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to six companies - in Italy, east
Germany, Spain and Portugal - in exchange for a total of 5.5m tonnes of
capacity cuts. Final agreement on the subsidy plans must be unanimous.
Political accord would provide the central plank of a wide-ranging EU
programme to support the ailing west European steel industry, which is
suffering from recession and over-capacity.
In the absence of a deal, private EU steelmakers made clear yesterday they
were not prepared to produce their own proposals to reduce capacity by a
further 10.5m tonnes. They are afraid that state-owned steelmakers will
continue to distort the depressed market with subsidised steel. Mr Savona
denied Italy was being inflexible. He said there was 'still a little margin
to strike a deal'.
Workers at the Italian state-owned steel works in Taranto, Europe's largest,
yesterday staged a short strike to highlight the threat to jobs posed by the
proposed capacity cuts.
German and Commission officials said yesterday they were pessimistic about
the chances of breaking Italy's veto. Instead, they said they hoped the 11
other EU industry ministers would agree separately on state aid for the
Spanish, east German and Portuguese state-owned steel industries, putting
more pressure on the Italians. However, other national officials cast doubt
on the possibility of even a partial agreement.
A loose coalition of Britain, Denmark, Luxembourg and France was still
opposed yesterday to elements of the east German and Spanish plans. Mr Tim
Sainsbury, British industry minister, said that 'no agreement would be
better than a bad agreement'.
Meanwhile, the Treuhand privatisation agency, which is handling the sale of
Ekostahl, the east German steel producer, will today set a deadline of
Tuesday for Riva, the Italian steelmaker, to provide more information on
prospects for a new hot rolling mill, including potential profitability.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Major prepares blueprint for Ulster peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR reinforced his personal commitment to a political settlement
in Northern Ireland yesterday by pledging to table a comprehensive plan if
the momentum towards peace founders.
The prime minister's statement to MPs at the start of the new session of
parliament marked the second time in a week he had chosen a high-profile
occasion to put his political authority behind the peace process. He
repeated his readiness to offer Sinn Fein a place at the negotiating table
if it permanently renounced violence.
Senior Whitehall officials said the government was drafting proposals
covering all three central elements in the search for a political
settlement.
Any blueprint would include plans for a devolved assembly in Ulster,
enhanced co-operation between the province and the Republic and a new
agreement to replace the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference.
The statement overshadowed the announcement in the Queen's Speech of a
programme of legislation designed to give substance to the 'back to basics'
theme driving the government's domestic policy agenda.
As expected, the 13 measures announced for the new parliamentary session
will be dominated by an omnibus criminal justice bill, marking a much
tougher stance on law and order;
a legislative drive against regulation; and an overhaul of the organisation
of teacher training.
But Mr Major took a conscious decision to keep Northern Ireland at the top
of the political agenda by modifying the government's position on the
circumstances in which it would put forward its own plan.
He indicated that he was no longer prepared to make a return to the
negotiating table by all four constitutional parties in Ulster a
precondition for a government blueprint. In an explicit warning to the Rev
Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major added that 'no party or
organisation' could exercise a veto on the process.
Speaking as tens of thousands of people rallied in Northern Ireland to
demand an end to the terrorist violence, he said he wanted a permanent end
to violence and a political settle-ment.
He emphasised that the precondition for a place in the process for Sinn Fein
was that 'the violence must stop - and be seen to stop'.
He added that the guarantee for the present constitutional status of
Northern Ireland was 'cast-iron' as long as it represented the majority's
wish.
Signs of unease on the Conservative back benches that Mr Major may have
leant too far in the direction of Sinn Fein were voiced by Mr Norman Lamont,
the former chancellor. He questioned the point of contacts with an
organisation committed to undermining Ulster's status.
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, responded
positively to Mr Major's remarks, saying he could see 'no cause for alarm'
in what the prime minister had said. But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of
the DUP, scorned recent calls for peace, saying they would come to nothing.
