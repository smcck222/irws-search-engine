FT  19 NOV 93 / Big drop in jobless fires recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST fall in unemployment for more than four years and a sharp drop
in average earnings growth raised hopes yesterday that the UK economy can
continue to recover without igniting inflation.
The jobless and earnings figures, coming after a sharp drop in inflation
announced this week, heightened the chances of an interest rate cut before
the end of the year to offset the effects of tax rises widely expected in
the Budget on November 30.
The number of people claiming benefit fell a seasonally adjusted 49,000 last
month to 2.85m, the lowest level since September last year. The monthly
drop, which may have been partly inflated by high numbers of students
returning to education, was the seventh this year and spread across all
regions.
Meanwhile, average earnings growth dropped to 3 per cent in the year to
September from 3 1/4 per cent in August, dragged down by the public sector
pay ceiling of 1.5 per cent, and underlining the lack of inflationary
pressures in the economy.
But weak bank and building society lending figures, also out yesterday,
acted as a reminder of the fragility of the recovery and the continued
reluctance by consumers and businesses to borrow. The Bank of England said
the M4 lending growth rate dropped from 3.3 per cent in September to 3 per
cent in the year to October, only marginally higher than the 30-year low of
2.9 per cent, reached in July.
The pound, buoyed by the encouraging economic news, closed in London a
pfennig higher against the D-Mark at DM2.5275, with little change in New
York. The FT-SE 100 share index ended up 5.5 at 3,125.5.
The government took the drop in unemployment and the surprise fall in
inflation from 1.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent in October as evidence of the
strength of recovery. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said: 'There is a
very high level of activity across the labour market. The UK's flexible and
deregulated labour market is delivering both economic growth and jobs.'
But Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said the level of
unemployment in Britain was still 'unacceptably high'.
'Wealth-creating manufacturing employment continues to haemorrhage at the
rate of 125,000 jobs a year, consigning Britain to a low-pay, low-skill,
service-based economy with no sustainable long-term future,' he said.
Although economists were surprised by the size of the October drop in the
jobless total, many now believe that the jobless total is on a firmly
downward trend.
The October drop, with September's 17,800 fall, more than outweighed an
increase of 9,900 in July and August.
The Department of Employment said seasonally adjusted unemployment had
fallen by 137,000 since the beginning of the year while employment trends
had improved. Manufacturing employment rose by 9,000 in September.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Italy rejects EU steel accord as row with Brussels worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL row between Italy and the European Commission over
restructuring west Europe's steel industry erupted into the open last night
when a meeting of European Union industry ministers broke up in acrimony and
disarray.
Mr Paolo Savona, Italy's minister, rejected a Commission compromise on
subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker.
Senior commissioners and the Belgian presidency of the EU warned that the
impasse would be highly damaging not only for Europe's ailing industry, but
for the new Union itself.
Italian opposition to a 2m tonne capacity cut at Ilva now seems likely to be
discussed, at least informally, at the EU summit in Brussels on December 10.
Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, called it a 'black day' for the
EU, and Mr Melchior Wathelet, Belgium's industry minister, who chaired the
meeting, said the outcome did not bode well for the relationship between the
Union's institutions. Mr Wathelet said he would only call a follow-up
meeting of ministers, on December 17, if there was a chance of a deal.
The British industry, however, which has already cut jobs and capacity
severely, welcomed the fact that ministers had resisted agreeing other
restructuring plans which Britain believes insufficiently strict. The
Commission had asked ministers to give their political blessing to Ecu6.8bn
(Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to six companies - in east Germany, Italy,
Spain and Portugal - in exchange for 5.5m tonnes of capacity cuts. Final
agreement on subsidies must be unanimous.
There was friction between Germany and Britain over UK opposition to a new
hot rolling mill at Ekostahl, east German steel producer, 60 per cent of
which is being offered for sale to Riva, a private Italian company.
The Treuhand, the privatisation agency handling the Ekostahl sale, will
today set a deadline of Tuesday for Riva to answer 'crucial questions' about
the new mill before the sale can be concluded.
British Steel welcomed the tough line taken by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK
minister, saying that by allowing subsidised new capacity at Ekostahl,
Brussels had not grasped the nettle.
Mr Sainsbury had told fellow ministers 'no agreement would be better than a
bad agreement' on subsidies. Denmark, Luxembourg and France are understood
to have some objections to the east German and Spanish plans.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Clinton pledges trade initiatives: Approval of Nafta hailed
as boost for Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JUBILANT US president Bill Clinton arrived in Seattle for his Asian summit
yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in Congress, and promising new
initiatives to liberalise world trade.
His mission, he said, was to drive down world trade barriers as a spur to US
economic revival.
Earlier, Mr Clinton declared from the White House lawn that the House of
Representatives' approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement was 'a
long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous
international competition.
The Nafta vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to
make its case, he said, not only with the leaders of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation group but also in the push for a successful conclusion
to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
Mr Clinton's optimism was echoed by trade officials in Europe who said the
Nafta vote had improved the chances of an agreement on trade liberalisation
measures under the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by
the December 15 deadline.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, said: 'There is no negotiator
in Geneva today who isn't breathing a sigh of relief as a result of the
vote.'
The Nafta debate had cast a shadow over Gatt talks for several weeks, tying
US negotiators' hands even though time was perilously short. It is now hoped
that talks next week in Washington between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner, will give
long-awaited impetus to the negotiations.
The US Senate is expected to approve Nafta next week, as is its Mexican
counterpart. Mr Clinton said President Salinas had invited US vice-president
Al Gore for the Mexican side of the ratification process. The new trading
bloc, which includes Canada, is to take effect on January 1.
The House victory, on a vote of 234-200, was far more comfortable than had
appeared likely even as the House debated the agreement. The majority was
composed of 132 of the 175 Republicans and 102 of the 258 Democrats, with
the sole independent voting against.
Yesterday, Mr Clinton thanked all who had voted in favour of Nafta and hoped
that the bipartisan spirit that had carried the day could be applied to
other great issues facing the US, such as healthcare reform.
The president also went to great lengths to compliment the opposition and to
heal the open wounds in his especially with organised labour.
Trade union leaders remained unmollified. The full hierarchy of the AFL-CIO,
the umbrella union organisation, held a press conference to express regret
at Nafta's passage. Mr Bill Bywater, head of the electricians, warned those
Democrats who voted in favour: 'We're going to make sure we get even at the
polls.' Mr Owen Bieber, of the car workers, said Senate votes next week
would be duly noticed, too.
Mr Ross Perot, a loser in the Nafta debate, also threatened retaliation by
his independent movement.
US stocks fell after investors took the Nafta vote as a signal to take
profits. The Dow closed off 19.01 points at 3,685.34.
In Geneva, Mr Sutherland, at a briefing to underline trade liberalising
moves that have already been provisionally agreed, warned of difficulties
ahead. He said: 'The overall picture is heartening, but there are still
significant difficulties in bringing the round to a conclusion.'
In Brussels, Sir Leon said the vote would remove a big distraction for the
US and allow a final drive for a Gatt agreement.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Amstrad chief warns of weak demand in high street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, warned
yesterday that there was no evidence of any pre-Christmas spending boom in
Britain's high streets.
Amstrad's often outspoken chairman told shareholders at the group's annual
general meeting in London yesterday, 'contrary to what you may hear from the
government, trading conditions are not very good, people just aren't
spending money'.
Earlier Amstrad had issued a statement to the stock exchange warning that
'trading conditions in October have been poorer than anticipated,
particularly in the UK where volumes and margins have been under pressure'.
The statement, which led to Amstrad's share price plunging by 10 3/4 p or 20
per cent to 43p, added that the company expected November and December to
reflect 'relatively weak demand'.
While Amstrad acknowledged that the outturn for the Christmas season 'still
remains unclear', the board warned that sales and margins are likely to be
below last year's levels.
As a result, Amstrad said that current market expectations for the group's
sales and operating profit for the year to June 1994 were likely to be
over-optimistic.
Mr Sugar said that Amstrad, which once dominated the personal computer
market in the UK, was now losing money on its remaining high street personal
computer sales and had seen margins on its satellite television equipment
business plunge.
Amstrad's first-half results have traditionally been dependent on the
strength of its October to December trading. Early indications of trading
conditions can give advance warning of likely profit performance.
After hitting a low of 20p last autumn, just before Mr Sugar attempted to
buy back the company with a 30p-a-share bid, Amstrad's share price has risen
sharply in recent months, buoyed by hopes of the economic recovery and the
company's mounting cash balances, which stood at Pounds 167.1m at the end of
June.
Yesterday Mr Sugar rejected suggestions from a small group of dissident
shareholders that Amstrad should increase its dividend and distribute some
of its cash reserves - which have fallen to Pounds 140.5m at the end of
October, reflecting seasonal factors - to shareholders.
Mr Sugar said the cash would probably be used make further acquisitions that
fell outside Amstrad's core consumer electronics business.

FT  19 NOV 93 / Nafta vote hailed as boost for Gatt: 'A long step in the
right direction,' says Clinton

TRADE officials said yesterday that US congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement should be used to secure a successful
completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, praised President Bill Clinton's success, but was quick to note
that the vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, by 234 to
200, was 'just half of the battle won'.
He said: 'Half the battle because Nafta and similar enterprises - no less
the European Union - cannot themselves thrive in isolation. They are not
economically self-sustainable and must be part of a broader world trading
system under the aegis of the Gatt.
'The other half of the battle, making the Nafta a genuine positive force in
the world economy, must be the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.'
Trade negotiators in Geneva have set a December 15 deadline for completion
of the round. The Nafta vote had cast a shadow over Gatt talks for several
weeks, tying US negotiators' hands when the time remaining for completing
the round has been perilously short.
Amid rising optimism that long-elusive trade-liberalising measures are
finally within negotiators' grasp, expectations have run high that the
success of the Nafta vote would allow top US and EU trade negotiators
meeting in Washington early next week to provide long-awaited impetus.
Mr Clinton, before flying to his Asian summit in Seattle, said the House
approval of Nafta was 'a long step in the right direction' of more open
markets and more vigorous international competition.
The vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to make
its case with the Asian leaders and in the final push to conclude the
Uruguay Round.
The measure was passed by a far more comfortable margin than had appeared
likely even as the House debated the agreement.
Mr Sutherland's comments came during a Geneva briefing intended to underline
trade liberalising moves that have already been provisionally agreed, and to
focus on what is at risk if the few outstanding differences result in
failure.
'What is in the bank is still capable of being lost,' he said. 'The overall
picture is heartening, but there are still significant difficulties in
bringing the round to a conclusion.
'There is a lot there that should stimulate the participants with the
knowledge of how much they stand to lose.'
In Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, also warmly welcomed
the House vote, saying it would remove a big distraction for the Clinton
administration and allow a final drive for agreement in the Gatt talks.
However, Sir Leon sounded one note of caution, telling reporters that he
needed to look at the 'small print' to see what the White House may have
offered members of Congress to get their vote and how it might affect Gatt.
With only four weeks remaining to deadline for a Gatt deal, Sir Leon is due
to hold talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Washington
next week.
A measure of concern exists that so much remains to be negotiated in the
Gatt talks, with so little time remaining. 'You have a feeling that each
side has spent half of its time calculating how to blame the other in the
event of a failure,' one Commission official said.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A little luxury goes
a longer way - A demand for durable products has replaced the throwaway
ethos of the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The industry is still under pressure as illustrated by the recent
takeovers of Gucci, the Italian leather company, and Yves Saint-Laurent,
the French fashion house. But the situation is improving as the global
economy edges towards recovery. The surviving companies must adapt their
marketing strategies to meet the new demands of the luxury market after
the recession.
During the 1980s, the dominant theme in the luxury business was expansion,
as new customers entered the traditional markets of Europe and North America
and Japan emerged as a dynamic new market for expensive western goods.
Whereas the industry's old customers had preferred to pay more for products
which were distinctive - either because they were made in limited editions
or designed to particular specifications - all that the nouveau consumers
wanted were instantly recognisable status symbols.
The most successful luxury products were the obvious ones: Chanel suits with
tell-tale double Cs on the gilded buttons and Louis Vuitton luggage
emblazoned with LV initials.
The recession has weeded out some of the nouveau consumers and reshaped
consumer taste after the ostentation of the 1980s. 'People show off less
than they used to,' says Francoise Jollant-Kneebone, design director of
Louis Vuitton, the French luggage house. 'They're still prepared to spend a
lot of money on an expensive product, but only if they're certain that it is
of really high quality and that it will last.'
The most successful companies of the early 1990s are those that have
recognised these changes. Hermes of France has prospered by sticking to its
specialist niche at the top of the market with its 135 scarves and 1,970
hand-made bags: as has Asprey, the British concern, that has turned its Bond
Street store into the gift shop for the world's super-rich.
'This business is all about scale,' says Peter Wallis, director of SRU, the
London-based management consultancy. 'It's perfectly possible for people to
operate successfully in luxury goods today, but they have to accept that
there are limitations to the size of the market.'
Hermes and Asprey have acknowledged the constraints. Hermes plans to
continue to expand the international network of shops that fuelled its
growth in the 1980s: but Jean-Louis Dumas, chairman, has said the pace of
openings will be slower in the 1990s.
Naim Attallah, group chief executive of Asprey, is adamant that he will not
expand the original Asprey company. 'It's a very special business,' he says.
'If we opened Aspreys all over the world, we'd risk ruining it.'
The luxury companies have had to adapt their product ranges to meet the new
demands of the 1990s. The backlash against the 'throwaway' ethos of the
1980s means people are buying fewer expensive items, but are prepared to pay
more for them if they are convinced they will last.
Jollant-Kneebone says fewer of Louis Vuitton's customers 'come back to buy a
new bag every six months', but there has been a sharp increase in sales of
customised luggage, which is often more expensive than standard lines.
In design terms this has triggered a shift towards classic styles which will
not date. The focus of fashion has swung from the glitz of Chanel to the
subtler looks of designers such as Jil Sander in Hamburg and Prada in Milan,
which have both expanded despite the recession.
The change in taste is already reflected in luxury advertising. The glossy
advertisements in Vogue and Vanity Fair now tend to dwell on exclusivity,
craftsmanship and the long history of their companies, rather than the
materialistic imagery of the 1980s.
Service is an increasingly important component of luxury marketing as
consumers demand more reassurance about the quality and durability of the
products they are buying. 'Our customers are more discerning,' says
Attallah. 'We must make sure our staff are properly informed about
everything in our range.'
Repairs and renovation are also expanding. Customers of Cutler &amp; Gross, the
London optician, can calm their ecological consciences by paying Pounds 35
to have their sunglasses reconditioned, rather than spending Pounds 70 on a
new pair.
The financial strains on the luxury business are now easing as the US and UK
come out of recession and the growth of the emerging Asian economies - South
Korea, Taiwan and, most recently, China - compensates for the weakness of
Japan. But no one expects the industry to return to the heady growth of the
1980s and the themes of exclusivity, high quality and sophisticated service
are likely to dominate luxury marketing into the 1990s.
'A lot of people in the 1980s thought that this business was all about
marketing in the conventional fast-moving -consumer-goods sense,' says
Wallis of SRU. 'It might have been at the time but it certainly isn't now.
It's about developing a brand with a clearly-defined market position.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Danish Local Elections: Coalition parties take a beating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S coalition government parties have taken a beating in local
government elections, which showed a surge in support for the opposition
Liberal Party, headed by former foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen.
The Liberals won 27.1 per cent of the vote against 15.8 per cent in the last
election to the Folketing (parliament) and 17.8 per cent in the 1989 county
council vote.
The results are a pointer to the general election due before the end of 1994
in which the Liberals are set to lead the opposition challenge to the Social
Democratic-led coalition, headed by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.
Mr Rasmussen said yesterday he was satisfied with the result, which 'shows
that people are beginning to see the results of the government's policies.'
The Social Democrats won 34.4 per cent in the county council elections
compared with 37.4 per cent in the 1991 Folketing elections and 35.4 per
cent in the 1989 local government vote.
But results for two of the small centre parties in the present four-party
coalition were disastrous. The Centre Democrats won 1 per cent compared with
5 per cent in the 1991 Folketing election; the Christian People's Party went
down to 1.6 per cent from 2.3 per cent.
The Centre Democrats would lose all their nine seats and the Christians
their four seats in the present Folketing if Tuesday's result were repeated
in next year's election. The fourth coalition party, the Radical Liberals,
did better, scoring 3.9 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in 1991.
The Conservatives, aiming to form a coalition with the Liberals after the
next parliamentary election, went down to 12.8 per cent from 16.0 per cent
in 1991 and the right-wing populist Progress Party scored 5.1 per cent, down
from 6.4 per cent in 1991.
On the far left, the Socialist People's Party scored 9.1 per cent, up from
8.3 per cent in 1991.
The Social Democrats have led the coalition since January when Mr Poul
Schluter, who was conservative prime minister since 1982, resigned.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen said yesterday the signal from the local elections was
that 'the voters found it unreasonable to switch governments without a
parliamentary election.'

Poland's new left-of-centre government has told the IMF it intends to
continue with free market reforms to achieve financial stability, writes
Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
'I'm encouraged by what I've heard,' Mr Richard Erb, IMF deputy director,
said yesterday after two days of talks with senior officials. Mr Erb is the
most senior western financial official to visit Poland since the election
two months ago won by the former communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD)
and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL).
Mr Erb warned that 'it is important to continue with a strong budget policy
and there is a need for further progress on lowering inflation'. So far this
year prices have risen by an average of 35 per cent.
Mr Erb was speaking after the government had said that the budget deficit
next year would reach no more than 5 per cent of GDP, with inflation
expected to reach 26 per cent.

Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the aim was to find
ways of reforming the policy against a background of economic difficulties.
'We need continuous economic growth, and we need to have more flexibility
and competitiveness. But economic growth must go hand in hand with social
progress,' he said.
The Commission yesterday published a green paper on the options for social
policy and invited ideas or suggestions before the end of March 1994.
Brussels hopes to produce concrete proposals for action in the second half

Mr Mircea Cosea, Romania's deputy prime minister in charge of economic
reform, said yesterday a breakthrough had been made in talks with the
International Monetary Fund for a new standby arrangement, writes Virginia
Marsh in Bucharest.
Mr Cosea, who returned to Romania yesterday after 10 days of talks in
Washington, said he expected a letter of intent would be signed after an IMF
visit to Bucharest at the end of this month. Romania has received no credits
from the IMF this year after failing to meet its final performance criteria
under a 1992 arrangement and due to disagreements with the fund over terms
for a new accord.
The sticking point in negotiations has been the Romanian government's
unwillingness to liberalise the foreign exchange regime.
The black market rate for the leu is around 40 per cent lower than at
official currency auctions. Local bankers estimate that the daily official
auction accounts for only around 10 per cent of hard currency transactions.

A FRENCH parliamentary committee yesterday recommended that the national

Paris.
The full assembly is expected to decide next week whether to follow the

alleged irregularities in campaign finance and in the diversion of corporate
funds of a company called Testut to Bernard Tapie Finance SA and to
Olympique-Marseille, Mr Tapie's football team.
Mr Tapie faces a second request to have his parliamentary immunity lifted
over the investigation of alleged bribery of Olympique-Marseille's football
opponents. That request will, however, have to be handled by a separate
parliamentary inquiry.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (46): The new rich emerge - The rising money
culture. FT correspondents discover the ingenuity of some of China's growing
band of entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, BRONWEN MADDOX and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEARD the one about the man from Sichuan who made a fortune out of nothing
by buying used Russian aircraft in exchange for train-loads of Chinese
consumer goods?
This true story is just one of many told in admiring tones to illustrate the
helter-skelter of money. Ill-paid bureaucrats are goggle-eyed when they see
the riches being made by China's new entrepreneurs. Suddenly, in the words
of one, 'money is flying in the air.'
Here we offer some snapshots of the new culture of money from around China.
MR XUE'S HERBAL REMEDIES
OUT of herbs which cost nothing except the labour needed to pick them, Mr
Xue Yongxin has in seven years generated a company with annual turnover of
Yn300m, writes Alexander Nicoll.
'In my opinion, it's only a starting point,' says Mr Xue, who aims to
quintuple the figure by 1996.
The company's main products are a lotion and tablets, made entirely from
Chinese herbs, for the treatment of vaginal inflammation.
Mr Xue, 41, says he was previously an itinerant worker studying medicine,
Taoism and architecture. He educated himself because his schooling was
interrupted by the Cultural Revolution. In 1986, he founded Chengdu Enwei
group, in which he holds 92 per cent. At the time, few people were willing
to invest in a new company - 'I was very adventurous to establish this
enterprise,' he says.
With annual pre-tax profit of Yn100m, Mr Xue is already a rich man - though
he professes Taoist beliefs in harmony and helping society. 'Money will do
no good to the human body, unlike medicine,' he says.
Boasting 46 group companies and 30 sales offices around China, as well as in
Vietnam, Thailand, Russia and Japan, Mr Xue can see few obstacles to further
exponential growth. He is applying to have his main products approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration (as cosmetics, rather than drugs).
After finding that poor packaging limited his ability to export, Mr Xue is
building a new packaging plant with imported equipment.
A man with marketing flair which has been rare in China, he is looking for
cross-marketing agreements with foreign manufacturers of name-brand
products. Mr Xue uses television and poster advertising in Chengdu, capital
of Sichuan province, and is expanding sales throughout China although he is
hampered by inadequate railways and roads, power supplies and
telecommunications.
And, inevitably for a medicine company with an eye for massive growth,
Chengdu Enwei has a cure for Aids as well as other fatal diseases including
liver cancer. Its Qian Kun Ning herbal capsules, according to the company's
literature, have 'the effect of replenishing Qi to invigorate the spleen,
promoting blood circulation, relieving flatulence, removing heat,
detoxicating and enhancing the effect of the body's immunity.' Chinese
researchers are examining the claims.
MR MO'S PROFITABLE PICKLES
THE IDEA is extraordinarily simple. But from a few sheds in Sichuan
province, Mr Mo Goshun says he makes a profit of Dollars 1m per year, writes
Alexander Nicoll.
His five-year-old enterprise in Xian Yang township cuts, salts and pickles
vegetables, and sells them to Japan. Mr Mo himself spotted the market
opportunity. Mushrooms which grow wild in the mountains of Sichuan sell for
Dollars 250 a kilogram in Japan, he says. He claims that it costs him
Dollars 400 to process one ton of mushrooms and that he sells them for
Dollars 14,000 per ton.
Seeds for cabbages and other raw materials are imported from Japan, and the
enterprise also processes onions, eggplant and other vegetables according to
demand in Japan.
Mr Mo admits that he is already a rich man in Chinese terms - he expects to
set up a co-operative agreement with a Japanese company, but says that 'we
do not need the money.'
STORES REPORT SPENDING FEVER
'MY POCKETS are bulging with money,' says Mr Fanchunfu, a stallholder in
Tianjin's biggest department store. He transports zip-up jackets from the
southern provinces to Tianjin, sells around 40 of them a day, and makes
Yn1,300 a month, writes Bronwen Maddox.
The store's four teeming floors in Tianjin's Hongqiao district, which open
at six in the morning every day, are testimony to the spending fever
gripping Chinese families. Customers elbow each other out of the way to try
out the electronic games, cosmetics, and karaoke microphones.
Mr Ye Furong, the store's general manager, explains that the store has been
set up as a market, with space rented to private stallholders, 'because we
(the store's founders) do not have enough experience in developing a market
system. Our aim is to mobilise private businesses to do that.'
Open for nearly two years, it now has more than 1,000 stallholders who
supply their own goods and set their own prices. Trading volume is expected
to reach Y300m this year.
*****
'These businesses work according to the law of the market,' comments Mr Ye.
'If it is cheap, lots of people will buy it.'
The managers' embrace of market values is now so firm that when asked what
makes a good businessman they give a textbook answer: good information;
matching supply with customers' tastes; quick transport; good quality, and
setting prices in line with quality.
Although the managers hotly reject the label of speculators, the enterprise
also illustrates the kind of property deal of which Beijing officials have
become wary. The cost of building the store, Yn30m, was financed by a loan
from a local property company on a interest rate of 7.2 per cent a year,
with part of the interest deferred.
The interest rate is lower than hotels and restaurants would pay 'because
this kind of project is encouraged by the state' says Mr Ye. 'We are selling
little goods that people need.'
Yet, although they have paid back only a third of the loan, they now have an
empty site earmarked for a second, bigger store, which they plan to finance
with a second loan from another property company.
Questioned on whether they would earn more money as traders in their own
store than as its managers, they roar with laughter, but the eventual answer
is 'yes.' That response reflects one of the new tensions of China: officials
and managers are increasingly confronted with the spectacle of
poorly-educated entrepreneurs earning a fortune.
The stallholders themselves express no doubts about their new jobs. Mrs Han,
40, who runs a sock stall in the store, used to work in a Tianjin factory
repairing machines - 'twenty years ago I never would have dreamed I'd be
doing this. The market system is good. Business is good.'
NEW FASHIONS CATCH ON
AFTER ONLY three weeks of running a Japanese joint venture clothing store in
Beijing, Mr Kunio Kawasato, is already fascinated by the mystery of
conspicuous Chinese consumption, writes Robert Thomson.
'You look at the statistics on what people are supposed to be earning, then
you see how much the customers are spending, and the figures don't add up,'
says Mr Kawasato, general manager of a venture by Taka-Q, famed for its
contribution to Japan's post-war development by supplying the standard blue
suit to salaried workers. He puts the willingness of Chinese customers to
spend at least Yn1,200 and sometimes much more, on the lack of spending
options - 'people are not saving for a house or a car, and the taxes are not
high,' he says. 'Food is relatively cheap, so people are using their money
for clothes and entertainment.'
Tapping into those relatively large urban incomes is the aim of the Taka-Q
venture, though publicity in Japan has put the shop on the tourist map for
visiting Japanese. While Mr Kawasato was explaining how he has encouraged
good manners among the shop assistants, a tourist group was downstairs
looking for Japanese quality at Chinese prices.
The store, near the main Beijing shopping street of Wangfujing, is a joint
venture with Leimeng Garment, which ran a Mao suit store during the cultural
revolution. As political fashions changed, Leimeng moved into western suits
and, now, a foreign partnership in Italian-style suits, leather jackets and
business shirts.
*****
Taka-Q Leimeng looks like one of the Japanese company's outlets in suburban
Tokyo, but Mr Kawasato is still coaching the sales assistants in the
Japanese arts of politeness. In many Chinese stores, change is often tossed
back at customers by mute assistants for whom a sale is an unwelcome
intrusion.
'We have trained the assistants to say, 'thank you very much, please come
again,' as would be the case in Japan. I think the customers can feel a
difference between this store and other Chinese stores, but our levels are
still not high enough,' he says.
Mr Kawasato has made the assistants more attentive to sales by giving them a
relatively low base salary and introducing a commission system. But
retraining the former Leimeng staff, accustomed to low-effort service, has
been more difficult than coaching recently hired employees.
In Japan, stores such as Taka-Q often keep files on customers and run a
discount card system for frequent buyers, but Chinese customers are
reluctant to provide information for a personal file. Until now, only the
Communist party, the police, and the State Security Bureau have kept
personal files.
Taka-Q is supplying the store from its own joint venture factory near
Beijing, which also exports garments to Japan. Among men, suits account for
about half of the sales, while Chinese women are most influenced by fashion
trends started in Hong Kong, Mr Kawasato says.
'The level of brand and quality awareness in China is even higher than that
of some Japanese consumers. But the use of the suit is different in China,'
he says. 'Men don't wear a suit to work, but they wear one on their day off,
if they go out.'
Taka-Q is planning a chain of Chinese stores, though opening dates are not
fixed - 'if we open more stores, the production costs will fall,' he adds.
'Before the war, the company had a store in Shanghai, so there is a
historical reason for the interest in China.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (42): There is no going back - As many as
19m rural enterprises have mushroomed in China over the past 15 years /
Township and village enterprises discover new prosperity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1978, Mr Wang Zhou Long set up a small steel workshop outside De Yang, an
industrial city in Sichuan province which already boasted some formidable
state-owned steel plants.
Mr Wang was the village accountant. He had learned mathematics at primary
school but otherwise had no formal education. He initially employed 27
people and had, he says, no money, no technicians and no equipment - 'the
idea was developed by all of us,' Mr Wang says. 'Everybody wanted to get
rich.'
Today, De Yang Iron-Steel Plant is the tenth largest township enterprise in
China. It has 3,100 staff - almost all of whom previously worked on the land
 -and earns a pre-tax profit of Yn80m for the eight townships which own it.
Its products sell in 23 provinces as well as Thailand and Taiwan, competing
with those of state-owned companies - on what had been farmland sprawls a
rough-and-ready collection of furnaces and equipment churning out steel bars
and pipes.
Mr Wang says he is not a rich man, earning only a salary. But he is a
prominent figure in the community as the recently-elected town leader and a
member of the National People's Congress.
He is ambitious for his company, having opened two new furnaces this year
alone at a cost of Yn70m. With Yn40m still at his disposal for further
expansion, 'I can negotiate with anybody,' he says. He is discussing the
establishment of a Dollars 10m aluminium alloy factory with a Taiwan
company.
This is just one of the estimated 19m rural enterprises which have
mushroomed in China over the past 15 years. Conceived as a means to soak up
the surplus of farm labour created by agricultural reform, they have become
the most dynamic sector of the economy. The entrepreneurs who run them will
have a lasting impact on Chinese life and business culture.
The new bosses are people with little or no education or special skills  -
in many cases, their schooling was terminated by the Cultural Revolution in
the 1960s. They are people who instinctively spot market opportunities and
exploit them. To an extent not known in Chinese business since the 1949
revolution, they must live on their wits. Many of them are already very
rich.
Township and village enterprises account for about one-third of China's
gross value of industrial output. They employ about a quarter of China's
430m rural workforce, account for about one-third of farm incomes, and are
still growing rapidly.
By 1992, according to economists at the International Monetary Fund, they
accounted for 25 per cent of China's exports, with textiles, clothing and
arts and crafts products accounting for nearly half this figure. Their
activities range across the whole gamut of products and services where
demand had not been satisfied by the lumbering central planning system -
from car repairs to to shoes to vegetables.
Technically, the enterprises are collectives owned by townships and villages
and may be quite closely supervised by town or village authorities. Many
are, however, effectively in the private sector.
Rural enterprises operate under the advantages and disciplines of the
marketplace. They have far greater flexibility than state-owned industry:
they do not have to answer to a supervising bureaucracy; they can sell at
market prices and set pay levels as they want; because their employees are
already housed on the land, the enterprises have no 'iron rice bowl'
responsibilities to them; they enjoy tax concessions for their first several
years and profit re-invested in expanding production is tax-free.
The obverse side of this freedom is the absence of the protection enjoyed by
state industries. Rural enterprises have no guaranteed market for their
products. They have no access to soft loans. When the economy turns against
them - as it did with government austerity measures from 1988 to 1991 - many
go to the wall. This makes for efficiency but also for vulnerability.
In Xian Yang township near Chengdu, in Sichuan province, where 5,500 of the
15,000 population are employed by 34 township enterprises, the township
arranged to inject equity into some of them when bank finance was
temporarily cut off this summer because of central government moves to
tighten credit.
Frustrated by their inability to predict the whims of Beijing, many rural
industrialists are becoming involved in both local and national politics.
Potentially, they represent a strong middle class political force. As the
government seeks to revitalise sick state-owned enterprises which it has
long protected, the businessmen who have come up the hard way will be
increasingly sensitive to official favouritism towards state industry.
As they seek to develop, rural enterprises will face a number of problems.
Many bosses complain that China's poor infrastructure hampers efficiency and
increases costs.
The new culture of competitive, money-making business is to be found in
unlikely places. Mr Qiu Guobing, 68 years old and a Communist Party member
since 1952, has more than doubled the productivity of his fish farm, a
village enterprise just outside Chongqing in Sichuan, since reforms began.
He sells his fish by auction to the highest bidder, he runs training courses
on fish farming techniques, and his biggest problem is theft.
He sees no going back to the starvation he witnessed in the 1970s - 'the
People's Commune was said to be a paradise. But it made people foolish.
People were cheated,' he says. 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics is
very suitable. Local markets everywhere are very prosperous. This way is
leading to prosperity.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (21): Shougang has international ambitions -
The dramatic expansion plans of an engineering giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A VISITOR to the Capital Iron and Steel works in Beijing's western suburbs
is left in no doubt as to the most important event in the steel giant's
recent history. The entrance foyer of its reception pavilion is dominated by
an outsize portrait of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, visiting
the plant on May 22, 1992.
Shougang could hardly have hoped for higher-level endorsement of its
ambitious expansion plans, both in China itself and internationally. Indeed,
the story of the company and its high-level connections provide a valuable
insight into the workings of an opaque Chinese system.
Within weeks of Mr Deng's inspection visit, State Council, or cabinet,
approved a fairly dramatic expansion of Shougang's charter, including the
establishment of the China Shougang International Trade and Engineering
Company, and the granting of a coveted banking license.
According to company literature, Shougang is now empowered to 'engage
directly in import and export business, set up plants and run joint ventures
abroad, undertake engineering contracts abroad and conduct labour services.
Shougang was also empowered to operate business in the fields of finance and
foreign trade.' There is little, it seems, that Shougang cannot do.
Mr Pan Huanyuan, Vice President of International Operations and a Shougang
board member, said that the company's ambition was to become a
'trans-national enterprise'. A decision to accelerate the expansion of its
activities abroad had been taken by directors late last year.
In fact, Shougang, which ranks as China's fourth largest industrial
enterprise and third biggest steel producer, had already signalled its
ambitions in the international market place.
Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Shougang Holding (Hong Kong) Ltd. it had
begun swooping on a clutch of listed Hong Kong companies, and in the process
forged some powerful alliances, including partnership with billionaire Li
Kashing in a steel company - Shougang Concord Inter- national Enterprises,
previously known as Tung Wing Steel Holdings.
Other Hong Kong invest- ments include interests in a metals trading company,
an electronic-component manufacturer and a property company. Among partners
in the property company, known as the Shougang Concord Grand (Group) is Mr
Deng Zhifang, the son of Mr Deng Xiaoping himself. These connections will
have done no harm to Shougang's global ambitions.
Shougang's move into Hong Kong has enabled it to secure 'back door' listings
on the local stock exchange, opening up prospects of the steel giant
transferring some its mainland interests to these listed companies. The
company's Hong Kong investments will also facilitate additional capital
raising in the local market.
Mr Pan says that in selecting Hong Kong as a 'fortress' for its
international ambitions, Shougang was mindful of its advantages as a 'centre
of finance, information and communications.' But he also made it clear that
the company was intent on seeking opportunities in the wider world.
'Shougang is interested in everything, although, of course, we are not
interested in running a cemetery]' he declares.
To this end, the company took control of the Mesta Engineering Company of
the US in 1988, and last year it purchased an iron-ore mine in Peru for
UDollars 120m. It is now looking for further invest- ments in the mining
sector in places like Latin America, Australia and South Africa.
In China itself, the company began in 1979, after reaching agreement with
the authorities on a new 'responsibility system' under which it was allowed
to retain a share of its profits for re-investment, diversifying into such
areas as construction, real estate, electronics, ship-building, shipping,
the manufacture of auto parts and textiles.
Shougang's employees number 280,000, the majority of whom are engaged in
either operating the company's iron-ore mine near Tangshan, north of
Beijing, or at the Beijing plant which resembles a small town with 60-70,000
people resident there, and engaged predominantly in steel-making activities.
Steel-making accounts for about 80 per cent of Shougang's profits which are
expected to reach Yn4.6bn (UDollars 807m) this year, compared with Yn299m in
1978, the year before the introduction of the responsibility system of
profit-sharing with the state.
Steel-making would remain the focus of Shougang's endeavours in spite of its
diversification strategy, said Mr Pan. The company expected to lift
production to 8.8m tonnes of steel by the end of 1994, up from 5.7m tonnes
in 1992.
At present, the steelmaker ranks third in production behind the Anshan works
in Liaoning province, but plans to be number one in China by the end of the
century. Another ambition is to be ranked among the world's top 10 steel
manufacturers. China this year will produce about 80m tonnes of steel,
making it the world's third largest producer behind the US and Japan.
The Shougang official noted that per capita steel consumption in China was
less than 70 kilograms compared the world average of 150 kilograms. This
left much scope for increased business, as China became more affluent.
'China's 250m families need more and more steel products,' he says.
Apart from its Beijing plant which will reach its maximum production
capacity of 10m tonnes by the turn of the century, Shougang is planning a
giant new steel-making facility in Shandong province, south-east of Beijing.
In partnership with Mr Li Kashing's Cheung Kong Holdings, the company will
invest Yn22bn in the first phase whose production would reach 5m tonnes
annually. A second phase would double capacity to 10m tonnes. Shougang could
not be accused of lacking ambition . . . or connections.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (20): Pain in the provinces - Bold plans to
sell-off state industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the debate goes on in Beijing, the reform of state industry is a
painful struggle in the provinces between factories and the local government
officials who have traditionally ruled over industry.
A year ago, the Chinese government introduced 'regulations on the
transformation of the operational mechanism of state-owned industrial
enterprises,' which were supposed to clarify the rights and responsibilities
of factory managers, and contribute to the gradual commercialisation of the
state sector.
But a government research team dispatched to review the impact of the
regulations has found that local machinery and other industrial departments
are reluctant to let go of their control over the factories, particularly
those not large enough to have a network of influence in Beijing.
Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier, was expected to raise this issue at a
meeting of the Communist Party's central committee which began last week,
and also wanted delegates to approve the widespread auctioning of small and
medium-sized state factories, intended to shift some responsibility for
loss-making companies away from the state.
Mr Zhu is concerned by a separate obstacle to the party's attempts to turn
state industries into corporate entities, similar in responsibility, if not
ownership structure, to a western company. Chinese ministries and their
myriad, sometimes loosely-linked departments and branches have been spinning
off new companies at a remarkable rate, again blurring the lines between
government and industry. One reason for the backlash against Mr Zhu's
efforts to cool the economy is that it has hurt these newly-emerging
companies, involved in everything from property development to the personal
computer trade. The government departments were annoyed that bank lending
slowed just as they were reaching for their piece of the action.
But these government departments and their corporate ventures are competing
unfairly against established companies and other new entrants. They are
often responsible for issuing business licences, a privilege they are prone
to abuse, and they control state funds for their industry, which is
naturally kept in the corporate family.
In the longer term, the government is planning to shift the welfare
functions away from state factories, for example, by encouraging home
ownership and establishing a public insurance scheme that will cover the
cost of welfare benefits. These reforms remain experimental, and, as a
northern Chinese factory manager complained, he has to pay market rates for
raw materials, and still provide all the old social services.
If the responsibilities of Chinese companies become more corporate, then the
government will be able to introduce an ownership scheme, proposed by a
group of young Beijing economists, which would create four distinct types of
shareholders, and ensure that the companies can still be called state-owned.
Shares will be held by a state investment fund, linked to the present
departments responsible for industry, and there will be cross-ownership by
suppliers and friendly companies similar to the Japanese keiretsu system, as
well as sales of shares to employees and investors.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (16): Astonishing record - China's share of
world trade has doubled in a decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN US President Bill Clinton and Chinese premier Jiang Zemin sit down
together at this week's Apec summit, trade relations will be among the key
items on their agenda.
In March, on a visit to Beijing, Mr Douglas Newkirk, the assistant US trade
representative, spelled out the trade liberalisation measures which the US
said were minimum condition for China to enter the Gatt.
These included a single national tariff policy, full transparency of trade
regulations, the gradual removal of non-tariff barriers and a commitment to
move to a full market economy.
But the following month, President Clinton added to these list a string of
political conditions upon which China must make 'significant progress'
before its Most Favoured Nation trading status could be extended, and thus,
implicitly, before China could join the Gatt.
The conditions include the end of exports to the US of products made using
prison labour, the release of political prisoners and adherence to the
Universal Declaration on human rights. The World Bank estimate that failure
to renew MFN status could cut Chinese exports to the US by between Dollars
7bn and Dollars 15bn.
Chinese government officials can barely conceal their outrage - 'it is
already eight years since China applied for resumption of our contracting
party status in Gatt and we have made great efforts to bring our trading
system in line with others,' says Mr Li Lanqing, vice-premier.
'The major obstacle is now the US. We are against linking political issues
such as human rights with trade - these should be settled by political
negotiations.'
IT is easy to see why the Chinese government in Beijing baulks at this
explicit linking of trade concessions to political issues, such as human
rights. While limited progress has been made on the latter since reforms
began in 1978, open trade and export-led growth have been at the heart of
its post-Maoist economic reforms.
Up to now, China's trade record has been astonishing. Exports volumes grew
at an average rate of 12 per cent a year between 1980 and 1991, making China
the world's thirteenth largest exporter in 1991, up from 26th place in 1980.
China's share of world trade has doubled in a decade. Merchandise trade as a
ratio of gross national product GNP, measured using the official exchange
rate, has increased from 12.8 per cent in 1980 to 38 per cent in 1992.
China has gradually dismantled its restrictive trade regulations, allowed a
substantial depreciation of the exchange rate and encouraged foreign
investors and the growth of the non-state sector to take advantage of cheap
Chinese labour. The result are reflected in the changing pattern of exports.
The share of labour-intensive manufactures in total exports has risen from
36 per cent in 1975 to 74 per cent in 1990, while the share of
capital-intensive manufactures has fallen from 50 per cent to 19 per cent
over the same period. By 1990, 20 per cent of exports now come from foreign
funded enterprises, while the share of township and village enterprises had
risen from less than 5 per cent in 1985 to over 20 per cent. China still has
a long way to go in replacing direct administrative intervention with
indirect price measures and removing opaque regulations before it will have
a liberal trade regime.
But the result of decentralised decision-making has been, according to the
World Bank, to make China's trade system de facto more open than its 32 per
cent average nominal tariff rate and the plethora of import controls,
licenses and non-tariff barriers would suggest.
Western diplomats in Beijing, while complaining that China is not
dismantling its quota system fast enough, say there are are encouraging
signs. In the area of intellectual property, while enforcement has lagged
substantially behind new copyright legislation and abuse is widespread, the
government recently raided an illegal CD manufacturer in Shanghai.
Similarly, while China's trade regime is far from transparent, the trade
ministry last month started to publish a periodic journal of regulations
relating to foreign trade and stated that any state council directives which
are not made public are henceforth invalid.
One sensitive trade issue in Sino-US relations, with textile quotas up for
re-negotiation at the end of this year. is the illegal trans-shipments of
textiles through Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Dominican Republic in order to
evade China's trade quotas.
Officially, Hong Kong alone receives 54 per cent of China's total exports.
But, according to the World bank, adjusting for re-exports raises the US
share of Chinese exports from 8.7 per cent to 25.6 per cent and the EC share
from 9.2 per cent to 19.2 per cent, while the Hong Kong share slips back to
a mere 6.2 per cent.
Yet, regardless of progress on the trade front, the operative condition for
MFN renewal is 'significant progress on human rights.' Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, said last month that China still has a
long way to go before significant progress has been made, a sentiment that
Mr Clinton is likely to echo this week in Seattle.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (17): Foreign firms move in - Accountancy
and legal services are growing fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of being rigidly controlled by the state and treated as
irrelevant, accounting joint ventures and foreign and domestic law firms are
experiencing an explosive growth in China.
The changes have been profound. In the face of a serious shortage of Chinese
financial experts with a real understanding of the workings of a market
economy, international accounting firms, in joint ventures with
domestically-trained accountants, have moved to fill the vacuum.
'The idea has begun to be accepted that accounting is for business and not
for the government, and that international accounting standards should be
practiced in China,' said Charles Feng, deputy manager of Arthur Andersen
Hua Qiang, the accounting firm's joint venture here.
With the rise of accounting firms, the economy has also seen the emergence
of a small group of well-connected domestic lawyers that work in independent
co-operatives, with at least five attorneys, in what are better known in the
west as partnerships - 'these co-operative firms are good and became good
quickly,' says a western lawyer. 'They are a bigger competitive threat than
foreign law firms realise.'
Within the last year, about 100-150 co-operative firms have been established
nationwide with at least twenty based in Beijing, six in Shanghai, and two
in Guangzhou.
Nearly all deal with commercial issues. Almost none handle criminal or civil
cases. Their areas of expertise include financing commercial transactions,
securities and listing advice, foreign investment and trade, real estate,
commercial disputes, and intellectual property rights.
Co-operatives are dramatically different from China's more conventional
state-owned law firms. Attorneys operate along western lines, working
longer, more western hours, making far larger salaries, and assuming more
individual responsibility.
For China, these 'partnerships' are the wave of the future. State firms are
losing many of their best attorneys to these new co-operatives with the
result that state-owned law offices may gradually fade away or be forced to
change.
With the emergence of independent domestic law firms, the role of foreign
lawyers has slowly begun to shift. Although foreign law firms continue to
offer legal, financial, and investment advice to both Chinese and foreign
companies, some foreign lawyers are beginning to specialise more in legal
consultations involving large business deals for Chinese companies overseas
and for those Chinese enterprises seeking listings on the New York and Hong
Kong stock exchanges.
But fundamental differences between Chinese co-operatives and foreign law
firms remain. Foreign lawyers are not allowed to argue a case in court for
their clients, nor are they permitted to give advice or legal opinions on
Chinese law.
Despite the restrictions, foreign law firms are eager to cash in on China's
increasing economic openness. Since the government has given official
approval to foreign firms to operate here, there are now over 40 foreign law
firms with offices in China, among them, such prominent companies as Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, &amp; Garrison, Denton Hall, Graham &amp; James, and
Coudert Brothers.
While foreign law firms compete with the newly established domestic
co-operatives, they also frequently work closely with them on matters
requiring vital personal Chinese connections and Chinese assistance in
litigation and in arbitration.
Still, foreign law firms bring a certain analytical edge that the fledgling
law co-operatives lack, according to western attorneys. 'Chinese firms are
not yet strong enough on analysis: it's an approach they haven't yet
developed,' a western lawyer observes. While lawyers are rapidly moving to
become the economy's legal foundation, accountants have become the country's
economic linchpin. The government says Chinese state-run enterprises seeking
foreign investment must adopt international accounting standards to make
corporate bookkeeping understandable to foreign investors, and in the
future, this will be broadened to include all Chinese enterprises.
Chinese accounting practices have followed the former Soviet model, where
ownership and profitability were irrelevant in a centrally planned economy.
'In government-owned enterprises, you couldn't find the real owners,' says
Li Bichang, vice-president of KPMG Peat Marwick Huazhen. 'The government is
trying to use corporatisation to clarify ownerships. It is a difficult job.'
The monumental task of overhauling China's accounting practices to bring
them into line with a market economy has proven to be a boon to foreign
accounting firms. All of the large multinationals are here and have
ambitious expansion plans.
Under the new regulations, they have formed joint ventures with accounting
firms that are linked either directly or indirectly with the Ministry of
Finance. Previously, they were permitted to do consulting and auditing only
for foreign joint ventures. Now, they are able to offer the same services to
any Chinese enterprise. Their focus will remain, however, on serving foreign
joint ventures and on those Chinese enterprises that are planning to be
listed on Chinese, Hong Kong, or New York stock exchanges.
While accounting and law are forging ahead, insurance remains largely closed
to foreigners. The multinational AIG is the only foreign company that has
been given a license to operate in China. It can sell life insurance to
Shanghai residents and write policies primarily for foreign investment
enterprises.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (18): Clinton seeks a new start - Sino-US
relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEETING due to be held in Seattle tomorrow between President Clinton and
Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president and communist party general secretary,
could signal a new phase in the complex relationship between Washington and
Beijing.
Though officials of both sides have been cautious about the meeting's likely
outcome, China has called it a 'Sino-US summit'. Mr Li Peng, the premier,
said earlier this month: 'It conforms with the common interests of the two
countries and is conducive to safeguarding peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region for China and the United States to maintain a stable and
constructive relationship.'
Mr Clinton has set the tone for deeper links by embarking on a new
multi-faceted approach to China in recent months.
On the one hand, he has set new conditions for next year's renewal of
China's most-favoured nation (MFN) trading status - thereby creating new
strains in the relationship and posing a severe threat not only to Chinese
economic progress but also to US exports and imports. US officials insist
that MFN status will be revoked if there is not significant progress on
human rights, trade and nuclear proliferation issues.
The US has also stepped up pressure on China by imposing sanctions because
of weapons sales to Pakistan. Relations were further impaired by US pursuit
of a Chinese ship it suspected of carrying poison gas ingredients to Iran.
An inspection found no trace of them and China demanded an apology.
But on the other hand, Mr Clinton has sent a number of top officials to
Beijing to engage China in much higher-level discussions on issues such as
trade, human rights, agriculture and military matters.
The US agriculture secretary, Mr Mike Espy, last month became the first of
Mr Clinton's cabinet to visit Beijing and senior officials from the State
and Defense departments as well as the deputy US Trade Representative have
all held talks there.
This contrasts with the approach of the Bush administration, which
substantially reduced official contacts after the 1989 Tiananmen Square
killings but resisted congressional pressure to set conditions on MFN
renewal.
The Bush approach provoked fierce criticism from congress members concerned
about human rights, but also caused alarm among academics and businessmen
who saw Washington failing effectively to address China's growing economic
power and regional influence.
The new US tack is an attempt to construct an over-arching policy of
engagement with the aim that issues which are thorny, such as trade and
human rights, become simply part of a much broader relationship and lose the
high profile which hampers progress upon them. It recognises not only
China's sheer complexity but also its rapid economic development, in which
US business is deeply involved, and its growing regional links.
Recent contacts have been friendly and US officials see scattered signs of
progress, for example on specific trade issues such as pirating of
copyright. China has undertaken to publish all regulations relating to trade
in a new official gazette, removing the bugbear of secret rules. There are
hints of a closer understanding on implementation of a memorandum on prison
labour.
However, in spite of these indications, US officials are also at pains to
make clear that the threat of MFN termination is real. Mr Warren
Christopher, secretary of state, told businessmen last month that MFN could
not be renewed next June unless there was steady and significant progress on
human rights, trade and nuclear proliferation.
The US demands are mainly general. But US officials said specific progress
must be seen in implementation of the memorandum on exports of
prison-produced goods, and on the granting of passports to eligible Chinese
citizens who wish to travel.
The picture as seen from the US is mixed. China is thought to have freed
most of the dissidents who were arrested for their 1989 activities in the
Tiananmen Square demonstrations, and has released some other dissidents.
However, it also launched a further round of arrests of dissidents and
reporters and new trials are expected soon.
Against the greater freedom of speech now evident in China must be set a
recent official announcement which could signal a clampdown on satellite
receivers which allow millions of Chinese to watch the Hong Kong-based Star
Television network and other satellite broadcasters.
China's view of these issues starts from an entirely different position and
results in vehement rejection of the US approach.
The Beijing government's concerns are principally domestic, with its main
foreign policy objectives being preservation of its borders and the
development of friendly relations with all countries so as to permit
continued economic development. It believes that development of the economy
takes precedence over pursuit of a western concept of human rights. Beijing
rejects the idea that a developed China poses a threat to the world as
'shallow'.
It says that trade and human rights are separate issues which should be
treated as such, and that MFN is normal practice rather than a favour for
the US to grant.
Termination of MFN status would be a double-edged sword, says Mr Wu Jianmin,
foreign ministry spokesman.
'Both China and the US will be hurt,' he says, pointing out that the two
governments have common interests in economic development.
'A lot of Americans do not really understand much about China,' says Mr Wu.
'Quite often there is a gap between people's perception and reality.'
Mr Wu wants closer contacts including further visits by US senators and
congressmen. When they visit, he says, they 'come to realise that we are not
talking about human rights on the moon or in a vacuum. We are talking about
human rights on the earth.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (11): Ambitious targets - Development zones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMBITIONS of Chinese provincial governments are on display in their
development zones. In Yantai, on the Shandong coast, a gaudy banner
proclaims that the 'investor is god,' and in Dalian, in the north, a
billboard sets the goal of 'building a world class yacht club.'
Development zones are the greenfield sites in which local officials have let
their imaginations flourish. State-run banks have built lavish buildings,
developers want a 'millionaire's row' of luxury villas, and vacant stretches
of land are enthusiastically described as a Chinese silicon valley.
Beijing disapproves of the provincial passion for development zones, and
closed 1,000 of 1,200 opened in eastern China. Village administrations had
followed the trend started in 1984 by clearing farmland for their own zone,
which stirred old fears about wasting scarce financial resources and the
disappearance of agricultural land.
Mr Gu Hong, deputy director of the Suzhou National New and High-Technology
Industrial Zone, emphasised that his zone is 'approved by the State Council'
the Chinese government. On the morning of the Financial Times tour, the
toilets at the zone's offices were perfumed and a meeting room prepared for
a visit by Mr Wang Bingqian, the former finance minister and state
councillor.
'There are 52 development zones approved by the State Council, and that
means that the government thinks these areas have conditions suitable for a
zone,' says Mr Gu. 'The benefit of approval is that the state will provide
funds for investment and encourage large enterprises to come here. It also
means that we have a preferential tax policy.'
The government of Suzhou, traditionally known for its silk, ornate gardens
and canals, describes the zone, approved last year, as the third stage of
the city's development, and has built an elaborate model capturing the
vision of universities alongside high-tech factories in tree-lined streets.
Mr Gu says that the 16sq km of the zone has agreements for 130 ventures
involving Dollars 1.2bn in investment, 68 per cent of which is foreign. The
zones has attracted Philips, which has a television project, Upjohn, the US
pharmaceutical company, and Acer, the Taiwanese electronics company.
At the Yantai Economic and Technical Development Zone, the boast is that the
local bureaucracy will process a joint venture application within an hour,
'even if the forms are incomplete.' Given Chinese officials' love of finding
fault with documents, the boast is even more remarkable than the zone's new
karaoke bar, opened in an old Air China jet parked beside the beach.
Mr Tian Fengcheng, vice director of the Yantai zone, said contracted
investment in the zone has risen from Dollars 360m in 1991, when much of the
infrastructure was in place, to Dollars 700m last year and another Dollars
700m in the first nine months of this year. Around 35 per cent of the money
is from non-Chinese companies, but the zone is falling behind the Dalian
zone, to the north, which been particularly successful in luring Japanese
investment.
'We find it easier to deal with US and European companies than Japanese
companies,' says Mr Tian. 'Our Japanese friends are becoming more interested
in Yantai, but they want very big profits and they pay a lot more attention
to details.'
In Dalian, 20 Japanese companies, with the assistance of the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (Miti), have set up their own development
area.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (12): Big surge of interest - Foreign
investment in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gold rush of foreign investors into China has taken on enormous
proportions this year. According to official figures, actual investment in
foreign-funded projects during the first nine months of the year exceeded
Dollars 15bn.
In the same period, the Beijing government approved 62,789 projects
involving foreign participation, with a contracted value of more than
Dollars 83bn, a 171 per cent increase on the first nine months of last year.
The figures so far this year compared with agreements signed in 1992 worth a
total of Dollars 68.5bn, and actual foreign funds flowing into the country
of Dollars 11bn, more than double the totals for 1991.
Such statistics have to be treated with caution. Equity from the Chinese
side is often included in the value of projects, exaggerating the size of
the apparent inflow. Some investment comes from inside China but is directed
through offshore companies to win tax advantages. Many agreements will not
be put into effect.
Nevertheless, interest from abroad is easily visible to anybody visiting
China's leading cities. One western diplomat says: 'We get hundreds of faxes
from companies saying 'we're sending our top corporate team'.'
The ventures which the latest visitors will eventually negotiate will spread
investment well beyond the dynamic, but increasingly clogged and expensive,
coastal regions.
Ethnic Chinese business from outside China - from Hong Kong, Taiwan,
south-east Asia and the US - dominates the flow of foreign capital into
China. Though most ventures have been in light industry and concentrated in
the south - representing a shift in the manufacturing workforce from other
Asian countries into China to take advantage of cheaper labour -
Asian-funded projects are growing in scale.
Most of the region's ethnic Chinese captains of industry, such as Hong
Kong's Mr Li Ka Shing, Indonesia's Mr Liem Sioe Liong, and Malaysia's Mr
Robert Kuok Hock Nien, are pouring money into huge projects. Singapore is
planning to build whole cities in China.
However, most significant western and Japanese companies also recognised
long ago the potential offered by China's reforms and growth, and have set
about establishing ventures.
Those that were there first are finding that they have a growing number of
different operations in China and are seeking better ways to co-ordinate
them.
Shanghai, where foreign investment has lagged and infrastructure is poor, is
likely to benefit as the ambitious Pudong development area takes shape.
The overall tendency is likely to be towards bigger projects and
concentration of investment in industrial parks where special efforts are
made to improve infrastructure.
Meanwhile, indirect investment is growing through listings of Chinese
companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges as well as in Hong
Kong, New York and most recently Sydney. A plethora of 'China funds' -
mostly investing a small proportion of their money in China itself - have
sprung up to cash in on feverish investor interest.
However, because of the nascent state of Chinese stock markets and of the
country's company law and accounting methods, direct participation in
Chinese business will remain dominant form of foreign investment for years
to come.
China's priorities for new investment focus increasingly on improving
infrastructure, particularly power and transport.
The government has seized upon the build-operate-transfer formula, which has
been used to a limited extent in the south, as an attractive means of
bringing in foreign capital to big projects.
However, western companies are cautious since the BOT formula means having
assurances about revenue streams in areas where price controls still exist.
The pressing need for China's industry is technology. Most joint ventures
involve a form of technology transfer which means that the foreign investor
is taking a risk in a country where there are worries about intellectual
property rights.
However, the government has taken steps to protect copyright as well as to
give fairer treatment to foreign-funded enterprises.
Mr Miao Fuchun, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation, says: 'Our general objective is to create a fair competitive
environment according to the principle of the market economy.
To ensure this, we must give equal treatment in such areas as taxation, tax
rates, exchange rates, transport, communications and work procedures.'
Improvement of the legal framework and greater transparency of regulations
are important in bring Chinese practices close to international standards,
Mr Miao says.
Nevertheless, China remains a very difficult environment in which to
operate. Companies feel they must be involved in China's boom, but find that
ventures take years of frustrating negotiations absorbing a great deal of
management time, and that problems often arise once ventures have started
up.
A commercial attache at one western embassy says his message to arriving
businessmen is: 'For goodness sake be careful, and why weren't you here
yesterday?'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (14): The wise go well prepared - Practical
issues for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA can be a daunting place for people who know little about the country
but feel that they must not miss out on the business phenomenon of the
1990s.
Businessmen and consultants familiar with the country say that it is
essential to take a long-term strategic view when establishing a presence in
China. Success requires patience, perseverance and flexibility. Here we
provide some advice on how to set about it.
PREPARATION
Define your company's goals. A vague idea that China is a big market in
which you should be present is far from enough.
Objectives need to be established at the highest level and pursued with
commitment - this is how Chinese enterprises work and your negotiators will
not be on firm ground unless you do the same. This means defining the
desired product of a venture, the targetted market, setting management
responsibility at a high level and establishing where the project fits in to
your corporate strategy. This will help to determine what structure would be
the most desirable: a wholly-owned Chinese enterprise, an equity joint
venture, a co-operative agreement or assembly contract.
Research should be done on government policies in your areas of business,
since a venture will have a far greater chance of receiving strong backing
if it is in line with official priorities.
APPROACHING THE CHINESE
Expect years to pass between your first contacts and the eventual start of
operations. Chinese business and government work on an informal system of
personal relationships, called guanxi.
This does not imply corruption - it is simply the way that things get done.
Relationships need to be built over time, through repeated visits and often
by arranging visits for Chinese officials and executives to your
headquarters.
Do not reveal your full aims, ideas or requests for specific information
until you have established these links. Remember that the people you meet
are themselves constantly seeking to build guanxi. Over time you want yours
to be as good as theirs, and this will help your negotiating position.
China's reform and expansion does not mean that there has been a radical
change in practice within the bureaucracy with which you have to deal.
Nothing can be taken for granted. At the same time, companies should be wary
of wide public mood swings about China and keep their focus on conditions in
their areas of business.
CHOICE OF PARTNER AND NEGOTIATION
Choosing your partner is the most important decision. If your first contact
is with a ministry, do not be too easily directed towards the first
potential partner suggested. Work out who has relationships of patronage
with whom.
Western companies are likely to choose state-owned enterprises as their
partners because they have strong links with supervisory bodies, need
injections of capital and technology, and are likely to be permanent
fixtures.
Beware of a state-owned enterprise which is seeking to diversify out of
out-dated products into areas it knows little about. However, you may judge
an apparently unlikely partner to be the right one: for example,
Baskin-Robbins of the UK Allied-Lyons group is opening ice cream stores in
partnership with the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control agency.
The most important criterion in choosing a partner is establishment of a
correspondence of respective goals. The goals of each partner do not have to
be the same, but they must not conflict and they must require mutual
co-operation. This cannot be discussed too much.
You need to be satisfied that success of the venture is as important to your
partner as it is to you and that you agree on the means to achieve it.
Part of the consideration of the right partner will be its location:
infrastructure and costs must be assessed. Tax and other incentives offered
to foreign investors are far more uniform across China than previously.
Understand on which documents the Chinese side places weight. A joint
feasibility study conducted with official participation is more important
than the earlier letter of intent. It is vital to ascertain who has the
final say.
CONTRACTUAL AND LEGAL ISSUES
Views differ on the need for detail in a contract. Negotiations are the
vehicle for nailing down detailed agreements on all aspects of a venture's
business - such as shareholding structure, product, technology transfer,
local content, whether products are to be exported, marketing, finance, tax,
access to foreign currency, management, recruitment, training.
However, the resulting contract does not have the weight that it would have
in the west because China lacks the necessary body of law as well as an
adequate judicial system. Virtually anything is negotiable. Topics which had
been closed can be re-opened. There would however be seeking of redress for
breaches of contract through the courts. It is likely that the use of
arbitrators will grow.
MANAGEMENT
Many foreign companies will insist that they appoint the general manager of
a joint venture. Even if they do, it is important to keep cementing the
friendship with the Chinese partner so that problems can be dealt with in a
co-operative fashion as they inevitably arise.
After start-up, management is the key issue. Foreign companies will
generally place an expatriate manager on site whose principal role will be
helping to improve management practices. Chinese staff may have a high level
of technical expertise but are unfamiliar with the concept of management
responsibility and often view it as being risky to take the initiative and
cut across bureaucratic practices.
This does not mean that foreign managers must simply attempt to impose
western practices. They have to be patient and adaptable in attempting to
deal with Chinese problems in a Chinese way, while increasing levels of
efficiency and responsibility. One foreign manager says: 'If you've just got
solutions, you're doomed to failure. You have to see what the problems are,
and then try to solve them.'
CONTACTS
A growing number of foreign consultants, law and accountancy firms have
established offices in China and can provide considerable expertise as well
as access to Chinese contacts.
Commercial sections of embassies in Beijing are good sources of information.
In Britain, the China-Britain Trade Group (071 630 5780) is a useful place
to start.
INTERPRETERS
Good interpreters are essential and hard to find. Poor translation means
poor communication. This will lead to verbal and cultural misunderstandings
which could haunt a venture in future years, as well as failure to build the
necessary understanding, friendship and trust.
Translators may weaken your points to avoid giving offence, which can both
help and hinder negotiations. Good, sensitive translators are likely to take
on a wider role as advisers on the attitudes of the people with whom they
are negotiating, as well as a general source of information. Companies
increasingly need to have executives who are fluent in Chinese.
USEFUL READING
For serious economic information, the World Bank has a number of important
publications and the IMF recently published Occasional Paper No 107, China
at the Threshold of a Market Economy.
Powerful, readable books include Jung Chang's Wild Swans, Nien Cheng's Life
and Death in Shanghai and Amy Tan's The Kitchen God's Wife. Also interesting
is Colin Thubron's Behind the Wall.
Historical overview is provided by Jonathan Spence, The Search for Modern
China, and John King Fairbank, The Great Chinese Revolution 1800-1980.
A useful tale for investors is Jim Mann's Beijing Jeep. Chinese Profiles by
Zhang Xinxin and Sang Ye is oral history. Geremie Barme and Linda Jaivin's
New Ghosts, Old Dreams is a collection of modern writings. Fang Lizhi's
Bringing Down the Great Wall; Writings on Science, Culture and Democracy in
China gives a sense of the Chinese mind.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (15): Looser controls from Beijing -
Centre/Provincial relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LIU ZHONGLI, China's finance minister, found himself this summer in
Zhejiang and Fujian provinces on the south-eastern coast. Sent by
vice-premier Zhu Rongji to help in enacting measures to slow down rampant
economic growth, he was shocked at what he saw.
'In one place the government was planning to establish ten golf courses,' he
said in an interview with the Financial Times. In another, the local
government had unilaterally lowered the tax on enterprises, which had in
turn reduced the revenue coming to his ministry.
Mr Liu and other top officials dispatched by Mr Zhu found that many local
governments had used money advanced by Beijing to pay farmers for their
produce had been diverted into real estate speculation. The central
government was forced to advance Yn2bn to help pay off IOUs given to
farmers, which had caused widespread unrest including riots in Sichuan
province.
The economic boom's wilder excesses, which Mr Zhu has been seeking to curb,
are a result of increasingly decentralised management of the economy.
Looser controls from Beijing have allowed provinces to develop rapidly and
provide powerful engines for growth. Coastal provinces such as Guangdong,
Fujian and Zhejiang have benefited enormously from massive inflows of
investment since their economies were liberalised and opened up during the
1980s.
However, privileges granted to the coastal regions have prompted other
provinces to compete, particularly after Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's leader,
endorsed rapid growth early last year. They have sought to boost local
economic growth and tax revenues so that they could, for example, finance
much-needed improvements in infrastructure.
Local authorities which have offered incentives and finance
indiscriminately, particularly for real estate development, are a key target
of Mr Zhu's measures.
This confrontation is likely to heighten tensions which have already arisen
because of the widening gaps in living standards between different regions.
Money pouring into the booming south for real estate or other investment has
actually contributed to a transfer of resources from poor to rich provinces.
Statistics show that the provinces which have improved living standards most
are those which have managed to:
Lower the proportion of state ownership by boosting non-state industries.
Intervened the least in micro-management of the economy.
Hung on to the most tax revenue.
Attracted the most foreign investment.
THE BIGGEST source of tension between Beijing and provincial capitals is the
breakdown in orderly fiscal relations. Until 1980, all revenues were
remitted to Beijing and then distributed back to the provinces according to
the spending requirements set under central planning. The various
arrangements which replaced that system have degenerated into ad hoc annual
contract negotiations with each province, to Beijing's increasing
disadvantage. The govrenment is sensitive to these problems and is taking a
number of steps to counter it:
Inland provinces have been opened up so that they can offer investors the
same privileges as those on the coast.
Mr Zhu's 16-point programme to rein in economic growth, announced in July,
seeks to re-establish macro-economic and monetary control particularly by
curbing excessive lending activities of provincial branches of banks
including the People's Bank, which is to become a full-fledged central bank.
A new tax-sharing system between the centre and the provinces is intended to
come into effect next year.
Mr Xiao Yang, governor of Sichuan, the most populous province with 120m
people including 90m peasants, said in an interview that the Zhu programme
will 'be good for the development of economic life because it will balance
investment between the provinces.'
Asked about political tensions arising out of widening income gaps, Mr Xiao
 -who is a firm adherent of faster economic reform - says: 'I think this is
a very big problem. The difference between coastal and inland provinces
should be narrowed. If the country wants to maintain high-speed development
within a reasonable structure, we should find measures to deal with the
problem.'
Most provincial officials agree that Mr Zhu's measures to deal with
overheating are good, but deny that excessive speculation is a problem in
their particular area. Mr Lin Dezi, vice-director of the Yantai economic
commission, says: 'The influence of the macro-economic controls has not been
very great in Yantai. There were a few signs of overheating, but we maintain
strict control ourselves on development, so there is no obvious adverse
impact.'
Mr Chen Zhenggao, vice mayor of Dalian, says 'this is not an austerity
programme - this is an attempt to exercise control over finance and things
like illegal investments, which would be forbidden even in foreign
countries.'
However, there are indications that the Zhu programme has aroused opposition
in the provinces which have forced its austerity to be toned down. Mr Wei
Liqun, secretary general of the State Planning Commission, said Mr Jiang
Zemin, China's president and communist party general secretary, and other
leaders have been touring provinces since late September to reassure local
leaders that controls on the economy will not be too tight.
'Our leaders wanted to see the effects of the macro-economic controls and to
reassure provincial leaders. The local leaders didn't criticise the central
policies, but they made some suggestions,' says Mr Wei. Economists at the
International Monetary Fund, in a recent paper entitled China at the
Threshold of a Market Economy, point out that it may be difficult for other
provinces to replicate the extraordinary growth of Guangdong province. They
note that exports have contributed a large part of its growth, that
proximity to Hong Kong and Macao has boosted foreign investment, and that
its role as a laboratory for reform has allowed it to be more aggressive in
reforming the economy than other provinces.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (13): Full speed ahead - Provincial focus:
Sichuan province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SICHUAN'S provincial government is keenly aware of the massive influx of
foreign money which has fuelled industrial growth in China's southern
coastal regions. The governor, Mr Xiao Yang, is determined to catch up.
The province has one-tenth of China's 1.2bn population but only 6.5 per cent
of gross national product and 6 per cent of the country's farmland.
Development of an already substantial industrial base is essential both to
soak up surplus farm labour and to boost living standards. Mr Xiao's aim is
to double the province's per capita income from the current 650 yuan by the
year 2000.
Sichuan, birthplace of Deng Xiaoping, was a testing ground for reform in the
late 1970s when Mr Zhao Ziyang, the former premier, was the province's party
secretary. Its 90m peasants were early beneficiaries of agricultural reform
and of township and village enterprises, the low-technology industrial
ventures introduced to absorb farm labour. 'Now the peasants can get food
and clothes but the situation is still not so satisfactory,' the governor
says.
Township and village enterprises employ 30m people, a quarter of the
province's population, but Mr Xiao's aim is to double the figure. 'To fulfil
this target, we need a huge investment,' he says. Sichuan, like other
provinces, needs huge improvements in infrastructure and is weighed down by
the behemoths of central planning: grossly inefficient state-owned
enterprises which need reform and investment in new technology.
Mr Xiao estimates that to meet his development targets, Yn36bn of investment
is needed each year and would generate 10 per cent annual economic growth.
The provincial government itself can find Yn24-26bn, he says, enough to
generate growth of 7 to 8 per cent per year - modest by current Chinese
standards. The rest must be sought by raising additional financing, from its
own citizens, foreign investors or elsewhere.
Over-enthusiastic attempts by local officials to raise money led to a crisis
in the spring. Farmers became upset on two counts: local governments imposed
a series of taxes and charges to fund projects such as new roads; and money
provided by the central government to pay farmers for their produce was
diverted into real estate speculation by officials who issued IOUs to the
farmers instead of cash. Farmers were unimpressed by protestations that the
real estate would produce a substantial return for their communities.
THOUGH the practices were not unique to Sichuan, the province suffered the
most severe consequences with riots and violent clashes which resulted in
the dispatch of armed police as well as teams of officials to crack down on
corruption. Mr Xiao says the tensions have now been resolved.
Though there may still be poverty and unhappiness deep in the countryside,
there is every sign of rampant growth in and around Sichuan's two key cities
of Chongqing, an industrial port located at the meeting of the Yangtze and
Jialing rivers, and Chengdu, the capital. Crane-filled skylines and busy
shops and restaurants underline the flowering of commercial activity.
Chengdu boasts its first underground shopping centre. A subway is planned
under its boulevards. Though a large statue of Mao Zedong waves a regal hand
over the main square, he would be appalled at the vibrant commercial
activity he now surveys.
The streets of Chongqing - which, because it is built on steep hills, has
almost no bicycles - are clogged with traffic. A subway is planned there too
and, local officials say, will be unaffected by financing problems because
it is to be funded from Hong Kong.
'Chongqing is not like other places,' says Mr Chen Yuanhu, vice mayor. 'It
is one of China's oldest industrial centres, with a huge base of industry.
What we want to do is to make good use of money to develop key projects, not
smaller ones.'
Chongqing's motorcycle industry, producing one-third of China's output, is
an example both of how the enterprises' problems can be tackled and of what
is still to be done.
Out of an arms factory in the huge Norinco group has come China Jialing
group, where 12,000 employees turn out 18 per cent of Chinese motorcycle
production under a technical agreement with Honda. Jialing plans to double
output to 1m cycles by 1997. It is profitable. But officials appear vague
about precise components and use of profit, as well as about its
shareholding structure. Little progress has been made towards dismantling
the 'iron rice bowl' commitments to the welfare of employees and their
families.
Meanwhile across the Yangtze river at the Chongqing Economic and
Technological Development Area, the new China is being built at a feverish
pace. Plots are being cleared for factories, even if much of the building
actually in progress, including villas for expatriates, is for residential
use. Some 150 enterprises involving foreign participation have signed up for
the zone, with Dollars 360m of foreign money committed.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (10): Socialist showcases - Special economic
zones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S long march towards a market economy began in a sleepy border town to
the north of Hong Kong called Shenzhen in Guangdong province.
Along with two other towns in Guangdong and one in neighbouring Fujian
province, Shenzhen has become the showcase for what China's leaders now call
the country's socialist market development.
These 'special economic zones' (SEZs) pioneered many of the reforms in
company management, decentralised economic decision-making and forms of
co-operation with foreign investors that are now commonplace throughout the
developing regions of China. In pursuing these policies, the SEZs recorded
startling high rates of economic growth.
In 1979, Shenzhen - the biggest and most successful of the SEZs which also
include Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong, and Xiamen in Fujian - had a
population of 320,000 and was one of the poorest localities on the mainland.
Today it is the richest area in China with a population of 2.2m. Its per
capita income, at more than Yn10,000 (Dollars 1,720), is nearly seven times
the national average of Yn1,540.
Shenzhen has grown at breakneck speed. From 1980 until 1992 its gross
domestic product rose by an annual rate of 46 per cent a year - making
Shenzhen one of the fastest growing micro-economies in the world for which
data exist. During the same period, industrial output expanded at an annual
rate of 61 per cent, and exports by 63 per cent a year.
Mr Chen Biao, deputy director of Shenzhen's Planning Bureau, says: 'We have
a planned economy, but we have grown very fast. We call it 'Shenzhen-style
speed'. (With output growing) at 40 per cent a year, we are quite happy.
'Our target is to turn Shenzhen into an export-oriented SEZ for advanced
industry and services - a socialist Hong Kong with economic prosperity and
an adequate legal framework, to borrow the words of Deng Xiaoping.'
'Shenzhen-style speed' would not have been possible without the latitude the
Chinese central government gave the SEZs to determine their own economic
development. Of this, the most important was administrative
decentralisation.
Allied to preferential tax and foreign investment policies, decentralisation
of decision-making power allowed the authorities to cut through much red
tape. It also gave full play to the 'pragmatism' and 'flexibility' for which
Chinese officialdom has recently become famed.
This was recently underlined when the financing of the Yantian container
port - one of China's five strategic deep water ports - on the west coast of
Shenzhen, was unveiled. The Yn500m (Dollars 86m) first stage development
will be owned and funded 70:30 by Hong Kong investors and a Shenzhen-owned
company.
As the SEZs, and Shenzhen in particular, developed they have also benefited
from high level political backing from China's military-industrial complex.
Shenzhen has become the window on the world for many of China's so-called
'third line' industries - the military complexes that were transferred to
regions deep in China's heartland in the 1950s and 1960s to protect them
from the then perceived US threat.
Across the Pearl River estuary in Zhuhai, a similar story of rapid economic
growth and big plans for future development can be told.
Both localities are feeling the pinch induced by the central government's
tightening of monetary policy. Idle, half-developed, building sites are,
however, a more common sight in Zhuhai than in Shenzhen.
Of larger significance to the two SEZs - in particular Shenzhen - is that
costs of land and labour have risen in line with the growth in their
respective economies. Both run the risk of pricing themselves out of the
market.
Officials on both sides of the Pearl River are aware of the danger. They are
now talking about the next stage of development, which envisages a growth in
services such as banking and finance, and a growth in high-technology and
less labour-intensive industry.
Shenzhen has an ambitious plan to re-orient its economy. The city's planners
want to turn Shenzhen into China's main export and foreign exchange earnings
centre and a base for advanced technology, banking and finance. To date,
however, there is little sign that foreign investors view either Shenzhen or
Zhuhai as places to locate high-tech industries - most foreign investment is
directed at infrastructure projects, and assembly rather than original
manufacturing or research and development.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (9): Long march to modernisation - A look at
the influence of the armed forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
COLONEL Pan Zhenqiang, director of the Institute for Strategic Studies at
the People's Liberation Army's National Defence University, has a vision of
China's strategic environment that should hearten its neighbours.
China, he believes, should press hard for multilateral security arrangements
like the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) that would
lessen regional tensions, and overcome mistrust that has bedevilled
relationships for generations.
'Our priority is to try to change from confrontation which is a zero-sum
game in nature to co-operative relationships,' he says. 'We do not advocate
a transplanting of the CSCE, but we believe such ideas can be adapted to the
Asian environment.'
These views may be regarded sceptically by Asian nations which have
expressed alarm over what they perceive as China's attempts to extend its
military reach with purchases of new weapons systems from the arsenals of
the former Soviet Union, and other sources such as Israel. But calls by
Chinese officials for closer regional security co-operation appear to
reflect a genuine interest in finding ways to deal with potential security
problems peacefully.
Not least of the factors weighing in China's calculations is the enormous
cost of acquiring modern weapons systems that would be required to project
its power beyond its own borders. The continuing debate within the military
over whether China can afford its first aircraft carrier is just one example
of these financial constraints.
While China increased the allocation to defence by 12.4 per cent to Yn42.5bn
(UDollars 7.4bn) this year, the fourth straight increase in defence
expenditure, spending remains low by most standards, even taking account of
the fact that the budgeted amount accounts for less than half of the total
cost of maintaining the military. Military analysts in Beijing believe that
talk of a Chinese regional threat is exaggerated, while they also
acknowledge that the sheer weight and size of China's armed forces certainly
make them appear threatening in the regional equation - 'I don't 'buy' talk
of a China threat,' says one Western official whose role it is to monitor
developments in the military. 'Their modernisation programme is simply not
enough to make them a regional threat.'
Mr Qian Qichen, China's Foreign Minister, seeks fairly regularly to calm
regional concerns about his country's military intentions by comparing
official expenditures with those of the US and Japan.
'In terms of absolute figures, China's military spending this year will be
Dollars 7.4bn, compared with Dollars 274.3bn for the US, Dollars 37.7bn for
Japan,'he told a press conference earlier this year. His use of the phrase
'absolute figures' is somewhat ingenuous, however, since, increasingly,
China's military has been augmenting its meagre stipend from the state with
business activities which have gone far beyond the original intentions of
the founders of the PLA who favoured such worthy money-making pursuits as
agriculture and roadbuilding. The military has become ever more deeply
engaged in bingshang, literally 'soldier's business', through affiliated
organisations like China North Industries Corporation (Norinco), and China
Poly Group Corporation. Both are heavily involved in the arms trade, and
increasingly in other commercial pursuits, as well.
A dramatic slump in China's international arms trade from Dollars 4.7bn at
the height of the Iran-Iraq war to perhaps as little as Dollars 100m in 1992
is obliging the country's military-industrial complex to seek opportunities
away from the arms business.
There is scarcely a branch of the Chinese military these days not engaged in
some way or other in bingshang. 'Soldier's business,' has come more and more
to mean 'big business' for sections of the military whose commercial
activities range from real estate speculation to trading in cars and other
commodities, and even the management of discotheques and karaoke bars.
Unsurprisingly, the expanding business activities of PLA Inc., as China's 3m
strong military is referred to in some quarters, has prompted fierce debate
within the defence establishment.
'Our main mission should be the defence of the country,' said Colonel Pan
from the PLA's National Defence University. 'We have to draw a kind of
demarcation line . . . One should not go too far in pursuing business.'
Limited financial resources are being devoted to increasing the mobility of
the army and building up air defences. The recent purchase of 24 Su27
fighters from Russia is part of the process.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (10): Narrow focus a
winner - Profile: BZ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR most of its astonishingly successful eight-year life, the BZ investment
banking group in Zurich has kept a low profile. Mr Martin Ebner, the driving
force behind the group, has preferred to concentrate on leading his tiny
band of traders and analysts to pile up profits for clients and, of course,
for the bank itself.
So far it has been a winning formula, with the bank showing a net income of
SFr59.5m (Dollars 41.90m) last year and Mr Ebner, a former equities analyst
at Bank J Vontobel, appearing regularly in the lists of the wealthiest
Swiss. The group's strategy has been to focus its attention narrowly. It has
only a dozen main institutional clients, it follows closely only about 30
Swiss shares, and it issues and trades warrants in even fewer of them.
It scored an early success in 1987, issuing covered warrants on registered
shares of Swiss companies. At the time, foreign investors were not allowed
to buy these but most reckoned prohibition would soon end. This happened,
but the warrants are still popular among some investors for their tax
efficiency.
As it has grown, BZ has diversified into fund management, but again has
focused narrowly. In 1991, it took over Pharma Vision 2000, a sleepy
investment trust with holdings in pharmaceutical and chemical shares. It
pared Pharma Vision's holdings down so that its SFr2.4bn portfolio is now
made up of securities of only three Swiss companies: Roche, Ciba and
EMS-Chemie. In the same year, it formed a similar trust, BK Vision, for
banking shares, and roughly two-thirds of its SFr2bn portfolio is in Union
Bank of Switzerland shares and options. BK is by far the largest single
shareholder of UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, with a 15 per cent stake.
In both cases, the trusts were able to achieve large scale status quickly
because BZ institutional clients were willing to put their holdings into
them in return for Vision shares.
By late last year, the BZ group had reached a size at which it was
increasingly difficult to keep a low profile, especially as three of its
vehicles, the two Visions and its derivatives subsidiary, OZ in Zurich
Options and Futures, were quoted. Moreover, Mr Ebner began to fulfil his
commitment that the Visions would be active shareholders, trying to
influence the management of companies in which they had holdings.
In December, BK Vision indicated publicly that it was unhappy with a UBS
board decision not to renominate Mr Christoph Blocher, a controversial
industrialist-politician, to its ranks. This was a delicate case as Mr
Blocher, the chairman of EMS-Chemie and of Pharma Vision, was clearly a BZ
ally. Yet the UBS move looked like spite against Mr Blocher's isolationist
politics. In the end, BZ pulled its punch, but UBS lost face.
In June, BK Vision returned to the attack, filing a legal suit against the
creation by UBS of shares that could be used to make acquisitions without
prior approval by shareholders.
This time, it struck a responsive chord in Swiss financial circles, where it
was widely felt that UBS had stretched the meaning of recent company law
reforms beyond a reasonable limit. UBS responded constructively, saying it
welcomed the opportunity to clarify the law. For its part, Pharma Vision has
begun to grumble about the lacklustre performance at Ciba.
But BZ's main claim to fame is still its ability to raise and make huge
amounts of money. So far this year, BK Vision has raised SFr220m and Pharma
Vision SFr310m in rights issues. A third investment trust, Gas Vision, to
specialise in shares of industrial gas companies, was launched in August
raising SFr500m.
Meanwhile, BZ Trust, a group offshoot which manages the Visions, has made
astronomical commissions from them. BZ uses a formula that provides for no
commission unless the Vision shares grow more than 6 per cent, but then for
sharply rising fees. In the first half of this year, it earned SFr140.4m
from Pharma Vision and SFr132.7m from BK Vision.
Mr Ebner's latest enthusiasm is for company share buy-backs. He says it is
better to distribute excess capital venture into risky diversifications. He
started working on the techniques two years ago when looking for tax
efficient ways for EMS-Chemie to pay dividends. One was to pay back a
portion of the nominal share capital, which Ems did last year in lieu of
paying a dividend.
This year, EMS took a bigger step, buying back and cancelling 36 per cent of
its bearer shares, distributing SFr550m back to shareholders. Societe
Generale de Surveillance, the cash-rich Geneva based inspection group,
followed with a similar programme to distribute SFr216m, but said it had not
been advised by BZ.
BZ recently announced that its OZ subsidiary would launch a buy-back
programme via partial redemption of its nominal capital worth at least
SFr18m.
BZ officials have begun floating the idea that mighty UBS should join the
trend, although they recognise that in the case of a bank, a delicate
balance must be struck between maintaining sufficient capital and producing
good returns on it.
The time has long since passed when sceptics could say that the BZ group was
a meteor that would quickly burn itself out. But equally, it remains to be
seen if it can continue to spin gigantic profits for itself and its clients
out of financial engineering on a small number of securities.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (9): In need of the
professional touch - Better recognition of portfolio management is the aim
of a newly-established institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS banks are estimated to manage about half the world's international
portfolio business and European institutions, as a whole, a good deal more.
Yet, unlike their American counterparts, Europe's financial circles have
been slow to recognise portfolio management and financial analysis as a
profession in its own right requiring special skills and qualifications.
Most of those now tending other people's money - in banks, pension funds,
insurance companies or asset management institutions - have learned what
they know on the job.
Mr Thierry Lombard, a partner in the private bank of Lombard Odier, and his
colleagues in the Fondation Place Financiere in Geneva hope to change all
that. In September this year the FPF and the Paris-based European Federation
of Financial Analysts' Societies (EFFAS) set up the European Institute for
Financial Analysis and Portfolio Management, with the aim of promoting high
professional standards and qualifications throughout Europe, stimulating
research and encouraging the exchange of ideas between the profession and
academia.
'The European investment business needs competent professionals,' says Mr
Lombard, adding that creation of the institute 'should lead to more
efficient and safer investments'. He would like to see something equivalent
to the American diploma of Chartered Financial Analyst, widely held in the
US and increasingly exported around the world.
Mr Lombard, who chairs the FPF, set up two years ago by the Geneva stock
exchange to promote Geneva as a financial centre, also hopes that
establishment of the institute will strengthen the city's reputation as an
international centre for asset management. This forms part of the FPF
strategy to find a distinctive role for Geneva when the open-outcry exchange
shuts down in 1995 to be replaced by a nationwide electronic bourse system.
The city is now home to some 200 financial companies employing 20,000
people, including most of Switzerland's private banks.
The institute itself will not train students, but will co-ordinate current
efforts and act as a catalyst for new initiatives. Among its first
priorities is the establishment of a network of experts to aid EFFAS in
designing and improving European-wide standards and qualifications,
including the exchange of teaching and examination materials. The institute
also plans itself to develop specialised training courses, refresher courses
and seminars on new financial developments, such as new derivatives products
or the latest portfolio management techniques.
In addition, the institute will sponsor publications and conferences, and
support exchanges of ideas and information, including the translation of
publications for broader distribution. (EFFAS' member societies use 12
different languages.) It has already initiated work on a comprehensive guide
for portfolio managers on taxation of investments throughout Europe, which
it hopes to publish early next year.
One of its most important tasks, says Mr Lombard, will be to improve
exchanges between theorists and practitioners, for instance to harness
recent academic work on portfolio theory to develop advanced asset
management techniques.
'If we managed only to halve the gap between academic research and
professional techniques, that would be a very high achievement,' he says.
For the time being, the institute is staffed by one part-time director, Mr
Philippe Sormani, and a full-time assistant. The work will be done mostly by
members of the institute's founding organisations, the FPF and EFFAS, or by
outside professionals and academics. The FPF has given the institute a cash
primer of SFr1.3m, apart from which its activities are required to be
broadly self-supporting.
Training of European financial analysts and portfolio managers has already
made rapid progress over the past few years under the auspices of EFFAS,
which has member societies in 17 European countries covering 10,000
professionals. In 1986 EFFAS established a training and qualification
committee to lay down qualification standards that could be recognised
across Europe. In 1990 it set up an accreditation board to certify the
national courses being offered.
The emphasis has been on post-graduate training leading to an advanced
diploma qualification. Switzerland and Britain were the first to be
accredited by EFFAS; they have since been followed by the Netherlands,
France, Norway and Austria between them turning out about 500 newly
qualified students a year.
Mr Lombard thinks it will soon be standard practice to require
qualifications for new entrants to portfolio management, and to enrol
existing staff on refresher courses. 'Given the speed at which financial
activities are evolving, financial professionals - like doctors - need to
master the new developments in new products or new market regulations', he
says. Companies will see a competitive advantage in better qualified staff.
At the same time, he does not believe more universal qualifications will
make competition any less intense. 'There is a world of difference between
acquiring the basic language and knowing how to use it skilfully', he says.
'But you need the first to learn the second.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (8): Alarm bells ring -
Public finance

<DATELINE>
   SWISS governments, normally models of fiscal rectitude
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even to the point that the government bond market until recently was
chronically dull - have recently found things going badly wrong.
In 1990, the aggregate deficit of all three levels of government was a
piffling SFr1.9bn, or about half of 1 per cent of gross domestic product.
This year it will exceed SFr11bn and government leaders are starting to ring
the alarm bells.
The main cause of the soaring deficits is the high level of unemployment
which has forced governments to sharply increase their welfare payments. In
previous recessions, unemployment tended to stay relatively low as guest
workers went home, women retreated from the labour market and many men were
too embarrassed to register for the dole.
Ashamed of their treatment of guest workers, the Swiss authorities have
eased the conditions under which they could obtain permanent visas. The
result is that few have gone home during the current recession, and the
unemployment rolls have swelled from a few thousand in 1990 to 170,000
today.
If that were the end of the story, everyone would attribute the bloated
deficit to cyclical factors and not worry too much about it. But
simultaneously a structural deterioration in public finance has also
occurred.
According to Mr Otto Stich, the federal finance minister, only half of this
year's federal deficit, which is now expected to exceed SFr7bn - more than
double the initial estimate - is attributable to the recession.
'Even after the economy recovers, the deficits will remain high,' he
complained at a recent press conference. The problem has been one common to
governments everywhere, with politicians approving popular spending
programmes without checking to see if the funds are available.
The federal government undertook a round of belt tightening last year. It is
also counting heavily on public support in a referendum on November 28 to
boost revenue by introducing a modest but universal 6.5 per cent value added
tax to replace a more selective turnover tax.
But even with these measures, Mr Stich warned that the prospect for the next
few years was for total public sector deficits in the order of 4 per cent of
GDP and the net public sector debt hovering around 40 per cent of GDP.
While these ratios are still relatively modest by international standards,
Mr Stich, a socialist, raised the awful spectres of the government's credit
rating being questioned and its financing requirements crowding out more
worthy private sector borrowers.
The former may be plausible, but the latter is most unlikely given the
extraordinary size of Swiss capital markets. Certainly, the government's
large current demands have not prevented long-term interest rates from
falling to close to four per cent, and no one apart from Mr Stich seems
worried about a reversal of the trend.
In any event, the federal government is now embarking on another
cost-cutting programme, this time focused on some of the more sensitive
items in the budget, including transfers to the cantonal governments and the
indexation of public servants' salaries.
The cantonal governments are now expected to put pressure on the communes,
but they will point out that some 70 per cent of their spending is
determined by cantonal laws.
Mr Stich claimed the new proposals would reduce the annual deficit by
SFr1.5bn by 1997 and by SFr2bn in the longer term.
With this kind of zeal being displayed so early in the descent into
excessive debt, it seems unlikely that Switzerland will ever become a
concern of the International Monetary Fund. But the last word, as always in
this country, will be with the voters.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (6): Austerity reduces demand - Abolition of
the two-tier exchange rate systems and the shift to convertibility could
happen soon / Foreign exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE thrice-weekly foreign exchange market at the Tianjin foreign exchange
adjustment centre opens promptly at nine in the morning. Seated in rows
wearing numbered bibs, the traders - from banks, large enterprises or
brokers representing smaller companies - first speak into their microphones
the amount of dollars they want to buy or sell. Then the buying and selling
begins.
'Trader number 19 wants to sell 50,000 at Yn8.7 per dollar - who wants to
buy?' cries the blue-cardiganed young auctioneer, the bid illuminated on the
electronic trading board behind. Laughter rings round the room - the 'swap
market' exchange rate has been stuck at 8.7 for a number of weeks now,
despite the fact that demand for dollars has dwindled.
The market was much busier in the first half of the year, with a daily
turnover of Dollars 3-5m, but the government's austerity measures appear to
have reduced the demand for foreign exchange and turnover has fallen to
Dollars 3m a day on average. State enterprise traders appear to have stayed
away - only 16 of the 51 trading seats are filled - and business is
completed within 45 minutes.
'About a month ago the seats were all filled,' says trader 19, a 37-year-old
woman named Xu Cuie who buys and sells on behalf of enterprises in Tianjin's
free trade zones. 'There are too many sellers of dollars and not enough
buyers - the enterprises just do not have enough local currency.'
The Tianjin swap centre is one in a national network of 100 regional FEACs,
established in 1987 when the government moved officially to a dual exchange
rate system, and which today form the backbone of what has become a
relatively free floating foreign exchange market. Reform began a decade ago
when the government relaxed rules requiring exporters to submit all their
foreign exchange at the official rate. Instead, it allowed them to swap
their currency for Foreign Exchange Entitlements (FEES) which then could
then use at a later date to buy currency.
In 1987, the government established the swap centres at which these FEEs
could be traded, thereby establishing a dual exchange rate system. Access to
these swap markets was initially very restrictive, but the regulations have
been progressively eased.
Today, 80 per cent of China's current account transactions occur at the swap
 -or floating - rate: the official rate is used mainly for tourists who, by
law, must exchange foreign currency at the punitive official rate.
Companies must also sell 20 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings to
the state at the official rate, and the government has the right to buy
another 30 per cent at the swap rate. The rest can be retrained or sold for
FEEs which can then be traded at the swap market, although these days the
majority of trading occurs in currency. But the foreign exchange rate is far
from being a free market: the government still controls 50 per cent of
foreign exchange, which it purchases outside these markets and uses to
manage the swap rate, and access to the market is still restricted.
Moreover, the government responded to the overheating in the first half of
the year by trying to re-impose control, first by not devaluing the official
rate as the swap rate fell in response to heavy demand for foreign exchange
and then by trying to cap the swap rate through administrative
interventions. The result was to open wide a 45 per cent differential
between the official and swap rates and to force transactions into the black
market until the government allowed the swap rate to fall in June.
Yet, despite this year's difficulties, many observers believe that the
government's stated next stage of reform - abolition of the two tier
exchange rate system and the shift to convertibility - could happen soon.
That will require a national swap market, an abolition of restrictions on
access to the FEACs and abolition of remaining surrender requirements so
that the government has to buy all its foreign exchange at the swap markets.
For the central bank, this will mean that the exchange rate becomes a more
effective monetary policy tool and will sharpen the link between interest
rates and the real economy. But for the government and some state
enterprises, it will remove a convenient source of cheap currency.
'Now is the right time to unify,' says Mr Qin Chijiang, director of monetary
research at the central bank. But Mr Liu Zhongli, finance minister, is more
cautious. 'We are gradually closing the gap between the official and the
swap market rates,' he says. 'But there is no timetable yet for
unification.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (7): A decade of radical changes - Fiscal
policy/Tax reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DECENTRALISING economic decision-making to dynamic provincial governments
has been at the heart of the central government's economic reform strategy,
but this devolution of power has also caused severe problems for Beijing's
reformers.
Fiscal policy is one area where decentralisation now risks impeding further
reform. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are keen
that some re-centralisation of budgetary policy be at the heart of the next
round of reforms. According to the Bank, 'reforms to equip government with
the appropriate tools for fiscal policy are a matter of urgency.'
China's budget data, although often opaque and irrationally constructed,
provide a good indication of the radical changes which have occurred in the
fiscal relations between the centre and the provinces over the last decade.
Total tax revenue has dropped sharply over the past decade, from 26.7 per
cent of gross national product in 1979 to 15.8 per cent in 1991.
Within this declining total, the share of revenue which the central
government retains has fallen from nearly 60 per cent at the beginning of
the 1980s to 45 per cent by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, the share of
revenue collected by locally levied, as opposed to nationally set, taxes has
also fallen.
THIS decline in total tax revenues was, in part, deliberate - the result of
freeing the state enterprise sector from direct government control. This
change is reflected in the growth of what the government calls
'extra-budgetary funds' amounting to 15 per cent of GNP, largely surpluses
of state enterprises. But revenue collection from enterprises has fallen
faster than expected as individual enterprises have negotiated favourable
tax arrangements.
Meanwhile, the state enterprises continue to provide substantial welfare
functions while loss-making state enterprises still receive cheap credit
from the central bank, implying larger effective budget deficits than the
modest budget gaps that the official figures reveal.
The fall in central tax revenues was also an intended consequence of the
decision to give more autonomy shift to regional governments. In the late
1980s, the government introduced a new system whereby each province
negotiated a three to four year tax-sharing contract with the central
government. State government have been given greater responsibilities in
providing housing and welfare services to their populations, requiring more
locally retained tax revenues. They have also been encouraged to offer tax
incentives to foreign investors.
But these new arrangements remain a significant source of tension between
the centre and the provinces. Some local official have been unhappy at the
tax deals struck by fast growing provinces, while the centre has been unable
to enforce the contracts. In 1990, according to the IMF, only six provinces
recorded a surplus even though 16 were contractually obliged to do so. But
it was in the first half of this year that the revenue shortfall became
particularly acute, resulting in the central government's decision to send
teams of ministers to tour the provinces in the middle of this year to find
out what was happening.
'Local governments have been abusing their power,' says Mr Liu Zhongli,
finance minister. 'They reduced taxes to certain enterprises which meant
less revenue for my ministry. But I inspected their books and put a stop to
these practices, and now our revenues have increased.'
The result of the fall in central tax revenue has been to the undermine
fiscal policy as a macroeconomic policy weapon, while imparting an
inflationary bias into the economy. Local governments have found it easy to
over-run their budgets, while tax revenues have consistently lagged behind
economic growth and budget spending.
Moreover, the government in Beijing has found it increasingly hard to use
fiscal policy to offset the large growth in inter-regional inequality.
Currently there are wide cross-regional differences in expenditures on
education and health: spending per head in Shanghai is four times that in
Sichuan province - while there is little relationship between a province's
average income per head and the net transfer it receives or sends from or to
the centre.
The Ministry of Finance is planning to address some of these deficiencies
over the coming year. It plans to levy a uniform 33 per cent tax rate on all
enterprises; to broaden and simplify the currently very limited value-added
tax by extending it across the country and reducing the number of rates from
fourteen to two; and to introduce legislation next year for a new
tax-sharing scheme which will increase Beijing's revenue share.
The details of the new scheme are not yet known, but are likely to be an
extension of a pilot 'tax-sharing' scheme introduced in nine localities last
year which clearly separated central, local and shared taxes. But the World
bank has misgivings about the tax-sharing scheme, arguing that it does not
move far enough away from the contracting system whereby the central
government continues to rely on the remittance of locally collected tax, the
fact which lies at the heart of the current difficulties. It prefers te idea
of an inter-provincial equalisation fund to redistribute locally collected
revenues.
But any system which succeeds in raising the taxes paid by the richer
regions is bound to be unpopular.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (8): Jostling for the Deng inheritance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the first week of November, as a winter chill began to settle over
Beijing, Chinese leaders gathered in the Great Hall of the People to
celebrate publication of volume three of the Selected Works of Deng
Xiaoping.
In the way of things in the Chinese leadership this was much more than a
publishing event: it was both an acknowledgement that the end was drawing
nearer for China's 89-year-old patriarch, and an attempt to reinforce
commitment to his reforming legacy among possible waverers in the ranks of
Communist party conservatives.
Preparations for the post-Deng era have come more and more to dominate the
ruling party's internal discourse, and to preoccupy its main personalities
who are only too well aware of the difficulties that lie ahead. Manoeuvring
for life-after-Deng touches almost all aspects of politics in China, and the
struggle for power and influence can only intensify as the moment of
reckoning approaches.
Reformist legacy
The redoubtable Mr Deng, who re-emerged 15 years ago from political oblivion
to steer China towards the international mainstream, and away from its years
of isolation and despair, knows that words alone will not be sufficient to
guarantee his reformist legacy, but time appears to have run out for him to
re-shuffle for the third time the deck of leaders who will succeed him.
For the potential weakness of his legacy lies not in whether his inventive
theories stand the test of time - Mr Deng has 'theories' while Mao had
'thoughts' - but in the political durability of those who have been
designated as his heirs. Nothing would place the Dengist legacy under
greater threat than a crumbling at the centre brought about by bitter
factional strife and the absence of strong leadership.
While, Mr Deng - who was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution - has
proved remarkably adept since his rehabilitation in 1977, at re-fashioning
Chinese ideology in his own image, with useful catch-phrases, such as
'Chinese characteristics', to provide a veneer for capitalist reforms, he
has been much less successful in selecting and nurturing potential leaders.
His earlier creations did not stay the distance: namely Mr Hu Yaobang, who
reigned briefly as party general secretary, before he was ousted by
conservatives for being too liberal, and Mr Zhao Ziyang, who fell because of
his alleged sympathies for the Tiananmen protesters in 1989.
In the bitter aftermath of Tiananmen, Mr Deng was obliged to look beyond the
central leadership group in Beijing for an official untainted by the tragic
June events. Hence, Mr Jiang Zemin's elevation from the relative obscurity
of Shanghai party boss to general secretary of the Communist Party.
Since then, Mr Jiang has also been appointed chairman of the Central
Military Commission and state president.
But in the eyes of Chinese and foreign observers, far from bolstering the
67-year-old Mr Jiang's position, these additional appointments suggest
weakness. After all, Mr Deng, who has exercised more power in
post-revolution China than anyone except Mao himself, has never been
premier, president or party boss: he has not needed titles to assert his
authority.
In what was almost certainly an acknowledgement of the inherent flimsiness
of the leadership group chosen to carry on Mr Deng's work, much was made in
late 1992, and early 1993, of a collective leadership with Mr Jiang at its
core. This collective rested on the shaky foundations of the avuncular,
although hardly inspiring, Mr Jiang, and the Premier Li Peng, who was laid
low by a heart condition in April. He returned to active duty in September.
Mr Li, whose public image is that of a fairly ineffectual careerist, suffers
from the lingering fallout of his involvement in the decision to crack-down
on the pro-democracy protesters in 1989.
Both Mr Jiang and Mr Li are regarded as relatively conservative, although
they are not averse to trumpeting reformist slogans, if that conforms with
the prevailing current.
The strength of the leadership appears to lie in its second tier, in the
persons of Mr Qiao Shi, the 68-year-old chairman of the standing committee
of the National People's Congress, and in Mr Zhu Rongji, the 65-year-old
senior vice-premier in charge of the economy. Both are members of the
seven-man standing committee of the ruling politburo.
But while Mr Qiao, who has long been responsible for overseeing China's
security apparatus, enjoys widespread factional strength, doubts persist as
to the reformist Mr Zhu's ability to continue his meteoric rise in the party
and state hierarchy, once his mentor, Mr Deng, departs from the scene. Mr
Zhu, who has has had a fairly bruising campaign since mid-year in defence of
his 16-point austerity programme, will have made some powerful enemies, both
at the centre and in the provinces. His status as a relative newcomer - he
was mayor of Shanghai before his transfer to Beijing in 1991 - renders him
vulnerable in the factional struggles that swirl constantly about the
leadership group.
Loyalties
The affiliations and loyalties of other members of the Politburo standing
committee - Mr Li Ruihuan, the 59-year-old propaganda chief, Mr Hu Jintao,
50, who is in charge of Party discipline, and General Liu Huaqing, 77, the
senior military figure - are something of a mystery.
Beyond the jostling for power among the leading candidates in preparation
for the post-Deng era is the wider issue of just how well equipped is the
Communist party itself to deal with the challenges ahead.
The anti-corruption campaign launched in the second half of the year was
recognition that the party's tattered prestige was continuing to be
undermined by a widespread perception that officials were profiting
personally from the economic boom.
But in spite of a rash of executions of allegedly corrupt officials and a
continuing noisy public campaign, the long-suffering masses appear not
entirely convinced that the rectification drive is much more than
window-dressing, since those ensnared have been, almost without exception,
relatively low-level functionaries. People believe that the problem reaches
high into the party itself, and that among the main offenders are the sons
and daughters of senior officials.
In all the calculations about the way ahead politically, the military
remains the great imponderable. There is no doubt that in the post-Deng era
 -as it does now - the People's Liberation Army will play a key role.
Support of the top generals will be crucial for whomsoever emerges on top,
however, and ultimately the army remains the guarantor of party authority.
The professionalisation of military ranks has not changed that.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (7): Volume hits new
highs - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH interest rates cut by half in the past year and share prices up 40 per
cent, it is hardly surprising that Swiss franc derivatives markets have been
booming in recent months.
The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) hit an all-time
high volume on October 15, with 151,231 options contracts traded, and by the
end of October, volume traded had surpassed last year's 15.1m futures and
options traded.
In the listed options market, trading volume is now more than SFr200m a day,
and OZ Zurich Options and Futures, one of the most active specialists in
this market, has just reported that its net income doubled in the first nine
months to SFr21.5m.
Over the counter volume has more than doubled too, according to Swiss Bank
Corporation, the leading designer of tailor-made option packages. 'We have
had a perfect environment,' an SBC derivatives specialist, said.
Market participants have noticed a significant deepening of the markets,
with not just the big Swiss banks, but also US investment banks, such as
Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs becoming more highly active.
One consequence of the buoyant conditions is that the competitive tensions
among the three elements of the Swiss derivatives scene appear to have
relaxed, with increasing recognition in the various camps that there is a
role for everyone.
It has also been a year of innovations. Since April, the top 50 warrants in
the listed market have been traded continuously, and the list is adjusted
weekly.
Mr Balz Merkli, managing director of OZ, says the change has encouraged the
big issuers to trade their warrants on the stock exchange rather than
privately in the hope of joining the elite 50.
In the OTC market, SBC raised eyebrows by introducing products linking
syndicated bonds with equity derivatives.
In October, for example, it led a SFr154m bond issue for the city of Zurich
that was coupled with warrants for Zurich Insurance shares, leading some to
wonder if the city was backing the insurance company or vice versa.
'The point is that you can sell these packages even to very conservative
funds,' an SBC official said.
At Soffex, the most welcome change was a 20 per cent average reduction in
commissions early in April.
The exchange, which celebrated its fifth anniversary in June, has continued
to adjust its product offerings. Notably it withdrew an interest rate future
on a synthetic bond when federal government borrowings became large enough
to support a real bond future. The so-called CONF future, launched in June,
1992, has become a solid performer with roughly SFr700m open interest, and
an option on it is to be launched next year.
Soffex is also planning to introduce long-term share options within the next
few months.
Mr Otto Nageli, chief executive, says he is thinking in terms of two to
three year contracts on the six top Swiss shares and the SMI index.
Mr Nageli acknowledges that this move is not universally supported by Soffex
members at the moment, and that it would put Soffex to an extent in
competition with listed options on the stock exchanges.
'It is partially stepping into the quoted warrant area,' he said. But he
argues that it would open up to medium sized members the possibility of
making writing long term options, a business that is now restricted to the
strongest banks.
'But Soffex cannot compete with its members. If they do not want it, it
won't happen,' he said.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (6): Back to traditional
values - Higher yield bond issues may lure retail investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWISS bond market has enjoyed a second year of recovery, helped by
falling interest rates and the unusual emergence of a substantial public
sector deficit. The big three - Union Bank of Switzerland, CS Holding and
Swiss Bank Corporation - now dominate the lead managing of issues even more
than in the days of the bond syndicate cartel. They expect another six
months of strong primary activity, but are uncertain what will follow.
Some traditional characteristics of the bond market have reappeared,
following an exotic period in the 1980s which saw an outbreak of
equity-linked Japanese issues and swapped deals by borrowers without triple
and double A ratings. Although volume in the first nine months of 1993
equalled that of the whole of last year, there has been a renewed emphasis
on simplicity and quality.
The unanswered question is whether Swiss retail investors, who buy most
foreign issues, will be drawn into higher yielding bonds when interest rates
fall further.
'Our investors are very conservative. I imagine that we may see some change
when we have very low rates, and they start to accept higher risk,' says Mr
Jean-Luc de Buman, a first vice-president of Union Bank of Switzerland.
'Investors will look for higher risk again eventually. That will give people
like us the chance to bring new names or structured deals to the market,'
says Mr Jules Keller, of SG Warburg Securities in Geneva.
But that time has not yet arrived. SFr10.9bn of foreign straight issues up
to November 4 were rated AAA, while SFr8.5bn were AA, SFr1.9bn were A and
only SFr450m were lower than A.
In addition, the fall in interest rates this year - government bond yields
have dropped from about 5.6 per cent to 4.2 per cent - has not yet turned
the yield curve positive. This has limited the scope for foreign borrowers
to tap the market through swapped issues. Only a third of foreign straight
issues so far in the second half have been swapped, compared with as much as
75 per cent at times in the 1980s.
Nonetheless, domestic and foreign markets have been active. The foreign
market has been helped by liberalisation, including the abolition of stamp
duty and by the end of the requirement for banks participating in syndicates
to be domiciled in Switzerland. The fall in interest rates has helped the
Swiss market to join in the worldwide trend towards refinancing of corporate
debt and capital raising.
This activity has been matched by the domestic sector, which issued
SFr29.3bn of bonds in the first 10 months compared with SFr33.5bn in foreign
issues. The biggest innovations have also occured in the domestic market,
including synthetic option bonds lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation,
offering options on Zurich Insurance equity in the case of a SFr154m issue
for the City of Zurich.
Despite market liberalisation, the dominance of the big three banks has, if
anything, strengthened since the Cartel Commission insisted on an end to the
agreement by which business was shared out among Swiss institutions. Their
share of lead management of foreign issues in the first 10 months was 72 per
cent, with only Nomura Bank (Switzerland) achieving more than 5 per cent
among the rest.
This is largely because of their immense placing power with Swiss retail
investors, which allows them to operate profitably in a market where
underwriting fees are virtually given away in issue pricing. Allegations
that the big three also gain by being able to 'stuff' their investors'
portfolios have largely disappeared as competition among them has stiffened
following the end of the cartel.
'If someone says the Swiss are not opening up their market, I say: 'What can
you contribute? What can you offer?',' says Mr Hans Rudolf Zehnder, the head
of syndicate and primary sales at Credit Suisse. He argues that the big
three banks have 'a unique situation' in the Swiss market because it is
dominated by retail investors that only they can reach through their
investment networks.
Opinions vary on whether the big three have also been helped in to gaining
market share by the rise in volume this year. Some competitors say that
their placing power allows them to take the risk of mispricing an issue
without becoming over-stretched. But others acknowledge that the fall in
interest rates has reduced the obstacles to competitors with less placing
power clearing an issue.
Whichever is true, the big three's dominance of underwriting raises the
question of whether they will sustain losses next year as short-term rates
reach a floor and they face difficulties in distributing the whole of the
most aggressively priced issues.
Most banks expect a floor in yields to be reached in the middle of 1994.
When it happens, primary activity may subside, although the emergence of a
mildly positive yield curve is likely to sustain investment in medium-term
and long bonds and improve conditions for swapped issues. Banks are also
preparing for a structural shift towards higher yielding bonds.
It is not only banks outside the big three that want to encourage this. Mr
de Buman of UBS says the market must protect itself against a slackening of
supply by persuading investors to consider issues outside the higher
investment grade 'religion'.
But the big three know that the wider the spread of issuers, the more
competition they will face from other lead managers. One of their strongest
protections against losing market share is their expertise in derivatives,
which has already allowed them to structure innovative domestic issues, and
will be helpful if greater interest in swapped foreign issues emerges next
year.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (5): Electronic trading
approaches reality - The Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swiss stock exchanges finally seem to be near to the introduction of
electronic trading. Mr Dieter Sigrist, secretary of the new Swiss Stock
Exchange, says the current project for developing an electronic system is on
schedule to be introduced in the spring of 1995. 'Both on the technical side
and on the political side, we are on track,' Mr Sigrist said.
This is a considerable achievement, considering the rough ride that Swiss
banks and brokers have had in this area over the past few years.
Plans for an electronic exchange in Switzerland were first outlined in the
mid-1980s. At the time, seven bourses were operating in the country but
intensifying competition from other European exchanges made the need to
concentrate activity more pressing.
However, given the strength of regional sentiment, it was unlikely that the
others would willingly cede the field to the Zurich Borse, by far the
largest of the Swiss exchanges.
The creation of an electronic exchange provided an elegant way of avoiding
loss of face as physical location would be irrelevant to such an exchange.
Two attempts to create such a system were made in the 1980s, the more
ambitious was designed by Andersen Consulting. But in late 1991, the project
was suddenly scrapped. By then four of the seven exchanges had closed,
leaving only Zurich, Geneva and Basle.
Moreover, business was depressed and fixed commissions had just been
abolished, leaving brokers uncertain about their future income. Many thought
the Andersen project, which some said could cost more than SFr100m by the
time it was installed, was extravagant.
Andersen and the stock exchanges are still in court arguing over the
consultants' fees, which are expected to be between SFr20m and SFr40m.
To their credit, the exchanges went back to work to design a more modest
system, and agreed on a plan that would be based on one developed for
Australia's stock exchanges.
Ironically, the Australian system had been based on one developed for the
Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) in the early 1980s.
The development budget is SFr80m and Mr Sigrist says about half of it has
been spent to date. The system will handle trading and connect to the Swiss
Clearing Corporation (SEGA) and the Swiss Interbank Clearing system (SIC)
for processing settlements.
In preparation for the launch of the electronic exchange, a number of
organisational changes have taken place or are foreseen.
First, a legal association called Swiss Stock Exchange (SSE) was established
in May this year to take over responsibility for completing the exchange
from the Association of Tripartite Bourses. It will also operate the
exchange.
Initially, only members of the three existing stock exchanges are SSE
members and, for legal reasons, this is likely to prevail for the initial
years of operation.
Direct membership will become possible as soon as one of the three founding
exchanges ceases operations, but that will only happen when the relevant
canton agrees to give up its collection of taxes on securities transactions.
SSE has already taken over responsibility for trading regulations and
listings from the Association of Swiss Exchanges, which has been dissolved.
Soffex, hitherto owned by the big banks and other exchange members, became a
wholly owned subsidiary of SSE last month. One result of this move was that
Soffex last summer dropped its plans for co-operating with other European
futures exchanges. Instead, it will wait and develop an external policy
together with the stock exchange.
Another consequence is that the Soffex computer system will be transferred
to a new computer complex that will be set up for the Swiss exchange.
Meanwhile a new federal stock exchange law is being prepared to replace
existing cantonal ones. It will probably not become fully effective until
near the end of the decade and so the existing stock exchange entities and,
more important, tax systems will remain in effect even after the electronic
exchange has started to operate.
For competitive reasons, the SSE wants to change from the cantonal
volume-based tax to transaction ones, but Mr Sigrist does not see this
happening until 1997 or later.
The new federal law will probably leave most regulatory and surveillance
matters to the SSE, at least at the initial stages, with final
responsibility falling on the Federal Banking Commission.
For example, a suspicion of insider trading would prompt the SSE to carry
out an investigation and, if it was suspicious of wrongdoing, it would pass
the case on to the commission.
It has not yet been decided whether the SSE will build up its own
surveillance staff or whether it will call upon companies' external auditors
to carry out initial investigations.
Mr Sigrist doubts that a big staff will be necessary because few cases will
arise. He points out that there are only 55 members. The electronic exchange
will collect data not only on the brokers carrying out transactions but also
on whether deals are done for customers or for the broker's own account.
The pace of implementation of electronic trading may seem painfully slow,
but Mr Sigrist makes no apology. 'We have learned by spending a lot of money
doing the wrong thing,' he says.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (44): Big shake-up under way - Oil and gas
industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HAN GENGSHENG, vice-president of the China National Chemicals Import and
Export Corporation, seemed remarkably sanguine for a man who had recently
seen his organisation lose its lucrative monopoly over the marketing of
Chinese crude oil and derivatives.
'Economic reform will inevitably have some unpleasant effects on companies
with monopoly positions,' he says. 'But I believe that this kind of reform
provides challenges and opportunities for development.'
Sinochem, as the giant state trading corporation is known - the company
ranked 29th in 1992 on the Fortune 500 list - has been obliged to enter
50-50 joint ventures with the China National Petroleum Corporation for crude
exports, and with the China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) for the
marketing of refined products.
Formation of the new joint venture companies, China Oil and the China
International United Chemical Orporation (Unipec), represents one of the
biggest shake-ups in China's oil sector in many years, and also coincides
with the abolition of the Ministry of Energy under a streamlining of the
bureaucracy approved this year by the National People's Congress, China's
parliament.
Mr Wang Tao, chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation, left no doubt
in an interview that he derived particular satisfaction from the new
arrangements that will involve CNPC not only in the production of crude, but
also in marketing.
He plans to use extra revenues from these ventures to further develop CNPC's
activities domestically, including investments in refineries. CNPC is also
interested in expanding its reach abroad through its China National
Development Company, established in 1981, to seek opportunities in
exploration and development, but whose activities have been severely
curtailed because of lack of funds. Changes in the oil sector also coincide
with the beginning of a period of heightened activity involving foreign
companies in the search for oil in China's onshore regions, especially in
the promising Tarim basin area of far-western Xinjiang region.
Mr Wang said earlier this year that in addition to the 11 southern provinces
of China which had already been opened to foreign involvement, an additional
12 areas would also be offered, including remote regions of Qinghai province
and Xinjiang in the west, and Inner Mongolia in the north-west. China
attracted a good response from the oil majors in March when it offered five
blocs in the prospective Tarim basin covering an area of 72,730 sq km.
EFFORTS to engage foreign companies in the development of China's oil
reserves (estimated at 30bn barrels) are being given added urgency by the
likelihood that by 1995 at the latest the country will become a net crude
oil importer.
Mr Wang estimates that exports will exceed exports this year by about 4m
tonnes. Onshore production this year is expected to be much the same as last
year's 138m tonnes. But he warned that with economic growth anticipated this
year of about 13 per cent, it was unrealistic to expect that China could
continue to produce more oil than it consumed without big new discoveries.
'The petroleum industry is developing like a tortoise, and GNP growth like a
hare,' he observes. Even if good discoveries are made in the Tarim basin, it
will be some years, and possibly not until the turn of the century before
oil is flowing in large quantities from China's far west. The cost of
building a pipeline more than 2,000 kms from the Tarim area across rugged
terrain to connect with the national pipeline grid is estimated at about
UDollars 2bn.
Exploration activity is also continuing in offshore areas; although the
crushing disappointment, not to mention huge losses, suffered by Western
companies such as British Petroleum in the 1980s in a fruitless search, has
dampened much of the early enthusiasm.
Mr Chen Binqian, vice president of the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC), said his organisation was pressing on with its efforts
to engage foreign companies in prospective areas offshore, such as the East
China Sea, the Pearl River delta, and waters off Hainan Island in the south.
Mr Chen expects to have awarded contracts for 13 concessions in the East
China Sea by the end of the year. CNOOC itself continues to be active in its
efforts to lift production at its own wells in areas such as the Bohai Sea,
in China's northern water, where it brought onstream a new field in
September. It is also looking forward to Agip, Chevron, Texaco, Philips and
Amoco bringing relatively small fields into production between 1994-1996 in
the Pearl River area.
This year, CNOOC expects oil production from offshore areas to reach 5m
tonnes - and to grow to about 12m tonnes by 1997. But disappointed by
results of oil exploration offshore, it is looking increasingly to its gas
finds to justify its own existence, and to provide energy to fuel China's
booming economy, especially in its energy-deficient southern regions, and
Hong Kong. By 1996, CNOOC expects to be supplying 2.9bn cu. metres annually
to Hong Kong, and 500m cu. metres to Hainan island itself from fields off
the island's south coast. More finds are being made in waters off Hainan,
and CNOOC hopes to be supplying 20bn cu. metres to consumers in Hong Kong
and on the mainland by early next century.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (41): High price of entry -
Telecommunications market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN manufacturers are waging an intense battle to win a greater share of
China's booming multibillion dollar telecommunications market.
'There is fierce competition, because the stakes are so high,' says a
western business executive involved in telecommunications. 'China could buy
more phones than many countries combined.'
China has about 17m phone lines and about 1.6 phones for every 100 people.
This compares with about 60 phones per 100 in the US. Beijing's goal is to
have 100m lines in operation by 2000.
The focal point of the competition is China's public switching sector. The
government is expanding and modernising its telephone exchanges by
installing 'stored program computers' (SPCs) to replace the older
electro-mechanical equipment to do the switching.
The leading manufacturers in this market are Alcatel, Ericsson, Northern
Telecom, Siemens, NEC, Fujitsu and AT&amp;T. However, the price for entry into
the market is high. Companies have been told that to manufacture switching
equipment, they must also make semiconductors in China, according to western
businessmen.
'The Chinese want semiconductor lines - it's the basis of everything from
modern weapons to computers,' a western diplomat says. 'It's more important
than the internal combustion engine was, 100 years ago. And it's extremely
expensive to set up.'
Most manufacturers have little choice. To sell their array of other
communications equipment, they must be in the switching market, the diplomat
adds.
Nearly all of the western telecommunications manufacturers in China have
established, or are in the process of establishing, micro-chip production
plants.
Siemens has a chip factory in Wuxi near Shanghai, Alcatel has a similar
arrangement with its Chinese joint venture partner in Shanghai, and the
Japanese multinational NEC produces semiconductors at the state-run Capital
Iron &amp; Steel plant in Beijing.
AT&amp;T is also believed to have reached agreement to set up semi-conductor
operations to support the manufacture of its planned switching joint
ventures in Qingdao, a port in north-east China, and Chengdu, the capital of
Sichuan. These joint ventures are expected to begin operation in 1995.
Northern Telecom has nearly concluded negotiations to make switching
equipment in Shunde in Guangdong province and expects to begin production of
switches by the end of this year or early 1994. It will use semiconductors
manufactured by two other joint ventures which the Canadian giant is
establishing in Shanghai.
Northern Telecom has also recently won Dollars 159m of contracts to sell
switching equipment to the provinces of Henan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Yunnan.
Northern Telecom's sales follows a period when the State Council initially
allowed only three multinationals to form Sino-foreign joint ventures to
manufacture switching equipment. These were Alcatel affiliate, Shanghai
Bell, a Beijing-based Siemens joint venture, and an NEC company in Tianjin.
Other multinationals were frozen out, but under pressure from Washington and
other companies, industry sources said the Chinese Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications agreed to ease its restrictions on the lucrative
switching market.
Of the foreign telecom companies, Alcatel is the market leader in the
switching business with about 30 per cent of the market; Siemens has
approximately 15 to 20 per cent, NEC a smaller share, with the rest split
among other foreign manufacturers, say industry sources.
Alcatel is the most aggressive. Its joint venture with Shanghai Bell has
tripled its design capacity to produce more than 2m lines last year  - and
Alcatel has sold an additional 2m lines direct to local branches of the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication since the 1980s.
Siemens also plans to dramatically increase its production capacity from
1.5m lines this year to 3m by 1995 at its Beijing operation. Last year, the
joint venture produced 370,000 lines.
Meanwhile, Ericsson plans to install 1.8m lines in Guangdong over the next
few years.
Apart from switching equipment, demand for the latest technology in optical
fibre networks to transport speech or data is also acute, western
businessmen say. The government recently had tenders for large long-distance
optical fibre networks crisscrossing the country.
'China is developing so fast that it wants to go in at the highest level,
rather than spend years with older equipment,' says a western businessman.
'The Chinese weren't buying optical fibre equipment in 1988 and '89. Now,
they are poised to take advantage of the latest technology.'
Because of the country's telephone shortage, mobile phones and radio pagers
have proliferated wildly in an unregulated atmosphere, often with network
frequencies interfering with each other. To impose more order on the market,
retain its monopoly and cash in on the huge consumer demand for pagers and
other datacommunication services, the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications recently issued new licensing regulations.
Foreign manufacturers welcomed the decision, saying it would help stop the
production of poor quality and counterfeit pagers.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (43): Well worth the risks - Successful
joint venture profile: Shanghai Bell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX

<TEXT>
'OUR BIGGEST problem is management' says Mr Bert Degraeve, the Belgian who
is general manager of Shanghai Bell, one of Shanghai's most successful joint
ventures between Chinese and foreign companies. A shortage of skilled
managers is also China's biggest problem in attracting investors, he argues.
Set up in 1985, Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment Manufacturing, epitomises
the kind of high-technology investment which China craves. Telephone
exchanges and switches from its Shanghai factory, designed to some of the
latest overseas standards, are being slotted almost daily into the country's
over-stretched telecommunications network.
The group was created as a joint venture between the Shanghai Ministry of
Post and Telecommunications, which owns 60 per cent; Alcatel Bell, the
Belgian telecoms group, which holds 32 per cent; and the Belgian government
with 8 per cent.
The attractions for the foreign owners are clear. While the Belgian market
for exchanges is 300,000 lines a year (a measurement of the exchanges'
capacity), the Chinese market is already nine times the size. This year,
Shanghai Bell expects turnover to be USDollars 450m, compared to USDollars
230m last year and Dollars 80m in 1990, even though the price of the
products has halved in the past eight years.
However, the price of entry to the Chinese market was the government's
requirement that foreign technology be transfered to the joint venture.
Alcatel Bell introduced not only the exchange and switch manufacturing
capability, but set up a subsidiary of Shanghai Bell, called Shanghai
Belling, to make wafers for silicon chips.
In Mr Degraeve's view, foreign companies' concerns about losing control of
the business after they have transferred technology 'are justified.' But in
the end 'you have to take the risk,' he says. In Shanghai Bell's case, the
requirement was easier to fulfil than it had expected: it discovered a
virtually unused wafer fabrication plant already in Shanghai, with plastic
covers still on the equipment, and took it over.
The bigger issue, he argues, is how to transfer management standards. Like
other high-tech companies, Alcatel Bell was attracted to Shanghai by the
large number of technically qualified graduates emerging from its
universities. But although the graduates are technically qualified, one of
his hardest tasks is to instill a sense of precision and high standards into
his staff.
'You can see the circumstances in which people are living, the crowded
rooms, the clutter, the traffic, the noise. Then you expect people to come
in this gate and turn around 360 degrees' to produce precisely-engineered
products - 'that is what we are demanding of them.'
His job is made harder because the Cultural Revolution has left a shortage
of trained 40 to 50-year-olds - 'the result is that company structure is
then distorted' by a disproportionate number of young staff, he says.
Despite these problems, Shanghai Bell believes it has a head start and a
competitive advantage which will put it ahead of other rivals; US telecom
groups now have the eye on the market. The same may not be true, however, of
Belling, its subsidiary.
Mr Lu De Chun, Belling's general manager, acknowledges that Belling's chips
are some way below the standards of the best international plants. Only
between 60 per cent and 90 per cent of wafers pass the tests at the end of
the production line, compared to 99 per cent in the most highly automated
Japanese plants. Belling's most complicated chips need to be be sent to
South Korea and Taiwan for assembly.
At the moment, 85 per cent of Belling's business is with Shanghai Bell; the
parent company is keen on owning local suppliers of components because of
the difficulty and expense of importing.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (45): Airlanes congested - Anxiety over
safety in the skies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID expansion of China's aviation industry is straining the country's
ability to maintain adequate safety standards, according to Western aviation
experts.
The proliferation of airlines, coupled with the purchase of so many aircraft
in the world's fastest growing aviation market, has triggered alarm among
senior Chinese leaders and western experts about just how safe the country's
skies really are.
'Their idea of aviation is aeroplanes,' a western businessman said. 'It's
almost as an afterthought that the Chinese consider maintenance, the
training of pilots, and airports to handle passengers.'
Indeed, since the mid-1980s the growth in the passenger and freight markets
has soared to 25 per cent a year. Even with a projected slower growth rate
of less than 20 per cent annually through the end of the century, western
businessmen estimate that Chinese airlines will continue to need 50 planes a
year for the next decade.
To meet this demand, foreign aircraft manufacturers are flocking to China.
Boeing Corporation and Airbus Industrie have been market leaders. In the
spring of this year, Chinese airlines bought 21 Boeing jetliners, making a
total of 150 Boeings either leased or sold to the country since 1972, when
China placed its first order with the American manufacturer. China has also
purchased 12 aircraft from Airbus this year. Prior to that sale, altogether
the European consortium has sold 17 aircraft to Chinese airlines.
Making the skies safer depends on making improvements in several vital
areas: air traffic control, radar, ground equipment and pilot shortages.
China'a air space is controlled by the military and civilian airlines must
request use of it. Civilian aircraft are allotted narrow corridors within
which to fly and cannot deviate out of them.
With more aircraft flying in the same air space, western diplomats said the
likelihood of an accident increases. The air space problem is compounded by
China's severe shortage of radar and ground equipment and navigational and
landing systems.
'China is using the same amount of radar to cover more aircraft,' a western
diplomat said. 'It is not ready to adequately handle the increase in the
number of planes its airlines have acquired. There are even areas in China
that have no radar. And if you have no navigational aids, you're in
trouble.'
Moreover, China lacks a national system of civilian air traffic control.
Transferring aircraft from one flight information region to another as it is
done in western countries simply does not exist.
Pilot training also lags behind the West. Modelled on the Soviet method,
pilots are given instructions from air traffic control on the ground, and
western diplomats said they are not trained to request permission to alter
their original route - 'if you are flying a plane in China, it goes through
clouds and turbulence because the pilots don't have the training or leeway
to deviate from the course . . . so you end up with a rather bumpy ride.'
The difficulties and dangers are compounded by an acute shortage of pilots.
The country's only training school, run by the Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC) and located in Chengdu, Sichuan, turns out 80 pilots
annually. Western businessmen estimate the country currently needs a total
of at least 600 new pilots. Because of the pilot shortage, pilots fly longer
hours than they should.
The drive to be profitable has also led to overloading aircraft with
passengers and cargo, and to aircraft flying when they should be grounded
for inspections and maintenance.
Since July last year, China has had five reported accidents, which killed
331 people. Even within the first two weeks of a 100-day safety campaign for
the Chinese air force, two F-7 fighters collided, killing both pilots.
Given all of these safety problems, the Chinese are attempting to improve
safety standards - 'safety, safety, safety - the order has come from the
top. The State Council has said safety is a first priority,' a western
businessman says.
In response to this pressure, the military has grudgingly agreed to release
control of some of the air space to CAAC, but western diplomats say the
armed forces have been slow to implement this policy.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (39): Headlong dash for growth - Profile:
China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HUANG JICHEN, vice-president, China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (Citic) is in an expansive mood - 'we expect total assets to be
Yn60bn by the end of 1995 and to reach Yn100bn by the year 2,000,' he says.
Size counts in China. Reflecting the central planner's concern with
'output,' rather than profitability or the efficient use of capital, Citic
executives still prefer to talk about growth in assets, rather than profits.
The company has increased in size greatly since its founding 14 years ago
with Mr Rong Yiren - the son of one of China's leading business families of
the pre-1949 era - at the helm. At the end of 1992 - the latest year for
which financial data is available - Citic's balance sheet had swelled to
Yn50.7bn, almost wholly on the basis of borrowings.
If the company's first 14 years of operation is any guide then Citic has a
good chance of fulfilling its headlong dash for assets growth. Profits,
however, are a different matter. At the end of last year the company made a
profit of Yn380m, giving it a return on all those assets of just 0.74 per
cent - 1 per cent on overseas assets and 0.4 per cent on domestic assets.
Losses during the 1980s, especially on US investments in forestry and steel,
eroded a grant of Yn5bn made by the Chinese government at Citic's
incorporation in 1979. By the end of 1992 the company's total equity (the
sum of paid up capital, reserves and retained earnings) was Yn24m greater
than the original Yn5bn capital injection.
Although Citic appears to the outside world as a western-style company it is
really a development bank. Its main role is to bring western technology and
business methods to bear on the pressing need to modernise the Chinese
economy. Hence the dominant role played by its overseas operations.
According to Mr Huang, Citic's foreign operations earn two-thirds of the
company's profits and account for half of Citic's assets. Citic is China's
largest overseas investor, owning 18 per cent of the country's total
investments abroad.
Citic has investment in aluminium in Australia, forestry and steel in the
US, pulp and paper in Canada, and through Citic Pacific, its listed Hong
Kong company, telecommunications, aviation and trading. Not all its
investments abroad have gone well but, as Mr Huang, explains it, from
adversity valuable lessons in business management have been learned.
'In September, when I was in the US, I met a banker who has had a
relationship with our forestry business (Citifor) since the beginning,' he
says. 'He had seen the whole process from the start; from when all our
equity had been lost to when the company made a profit. With effort Citifor
has become profitable, recouped its losses and is now offering up profits to
Citic.'
Mr Huang said that difficult as these experiences abroad have been they were
good for managers. He likens it to a school, adding, 'to train people
without practice is just empty words.' He says Citic is paying closer
attention to the development of its staff, slipping into language that would
warm the heart of any western 'human resources' manager - 'we offer a lot of
opportunity to the people here. We are paying a lot of attention to training
and offering staff opportunities to play a full role, especially in overseas
business.'
Citic is also discovering that management and financing techniques used in
the west for building large infrastructure projects, such as power stations,
are now ripe for use in China. The company is discussing with GEC of Britain
and National Power, the UK privatised electricity generation monopoly, the
construction a 4 times 600MW power station in Jiaxia City on Hangzhou Bay,
based on the 'build, operate and transfer' method so common in Hong Kong.
'The main reason for applying this model is because of China's stage of
development,' says Mr Huang. 'We couldn't do it years ago, the fact that we
can talk of doing it now shows that reforms and market development have been
realised at a higher level. If we look further at the model it will only
work if the price of electricity fluctuates according to the market.'
Although the early years of the 1990s has witnessed an explosive growth in
opportunities for foreign investors in Chinese companies, it is unlikely
that Citic itself will ever be listed on a stock exchange. Citic reports
directly to the Chinese government's State Council, or Cabinet. It is
closely linked with both government and the Communist party at the highest
level.
Foreigners can gain an exposure to some of Citic's mainland assets through
Citic Pacific in Hong Kong. Next year they will also be able to buy equity
in Yizhang Chemical Fibre, one of China's biggest synthetic fibre makers in
which Citic has a 30 per cent share. This is one on of the nine big Chinese
state companies which will be listed in Hong Kong during the first half of
next year.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (36): Regulators battle to catch up -
Securities market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE was ever any doubt that China is a nation of traders and gamblers,
then the enthusiasm for company shares which has developed over the past
three years has settled it decisively. The stock market is the point at
which the national craving to get rich quickly and the government's desire
to see a greater role for market forces intersect.
The frenzied buying of shares a year ago may have subsided, but the country
is in thrall to stock markets. Kerb-side dealers in unofficial shares and
bonds have grown like Topsy on the street corners of many Chinese cities,
especially those inland.
This enthusiasm for securities has, however, not come without a measure of
downside risk. Earlier this year one Beijing company, which had illegally
issued Yn1bn in loan securities, failed, leaving disgruntled investors with
a pile of worthless bonds.
In Shenzhen last August, more than 1m people rioted when an inadequate
system for issuing shares in soon-to-be-listed companies combined with
official corruption, to deprive investors of a fair chance to participate in
the new offerings.
Although there is little - short of exhortation - that the authorities can
do to control kerb markets, they have moved decisively to damp the frenzy
surrounding new issues. Officials - though not their families - have been
banned from participating in the stock market; a lot of effort has been put
into telling retail investors that shares can go down in value as well as
up; and, the rules for new issues have been changed to make participation in
them less profitable.
At the end of September, there were 46 companies listed on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange and 80 on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. In Shanghai, up to
five companies are being added to the official every week, and the
authorities expect to have 100 companies listed by the end of 1993.
With the growth in the number of stocks traded has come an explosion in the
number of securities companies: 205 in Shenzhen, including 10 foreigners,
and 448 in Shanghai, including 26 foreign brokers. On both exchanges,
foreign brokers are allowed to trade only B shares, of which there are 13 in
Shanghai and 20 in Shenzhen.
In total, B share flotations have raise Dollars US1bn since 1991. The amount
of capital raised through A share issues is harder to determine; neither the
Shenzhen or Shanghai stock exchanges collect figures on capital raisings,
preferring instead to talk about market capitalisation. However, according
to one Hong Kong brokerage A share issues have raise around Yn6n since
December 1990.
China's adoption of computerised stock trading - where orders are matched by
computer and trading is paperless - has enabled securities companies to
offer real time stock trading on either the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges
virtually anywhere in China. In Shenzhen itself an investor can dial a
computer and transact an order over the telephone.
It is hardly surprising that such rapid growth has overtaken the ability of
the regulators to police the market. Says Mr Xu Qing Xiong, chairman,
Shanghai International Securities Co: 'Many listed companies are not
following what they said they would when they issued their prospectuses. We
need more regulation to check and make sure companies follow their
prospectuses.'
The two stock exchanges and the China Securities Regulatory Commission
(CSRC) are acutely aware of this problem - which has been the source of much
criticism by foreign brokers - and its associated problems of the timely
reporting of market sensitive information and the publication of accounts
based on western accounting standards. According to Mr Gao Xi-qing, general
counsel at the CSRC in Beijing, the CSRC has set up a working party to study
how best to enforce compliance with the regulations. 'We are fully aware of
the complaints; the government does have the intention to force companies to
publish more information.'
Part of the regulatory problem stems from a division of responsibilities
between the People's Bank, China's central bank, and the CSRC.
The People's Bank, which licenses securities dealers, has opposed the rapid
development of the securities industry, mistakenly seeing it as a threat to
the banks. The compromise which created the CSRC late last year left the
regulator only with the power to supervise securities companies.
This has meant that the CSRC - which is dedicated to the rapid development
of a western-style market in China - has had to be ingenious in its attempt
to improve the quality of dealers. It has done this through its power to
approve the underwriting of new issues. Securities companies have found that
to underwrite securities the CSRC applies a standard 'fit and proper' set of
criteria to them, or licensing by another name.
The difficulties the division of labour between the regulator and the
People's Bank may be overcome when a new securities law is published next
year. Modelled on the US Securities Exchange Commission, this will vest much
wider powers in the CSRC.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (38): Suddenly last summer - Just when it
seemed that China's first takeover was at least a decade away, a Shenzen
conglomerate made a surprise move / China's first takeover bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN China's stock market regulators were writing the rule book earlier this
year the legal department of the State Council - China's cabinet -
questioned why rules were needed governing takeovers.
As Mr Gao Xiqing, a director of the China Securities Regulatory Commission
(CSRC), China's corporate watchdog, remembers it, one official said 'it will
take 10 to 20 years before we have a takeover in China'.
Wrong. The ink had barely dried when Bao'an, a fast growing conglomerate
listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, was buying stock in Yanzhong, a
Shanghai-listed manufacturer with large property holdings.
Bao'an's tilt at Yanzhong this autumn sparked controversy up and down the
south China coast about the efficacy of company takeovers and the quality of
the regulations governing the stock market.
Local loyalties were also fully engaged. The superior-minded Shanghaiese
were horrified by what the parvenu from the south was up to. In Shenzhen,
China's first and most successful special economic zone, Mr Zeng Hanxiong,
chairman of Bao'an, was elevated to the status of a local hero.
Like it or not, as Mr Xu Qing Xiong, chairman, Shanghai International
Securities Co., noted, takeovers have come to China. 'This sort of
acquisition is inevitable; you can do nothing to prevent them from
happening.'
Late last month, however, the CSRC found that Bao'an had violated the law
governing the acquisition of substantial shareholdings. Bao'an's sin was to
move from 10 per cent of Yanzhong to nearly 20 per cent of the company
without making the required statutory declarations.
The CRSC fined Bao'an Yn1m and it was required to pass on to Yanzhong some
of the profits (about Yn500,000) it made from the illegal trade in
Yanzhong's shares. Bao'an was banned from buying any further stock in
Yanzhong until November 4.
The CSRC's ruling has cleared up what some professionals thought was a flaw
in the rules concerning the timing of declarations and the definition of
concert parties. It has also got China's securities industry talking about
the value of takeovers.
Mr Gao, although admitting that China's regulatory environment is not
'pro-takeover', is in no doubt about their benefit. 'A lot of listed
companies still behave in the same way as they did before corporatisation,'
he says. 'The threat of takeover shows them that control now rests with
shareholders, not government departments.'
Mr Liu Bo, executive vice-president at the Shanghai Securities Exchange,
agrees. 'Takeovers are good for management change and for the management of
resources and for the economy in the long run.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (37): A feeble springboard - China's
inadequate infrastructure has emerged as a serious constraint on its future
non-inflationary development / Urgent need to upgrade road, rail and port
facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON

<TEXT>
CHINA has embarked on the world's largest expansion in railways, roads,
ports, electric power capacity and telecommunications. By the end of the
century, however, the nation will still be unable to meet demand for these
key services, thereby capping the China's ability both to grow rapidly and
maintain a semblance of price stability.
Financing the country's upgrading of infrastructure resources has also
emerged as a pressing problem for the authorities. Central government
revenues - the mainstay of investment a decade ago - have been eroded by the
growing fiscal power of the provinces.
Beijing's loss of financial control - which may be reversed once planned tax
reforms and revenue sharing agreements are in place - has also hampered
coordination of infrastructure development. Local interests have sometimes
taken precedence over national requirements.
In addition to this, the inefficiency of China's banking system in
marshalling domestic savings for investment has also retarded development.
Again, this may be addressed by planned reforms of the banking system.
Foreign investment has become an important source of finance for the
development of infrastructure. Such are the needs for increased capacity
that China has been forced to allow direct foreign ownership of roads, local
railways and power stations.
According to one estimate, compiled by Crosby Securities, a Hong Kong stock
brokerage, the share of foreign investment in China's expenditure on
infrastructure development rose to 13 per cent in 1990 from 2 per cent in
1982. This trend is expected to continue.
What follows is a selective look at the current infrastructure bottle-necks
besetting the Chinese economy, the government's plans for future development
and the difficulties it is encountering in realising its plans.
RAILWAYS. About 70 per cent of China's freight is carried on its 53,000km
railway system. In the 8th five-year plan (1991-95), the Ministry of
Railways hopes to increase the network by 16,300km, or 30 per cent, and
rolling stock by 20 per cent.
According to the World Bank China's railway network is sufficient to meet
only 60 per cent of industry's demand for rail services. Mr Tu Yourui,
vice-minister of railways, says network can satisfy 70 per cent of demand,
but that 'in some areas, especially the main line to south China,
bottlenecks mean that we can meet only 40 to 50 per cent of demand.'
The ministry plans to upgrade the Beijing to Kowloon line to a double track
railway by the end of 1995. It recently mobilised a workforce of 200,000 to
accelerate the building of the line, which has encountered difficulties on
the Guangdong-Guangxi border in the south where 300km of line has to pass
through mountains and cross rivers.
Inflation has affected the ministry's ability to meet the 8th five year plan
for rail construction. Its original Yn100bn budget for capital construction
is up to 40 per cent less than it now needs. This has prompted calls for a
review of its very low tariff structure.
It costs just 5.3 fen (about six US cents) to transport one tonne of freight
one kilometre. Mr Tu estimates that a one fen increase in the tariff would
earn the ministry an extra Yn11bn a year in revenue.
But the coal industry is the main impediment to increasing tariffs. Half of
the freight shipped by rail is coal for the electric power industry. Coal
industry losses grew to Yn11.9bn in 1990 (from Yn1.25bn in 1985) and it is
doubtful if the industry could shoulder its share of the price rise.
Foreign investment in railway lines has become one way of addressing the
financing problem, but so far only for city and intra-regional lines. In
Zhejiang and Fujian provinces as well as Chongqing city in Sichuan, foreign
investors are developing rail systems. In Zhejiang and Fujian they own
equity in the lines and are able to develop land adjacent to the railways.
PORTS. China's big 8 ports - from Dalian in the north east to Guangzhou in
the south - handle 80 per cent of China's seaborne trade. According to the
ministry of communications, the volume of trade currently being handled is
20 per cent in excess of their design capacity.
Over the 1991-95 period China hopes to build an additional 180 berths (100
of which are deepwater berths) and increase capacity by 170m tonnes. The
ministry has set a target of doubling China's ports capacity. Today, 50 per
cent of ships calling at China's ports have to wait days before they can be
unloaded.
Beijing has decentralised decision making on ports development to the
provincial and city level. In Shanghai and Shenzhen, city authorities have
brought in Hong Kong investors to upgrade container port facilities, with
these investors owning between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of these
facilities.
ROADS. China's road network is one of the most under-developed in the
developing world. Density of highways is a fifth of that in India.
At the end of 1992 China had 1m kilometres of roads, only 6,000 of which
were class 1 or class 2 highways - properly paved and consisting of more
than one lane each way. China's 30,000km national truck road network is
operating in excess of its design capacity. A further 250,000km of roads
have reached or exceed 60 per cent of their design life. The ministry of
communications estimates that upkeep for these roads alone is costing Yn1bn
a year.
The ministry has ambitious plans for the future development of China's road
network. Over the next 30 years it wants to see 30,000km of highways linking
China's main urban centres. It is unable to estimate the cost of this roads
programme, due to price variations throughout the country for land and
materials acquisition.
Providing the needed infrastructure for shipping goods throughout China is a
daunting enough task. Addressing the social infrastructure needs of the
cities is just as challenging. According to Mr Wang Guangtao, a senior
official at the ministry of construction, China's cities produce 85m tonnes
of sewage and waste water a day, of which only 17 per cent can be treated.
The hope is that by 2000, 25 per cent can be treated - 'this is a big task
for us,' he adds.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (40): An economic bottleneck - Coal and
energy shortages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People are not complaining too much about the price rises - 'not yet
anyway,' say the blue-boilersuited staff of the coal depot in Beijing's
grimy backstreets.
Several years ago the cylindrical bricks of pressed coal dust were three fen
each - now they cost five times as much.
The overhaul of the loss-making coal industry, one of the central parts of
China's modernisation, is also one of the most publicly sensitive. It
implies not just sharp price rises but huge job cuts in China's coal
industry - with 7m workers, it is the world's largest.
The use of coal is woven into almost every part of Chinese life. In winter,
the cities' hutongs - crowded lanes of huts - pump out black coal smoke from
their heating stoves, while most electricity is generated from coal.
In total, it makes up three-quarters of the country's energy consumption.
But the need for reform is inescapable. After years of explosive economic
growth, during which energy production failed to keep pace, the southern and
coastal regions now see their growth threatened by coal and power shortages,
one of the economy's tightening bottlenecks.
Although annual coal production doubled between 1977 and 1992 to 1.1bn
tonnes, it has failed to meet demand. Similarly, electricity generation,
which has risen by around 8 per cent a year in the last decade, has been
outstripped by GNP, which has risen nearly 9 per cent a year in that period.
According to the State Planning Commission, the energy shortage may be the
equivalent of 500m to 600m tonnes of coal by 2000 if the economy grows by
around 9 per cent a year.
Part of the problem has been artificially low state prices. Although the
range between provinces is wide, the level has frequently been less than a
third of world market prices of USDollars 35 a tonne.
In the past year, the huge China General Coal Corporation, which accounts
for a third of the industry's output, has taken the first steps to reform by
allowing coal prices on 57 per cent of its output to float at market prices,
compared to 20 per cent in 1992.
The rest of the industry is made up almost entirely of mines run by
provincial and local governments, which must sell specified amounts to China
General and state enterprises at set prices.
According to a World Bank report in June, prices for this mandatory
production were raised by 27 per cent to Yn71 per tonne.
The government has also, gingerly, begun to tackle overmanning. Since last
year, China has laid off or has made plans to lay off 200,000 employees. The
government has given it some Yn2bn a year to pass on as compensation.
But even if profitability returns to the industry and production rises, the
creaking rail network threatens to choke off supplies.
Guangdong province, in China's booming south, imports some coal from
Australia because freight deliveries from the north are so erratic. Hundreds
of kilometres away, stockpiles of Chinese coal smoulder while waiting months
for freight trains.
The problem is made acute by the regional imbalances between production and
consumption: while China's main coal deposits are in the north, the main
consumption in the east, south and north east.
One of the government's proposed solutions is to build more power plants
inland near the mines.
However western diplomats point out that electricity transmission along
power cables is currently so inefficient that much electricity is lost on
the way.
Given China's coal reserves - estimated by western observers to be some
900bn tonnes - coal will remain the backbone of China's energy supplies for
decades.
If the transformation of the industry is successful, Beijing expects annual
production to rise by nearly 40 per cent by the end of the century to 1.5bn
tonnes.
But between now and then, Beijing must navigate some of the most publicly
contentious issues of its programme of reform.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (33): Still a long way to go - A look at
progress on banking reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE appointment last July of Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier, to head the
People's Bank of China signalled the government's intention to accelerate
reform of the financial sector.
But despite considerable strengthening of the central bank's power since the
summer, there is a long way to go before China has a viable and competitive
banking system.
Over 14 years of reform, dramatic changes have occurred. Originally little
more than a means of directing credits to state enterprises according to the
central credit plan, China's banking system has become an increasingly
important source of funds for enterprises and a means of recycling the large
pool of domestic savings.
In 1984, the People's Bank of China became the central bank, with its
commercial activities transferred to a newly created bank, the Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China. Meanwhile, the other three state banks were
encouraged to expand outside their traditional areas - agriculture,
construction and trade finance.
The big four still dominate the banking system, but since the mid-1980s
there has been an explosion in the number of non-bank financial institutions
engaged in domestic currency lending, direct investment and trust business.
Meanwhile, the government has increased the number of banking licences
granted to foreign banks. Although still prevented from engaging in domestic
business, they have made a significant dent in the trade finance market. One
western banker estimates that Shanghai's 26 foreign bank branches have won
more than 25 per cent of that market.
Yet as the banking sector has become more sophisticated, flaws in the system
have become more obvious. Problems exist in the following areas:
Non-commercial lending. The state banks remain obliged to lend to state
enterprises, regardless of commercial criteria, so the government has been
obliged to keep tight control on competition in the banking sector and on
the banks' interest rates policy.
Up to 40 per cent of the banks' loans to state enterprises are believed to
be non-performing, although the Bank of China prefers to describe them as
'overdue'.
This lack of competition effectively prevents the central bank from using
indirect instruments of monetary policy such as changes in reserve
requirements to control credit.
Under-regulation. Another result of the lack of permitted competition for
deposits by the banks, combined with lax regulation by the PBC, has been a
mushrooming of illegal lending to non-bank financial institutions who then
on-lend at much higher interest rates.
One western banker estimates that, as a result of the crisis in the real
estate sector, as much as 90 per cent of this bank to non-bank lending may
now be irrecoverable.
Much of this lending occurs outside the published credit plan, and is
mysteriously recorded in the government's monetary survey as 'other items,
net'. Last year, net domestic assets grew by 32.7 per cent - 10 percentage
points faster than allowed for in the credit plan. Lax regulation has led to
a series of financial scandals and frauds involving non-bank institutions.
In March of this year, the PBC issued a circular which tightened access to
the interbank market to keep non-banks out, prohibited real estate lending,
and shortened maturities on interbank lending, although the decree was not
enforced until July when Mr Zhu took over.
Decentralisation. The government tries to use the PBC branch network to
drain surplus deposits from the relatively few, normally richer, surplus
provinces to redirect them to those in which the growth of deposits lags
behind credit demand. But it has faced growing pressure from PBC branches,
often with close ties to local governments, which have sought to make
changes to the credit plan.
'Each province has a head branch of the People's Bank,' explains Mr Lu
Baifu, vice-director of the State Council's development research centre.
But, he says, the bank has been losing control of its provincial branches.
'The PBC cannot use it (the provincial branch) to adjust monetary policy. It
has become a hindrance to the activities of the central bank.'
Mr Zhu's first priority has been to re-establish control over the regional
PBC branch network and to assert the PBC's independence.
'In the new financial system, the main objective of the central bank is to
stabilise the value of the currency,' says Mr Qin Chijiang, director of the
PBC's Monetary Research Institute. 'At the moment, the PBC has only limited
power to change interest rates, but our reform direction is to increase it
gradually.'
Next year, according to Mr Qin, the government intends to establish three
policy-oriented banks which will take over the non-commercial activities of
the state banks, thus allowing the commercial banks to choose their
customers and set realistic lending rates.
Meanwhile, the PBC is trying to build a national interbank market, improve
the bank's asset and liability management and strengthen its own supervisory
capabilities.
Yet, as one western banker in Beijing points out, 'the big question is not
how to reform the banks but how to reform their loss-making customers.'
Foreign observers doubt whether the government will be able quickly to free
the state banks from their obligations to lend to state enterprises.
'The government has got to make it clear to the commercial banks that it is
not their duty to lend to loss-making state enterprises,' says an
international financial official. 'That means impressing on local
governments and managers that they must make state enterprises profitable.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (32): It will get worse - Pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICYCLES have been banned from the Bund, the highway along Shanghai's
colonial waterfront, so that cars can move more easily. The image of hordes
of Chinese making their way to work on bicycles is giving way to that of
day-long traffic jams, which pump out a choking smog into the city air.
That is just one symbol of the pressures which China's economic development
is putting on its environment. In the past, environmental concerns have been
low among China's priorities. But in the past year, Chinese officials and
the World Bank have both warned that pollution needs to be curbed urgently
because it threatens future economic growth.
Shortages of clean water have already cut agricultural yields on millions of
hectares of cropland and are pushing up manufacturing costs. Environmental
diseases are a growing burden on public health programmes; lung disease,
partly blamed on air pollution, was the leading cause of death in China in
recent years at 26 per cent of all deaths.
Government statistics, though incomplete, indicate that Chinese cities are
among the dirtiest in the world. More than two-thirds of household and
industrial waste water is dumped untreated into rivers, lakes and the sea.
In Beijing, where only 2 per cent of household waste is treated, the eastern
suburbs reek of sewage, while Guangzhou's canals bubble with methane from
rotting rubbish.
In northern industrial cities, levels of particles in the air, which cause
breathing problems, are up to nine times higher than World Health
Organisation standards, the World Bank reported last year. In rural areas,
only one in seven people has clean drinking water.
These problems, while common to industrialising countries, have been
exacerbated by the route that China has taken to development. The sharp rise
in its population to the present total of 1.2bn followed Mao's endorsement
of large families between 1950 and 1965. The economy is only gradually
turning away from highly-polluting heavy industry, still nearly half of
industrial output.
Moreover, the low energy prices set by the state have left Chinese industry
inefficient. Consumption of energy per unit of output is high even by
developing country standards, according to the World Bank. Coal, the single
biggest culprit behind China's air pollution, still supplies three-quarters
of the country's energy.
The Chinese government has made some attempts to curb pollution during the
past 15 years. It is hard to think of another developing country with a
comparable array of environmental regulations, permits, and levies at both
national and local level.
Professor Ye Rugiu, of China's National Environmental Protection Agency,
claims that these schemes have been at least partly effective: pollution per
unit of output has not increased since 1978, in a period when GNP has grown
by some 160 per cent, he says.
But the schemes attract scepticism among some Chinese intellectuals and
western observers. They point out that the central government's budget for
fighting pollution is tiny: only Y11.8bn last year. They are doubtful that
without more funds, the government's current campaign to shame polluters
into cleaning up will be effective. (In the summer it published a list of
China's 3,000 worst polluting factories, and last month launched a
nationwide nightly television programme to celebrate triumphs of pollution
control.)
Perhaps the greatest problem is that regional and district governments often
fail to enforce Beijing's policy. In the view of one western diplomat: 'I
think they (the central government) are sincere. The problem in China has
always been the disconnection between the provinces and the centre.'
For a start, fines are generally too low to be effective in deterring
pollution or encouraging investment in cleaner technology. In Tianjin, a
fast-growing industrial city 100km south east of Beijing, the district
government can impose fines of only Y50,000 on factories, and the municipal
government fines only up to Y100,000. Mr Liu Jin Sheng, senior engineer with
the city's environment protection bureau, acknowledges that 'the fines are
low and need revision'. But local officials cannot raise the fines without
authorisation from central government.
However, tougher penalties might jeopardise economic growth and jobs. Faced
with that choice, both central and provincial officials tend to choose
growth and jobs. That preference is reflected in the lack of environmental
controls exerted over the mushrooming township and village enterprises.
Often using outdated, inefficient technology, their sprawling sheds and
belching chimneys are part of the new scenery of the Chinese countryside.
Yet they underpin much of the new provincial prosperity, and also have a
central role in state plans for soaking up surplus rural labour and
discouraging peasants from migrating to the towns.
Given the shortcomings of China's present system of pollution control, the
immediate prospect is that much of China will get dirtier as the economy
grows. Informal government estimates suggest that China will burn 1.4bn
tonnes of coal by 2000, a 40 per cent rise on present levels.
However, structural changes under way in the economy could bring about
longer-term environmental improvements. If the attempts to free resource
prices are carried through, particularly in the case of coal, industrial
efficiency may rise.
Development of hydroelectric and nuclear power will also help, although it
brings other problems: China's 'Three Gorges' project to dam the upper
Yangtze river has attracted international criticism for the ecological and
social disruption it will cause. Decentralisation may also give the
provinces more responsibility for pollution fines and permits.
Chinese officials acknowledge that foreign funding and technology increase
the chances of this transformation.
In securing funds, China may be able to capitalise on international concern
about global warming. It made clear at last year's Rio Earth Summit that if
developed countries wanted it to curb emissions from coal burning, they
would have to provide the cash.
But until these structural changes take place, it is hard to see China
becoming cleaner. As Professor Ye puts it: 'We must simply try to slow down
the rate of increase of pollution as China develops - but we cannot stop the
development.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (34): Seeker of excellence - Profile:
Shanghai International Securities Company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MODERN China is the land of the slogan, writes Simon Holberton.
Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, is famous for his 'seek truth from
facts'. The Shanghai International Securities Company (SISCO) hopes to be
famous by putting into practice management guru Tom Peters' slogan 'in
search of excellence'.
SISCO is one of the largest securities companies in China and dominates the
market in Shanghai.
Owned by a clutch of pension funds and industrial companies, it produces
about half of all the new issues coming to the Shanghai market and is
responsible, it claims, for more than 10 per cent of the market's daily
turnover.
The company has also expanded into Hong Kong where it, and its mainland
partners, control two listed companies.
Says Mr Xu Qing Xiong, the company's chairman: 'SISCO is two years older
than the stock exchange. At first we were dealers in government securities
but with the listing of shares our business shifted to the trading of
stocks. As the Shanghai exchange has expanded our company has developed very
quickly.'
Indeed it has. The company's fifth birthday, in May this year, was a time
for celebration. In the 1992 calendar year, SISCO's balance sheet -
according to mainland accounting standards - had more than quadrupled to
Yn2.5bn from Yn600m at the end of the previous year. Profits before tax were
Yn73.6m, compared with Yn12. bn
This growth has funded SISCO's expansion throughout China and Hong Kong. The
company now employs 1,000 and it has 17 branches in Shanghai, 20 branches in
other cities across China and further 16 agents. It is waiting for approval
to set up another 13 branches.
Hong Kong has also become an important base of the company. Mr Xu spent five
years in the colony and knows it well. SISCO teamed up with local tycoon Mr
Li Ka-shing to acquire Public International (subsequently renamed First
Shanghai) earlier this year.
It has also bought control of Ong Holdings which it has renamed Shanghai
Hong Kong International Securities and will concentrate on securities
dealing. Mr Xu says it is important to develop SISCO's business in Hong Kong
as well as Shanghai.
In China's bifurcated securities market - where mainland investors can only
trade A shares and foreign investors only trade B shares - a presence in
Hong Kong enables SISCO to participate in both markets, he says.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (35): Homeowner Mr Li feels very secure -
Housing reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING crammed three generations into his recently purchased Yantai
apartment, Li Xitian has combined the traditional Chinese family arrangement
with the modern Communist party dream of owning your own home.
A party member at a Yantai storage company, Mr Li has set an example for his
fellow workers, most of whom are yet to be convinced to swap a minimal
monthly rent for housing loan repayments and the uncertain legal protection
offered by the Yantai municipal government.
'I feel very secure. I really feel that I own the apartment and will be able
to pass it on to my son and grandson,' said Mr Li, who would not have bought
it had he only been entitled to 'occupation rights', as is the case under
other experiments in Chinese housing reform.
In the past, party members have been expected to lead the way in political
purity campaigns. Now Mr Li is a model homebuyer, having traded in a rent of
Yn69 a month for an apartment priced at Yn23,000. He had saved half the
amount and borrowed the remainder from friends, who will expect him to
become a lender if they, too, decide to invest in a home and hence in
China's economic reforms.
Housing reform began in Yantai, in east China, six years ago. However,
workers and their work units, which own most of the country's housing space,
are still reluctant to participate in a programme linked to the government's
drive to strip away the many welfare functions of Chinese companies.
After the early fanfare, Yantai baulked. Sales were frozen after 1989,
partly because of an unfinished ideological debate over ownership, but
primarily because work units did not want to sell apartments at a loss.
Meanwhile, the local government was reluctant to push rents to a level that
would increase the incentive for tenants to buy at market value.
The government has restarted the experiment this year, convincing 11 work
units, including Mr Li's Yantai Supply and Storage Transport Company, to
participate. Yantai has ruled that all apartments built before December 1990
are 'old' and will be sold at a discount, while those finished after that
date are 'new' and the selling price must reflect the cost of construction.
Yantai's experiences will be studied by other local governments, which have
been delegated the responsibility for setting a timetable for reforms over
which there is little dispute back in Beijing. It is agreed among economic
planners that housing should be exposed to the market, but it is also
recognised that sudden change could produce the 'social instability' feared
by the Communist party.
The central government was responsible for 90 per cent of housing investment
before 1978, but its share was cut to 16 per cent by 1990, and has fallen
further. By reducing its funding, Beijing has increased the pressure on
local governments to develop housing policies or face a heavy burden in
direct and indirect subsidies.
In Shenyang, an industrial centre in the north, where 38 per cent of
state-owned companies are losing money, reforms are to begin early next
year. But Mr Ai Tingjun, the city's vice-mayor, said: 'Solving the housing
problem will not be easy.'
OFFICIALS in the northern Beijing district of Haidian would agree. They have
suspended a scheme to sell apartments to tenants, many of them academics
from the universities and research institutes dotted around the area.
Academics complained that planned rent increases were excessive, and
demanded special treatment as they were unable to take a second job to
supplement their income and could not raise the money to buy a home.
Yantai, which increased rents in 1987 in the first phase of reform, plans to
lift charges again to cover the costs of construction and then to reflect
the market value of rents. The first change is due to come 'in the years
before 2000' and the second 'in the years after 2000', according to a
cautious Mr Wang Qingyuan, president of the city's real estate management
bureau.
Private buyers outside the work unit system remain a small minority. Mr Wang
estimates that only 3 per cent of 'commodity houses' built by government
authorities are sold to individuals, generally get-rich-quick business
people or families backed by relatives overseas. The remaining apartments
are bought by work units or state institutions.
Even Yantai officials, who are at least trying to reform housing, have a
limited view of the market's boundaries. For example, if Mr Li or another
apartment buyer wants to cash in the asset value and return to the
subsidised rental market, he must wait at least five years and will never
again be allowed to buy an apartment through the work unit.
And, Mr Wang explained, the capital gains must be shared with the work unit
and the government, though the precise formula of taxes and charges for the
unprecedented event of a quick resale has yet to be finalised.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (31): The population puzzle - Experts search
for reasons for a dip in the fertility rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SHANGHAI'S population has stopped growing because the birth rate has fallen
so low, according to China's ministry of family planning. That claim does
not take account of peasants flocking to the city's construction sites or
the sprawl of the new suburbs. But if true, it reflects the success of
China's population programme, one of the most ambitious and internationally
controversial aspects of its policy.
For nearly two decades, China has been trying to curb the growth of its
population in order to raise living standards and restrain pressure on
scarce resources. Latest government figures put the total at 1.17bn: China
now has a nearly quarter of the world's population on around seven per cent
of the world's arable land.
Estimates of the future population are staggering. The United Nations'
central projection is that by 2050, the total could reach 1.52bn.
But tiny changes in assumptions about family size produce a wide range: from
as little as 1.23bn in 2050 up to an astounding 1.9bn in 2050 (and 2.4bn in
2150), although demographers regard the highest figures as unlikely.
The core of China's policy is to limit couples to one child, mainly through
financial incentives. In Beijing, couples pay 10 per cent of their income
for a second child and a further 15 per cent for a third. In practice, they
may also lose promotion, housing and other benefits.
The programme has also aggressively promoted contraception, principally
intra-uterine devices, sterilisation, condoms and pills. Abortion is also
widely available: the ministry reports one abortion for every two live
births.
Much foreign criticism has centred on press reports of compulsory abortion
and sterilisation. Beijing has generally called these reports exaggerated,
but the family planning ministry acknowledges that some local officials may
be inadequately trained - 'around 60 per cent of staff at township level
left school at around 15 years old - they do not have enough knowledge of
contraceptives,' says the ministry.
It is clear that the policy has had a dramatic effect. According to
government figures this year, the fertility rate - the average number of
children per woman implied by current birth rates - has fallen to around 1.9
from 2.25 in 1990. That is nearly as low as western European and US rates,
and less than half that of India.
The reasons for the fall have puzzled population experts, given the partial
relaxation of the one-child policy in the mid-1980s - 'we were certainly
surprised when the figures came through,' says Mr Carl Haub, a demographer
with the Population Reference Bureau, an independent Washington-based
research organisation. Some analysts speculate on an unpublicised toughening
of policy; others question whether the fall is sustainable.
The headline figures also hides other concerns. The policy has been more
effective in the cities than in the rural areas, where three quarters of
people live, and where the average number of children per family is still
2.6.
'The countryside is still a problem - they work with their hands and believe
that they need more hands,' officials say. The policy also appears to have
encouraged a disproportionate number of baby boys, traditionally preferred
to girls in China. Ultrasound machines - which can detect the sex of the
foetus - are now widespread, although abortion on those grounds is
officially discouraged.
According to the family planning ministry, in Zhejiang province in the
Yangtze Delta, the proportion of boys to girls has reached 118 to 100
compared to the normal 104.
Demographers stress that given these tensions, and the scale of social
change now under way in China, particurlarly growing affluence and migration
to the cities, the future is highly uncertain.
In Mr Haub's words: 'Who knows what China will look like in 30 years time?
The range of prospects for its population is enormous.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (28): New tensions emerge - Many farm
workers migrate to the cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN upheaval is under way in China's rural heartland where 900m people -
three-quarters of the population - still live. Millions are starting to move
to the cities, marking one of the biggest population shifts in China's
history.
The migration has presented Beijing officials with an alarming vision of the
social transformation set in train by their reforms.
The huddles of people camped in Beijing's railway station testify to the
scale of the changes. Mr Du Wen Bei, 19, from a farming family in the
south-west, has crossed the width of China with his friends to find work on
the construction sites of the north-east.
'Jobs are easy to find up there, but there are no jobs at home at all,' he
says.
The current problems in agriculture partly stem from the successes of the
past 15 years of liberalisation. The commune system imposed on farmers in
the 1950s and 1960s sharply reduced agricultural yields, and output barely
kept pace with the fast-growing population.
However, after 1979, peasant households were allocated their own plots of
land under contract. After fulfilling local quotas, they were allowed to
sell the surplus in the markets that began to emerge.
In the past two years, the government has also lifted state controls on most
agricultural prices, and by the middle of this year, controls on grain and
other food prices had disappeared in most parts of the country, the
International Monetary Fund reports.
The surge in agricultural output since 1979 was one of the first clear
successes of the liberalisation programme and has given the government
confidence to reform the industrial sector.
But new tensions have emerged. The leap in agricultural productivity
coincided with a steady rise in China's population, and Beijing ministries
estimate that at least 130m of the total 333m agricultural labour force are
now surplus to needs.
On some ministry estimates, this figure could reach 200m by the end of the
decade.
Hence the migration - many of those people are now leaving their home
provinces to look for work on construction sites or as maids, enticed by
stories of bright lights and big cities.
Discontent is also rising among those still on the farms. Although the rural
standard of living has risen in the past decade, the gap between rural and
town incomes has widened; official figures say that per capita income for
peasants is Yn770 a year, less half that in the cities.
In the past two years, farmers have seen their incomes squeezed by a fall in
prices for grains, while the costs of fuel, water, pesticides and
fertilisers have risen steeply.
Their grievances were inflamed further in the spring when local banks failed
to honour government IOUs for grain purchases.
One western diplomat says: 'The problem arose partly because many local
officials still regard peasants as serfs and don't take their needs
seriously.'
Although the central government gives the provinces money to buy the grain,
many regions used their growing independence from Beijing to invest the
money in real estate - they then lacked enough money to pay farmers.
Provincial independence, combined with farmers' preference for growing only
the most profitable vegetables, has given Beijing a further headache:
production of some of the most important crops has become volatile.
Following a disastrous cotton crop last year, production levels are expected
to slump, even though China relies heavily on cotton production for textile
exports.
Tensions came to a head in Henan and Sichuan provinces in May and June when
peasants, enraged by layers of taxes imposed on them, rioted and attacked
local government officials.
Beijing ministries were clearly rattled: 'The riots and the migration have
told them that they are losing social control,' says one western observer.
The government has wielded a range of tools to pacify the farmers and
stabilise output of the main crops.
It has ordered local banks to pay farmers promptly for the autumn harvest -
the next few months will show whether this has been heeded. It has also
continued to raise the price it pays farmers for some crops, and tried to
establish a minimum price for the main grains.
Further rises are in the pipeline, the agriculture ministry says, although
the government's room for manoeuvre may be limited as the price of soya
bean, cotton and corn is already close to world market prices. Beijing has
also tried to put a ceiling on fertiliser costs, and is compensating farmers
for some of the increases.
According to the ministry of agriculture, the government is reconciled to
maintaining these subsidies as the price of peace. Mr Xu Haijiang, division
chief of its international division, and Mr Liu Zhenwei, deputy director of
its central administration, says: 'In the past, the government used to pay a
lot of subsidies for consumers and for factories. Now these subsidies are
being reallocated to farmers.'
Meanwhile, Beijing is taking steps to control migration directly. In the
past few months thousands who were camped indefinitely at Beijing railway
station have been dispatched home.
During the rest of the decade, Beijing hopes that mushrooming rural
businesses will soak up 50m of surplus rural labour. The government also
plans to create 12,000 new small towns to absorb a further 20m, the
agriculture ministry says.
Beijing officials and western diplomats agree that China is not about to run
short of food. Transportation problems may mean some regions find some foods
hard to obtain but 'there is no shortage of farmers, no fallow land and no
crisis of falling yields,' says one western observer.
But Beijing will eventually be confronted by the social consequences of the
changes it has set rolling, and by a difficult conundrum.
Continuing to cushion the farmers from price liberalisation is expensive;
removing the protection risks further loss of control; reversing the reforms
jeopardises the past decade's success.
In the agriculture ministry's words, the government's recent measures 'will
alleviate the problems - but they will not solve them.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (30): Migrant labour moves to cities - Over
130m farm workers now 'surplus to requirements'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUDDLED in tightly packed groups around the railway stations of China's
urban centres, peasant workers from the countryside wait listlessly for
offers of work from city dwellers.
Government officials say that about 30m of China's 697m population of
working age are employed outside their home provinces, and that about half
are skilled manual workers, often in construction. But the World Bank
estimates that this 'floating population' may number as many as 120m.
In Guangzhou city alone, at the heart of the flourishing Guangdong province,
officials estimate that about half a million of the city's 3m workforce are
migrants - 'it is hard to get good statistics for illegal migrants into our
city,' says Mr Fu Yin, division chief in the Guangzhou Planning Commission.
'But it is unavoidable, and the figure will increase.' He expects the number
of migrants without work permits have risen to 900,000 by the end of the
decade.
Traditionally, the Chinese state has assigned jobs for life to its citizens,
with housing, health and welfare benefits attached. Citizens received the
benefit of this guaranteed living standard or 'iron rice bowl.' Meanwhile,
the Communist Party was able to keep a close eye on the behaviour of its
subjects.
As economic development has accelerated, government officials have become
aware that this highly immobile and inflexible labour system is hampering
reforms.
In 1986, a labour contract system was introduced for all newly recruited
workers in the state sector, although by the end of last year only 16m (21
per cent) of total state enterprise employees had such contracts. The
government is currently planning further labour market reforms, requiring
all state employees to sign contracts. Unprofitable state enterprises were
prevented over the summer from paying wage bonuses to their workers.
Meanwhile, the state plans to remove from state enterprises the
responsibility for provision of welfare, pensions and housing. Experiments
are under way to allow housing agencies to buy housing stock from state
enterprises, and then gradually to increase rents over time. The government
has established an unemployment insurance system and is investigating a
national retirement fund.
'Our ultimate objective is to create an active labour market so that
enterprises can freely choose their workers, and in which labour is more
mobile,' says Mr Zhu, vice labour minister. Yet the government remains
cautious about the implications for 'social stability' of asking enterprises
to shed surplus workers, let alone forcing unprofitable enterprises to go
bankrupt. Official unemployment in urban areas is below 3 per cent, but
government officials estimate that about 10 per cent of workers in state
enterprises are under-employed, while a third of enterprises are
unprofitable.
'We cannot allow many enterprises to go bankrupt because our society does
not have the capacity to absorb these surplus workers,' says Mr Wei Liqun,
Secretary General of the State Planning Commission. 'With unemployment at 2
per cent, our society is stable. But if unemployment rises above 5 per cent
we will have social unrest.'
As the importance of state enterprises has dwindled, so the grip of the
state on the activities of its population has also been weakened. Less than
half of China's non-agricultural workforce now works in state enterprises,
with a growing number working in foreign-funded enterprises often at five
times the wage of their state compatriots. Meanwhile, the proportion of
workers employed in Township and Village Enterprises (TVEs) rose from 7 per
cent in 1980 to 16 per cent in 1990. These workers account for 40 per cent
of non-agricultural employment.
One reason for the growth of this floating population is the accumulating
surplus of farm labour owing to population growth and technological change.
The labour ministry estimates that 130m of the total 333m agricultural
labour force is now surplus to requirements, and estimates that this figure
could reach 200m by the end of the decade. The World Bank estimates that,
while urban employment should grow by 2.8 per cent a year, agricultural
employment will stay constant.
Another reason is the growing inequality of income between the richer
coastal urban areas and poorer rural provinces. According to World Bank
figures, the percentage of the population which now lives in poverty has
fallen dramatically from 33 per cent in 1970 to 9 per cent in 1990. But
poverty is highly concentrated in the countryside: 95 per cent of China's
100m poor live in rural areas.
In many rural areas, the growth of rural industry has played an increasingly
important role in alleviating poverty, a policy that the government now
plans to encourage. But there is also substantial regional variation in
poverty incidence, as the chart shows, while rural industry is much more
prevalent in the richer regions. More than a quarter of the rural population
in the southern provinces is employed in rural industry, compared to a mere
3.9 per cent in north-western Gansu province where a third of the rural
population is poor.
The government plans to encourage the growth of new urban areas in the
poorer provinces by persuading enterprises and foreign investors to move to
less developed areas. 'Our policy is that farmers can leave the land, but
not the countryside,' says Mr Zhu of the labour ministry. But, as the
floating population already shows, the development of China's labour market,
like its economy, is not always under the government's control.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (29): A tussle over water supplies -
Shortages are made worse by the pollution of rivers and water tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the best tests of whether China can get to grips with pollution will
be its success in improving supplies of clean water. At the moment, the
cities, industry and agriculture are tussling over an increasingly scarce
resource.
Tianjin, located 100km south-east from Beijing, has recently seen part of
its water supply diverted to Beijing, after a new reservoir was built
upstream.
It is now rapidly approaching a ceiling: it uses 90 per cent of the
remaining water and demand is still rising.
Tianjin's Environmental Protection Bureau acknowledges the dangers that
water shortage poses to its regional development, but the solution -
building more reservoirs - is expensive.
Reports by China's National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and the
World Bank show that the main cities frequently extract too much ground
water.
Thousands of square kilometres of land have subsided around Beijin and
Tianjin because of over-extraction of groundwater.
Overall, subsidence has been detected in 45 large and medium-sized cities.
The shortages are exacerbated by pollution of rivers and water tables. Much
of the country's liquid and solid waste ends up eventually in one of the
seven main river basins.
The pollution is rapidly cutting fishery yields. Annual breeding of the four
main fishes in the Yangtze river declined from 20bn in the 1970s to the
present 1bn, according to NEPA reports.
Meanwhile, poor drainage and accumulation of salt has cut yields on nearly
7m hectares of irrigated cropland, sometimes by 25 per cent, the World Bank
study found.
Around 1.4m hectares are irrigated by polluted water, leaving poisonous
heavy metals in the crops.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (25): Trying to bridge the gap - Scientific
research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALONG Tian Lin, a kilometre-long stretch of road in West Shanghai, dozens of
newly-built computer shops are taking the plastic wrappings off their signs
and preparing to start business. Managers of the electronics factories along
Tian Lin expect that within months it will be packed with customers, who
will be able to walk away with almost any kind of computer or component they
want.
The Chinese government hopes that many of the goods in streets like Tian Lin
will eventually be Chinese-made. But that will depend on a transformation
taking place in Chinese science and technology - one of the government's
priorities since opening up the economy.
The central questions are how much that transformation will depend on
importing technology, and whether China can develop a vigorous research base
of its own.
Chinese science lost a generation of scientists and technicians during the
Cultural Revolution, when many of the best were sent to work on the fields.
Though many were later reinstated, those who held doctorate degrees from
western universities before the turmoil are now mostly over 70 years old.
The current scale of scientific and technological research is huge: some
5,000 research institutes - generally separate from the universities - which
are directed and funded by the Beijing-based Academy of Science, industry,
regional colleges and the military.
However Professor Zhu Lilan, a polymer chemist who is vice minister of the
State Science and Technology Commission, estimates that Chinese scientific
research, while strong in some subjects, is still a decade behind the
cutting edge of world science. In some areas, such as communications and
nuclear science, China has been able to take advantage of an overlap between
military and civil interests.
But according to western diplomats, 'a shortage of money to buy equipment
has been a handicap in the natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biology),
while the social sciences still look stunted - they don't yet have enough
autonomy (from state ideology)'.
THE technological standards of Chinese-made goods have also been low. The
evidence is visible in any department store: most electrical and electronic
goods are imported. Even those which are Chinese-made often use imported
components where reliability is needed - Chinese refrigerators use Yugoslav
parts.
To bridge the gap, the government has been sending science students abroad
to study - although half do not return, according to the science ministry.
Prof Zhu takes a benevolent view of this: 'The world is becoming more open -
a global village. You cannot say any more who can go where, but it does not
matter for science where scientists work.'
She adds that 'the important thing is to create better conditions here so
that they return'. In western diplomats' eyes, however, 'there is some
debate whether it has been a conscious part of government policy to let them
go because the country has not up to now been able to absorb them'.
China's attempts to improve its science are focusing on areas which might
yield commercial applications. However, researchers' 'lack of understanding
of the market' is a formidable obstacle, admits a ministry official.
One response has been to collaborate with foreign scientific research
institutes, particularly in the US, and with foreign investors, especially
in electronics and telecommunications.
The electronics ministry, which estimates that the sector is now 5 per cent
of industrial output, believes that some Dollars 3bn has been invested in
joint ventures.
To encourage investment, the Chinese government has begun to pay attention
to the question of protection for copyright and intellectual property. IBM,
the computer giant, among many other companies, has cited this as a
considerable concern, although Beijing ministries insist that legal redress
for such theft is possible.
Meanwhile, as China grapples with these problems, there is little doubt of
the thirst for technological products.
Beijing's largest bookstore, in the Wangfujing shopping district, is
evidence alone: one of the fastest-selling technology books is a manual on
Microsoft Windows, the US-designed personal computer software that has won
worldwide popularity. It may, though, be many years before Chinese companies
mount a challenge.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (24): Loss-maker is given a new parent -
Anshan rescues Shenyang Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST inside the entrance to the Shenyang Steel Sheet Works, a banner
congratulates employees on their becoming members of the Anshan Steel
family, which benevolently adopted a company that has consistently lost
money for the past decade.
Shenyang Steel is typical of northern China's ailing manufacturers, slipping
far behind the competition on quality but too poor to overhaul equipment
installed in the 1950s and, in this case, unable even to buy raw materials.
The factory last year officially lost Yn12.66m, though the actual loss was
double that amount, according to one manager. It has about Yn100m in
outstanding loans from banks, 4,000 mostly idle workers and a potential
output of 100,000 tonnes of steel, though last year it produced only 18,000
tonnes.
'We produced only for 75 days last year because we didn't have enough
materials,' explains Mr Lu Zihe, head of Shenyang Steel's business
department. 'We had no option but to be taken over by a company like Anshan.
We have been trying to find a partner since 1991.'
Mergers and takeovers are encouraged as an alternative to bankruptcy, still
a touchy issue in Shenyang. In 1987, the city announced that an explosive
materials factory had failed, but the resulting controversy surprised local
officials and the city has not had another bankruptcy since then.
The idea of state-approved takeovers is that the stronger partner, Anshan,
the largest steel producer in northern China, will reform the management of
the company and replace the outdated equipment. But, in the four months
since agreement was reached, Anshan has not changed the senior management
and the factory is still working well below capacity.
One cause of Shenyang Steel's woes was the government's decision to remove
subsidies from material prices, which rose to levels that the company could
not afford. As Mr Lu put it, before 1992, 'the state provided materials for
us, but from last year the state stopped providing those materials,'
speeding its collapse.
'We are determined to learn advanced management skills from Anshan,' Mr Lu
says. But the managers at Shenyang do not expect that Anshan will want to
control the company, and emphasise that they will be able to trade
themselves out of trouble, given a continuing flow of money from Anshan.
Another worker at the factory insisted that the 'state still owns the
factory,' even though Shenyang Steel has signed a contract making it
responsible for profits and losses: 'This is not like the system in the west
 -this is a socialist country and the state remains responsible for the
assets and the workers.'
His comments indicate the difficulty faced by the government in handling
workers facing dismissal at loss-making companies. The arrival of Anshan is
seen by workers as the state acting, in another form, to ensure that
Shenyang Steel continues to operate regardless of its lack of profitability.
Mr Lu said his company is trying a few new tactics in the quest for profits.
It is attempting to find a market for the waste steel materials rusting
outside the main workshop, and is about to open a hotel, a popular but not
necessarily profitable diversification by Chinese manufacturers.
'We are doing our best to avoid cutting the staff. We have changed the
working system by putting employees into smaller units and we plan to open
service businesses,' says Mr Lu. 'In the past, the government assigned
people to the factory and we are still responsible for looking after them.
We run a kindergarten and perform other government functions, so we should
get help.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (26): Bumpy road for car groups - Troubled
joint ventures

THE UNPACKED boxes with bright red General Motors markings stacked around a
Shenyang factory tell of the difficulties facing the US vehicle maker in its
joint venture in the northern Chinese industrial city, writes Robert
Thomson.
Each box contains part of a pick-up truck, but the assembly line has stalled
along with sales, and GM's partner, the Jinbei (Gold Cup) Automotive
Company, complains that the model is unsuitable for Chinese conditions and
that the price of Yn180,000 is beyond the means of most work units.
Mr Zhang Defa, vice director of Jinbei, said the joint venture has only put
together 300 of 580 pick-up kits imported in the past year, while existing
production lines are still churning out Jinbei's standard commercial van. He
suggests that the fruits of co-operation have not been to either partner's
taste.
'There is no market for the GM truck. Chinese consumers are not very
accustomed to this kind of two-seater vehicle and it is very difficult to
sell.
'We are now negotiating with them to build a four-seater vehicle which would
be better suited for China,' Mr Zhang says.
Dealing with Jinbei has not been easy for GM or for Toyota Motor, which has
a technical tie-up for minibus production with the Shenyang company, which
is eager to boast that it is the 37th largest enterprise in China and has 40
per cent of the minibus market.
Jinbei's close links to the Shenyang government make it difficult for
partners to resolve disputes locally, but Volks- wagen found in its venture
in larger, less provincial, Shanghai that it could tap support from
government officials who owed no personal loyalty to its partner.
Mr Zhang suggests that negotiations for a production joint venture with
Toyota are in the final phase: 'It is very good to have technical
co-operation, but we would like them to make an investment and be involved
in the design of the car.'
Toyota, the Japanese car maker, insists that there are many areas of
disagreement and a contract is far from signed: 'The Chinese side would like
to think we are close to an agreement.' One obstacle is Jinbei's lack of
openness about its financial operations.
The Japanese company discovered that the Hong Kong-based Brilliance group,
through which Toyota has the technical tie-up with Jinbei, established a
Bermuda-registered company, Brilliance China Automotive Holdings. This
became the first Chinese mainland company, via Bermuda, to be listed on the
New York exchange late last year.
According to Mr Zhang, Jinbei itself was not listed, though 25 per cent of
the Toyota-linked minibus production venture was listed by the Hong
Kong-based Brilliance.
Toyota says that it was not told of the listing until after the event: 'Our
name was used in some of the publicity materials, but we didn't know.
'The Brilliance issue does not affect the ownership of Jinbei,' Mr Zhang
says.
'I have no idea what the share price is now. I know that the share price
went up on the first day of listing, but that is all I know because we have
no reason to watch the price.'
However, the vehicle maker's own brochure talks of the 'Brilliance-Jinbei'
listing, and has a photograph of Jinbei officials in the company of Mr Jiang
Zemin, the Communist party general secretary, who is supposed to have said
that 'Jinbei has connected the finance line with the US and the world.'
At the time of the listing, the New York exchange was presented with a
painting depicting 'a hundred birds worshipping the phoenix,' which, Jinbei
explains, symbolised the hundreds of state-owned Chinese companies flying
toward the US stock market for a listing.
But the listing stirred opposition in Beijing where some Communist party
officials were furious that the Shenyang company and its charismatic
chairman, Mr Zhao Xiyou, had proceeded.
Toyota is still angry, and wonders whether its future in China should be
tied to a a company with an erratic management record.
The Japanese maker is also yet to solve the issues that haunt most joint
venture negotiations, including the value of existing assets that Jinbei
sees as its contribution to the project, and the composition of the
workforce, as well as the role of the imported management.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (23): The market's burdens - Profile: Dalian
Machine Tool Works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DALIAN Machine Tool Works, maker of lathes, boring machines and other
important if unglamorous equipment, is the type of factory in which China's
legendary model workers were supposed to have toiled ceaselessly and
selflessly for the sake of the proletariat.
Mr Zhou Kui, the factory's director and Communist party secretary, now finds
himself at the centre of a sensitive debate over the reform of state
industry and the rights of workers to leave the state sector and take their
skills to collectively-run or private companies.
Over the past year, the machine tool factory has lost 71 of its employees,
many of them managers and senior engineers, to a small company, Bohai
Machinery Plant, established late last year on the fringe of Dalian, a
northern port.
The case has received national coverage, with the departing workers
asserting that 'if you want to have a market economy, competition is
inevitable.'
However, Mr Zhou complained in a state newspaper that 'they are digging at
our wall publicly' and 'some of our departments are half-closed'.
The remarks prompted letters from factory managers who either agreed with Mr
Zhou or thought that he had to accept the defections as part of managing a
factory in modern China. But the replies also highlighted the welfare burden
faced by large state-owned factories, which run kindergartens, provide
housing and bear most of the costs of keeping retired workers and their
families.
A tractor factory manager wrote to the Economic Daily complaining that his
company had 40,000 workers, 100,000 relatives and 20,000 retirees, and 'we
have to take care of everything - how they eat, drink, and sleep.' His
complaint was that this burden left the factory at a disadvantage in the
domestic and international markets.
HAVING been surrounded by political controversy, Mr Zhou is now careful in
his choice of words. He began talking about the resignations by emphasising
that he and the Dalian Machine Tool Works are committed to economic reform,
and that the factory has imported new machinery in the state-approved quest
for quality.
But he also makes clear that the factory has a long and honourable history
of serving the state, which he thinks should count for something even in the
middle of reform: 'We have won many awards for our products since our
founding in 1948. We have contributed to the growth of China's industry.'
Mr Zhou did not directly criticise the senior staff who resigned, and made a
point of mentioning that the exchange of talents was a natural result of the
market economy, which suggests that he has been doing his duty as party
secretary by taking note of the pro-reform editorials in the People's Daily.
However, he thinks that the exchange should be gradual, and not be allowed
to damage state-owned companies, which do not have the flexibility enjoyed
by their smaller competitors: 'We are trying to make the transition to the
market, but it is not easy because we have been part of a planned economy
for a long time, and must deal with overstaffing and other difficult
issues.'
Mr Zhou is unable, for example, to dismiss a few hundred of the factory's
6,500 workers without government approval and without the danger of
impoverishing those employees, as Beijing has yet to put a social safety net
in place. He sees these changes taking a long time, and implies that
state-owned companies need assistance in the meantime.
'We still have some planning and regulations from the central government,
and even in a developed market economy there should be some regulations.
After the perfection of regulations, our development will become more
orderly and reasonable,' he said.
Mr Zhou is not the only factory head to think that reform has created
disorder. The director of the Luoyang Copper Products Factory wrote that he
experienced 'bitter and sour tastes' similar to those felt at the Dalian
Machine Tool Works, and is unable to overhaul the factory, despite
appreciating the need for change.
'Some people say that the state has invested a lot of money in our factory,
and that we should be able to revitalise our operations. It's not that we
don't want to do it or that we don't have ability. There is really nothing
we can do. We are like a big elephant being eaten away by ants.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (27): More joint ventures are sought - Car
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a delegation of Japanese car executives arrived in Beijing earlier this
month to pay their respects to a fast-growing market, they were well briefed
about the difference between the alluring statistics and the hard-won
opportunities of China.
For the past decade, Japanese makers have been generally content with
technical tie-ups and exports, not risking much of their own money or
prestige in the joint ventures preferred by international competitors such
as Volkswagen, which has two large projects, and Citroen.
'Chinese officials always tell us that we must pay a premium for being late
to the market. They say that Volkswagen took a risk and has been rewarded -
and that we should pay extra for starting up now,' a Japanese company
representative explains.
While the Chinese government warned the Japanese delegation about not
missing out on a share of the world's fastest-growing car market, the
government itself is divided over the development of the industry, and over
the pace at which a tariff and tax wall of between 240 per cent and 300 per
cent should be lowered.
China's leading car companies are courting joint venture projects, even
though Chairman Mao Zedong is reputed to have said: 'At last I'm sitting in
a car made by Chinese' when the Number One Motor Vehicle Plant in Changchun
began producing East Wind cars in 1958.
In the meantime, Chinese makers have slipped far behind their competitors in
technology and quality. Economic reform has stimulated demand for new
vehicles and has highlighted the deficiencies of the local product and
producers, which are among the most politically-influential of the country's
companies.
One sign of that influence, and of concern about the use of foreign
exchange, is the unpublicised understanding within the government that
imported vehicles should account for only 10 per cent of total sales. The
government had aimed for a 28 per cent increase in local production to
around 900,000 vehicles this year, and wanted to keep imports to between
70,000 and 80,000 vehicles.
'The pace of economic development means that the import level is likely to
be between 90,000 and 100,000, and will at least be 80,000 vehicles,' a
Chinese government report predicts. However, the report also reflects
concerns that China's desired admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade will create extra pressure to open the market .
But, as in so many industries, the official Chinese figures tell only part
of the automotive story. They grossly underestimate the level of imports, as
Japanese companies exported 96,953 vehicles to China last year, up from
20,673 in 1990, and not including those shipped through Hong Kong.
The Communist party's discipline inspection committee is apparently
investigating illegal imports of South Korean cars through Shandong
province, in the east. Imports of used Japanese cars have come through a
Korean minority area in northern China, with much of the profit being taken
by North Korean organisers.
To cool the car market, Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice premier, suspended purchases
by government offices, which has slowed the flow of exports from Japan.
Production in the first half was running at 45 per cent above last year's
level, but the China National Automotive Industry Corporation said
production and sales fell by just over 10 per cent in August, compared to a
month earlier.
One reason for the low expectations of the Japanese delegation, sponsored by
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo, are recent hints
from senior Chinese automotive officials that the government does not
expectto approve another large-scale joint venture until 1996.
Chinese officials have suggested that three large ventures, the two
Volkswagen projects and that of Citroen, will cover demand for cars. It is
also argued that three commercial vehicle and light truck plants, including
Beijing Jeep, and two mini-vehicle projects, involving Suzuki Motor and Fuji
Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, are enough for the next three
years and, perhaps, until 2000.
However, another senior Chinese official said Volkswagen dominates car
production and another venture, either US or Japanese, would provide a
better balance of makers. A government report also draws attention to the
limited presence of US makers in the market, and the political value of
increasing imports of US vehicles or approving another joint venture.
Jinbei Automotive Company in Shenyang, in the north, is still looking for a
joint venture partner, and has been negotiating with Toyota. Mr Zhang Defa,
Jinbei's vice director, said that China 'cannot rely on car imports' to
satisfy demand, but 'we can't meet the technological and capital
requirements ourselves.'
While the leading Japanese makers have been reluctant to commit themselves
to China, the yen's appreciation this year has encouraged car parts makers
to consider investment, partly to link up with ventures in which friendly
companies, such as Nissan, have a small stake, but also with a longer-term
aim of using the country as a base for components exports to Japan.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (19): Central controls are eased - Balancing
rapid development and popular opinion appears to be the guiding principle of
the government / Industrial reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the early years of China's economic reform, factory managers and
Communist party secretaries did their job satisfactorily if they expressed
support for change and spiced their sentences with the language of newspaper
editorials and internal party documents.
Reform has come gradually, sometimes erratically, but the accumulated change
has altered the character of Chinese industry. Factory managers, whose tasks
were neatly described in a state plan, are now aiming at the moving target
of a market, and the government wants to peel away the welfare functions of
the work unit, leaving a corporate core.
The nature of opposition to industrial reform has also changed. In the past,
Communist party leaders fought over points of ideology on issues such as
bankruptcy, but the reluctance of local governments to use the tool of
bankruptcy now has more to do with angering workers and disrupting 'social
stability'.
Ideological arguments have been settled by the success of reform, but the
government is yet to solve some of the more difficult questions confronting
industrial China. Many large state-owned companies are still soaking up
subsidies to cover losses, and the 'debt chains', the networks of unpaid
debts in the state sector, appear to be lengthening again.
Smaller, collectively-run and private companies are diversifying into new
areas with a passion, pushing up the national rate of industrial output,
which rose 23.4 per cent in August, against a year earlier. But some of
these new ventures are flooding the market with poor quality products that
were a good idea last year but have already lost their niche.
Change is begetting change. Factories, such as the Shenyang Cable Works, now
responsible for their own profitability, are experimenting with foreign
exchange hedging for the first time. As Mr Wang Fuyao, vice president of
Shenyang Cable, explained: 'We import raw materials and we have been hurt by
exchange rate fluctuations, so we set up a team to research the market and
will begin operations next year.'
For the first year in its post-revolution history, Shenyang Cable says that
products are not sold at a discount for special state projects, and the
company has decided that it must trim 1,000 from its 12,600 workforce. But
the factory's suggested solution to that awkward problem is typical of the
central government's response to reform's unresolved contradictions.
'We, in the management, are not going to decide who should be among the
1,000. We will let the workers decide among themselves. For example, if 600
people are in a certain workshop, we will say that there should be only 550
and let the workers select who the 50 will be. Then we will approve their
decision,' says Mr Wang.
Similar difficult decisions are being faced and avoided in factories
throughout the country. The 'responsibility system,' introduced after early
successes in reforming agriculture, has taken hold, but factory managers and
the Communist party leadership are still ready to pass the parcel of
responsibility, which hinders the identification of worrying trends in
industry.
Debt chains were hurting industry many years before Mr Zhu Rongji, the
vice-premier, was called in to clean up the mess. And, for example, the New
Asia General Corporation in Yantai, on the east coast, has been awarded the
title of 'Star Unit' by local officials for expanding into business area in
which it has no expertise and, in some cases, almost no hope of success in
already overcrowded markets.
But the 2,000 workers, many of them farmers turned factory managers, have
built on the early success of a steel plate factory, creating 18
subsidiaries, which churn out instant noodles, mineral water, lifts, and
'biochemicals'. Like other work units, they have just ventured into the
hotel and taxi business and are building a cluster of villas on a nearby
hilltop.
Asked which is the most profitable of the businesses, Mr Li Xueben, a vice
general manager at New Asia, sighed and said: 'The steel plate factory. The
production scale at that factory is the largest and the prices are good. The
food and drink markets in China are very difficult, but we hope to make a
profit with our Xinxin noodles this year.'
The relaxation of central control, and the rapid expansion of companies such
as New Asia, explains the fall from 12 per cent to 6.5 per cent in the
proportion of planned industrial output this year. As well, there was
'guidance' in the form of estimates for about 25 per cent of production,
compared with 34 per cent a year ago. China's government has allowed markets
to flourish and encouraged competition, but some of the country's largest
companies and their managers are ill-equipped for these new conditions.
About 31 per cent of state-owned factories reported losses in the first
half, but the actual figure is probably far higher, as accounting is one
sector still in need of reform.
In Shenyang, the northern heart of Chinese heavy industry, the municipal
government estimates that 38 per cent of factories in its care are losing
money. The government has asked for extra central funds to ensure that these
companies, which double as welfare institutions, can continue to provide
housing, kindergarten and leisure facilities for their unwieldy workforces.
Company housing reform began six years ago, but stalled because local
governments are reluctant to push rents to levels that make the purchase of
a home an attractive alternative. When reform began, debate about the rights
of ownership in a socialist country distracted officials, but now the party
is hesitant because of its fears of instability.
Balancing rapid development and popular opinion appears to be the guiding
principle of the government, but some officials and factory directors are
still inspired by ambitious industrial output targets of a kind that once
excited Chairman Mao Zedong in his rush for growth. However, in searching
for role models, Chinese officials are looking elsewhere.
Mr Cai Weici, deputy director of the Ministry of Machinery Industry, has
turned to Japan and its Ministry of International Trade and Industry for an
example in guiding Chinese companies: 'Their experience is very inspiring.
We have done very careful research on how they handled the period of rapid
growth and the reform of industry. We are like Japan in the 1960s.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (22): Challenges ahead - Hong Kong/Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS 1993 draws to a close, China faces mounting challenges in its attempt to
regain sovereignty over Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Its negotiations with Britain about Hong Kong's political development have
gone badly, raising the possibility that the much sought after 'smooth
transition' in 1997 from British to Chinese rule will be unattainable.
Across the straits on Taiwan, the island's political social development is
leading it further away from reunification with the mainland, in spite of
growing economic relations which are pulling the two economies closer
together.
One of first tasks Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, set himself on
his return to power in late 1978 was to deal with these two problems which
were left unresolved by the communists' assumption of power in 1949.
China's revolution was strongly nationalistic in character. The British and
Portuguese colonies of Hong Kong and Macao were symbols of past humiliations
by foreign powers. Their existence for most of the post-war period was
tolerated because of the access they afforded China to the outside world in
the aftermath of its enforced isolation following the Korean War.
Taiwan was a different matter. It housed the remnants of the Kuomingang
(KMT, Nationalist) government which the communists had defeated in a civil
war which raged in earnest from 1945 until 1949.
Both issues, however, came together under the rubric of 'uniting the
motherland.' Mr Deng's solution to these two different problems, 'one
country, two systems,' was propounded in 1979 and first applied to Hong Kong
(and later Macao).
Today, Chinese government officials in charge of Hong Kong and Taiwanese
affairs face very different problems, problems which reflect the relative
strength in both areas.
Those in charge of Hong Kong evince confidence in their ability to manage
the colony in the absence of agreement on Hong Kong's political development.
They draw comfort from the enmeshing of Hong Kong's economy with China's and
from the colony's aversion to confrontation with Beijing.
CHINA has said that if Hong Kong's political development proceeds without
its consent then, come 1997, it will hold fresh elections for the 60-strong
Legislative Council, the colony's law-making body. It has also threatened
British economic interests in Hong Kong and on the mainland while at the
same time promising to safeguard Hong Kong and Chinese economic interests.
In July, China set up a 'preparatory working committee' consisting of
mainland officials and a selection of Hong Kong plutocrats. Its role is to
provide detailed advice to a 'preparatory committee' - which comes into
being in 1996 - on all aspects of Hong Kong's political, social and economic
life.
Mr Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council (or cabinet), says: 'If there is no agreement, which we do not want
to see, Hong Kong will still go on and continue to be prosperous and an
international financial centre . . . Hong Kong will not collapse.'
For officials in charge of Taiwan the situation is radically different. In
spite of this year's thaw in relations, which saw an historic meeting of
mainland and Taiwanese officials in Singapore in April, Beijing officials
admit that Taiwan holds the cards in dictating the pace of contacts and
eventual unification.
Mr Zhang Ming Qing, a senior official at the Office of Taiwan Affairs in the
State Council, says: 'I should not say that we have acquiesced in slowing
down the talks (about reunification), but there is nothing we can do. It
largely depends on them (the Taiwanese government) whether they want to sit
down and talk.'
Regional trade issues: the presence in Seattle of Mr Jiang Zemin, China's
president, for this week's meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation
(Apec) forum is of more than just symbolic importance. It underlines China's
growing role as a political and economic superpower in the region.
In terms of regional trade politics China is keen to cloak itself in the
banner of free trade and will resist turning Apec into an Asian version of
the European Community.
Mr Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, says: 'We see
Apec as an open trade bloc, rather than a closed one. We are not in favour
of an exclusive, formalised trade bloc but one open to all.'
A little over a decade ago China's trade with the members of the Association
of South East Asian Nations (Asean) was Dollars 800m; today it stands at
more than Dollars 8bn.
The combination of China's open door policy and the enthusiasm of the
estimated 40m overseas Chinese - most of whom live in the region - for
mainland investments will help underwrite further rapid expansion of
regional trade in the coming years.
China has sought strenuously to build relations with other Asian countries
in recent years.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (5): An exhaustive and wearying process -
Economic decision-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN CHINA was grappling earlier this year with the vexed issue of what to
do about an overheating economy, no fewer than seven ministers from the
economic sphere were despatched on inspection tours of the provinces.
Among these senior officials was Mr Liu Zhongli, the finance minister, who
visited the booming coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. It was a
salutary experience for Mr Liu who discovered widespread misuse of funds and
a flouting of central government edicts by banks and by provincial
officials.
'I was shocked by certain phenomena,' said Mr Liu of the practice of banks
to ignore credit plans which required certain funds to be set aside for
payments to farmers and also for key infrastructure projects. Instead, money
was being shovelled into real estate ventures, often through trust and
investment companies set up by the banks themselves.
'Personally, I went to the banks and checked their records,' said Mr Liu. 'I
also went to construction sites to find out how money was being spent.'
Among proposed ventures that came to light was one for the construction of
no fewer than 10 golf courses. The economic decisions that emerged in early
July to calm an overheating economy and bring order to a chaotic financial
system, included a specific ban on the construction of new golf courses.
In the West, the idea of the finance minister thumbing through the records
of local financial institutions would seem laughable, but in China, the
inspection tour remains a tradition. Mr Liu's tour of Fujian and Zhejiang,
as part of a fairly exhaustive process, which eventually yielded the
16-point stabilisation plan of mid-year, reveals how economic decisions are
still made in China. The process remains cumbersome, owing more to tradition
than to modern methods of economic management, even in these days of glib
use by Chinese officials of economic jargon that would have no place in
Marxist textbooks.
Implementation of the austerity programme after problems of overheating
surfaced last year, began effectively at a work conference held last
December in Beijing and presided over by Mr Jiang Zemin, the general
secretary of the Communist party. But it was not until May this year that
alarm bells really began ringing at the centre, and this was after Mr Liu
and his fellow ministers reported back on the extent of the problem.
Much time had been wasted since the Beijing conference, thus risking a more
severe retrenchment than might have been necessary if prompter action had
been taken. When the state council, China's cabinet, met in May to consider
a report of the state planning commission, time for action was already
overdue. Indeed, there was little argument at that meeting about the need
for drastic measures to calm the economy, and to put a stop to the rot at
provincial level that was eating away at Beijing's control, and playing
havoc with central government finances.
The state council laid down broad proposals for bringing order to the
economy, and these were passed on to the standing committee of the Communist
party's ruling politburo for approval. But it was left to Mr Zhu Rongji, as
the senior Vice-Premier in charge of the economy to formulate detailed
plans. These were the product of consultations among key economic
policy-making elements of government, such as the People's Bank and the
finance and trade ministries, and also among the various commissions and
agencies concerned with the economy.
These include, apart from the State Planning Commission, the Economic and
Trade Commission, the Commission for Economic Restructuring, and the
Development Research Centre under the state council. Another important
element in the decisionmaking process that spawned the 16-point austerity
plan and the proposed reforms of the financial sector was advice from
international financial institutions such as the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund. A conference, jointly organised by the World
Bank and the Commission for Economic Restructuring, held in June in the
northern city of Dalian helped refine some of the ideas that were being
formulated by the bureaucracy.
CLOSER consultation with international institutions increasingly is a
feature of Chinese decision-making.
Ultimately, however, recommendations and ideas were distilled by a body
which tends not to appear on organisational charts, that is, the Central
Committee's leading group on finance and the economy presided over by Mr
Zhu.
This supra-ministerial organisation, effectively signs off on key economic
policy decisions which are then referred to the Politburo and State Council
for formal approval.
The process by which economic decisions are made in China, especially where
there might be risk of social and economic dislocation, is exhaustive and
exhausting.
Like any bureaucracy, China's is riven by competing ambitions and policy
differences.
Factional rivalries among leadership contenders are often played out in the
musty corridors of the ministries, commissions and agencies listed above.
While Mr Zhu appears shrewdly to have strengthened his hand over key
ministries and agencies like the People's Bank of which he is the governor,
he still faces significant opposition from conservatives in bodies such as
the State Planning Commission, whose own previously all-powerful role has
been diminished by the market reforms.

fly - But China's economic flight path will remain erratic for some years /
Economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE 'bird in the cage' was how China's leadership described its approach to
economic reform in the early 1980s: the nurturing of fledgling market forces
within an overall central plan. But, as the bars of this cage have been
progressively dismantled, China's economic bird has stretched its wings.
Economic growth since 1978 has averaged an astonishing 8-9 per cent a year,
the mushrooming of collective enterprises has reduced the share of the old
state enterprises in total employment from 81 per cent in 1978 to less than
50 per cent today, China's share of world trade has doubled and 200m people
have been released from absolute poverty.
Nor has this new economic freedom been concentrated in a few southern and
coastal provinces. From Guangdong in the south, past Jiangsu province on the
east coast to Jilin province in the north, the evidence of dynamic economic
change is evident to the eye: in the rows of advertising hoardings which
line the streets of northern Tianjin, the construction cranes which dominate
the Guangzhou skyline or the congested streets and overflowing market stalls
of Shanghai.
Yet the dismantling of the planning cage, and the decentralisation of
economic decision-making, have caused severe economic and political
difficulties for the government in Beijing. The next phase of reforms needs
to find reformist solutions to the problems of growing inequality and
macroeconomic instability if development is to continue at the same pace.
Decentralisation has been the driving force behind China's economic
dynamism. Reforms have occurred step-by-step, often province by province,
with liberalisation occurring first in agriculture and only later in the
banking and state enterprise sectors. The rapid output response to the
decentralisation of farming kick-started reform, generating a substantial
pool of savings which enabled local governments to encourage rapid growth in
rural manufacturing.
Equally important was the decision to allow selected provincial governments
to set up development zones, offering tax and duty concessions to exporters
and foreign investors. Again, the response in terms of export growth and,
later, the volume of foreign direct investment was dramatic.
This explicitly regional and decentralised approach has been important for a
number of reasons: the central government has been able to test deregulation
in particular provinces; provinces have been keen to compete with each other
to attract investment; all have had strong incentives to encourage local
enterprise and thus expand their own tax base.
But this regional approach has also caused problems. By encouraging rapid
growth in the southern and coastal provinces, the Chinese government has
allowed the growth of wide income gaps between provinces. The World Bank
estimates that 100m people still live in poverty, almost entirely in rural
areas and more often in northern and western provinces where growth in rural
enterprise has been much less dramatic.
Beijing's reformers face, as a result, pressure from poorer provinces for
aid from the centre combined with a large 'floating' labour force which,
they say, threatens China's sacred 'social stability'. But, by allowing
richer provinces more control over their own tax base and more power to
offer tax concessions, the centre has been less able to redistribute revenue
for spending on education and health.
THE most immediate problem for Beijing is macroeconomic instability. China
does not have the social and physical infrastructure to sustain growth rates
in double figures. But, without sophisticated monetary and fiscal levers,
the central government has not had the means to keep growth at a sustainable
pace. Each time the bird has soared higher, it has fallen back to earth with
a bigger, reform-threatening thud.
The overheating in the first six months of this year illustrates the
problem. Provincial governments and local central bank branches responded to
last year's southern tour by Deng Xiaoping by effectively ignoring
restrictions on credit creation. Rapid growth and real estate investment in
urban and coastal regions was quickly followed by inflation as
infrastructure bottlenecks developed and raw material prices soared.
While the central bank had lost control of credit creation, the government
could not quickly raise taxes or cut spending in the overheating provinces.
For all the government and the World Bank's talk of 'indirect' measures such
as interest rate increases, the government had no effective means, short of
a blunt across-the-board clampdown, to slow the economy. Fortunately, this
time the clampdown was enforced by reformers rather than conservatives.
The need to develop more sophisticated policy levers poses a dilemma for
reformers. Curing this boom-bust cycle requires a re-centralisation of
economic power, particularly over monetary and fiscal policy. But, if reform
is to progress, this re-centralisation must occur with the support of the
richer provinces and without blunting China's regional dynamism. For this
reason, vice-premier Zhu Rongji's determination to avoid a hard landing
which would threaten support for planned reforms of the central bank, fiscal
policy and the banking sector.
But Mr Zhu's task is more complicated. As the economy has developed, the
step-by-step approach to reform has become much harder. The central bank
will not be able to use monetary policy effectively until the banking sector
acts competitively. The banks cannot lend commercially until they are freed
from the need to support loss-making state enterprises. But these state
enterprises remain the main source of welfare services - housing, health and
pensions. The state cannot allow them to go bankrupt, and workers dare not
change jobs, until a new state welfare structure has been constructed
outside the enterprise sector, a task which has only just begun.
In short, the levers of macroeconomic control in China will remain difficult
to use for fine tuning. Even if Mr Zhu succeeds in avoiding a hard landing
and can reassert the central bank's authority, it seems doubtful that China
has seen the last of its boom-bust cycles. The economy is now almost
certainly too open, and market forces too deeply embedded, for China's bird
to be re-caged. But its flight path will remain erratic for some years.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (3): Private factor is
potent attraction - The market is flourishing but beware of competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mood among Swiss private bankers these days is a mixture of
gratification and apprehension. They are gratified because asset management
for wealthy individuals is now a flourishing market in spite of decades of
scepticism about its future. They are apprehensive because the boom has
brought with it competition from unlikely sources, including retail banks in
Europe and America.
The strength of competition has raised questions over whether Swiss banks,
and in particular the small privately-capitalised Geneva banks, will
continue to exert their dominance over offshore private funds of Dollars
2,100bn.
The alternative is that they will be squeezed out by other centres, and by
large institutions which attempt to offer similar services from bases in
Switzerland.
Chase Manhattan estimates that 35 per cent of private client funds are
managed from Switzerland. The near-monopoly of Swiss private banks in the
inter-war period has been gradually eroded. But the country's political and
financial stability, traditional expertise and banking secrecy remain potent
attractions, in spite of strong competition from Luxembourg and London.
'Knowing others think this is an interesting sector is a reassuring
confirmation that we were right in decades when people said it was not that
important,' says Mr Thierry Lombard, one of six partners of Geneva-based
Lombard, Odier &amp; Cie.
Competition has intensified as banks have looked at private banking as a
commission-earning activity with lower capital risks than lending.
'It is a fee-earning business with relatively good margins, and the bulk of
it is off-balance sheet, so you can achieve a good return on capital,' says
Mr Jean Pierre Cuoni, chief executive of Coutts &amp; Co AG, the international
private banking arm of National Westminster Bank.
Banks are also encouraged by the potential growth of wealthy individuals in
emerging markets in Asia and Latin America.
Banks that already manage assets and provide capital markets services to
large corporate clients and institutional funds, can offer similar services
to rich individuals at relatively low marginal cost.
Mr Georges Vergnion, chairman of Chase Manhattan Private Bank in Geneva,
says that Chase's derivatives expertise and technology is one example of a
transferable resource.
International banks, such as Chase and National Westminster, are unconcerned
about Switzerland's future as a private banking centre.
'Switzerland is a booking centre, a product, for us,' says Mr Cuoni. 'I am
not worried if people say other centres are coming up. We are there too.'
The fortunes of Swiss private banks are more intertwined with the country's
competitive advantage.
Yet maintaining that advantage requires a delicate balancing act. The
private banks must be large and expert enough to provide clients with the
enormous range of modern financial products and capital instruments. Yet,
they must maintain the small-scale, personalised service that allows them to
command private client fees big enough to offset larger competitors'
economies of scale.
Mr Hans Bar, chairman of Bank Julius Bar in Zurich, says that the primary
emphasis must be on individuals. 'The margins are slim on asset management
and global custodianship. It is the private client who pays the bill,' he
says. Mr Lombard agrees. 'We may sell part of our expertise outside, but the
bulk of our research must be devoted to our clients,' he says.
This principle is more easily enunciated than achieved. The Swiss banks need
to boost private client assets with institutional funds: 45 per cent of
Lombard, Odier's assets under management, are institutional. This gives them
an incentive to concentrate on fund rather than portfolio management,
devoting research to overall asset allocation instead of selecting
individual mixes for clients.
This tendency has been reinforced by the growth in mutual funds from the US,
which offers individuals the chance to diversify risk and to spread
investments around different markets.
Private banks increasingly act as intermediaries between their clients and
such funds, sometimes making markets in investment fund holding to allow
private clients to swap among them easily.
Mr Bar says that private clients have become preoccupied by fund
performance. 'It is less and less them asking: 'Is this a good bank?' People
ask about the funds now,' he says.
This could mean that private banking will become a 'commoditised' business,
with margins falling as a growing number of competitors are able to offer
fund management expertise similar to the established participants.
Nor is it simple to decide which form of institutional business banks should
seek. Some are now having to choose between offering large corporations
asset management services, or becoming global custodians that manage
securities portfolios.
Calculating which option is more profitable in the long term is 'a difficult
call', according to Mr Patrick Odier, a partner of Lombard, Odier.
Mr Vergnion argues that such trends favour big banks which can allow their
private banking arms to draw on the expertise of other specialist
activities, such as institutional fund management and capital markets.
'We have already seen some of the smaller banks merging. Those that cannot
invest in people and technology are going to be squeezed out,' he says.
Mr Vergnion believes that international banks with a presence in Switzerland
have an edge in attracting new clients because much of the emerging wealth
is among entrepreneurs in Asia and Latin America.
Chase says that it is gaining market share, although its 31 per cent growth
in assets under management, so far this year, includes money entrusted to it
by independent advisers.
The Swiss banks remain a competitive force. Surveys have found that clients
still value their traditions of service highly and are prepared to pay a
premium for it. The suspicion that private banking is merely the latest fad
for some of their competitors also helps.
They have specialised in client asset management for so long that their
names and addresses alone are an advertisement.
'We are willing to render service in the very long term, and we devote our
capital to our clients' needs. That is important,' says Mr Odier.
Yet in a world where the average retail investor can buy equity options or
take a stake in Venezuelan equities through a mutual fund, the Swiss banks
must work increasingly hard to demonstrate that their expertise remains a
unique asset.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (4): Spectacular returns
bring big three the risk of protest - John Gapper explains why cost-cutting
follows record bank profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international boom in securities underwriting and derivatives trading
has created record profits for Switzerland's three biggest banks - but the
achievement could not have come at a more awkward time. As they cut costs in
the competitive domestic retail market, the banks now risk political and
consumer protest.
The success of Union Bank of Switzerland, CS Holding, and Swiss Bank
Corporation in diversifying into profitable forms of international business
was rewarded spectacularly in the first half. Post-tax profits increased by
83 per cent, with trading income double that in the first half of 1992.
This gave them a respectable 13 per cent return on capital, despite domestic
returns of between 5 and 6 per cent. The three have suffered from low
returns in the past because they have high ratios of equity to assets. They
have maintained their solidity at the expense of short-term returns.
But concerns over the sustainability of trading revenue and risks associated
with derivatives mean that each is trying to improve long-term
profitability. This involves restructuring of domestic operations and some
highly cautious provisioning against bad debts to provide a cushion for the
future.
'The trading side is volatile and makes us vulnerable,' says Mr Josef
Ackermann, chief executive of CS Holding's Credit Suisse. 'The things which
will remain with us are cuts in costs and a high level of provisions.' Mr
Ackermann says the big three must be cautious because the Swiss economic
outlook is uncertain.
The Swiss domestic market is characterised by high levels of competition and
slim interest margins. Swiss banks also went through a period in the 1980s
when they offered a large and expensive range of products to personal
customers, and kept large networks of indistinguishable branches.
The banks face political problems in improving net interest margins from the
current level of 1.4 per cent. They have been unable to match the rise in
mortgage margins achieved in other countries because of public antagonism.
Customers are also astute at not leaving interest-free deposits.
This means that attention has focused on cost-cutting and simplifying
products. Mr Robert Studer, chief executive of UBS, says: 'In the 1980s all
the banks introduced products of a sophistication that the customer did not
want or understand, and certainly was not prepared to pay for.'
Cost-cutting has been given impetus by the acquisition of the fourth largest
bank - Swiss Volksbank - by what was the third largest by asset size, CS
Holding. It is estimated by Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, that
cost-cutting could improve domestic operating profits by 15 per cent by
1995.
But the CSH/Volksbank deal has also reinforced the banks' contest for size.
Mr George Blum, chief executive of Swiss Bank Corporation, says his domestic
priority is to increase market share by measures that include buying small
banks, and using unspecified new distribution channels.
Mr Blum emphasises that SBC will do all it can this year to make bad debt
provisions high enough to ensure a profits gain from falling provisions over
the next few. 'It is best for them to be as high as possible in the special
circumstances of this year to give us a totally safe base,' he says.
The challenges in international operations are different. The banks have
gained by not making similar mistakes to those of US and European banks
which expanded into loss-making retail overseas operation in the 1980s.
Instead, they have concentrated on more profitable corporate and securities
businesses.
The banks have gained from their derivatives strength as currency and
interest rate volatility have drawn huge demand from corporate customers for
risk management services. SBC's derivatives liabilities and credit
substitutes alone rose by about a third last year from SFr1,017bn to
SFr1,544bn.
While the banks' strong capital is likely to help them keep their market
share, concerns focus on narrowing of margins and trading risk. Mr Ackermann
says that 'derivatives are here to stay', but adds that he expects margins
to narrow for plain derivative products over the next few years.
But the banks are optimistic that they can sustain international profits by
expanding in securities and banking markets where they are underdeveloped.
'If we can expand our infrastructure, we can get stable income from markets
where we've had a limited role,' says Mr Ackermann.
The biggest strategic question facing the banks is whether they can maintain
their approach of valuing capital strength at least as highly as return on
equity. With US banks achieving returns on common equity of 15 to 20 per
cent on strengthened capital, pressures may mount.
In one sense, the world is moving in the direction of the big three. There
is a growing international emphasis on strong capital ratios in businesses
such as securities underwriting and derivatives. The Basle accord on minimum
capital ratios has also encouraged banks to meet Swiss standards.
Nonetheless, Switzerland is not immune from shareholder activism, with UBS
already facing a legal challenge from BK Vision, the investments company
which holds a 15 per cent stake. There could be external pressures to
concentrate on higher earning businesses to raise overall returns.
Mr Blum says that if SBC can produce returns above 10 per cent in future he
will be 'very happy', but he does not regard it as the sole target. 'If we
cannot, then so be it. What is the alternative? To reduce our capital would
be crazy because that is the base of confidence in the bank,' he says.
Mr Studer says that it would be wrong to depend too strongly on short-term
equity returns. It must sustain types of activity which contribute to
overall profits. 'We are an ocean steamer not a small boat on a lake, and
you cannot try to move us as quickly as a small boat,' he says.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (2): Little to celebrate
 -Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is not much joy in the Swiss economy these days, but neither its
current state nor its prospects appear to be as bad as many have feared.
The country is coming to the end of the third year of a recession that has
been unpleasant, but mercifully shallow. According to recently upwardly
revised figures, real gross domestic product was in fact stagnant in 1991
and contracted by only 0.1 per cent last year. It is expected to fall 0.7
per cent this year.
The slump was initially self-imposed, as inflation shot up to more than 6
per cent in 1990, forcing the Swiss National Bank to tighten monetary policy
just as other stimuli were showing signs of flagging.
The effect of the squeeze was felt first on private sector investment. It
contracted 2.5 per cent in 1991 and 5 per cent last year, leaving the
construction industry, property markets and many machinery sectors in
considerable difficulty.
On the other hand, exports, which account for more than a third of GDP, held
up remarkably well, growing 3.4 per cent last year. But they have sagged
this year as the German economy has slumped.
By far the most damaging aspect of this recession has been its impact on
jobs. The unemployment rate has shot up from less than 1 per cent in 1990 to
4.5 per cent, with a record 170,000 people now out of work. Economists agree
that this will worsen next year.
High unemployment has had a strong impact on other elements in the economy.
Soaring spending for welfare benefits has been the main contributor to the
government's record breaking deficits in the past two years.
Economists also suspect that unemployment is behind the nervousness that has
sent private consumption plunging much more deeply than in previous
recessions. Consumption was off 0.2 per cent last year, and tumbled 2.5 per
cent and 1.2 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year
respectively.
There is an uncommon unanimity among analysts that the economy is at last
bottoming out, but no one expects it to recover quickly next year. Among the
leading forecasters, the Lausanne-based Crea Institute for Applied
Macroeconomics and Zurich-based Centre for Research of Economic Activity
(KOF) are the most optimistic, expecting GDP growth of 1.7 per cent and 1.5
per cent respectively. Bank Julius Baer is at the bottom of the range,
seeing only a 0.9 per cent growth.
Whatever the outcome, no one expects that growth will be strong enough to
reduce unemployment.
Inflation, on the other hand, has been largely wrung out of the system. The
central bank expects it will drop to under two per cent by the middle of
next year compared with the September rate of 3.4 per cent.
The differences in the forecasts seem mainly to reflect differing views on
the outlook for exports. The Swiss National Bank seems to side with Baer.
Mr Georg Rich, director and chief economist, says he is sceptical of the
optimistic forecasts of German recovery recently published by the German
institutes. The recovery, he says, is more likely to be led by private
consumption, as people gradually lose their nervousness about unemployment.
The more interesting question is the state in which Swiss industry will
emerge from the recession. It has taken a beating in the past two years. A
September survey of 200 industrial firms by Union Bank of Switzerland found
that average capacity usage had dropped to 81 per cent and two thirds of the
companies employed fewer people than a year ago. Only 4 per cent expected
orders to rise in the fourth quarter.
Moreover, there has been much moaning in Swiss industrial circles about the
difficulties exporters now face. One obstacle is the strong Swiss franc,
bolstered by large inflows of haven-seeking capital in the past year and
supported by a fairly rigorous monetary policy.
The central bank, having been burnt once in the late 1980s, is hesitant to
stimulate the economy beyond its medium term target of one per cent growth
in the monetary base.
In the first half of 1992, the bank was much criticised for maintaining a
tight grip. But since then, it has regained credibility, taking advantage of
rises in the franc which have been caused by capital inflows to reduce
interest rates unilaterally.
The spread between German and Swiss short-term interest rates is still over
150 basis points and the franc remains strong, but the bank seems in no
hurry to provide further unilateral relief.
The more worrying problem for exporters is the possibility of discrimination
in European markets as a result of Switzerland's decision last year to
remain outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Mr Rich and others believe that Swiss industrial companies have made great
strides during the recession to improve their competitiveness. This is shown
by the fact that corporate profits have remained at respectable levels.
Thus, they should be able to absorb the marginal extra costs of border
formalities that their European Union competitors will no longer face. But
discriminatory acts, especially covert ones, would be difficult to counter.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, managing director of BZ Trust in Zurich, a fund
management firm, is especially optimistic. 'People are underestimating the
progress our companies have made,' he says.
'Of course there will be some unpleasant surprises in Europe, but that is a
challenge to produce better products. Swiss companies should not be in
businesses where a sale depends on a 2 or 3 per cent margin.'
Mr Schiltknecht also points out that Swiss companies have already had some
important benefits from being outside the EEA, notably the lower interest
rates made possible by the large capital inflows.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (2): Mr Zhu walks an economic tightrope -
The government has eased monetary policy but inflation is still worryingly
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice premier in charge of China's economy, has taken two
large gambles since he assumed control of the central bank in July.
First, he enforced a tough austerity programme in the full knowledge that it
would make him a number of enemies within the government and in the
provinces and make it harder to force through the structural economic
reforms.
Then, having taken the heat out of the inflationary boom, Mr Zhu bowed to
pressure and eased monetary policy earlier than international lending
institutions like the the World Bank would have preferred. This risks a
resurgence of inflation and an eventual hard landing.
The inflationary pressures which became evident in the first half of this
year suggested then that a hard landing might be necessary. Last year's
economic performance was impressive: economic growth of 12.8 per cent,
inflation under 5 per cent and a current account surplus.
But prices for raw materials such as steel and cement showed sharp gains
partly because of a boom in the real estate market as banks lent heavily,
and often illegally, to property companies.
Economic growth was 14 per cent in the second quarter compared with a year
before. In the same period, investment in fixed assets rose 62 per cent and
inflation accelerated to 14 per cent nationwide and 21 per cent in the
larger cities.
The government's 16 point plan, announced in July following a first, modest
increase in interest rates in May, aimed to take the heat out of a growing
speculative property boom. Many measures enforced government regulation
which local central bank branches and provincial governments had ignored. Up
to 1,000 new development zones were closed by the middle of August.
The biggest economic shock came not from the further rise in interest rates,
but an administrative order from the central bank in Beijing that illegal
inter-bank loans should be repaid to state banks.
'The only way to tighten credit was to pull the firewood out of the stove,'
says Mr Lu Baifu, director of the State Council's Development Research
Centre. But, unable to liquidate their real-estate lending, banks clamped
down on lending to state enterprises, who receive 70 per cent of state banks
loans and rely on credit for working capital.
Enterprise deposits at the banks fell by Yn28bn in June, Yn34bn in July and
Yn10.6bn in August. Broad money supply contracted in the summer months, and
the swap market exchange rate appreciated from its summer low.
The measures have restored some sort of order. Fixed asset investment, which
grew by 68.5 per cent in the first eight months, actually fell by 10.4 per
cent in August from July.
Growth of industrial output slowed in September to 19.1 per cent compared
with the same month of 1992, compared with 22.6 per cent growth in the
entire third quarter over the samer quarter of 1992. Annual-rate inflation
in the 35 big cities was 20.7 per cent in September, down from 23.3 per cent
in July, while prices of key commodities are falling - steel prices fell 34
per cent in the third quarter.
The effect of the credit squeeze was felt most severely by state
enterprises, many of whom found themselves unable to pay wages and
complained bitterly to regional and national officials that they were being
unfairly treated. The result was strong political pressure on the central
bank to ease credit.
An example of this view came from Mr Dong Fureng, a member of the standing
committee of the National People's Congress. 'Personally, I think Zhu
Rongji's macro control measures should be more flexible,' he said last
month. 'Banks should quicken steps to provide loans to troubled
enterprises.'
Policy has, in fact, been eased progressively since the summer, as Mr Li
Lanqing, vice premier, confirmed recently: 'There is no disagreement in the
Chinese leadership,' he said. 'We are going to loosen credit a little for
profitable state enterprises and the agricultural sector.'
Moreover, Mr Zhou Zhengqing, central bank deputy governor, told a Beijing
newspaper in October that the central bank had increased the supply of base
money by Yn10bn in August and September, compared with Yn1.46bn in the same
period last year.
'This should permit the banks to increase loans during the fourth quarter,'
he said, although credits would flow initially to profitable enterprises.
Inefficient enterprises would first have to demonstrate that they had taken
steps to reduce reliance on credit. But the risk remains that Mr Zhu has
eased too early.
Urban inflation is more than 20 per cent while demand pressures persist. The
trade deficit rose to Dollars 6.97bn in the first nine months, with import
volumes up 29.9 per cent compared with export growth of just 6.6 per cent.
The World Bank estimates that China can sustain growth of 8 per cent a year
without overheating, but the government is still expecting 12 per cent
growth this year.
In short, the underlying inflationary momentum has probably been suppressed
rather than cured.
The government claims that illegal interbank borrowing has stopped and that
half of the illegal loans have been recovered.
But Mr Lu Baifu of the Development Research Centre is less sure. 'The
fundamental problem has not been solved. Money growth is still too high, the
demand for investment is still too high, and inflation is still too high,'
he said.
Mr Zhu has, of course, a wider reform agenda to pursue which would be
jeopardised by too tough a stance on inflation. One western official in
Beijing says: 'Zhu Rongji never talks of stabilisation, only of a
re-adjustment of the structure of lending. The government does not want a
draconian contraction, just a modest tightening.'
Mr Zhu is walking a tightrope, risking being seen to be too tough and too
soft at the same time. It is too early to tell whether he will remain
sufficiently popular to see his reforms passed - and yet remain tough enough
to keep the lid on inflation. But Mr Zhu is still walking.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China 3): The meteoric rise of Zhu Rongji - Tony
Walker profiles the movers and shakers in China's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy,
'uneasily sits the crown,' as the saying goes.
The reformist Mr Zhu, who introduced a 16-point austerity programme
mid-year, has entered some rough water after offending powerful vested
interests in the state sector with his attempts to impose stricter financial
discipline.
But the 65-year-old electrical engineer is unlikely to be fazed by criticism
if he believes he is on the right track. A native of Changsha in Hunan
province close to the birthplace of Mao Zedong, Mr Zhu is known for a
stubborn streak, and a willingness to take risks.
He has also experienced ups and downs in a bureaucratic career that began in
1951 as an official involved in central planning after graduating from
Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University. In the late 1950s, Mr Zhu's career
went into eclipse after he joined criticism of the system in the 'Hundred
Flowers' campaign of 1957. During his years in the doldrums, which included
a stint in the countryside for 're-education' during the Cultural
Revolution, Mr Zhu remained nominally a deputy division chief of the State
Planning Commission from 1952-1975.
In the last years of the Cultural Revolution he was transferred to the
Ministry of Petroleum. Then in 1978, the year that Mr Deng Xiaoping,
launched his economic revolution, Mr Zhu became director of the Industrial
Economics Institute attached to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, an
important Dengist 'think tank.'
There followed jobs with the State Economic Commission, president of the
Economic Management Institute affiliated with his alma mater, Qinghua
University, deputy Party-Secretary of Shanghai in 1987, and mayor in 1988.
The bold Mr Zhu earned a reputation for getting things done as mayor of the
China's largest city: he was known as 'one chop' Zhu - a reference to the
seal used by Chinese bureaucrats to signal approval.
In recognition of his sterling efforts in Shanghai, Mr Zhu was transferred
to Beijing as a vice-premier in 1991, elevated to the seven member standing
committee of China's ruling politburo in 1992, made senior vice-premier in
charge of the economy in March this year, and concurrently People's Bank
governor in mid-year.
By any standards, it has been a meteoric rise, and has, inevitably, aroused
jealousies.
LOU JIWEI, THE IDEAS MAN
AMONG Mr Zhu Rongji's core group of close advisers a key figure is Lou
Jiwei, director of the Macroeconomic Department of the Commission for
Restructuring the Economy.
While, the 42-year-old Mr Lou's substantive position is with the
Restructuring Commission, his more important role is that of 'ideas man' in
the Zhu kitchen cabinet dealing with economic issues.
Indeed, he is credited with a vital part in formulating the 16-point
stabilisation programme of mid-year. The representative of an international
lending institution says of Mr Lou that he is 'very influential' and
'liberal minded'.
Like Mr Zhu, Mr Lou is a graduate of Qinghua university - he graduated in
computer engineering - and, among his more recent tasks, he was head of the
Shanghai Commission for Restructuring the Economy. This was during the
period when Mr Zhu was mayor.
ZHU XIAOHUA, YOUTHFUL ADVISER
ZHU XIAOHUA, the new deputy governor of the People's Bank, China's Central
Bank, is another of Mr Zhu Rongji's youthful advisers, and like Mr Lou
Jiwei, these connections stem from associations formed in Shanghai in the
late 1980s. The 44-year-old Mr Zhu served as vice-president of the People's
Bank's Shanghai headquarters from 1987-1990. This was during Zhu Rongji's
term as mayor.
A graduate of the Shanghai Institute of Finance, Mr Zhu Xiaohua was seconded
to the International Monetary Fund from 1991-92. He returned to be deputy
director of the economic section of Xinhua newsagency in Hong Kong before
his appointment to the People's Bank in July.
The Xinhua offices in Hong Kong are China's unofficial headquarters in the
colony, and officials placed there are effectively Beijing's senior
diplomatic representatives. Mr Zhu, described by a Chinese economist as
'smart,' is a native of Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai.
LI JIANGE HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE
LI JIANGE has the least public face of Mr Zhu's close staff, but according
to a Chinese economist familiar with the workings of the vice-premier's
office, Mr Li plays a crucial role as a personal assistant and
speech-writer.
Mr Li, who is in his forties. has worked in recent years in the State
Council's Development Research Centre, the Cabinet 'think tank,' and in the
State Planning Commission. His substantive position is deputy director of
the law and policy department of the Economic and Trade Commission, but he
spends almost no time there these days. A Western economist describes Mr Li
as 'clear-headed.' He is tipped for bigger and better things.
ZOU JIAHUA: WIDE CONNECTIONS
ZOU JIAHUA, the third ranking vice-premier among five behind Premier Li Peng
and Mr Zhu Rongji, appears to have seen his influence diminished recently;
but with his wide Party and bureaucratic connections his present lack of
prominence may be temporary.
The 67-year-old Mr Zou, is married to the adopted daughter of the late
Marshal Ye Jianying, one of the heroes of the Communist revolution, and is a
son of Zou Taofen, a famous intellectual and journalist from the Shanghai of
the 1930s.
His responsibilities include industry and the State Planning Commission
which is seen as a haven for officials antipathetic to Mr Zhu's reformist
zeal. But the Shanghai-born Mr Zou himself is regarded as a moderate with
liberalising tendencies. His long experience in the Chinese bureaucracy
includes stints as Minister of Machinery and Electronics and director of the
State Planning Commission.
Born in Shanghai, Mr Zou was trained as an engineer in the Soviet Union
between 1948-55. He is fluent in Russian and speaks some English.
LI LANQING'S STAR IS RISING
THE fifth-ranking vice-premier, Li Lanqing is one of China's more impressive
officials whose star appears to be rising. The urbane Mr Li, 61, has overall
responsibility for foreign trade and education. Among his more important
tasks is selling China to the outside world. He is frequently charged with
the task of receiving foreign visitors.
In his previous role as Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
(Mofert), he travelled widely. He speaks passable English. Much of his
experience has been in the automotive sector. A graduate in enterprise
management from Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University, he was trained at
automotive plants in the Soviet Union in the 1950s.
Mr Li was appointed vice-premier in March. According to Chinese insiders he
fought a successful rearguard action to stop the powerful Trade Ministry
(now called the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation -
Moftec) from being dismembered.
WU YI: 'A SMART, TOUGH BARGAINER'
THE 55-year-old head of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation (Moftec), Wu Yi may not be the highest-ranking female in the
hierarchy, but her 'trade minister' role gives her the most prominence.
Appointed minister in March this year, Ms Wu is regarded as one of the
younger breed of officials more likely to succeed. She first came to
international notice when negotiating trade agreements with the US. Her
opposite number, Carla Hills - the US special trade representative - said of
her negotiating partner that she was a 'smart and tough bargainer.'
Trained as a petroleum engineer in Beijing, Ms Wu spent 25 years in the
petroleum industry, most of them working in refineries. A Xinhua dispatch
listed her hobbies as tennis, golf, angling and reading - Tolstoy, Hugo and
Balzac. Ms Wu is unmarried.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (1): Brisk activity on
most fronts - Continuing recession is a dampening factor but a sharp upturn
in its fortunes is persuading the sector that it still has a useful role to
play in European finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND'S international financial services sector is enjoying an
unexpected and vigorous revival.
It is not just the fact that the country's big universal and private banks
are heading for bumper profits this year. Big banks and brokers everywhere
have benefitted from buoyant securities and money markets in recent months.
And it is not just the fact that the brisk inflow of foreign investment
capital is continuing, although the decision by the Swiss a year ago to
eschew closer ties with the European Union has undoubtedly helped refresh
the country's image as an independent safe haven.
More importantly, the financial scene has been energised by the recent
removal of stifling restrictions on importing skilled professionals, the
removal of some transaction taxes and improved education programmes.
A new sense of optimism is emerging that Finanzplatz Schweiz can after all
retain a useful and profitable role in European finance in the face of
increasingly stiff competition from London and other large centres.
While hundreds of clerical jobs are being lost as banks rationalise branch
networks and streamline back office operations, many new high value ones are
being created in the country's increasingly lively securities and
derivatives markets.
Indeed, activity is so brisk that the Zurich Stock Exchange, whose leaders
were in a state of high anxiety two years ago over the burgeoning trade in
big Swiss equities in London, is planning to open a seventh trading ring
next February, either for Swiss bonds or for foreign equities.
The derivatives markets, underdeveloped and flagging two years ago, have
been helped by improved education programmes in Swiss universities and a
more liberal government policy on granting work permits to highly skilled
people.
Last year, the authorities would allow Credit Suisse Financial Products to
bring in only two experts from its London base. Now, banks can bring in
whoever they need. 'Zurich is at the state of the art', says Mathis
Cabiallavetta, Union Bank of Switzerland's director responsible for
derivatives. 'We feel we can do anything here that could be done in New York
or London, and we are regaining ground.'
The one dampening element in this revival is that the Swiss economy is in a
dreary state, having suffered three years of mild recession and some
economists believe even a weak recovery is still some months away.
Thus, while securities and international financial business are booming, the
domestic commercial banking scene is in a dismal state. Three years of
slumping property markets, sluggish sales for industrial companies and
falling tourism activity have left banks with an unprecedented level of bad
debts.
The big universal banks can and will absorb record provisions for bad loans
this year without breaking stride, but the smaller cantonal and regional
banks are not so resilient and the trend to painful consolidation in these
sectors continues.
The number of regional banks, for example, has tumbled from 190 to 150 in
the past two years, and Mr Roland Boeschenstein, deputy director of the
Association of Regional Banks, says the process, which has slowed so far
this year, is likely to accelerate again when bank directors take stock at
year end.
Ironically, the biggest single consolidation seen to date, the takeover by
Credit Suisse of Swiss Volksbank early this year for SFr1.6bn, (Pounds 740m)
appears to have intensified the competitive struggle, at least for the time
being. At a stroke, this acquisition catapulted Credit Suisse from a weak
third position in most domestic markets to a neck and neck battle with UBS
for leadership.
Both UBS and Swiss Bank Corporation - the latter now an embarrassed number
three in most markets - have responded by stepping up their marketing
efforts, undoubtedly in the hope of picking off disaffected customers from
Credit Suisse or Volksbank. Others have had no choice but to follow. 'We
thought that after everyone took a bath in the mortgage market in the past
two years, a risk premium would appear this year, but no way,' says Mr Josef
Ackermann, the new chief executive of Credit Suisse.
One immediate consequence is that the big banks are, if anything,
accelerating their cost-cutting programmes, including eliminating jobs.
This has gone down badly with the general public. Many people cannot
understand how the banks can be so insensitive at a time when they are
making record profits and when unemployment is already soaring because of
lay-offs by hard pressed industrial companies. But the banks, if slightly
uncomfortable with this criticism, are unrepentant. 'It would be totally
wrong to finance the weak, domestic side from our trading profits from
elsewhere,' says Mr Ackermann. 'We would be heavily and rightly criticised
three years from now if we did not act.'
The private banks, too, are having a banner year. Most of these banks, which
specialise in managing private fortunes and, to an increasing extent,
institutional portfolios, are themselves private and do not publish their
financial results.
But Baer Holding, one of the largest, reported that its consolidated net
income more than doubled in the first half to SFr71m, with the volume of
clients' assets up 17 per cent to SFr38.7bn and trading income more than
doubling to SFr114m.
This sparkling performance has helped rebuild confidence that this sector,
the heart of the Swiss financial centre, can remain internationally
competitive. Estimates put the value of foreigners' funds in the country at
more than SFr1,000bn, a third of all offshore investment.
That may be a big drop in market share from the near monopoly that Swiss
bankers had early in the century in this high margin field, but 'the
miracle', says one private banker, 'is that we have held on to as much as we
have'.
'Our market share is an advantage,' says Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, chief
executive of the eponymous private banking group in Zurich. 'It enables us
to do things that someone starting from zero cannot do.' Mr Vontobel
published a book two years ago expressing concern about the future of the
Swiss financial centre, and in particular about the commitment of the big
universal banks to it. At the time, the big banks seemed to be moving many
activities - especially in the securities field - to London.
Today, he confesses to having become 'rather optimistic'. He points in
particular to the development of the national electronic stock exchange, due
to be completed late next year after two false starts in the late 1980s.
That development, with the removal of some transaction taxes and aggressive
cost-cutting, makes operating in Switzerland look much more attractive.
'The big banks realise that we are now able to be low cost producers. London
outmanoeuvred Switzerland and others in the 1980s, but it has its problems
now. I cannot comment on the outcome of the war, but the next battle could
go to the continent and to Switzerland,' Mr Vontobel says.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (1): Crucial stage of the reform programme -
China's economic reforms have brought huge changes and excited investors
around the world, but as Tony Walker reports from Beijing, the biggest tests
are yet to come
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHINA stands today at the threshold of a new and more testing phase in the
gargantuan task of bringing a creaking centrally planned economy into the
modern era.
The country's second revolution, launched 15 years ago by Mr Deng Xiaoping,
has wrought a remarkable transformation, both in improved living standards
and in relations with the outside world.
But challenges abound. Not least of these lie in deepening the reforms that
have brought China in little more than a decade from poverty and
backwardness to being viewed as the world's next economic superpower.
Such claims may be premature in a country whose vast population remains
predominantly peasant farmers. However, China's opening to the outside world
has kindled extraordinary enthusiasm among foreign investors.
In the first three quarters of this year Dollars 15bn was actually invested
by foreigners, and Dollars 83bn pledged in new contracts, according to
official figures. Utilised foreign investment now stands at Dollars 52bn
since China's opened its doors to foreign business in 1979.
For all these promising indications, China, burdened by an unwieldy and
impoverished state sector, is still far from achieving its goal of creating
a an orderly market economy as it moves to the next, more complex, stage of
its reforms.
These will be aimed at better regulating the raw entrepeneurial energies
that have been unleashed and - perhaps more important - reasserting central
control over increasingly unruly provinces where powerful local officials
have been carving out their own small empires.
Mr Deng could hardly have anticipated the monumental changes that have
overtaken China in the years since the third plenary session of the eleventh
Central Committee in December 1978, when the reform drive was launched. But
the words employed then have an historic resonance now. Casting off the
burden of Maoist dogma, the party demanded 'great growth in the productive
forces,' and observed prophetically that the modernisation of China would
prove to be a 'profound and extensive revolution.'
The 89-year-old and enfeebled Mr Deng has remained true to those sentiments,
arguing recently for a renewed commitment to growth even as his lieutenants
were seeking to rein in a runaway economy growing at 13 per cent this year
for the second year running.
THE veteran communist, whose exhortation last year to 'do it faster'
prompted an explosion of commercial endeavour, may go down in history as one
of the great advocates of accelerated economic activity to deal with
potential political problems. Chinese leaders need look no further than
across the Russian border to be reminded of the costs of economic
stagnation.
The reformers have already travelled further down the road of economic
change than even the greatest optimists might have predicted. However, the
next steps, including an overhaul of the banking system, far-reaching
reforms of the tax regime, further trade liberalisation, and creative
approaches to dealing with debt-ridden state enterprises, will require
persistence and nerve.
Among the most critical tasks is to arm institutions like the People's Bank,
the country's central bank, with the authority to assert reasonable control
over the economy, and thus help China avoid the wild fluctuations from
'boom' to 'bust' that have bedevilled the reform phase.
China also has to find ways to ensure that adequate funds reach priority
areas such as infrastructure. Serious bottlenecks in transport along with
inadequate power supplies are a drag on economic activity.
In some ways this second stage of China's 'second revolution' may prove more
difficult politically than the first. Reform of state enterprises is already
falling foul of powerful vested interests at the centre and in the
provinces.
Mr Zhu Rongji, the reforming vice premier in charge of the economy, was
obliged to ease credit restrictions in August and September after he had
sought in mid-year to impose stricter discipline on loss-making industries.
The episode raised doubts about the longer-term integrity of the
anti-inflation fight, and also emphasised just how difficult is the task of
enterprise reform.
Details of the new reform programme were endorsed at a meeting of the
Central Committee held in Beijing this month. This was the Third Plenum of
the Fourteenth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and
officials, with an eye to history, drew bold comparisons with the Third
Plenum of 1978.
They hoped that in the same way this latest event would act as a springboard
for reform. It was also aimed at bolstering the reforming consensus among
Party leaders lest any might be entertaining ideas of backsliding once Mr
Deng goes to 'meet Karl Marx' - his euphemism for death.
Although this gathering of the Central Committee - the Party's supreme
policy-making body between sessions of its National Congress - emphasised
collective leadership, factional differences were unlikely to be far below
the surface. Chinese leaders are now fully engaged in manoeuvring for power
in preparation for the post-Deng era.
The party can ill afford to be distracted, since it faces challenges on many
fronts. Not least of these is the widespread public perception that, bereft
of new ideas and new faces, it is less relevant. Attempts to shore it up by
engaging in campaigns like this year's anti-corruption drive are hardly
convincing. In the end, the party's survival will depend not on propaganda
but on the ability of China's rulers to continue delivering improved living
standards.
For the time being, political liberalisation has been ruled out, but
inevitably, the sheer pace of economic change is eroding the party's ability
to assert control as before. Faint voices can also be heard advocating
greater pluralism, although political dissent continues to be stamped upon.
Among China's supreme challenges is to deal with the widening income gap
between prosperous coastal regions and the impoverished hinterland, and also
between peasant farmers and urban dwellers. With surplus labour of 100m
among China's 900m peasants, there is no room for complacency.
Widespread peasant unrest this year - more than two hundred separate
incidents had been reported by mid-year - unnerved the leadership, and
prompted an urgent review of measures to improve the farmers' lot, including
prompt payment of money owed for produce acquired by the state. Older
generation Chinese leaders had not forgotten that it was the peasants who
were the footsoldiers of the revolution.
While domestic issues, including the succession struggle and attempts to
bring the economy under control without risking severe retrenchment, have
tended to preoccupy the leadership, other concerns have also intruded.
China's spirited but unsuccessful campaign to secure the 2000 Olympics for
Beijing would have reinforced among senior officials the realisation that
engagement with the outside world will never be easy. Human rights issues,
including memories of the Tiananmen square massacre of 1989, almost
certainly helped to torpedo the Chinese bid. But these officials would
understand that China's ambitions to be a world power, economically and
politically, by early next century mean that retreat into brooding isolation
has long ceased to be an option.
Trade issues, including China's application to re-join the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade and its efforts to preserve its Most Favoured Nation
trading status with the US, make it imperative that Beijing strike out even
more boldly into the international mainstream.
Among promising developments is the decision of Mr Jiang Zemin, China's
president, to attend an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation leaders'
conference this week in Seattle. President Clinton and Mr Jiang have much to
talk about, not least how to place Sino-US relations on a more businesslike
basis, and thus avoid the risk of rupture over issues ranging from human
rights to arms proliferation.
If the early 21st century is to be the era of the Pacific, there is hardly a
more important relationship than that between the remaining superpower and a
rapidly modernising state with more than one-fifth of the world's population
and economic ambitions to match.

FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further downgrades in Ladbroke, including one from joint broker SG Warburg,
continued the downward revision begun by Smith New Court, the other house
broker, on Tuesday.
Although most leisure analysts were hinting at problems at the group's DIY
business, Texas Home Care, there was consternation over the continuing
downward pressure on the shares. This was underlined by another good
performance from Forte, the hotel group's shares opening up their largest
ever gap over Ladbroke, the two normally running fairly in parallel.
In a strong sector, Ladbroke shed a penny to 156p, the lowest level for more
than a year, in big turnover of 12m. Forte climbed 5 to 239p in volume
approaching 6m. The stock has been advancing in recent sessions as talk of
stronger London bookings have given hopes of improvements in room rates -
news that would normally impact favourably on Ladbroke.
Analysts are expecting further details on Forte trading on a visit to France
today to inspect the group's motorway service station business.
A health scare in the Netherlands sent Unigate shares down 12 to 355p. Dutch
food group Verenigde Bedrivjen Nutricia, in which Unigate holds a 32.6 per
cent stake, announced that it was recalling a consignment of baby food that
may possibly be contaminated. As Unigate shares began to fall, hectic
trading in Amsterdam led to Nutricia being temporarily suspended.
One UK food analyst said the recall could cost Unigate more than Pounds 1m.
Last year, Nutricia contributed 15 per cent of Unigate's Pounds 108m
profits.
United Biscuits gained 8 at 337p, with Smith New Court rumoured to be a
buyer. Dalgety added 9 at 448p on news that it is in discussions to buy BP's
pet food business.
Food retailers were the best performing sector, rallying from their recent
bout of weakness. J. Sainsbury jumped 14 to 379p and Tesco 8 1/2 to 195 1/2
p.
Property shares were again strong, lifted by results and a positive
statement from Land Securities, the UK's biggest property group. Its shares,
strong following a James Capel buy note earlier in the week, added 6 at
734p. MEPC advanced 12 to 510p, British Land 8 to 418p and Brixton Estates 5
to 229p.
A reversal of recent switching out of National Westminster and into Barclays
saw the former race up 12 to 562p on 4.4m traded. Barclays edged up a penny
to 585p on 3.1m.
A single deal in TSB, where one UK house bought and sold a block of just
over 2m shares, left the stock 4 higher at 224p with overall turnover
reaching a hefty 9.1m.
Pharmaceutical issues benefited in early trade from a strong performance by
the sector in New York on Tuesday night. Some gains were trimmed in the
afternoon as Wall Street opened easier, but Zeneca gained 10 at 787p and
Glaxo 9 at 658p. SmithKline Beecham rose 7 1/2 to 412p as concern over a
possible difference of opinion between Mr Bob Bauman, the chief executive,
and Mr Jan Leschly, the chief executive designate and current head of the
pharmaceuticals division, faded away.
Commercial Union added 10 at 606p following the well received third-quarter
figures, while General Accident, badly affected by below par results on
Tuesday, rallied 13 to 671p.
Increased prospects for a cut in UK interest rates after the latest economic
data on inflation and retail sales led to a strong burst of buying in high
yielding utilities stocks. In the regional electricity issues, South Wales
jumped 17 to 657p while Yorkshire rose 10 to 622p. Northern Ireland
Electricity climbed 6 1/2 to 199 1/2 p.
The FT-SE 100's four water stocks made excellent progress. Anglian rose 9 to
515p and Severn Trent 8 to 525p.
The oil and gas sector's two cold weather stocks, British Gas and Calor
Group, were the brightest performers in a generally strong sector. Gas moved
up 7 to 328 1/2 p following a buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson, who
said the recent fall in the shares was overdone. The broker added that Gas
now yields more than three-month money and that given Kleinwort's
expectation of rising production profits and further cost cutting the stock
is attractive.
Gas reports third-quarter results today. Kleinwort, along with most leading
brokers, forecasts a loss of Pounds 200m on a historic cost basis.
Calor Group, always boosted by cold snaps in UK weather, advanced 11 to
293p.
PowerGen's purchase of a 3.9 per cent stake in the Liverpool Bay oil and gas
development from Monument Oil &amp; Gas continued to drive Monument shares, a
shade higher at 56p, but also produced another firm showing by Lasmo - also
heavily involved in Liverpool Bay - which hardened to 134p. Enterprise made
good progress, closing 9 ahead at 462p.
Recent encouraging drilling news helped Pict Petroleum add a further 4 at
158p.

FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strength in P&amp;O
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that P&amp;O was among a consortium intending to raise container rates
on its eastern shipping routes helped the shares rise sharply in useful
turnover of 4m. They closed 23 ahead at 565p.
According to the reports, the consortium is to push up rates by 20 per cent,
which would have a big impact on P&amp;O's balance sheet. Last year, the group
made Pounds 36m profits from its container and bulk shipping interests.
However, transport analysts tended to be sceptical, pointing out that the
consortium had made attempts before to harden rates. 'None of the price
rises ever stick,' commented one specialist.

FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Courtaulds shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savaging of the chemicals sector continued yesterday as disappointing
figures from Courtaulds, one of the sector leaders, sent the company's
shares reeling on their highest turnover for more than 4 1/2 years. The
stock dropped 44 to 432p, a level last seen more than a year ago, with 9.8m
shares traded.
The fall followed a sharp rerating for BOC the previous day.
The headline interim profits from Courtaulds were up at Pounds 96.1m from
Pounds 88.8m previously and market forecasts of around Pounds 87m. But the
pre-tax figure contained an exceptional charge of Pounds 24.4m and once that
was deducted the numbers were looking depressing. Furthermore, Courtaulds
warned that conditions would continue to be difficult during the second
half, traditionally the best period for the group.
Analysts brought their forecasts for the full year down to around Pounds
150m from estimates of Pounds 180m to Pounds 190m previously. Mr David
Ingles of agency broker James Capel maintained faith in the company, but
said he saw the shares slipping to around 400p before they were worth buying
again.
Mr Martin Evans of securities house Hoare Govett said: 'Courtaulds is dead
money for the time being - it is too late to sell and too early to buy.'
BOC recovered 5 to 601p, with Hoare maintaining its buy stance.

FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: HK stocks under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCKS WITH heavy exposure to Hong Kong suffered extremely heavy selling in
a day of frantic activity generated by a significant shift in the trading
position of Morgan Stanley, one of the leading US investment banks.
Morgan Stanley, which was instrumental in driving Hong Kong stocks higher in
the summer, yesterday cut its recommended international equity exposure to
Hong Kong from 7 per cent to 5 per cent.
Telecoms group Cable and Wireless, which generates much of its income from
Hong Kong, was badly affected, the shares hitting a low of 470p before
settling 17 off at 473p on turnover of 5.4m. C&amp;W's interim figures are due
this morning, with profits forecast to come in around Pounds 500m, against
Pounds 378m.
Sentiment was further weakened by persistent and long running stories that
the Chinese government's investment agency CITIC is poised to make a large
placing in Hong Kong Telecom. C&amp;W has a 57 per cent stake in HK Telecom,
while CITIC holds a 17 per cent shareholding.
HSBC was also mauled, the shares sliding 18 to 734p on exceptionally heavy
turnover of 12m. 'There was a flood of selling and it looks as if there is
more to come,' said one trader.

FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC data from the UK which suggested that any inflation worries were
overdone sent the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index soaring yesterday
as the market became convinced that a further reduction in interest rates
was needed, writes Peter John.
Derivatives began wearily, digesting a very large trade in Footsie options
on Wednesday. Then, the mid-morning news on the RPI sent December sharply
forward, as hopes rose of an imminent rate cut. Sales data, pointing to a
sluggish recovery, also added impetus.
The optimism gave a boost to gilts and short sterling and pushed the FT-SE
futures contract for December to a high of 3,142 shortly afterwards, a
premium of 16 to the cash market compared with an estimated fair value of
some 6 points above cash.
One dealer said: 'After the announcement everyone was buying. And with the
NAFTA vote, a Bundesbank meeting and the Budget all just ahead of us,
volatility is not going to come down.'
Implied volatility, the indicator of market uncertainty priced into options,
was said to be hovering around 16 per cent for the December Footsie series.
Footsie options turnover represented over 19,000 of the total option volume
of nearly 39,000 lots. December futures hit 3,128.5 by the official close
and 3,133 in after hours dealing suggesting that the market might begin
strongly today.

FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation news boosts base rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTEDLY large fall in domestic inflation in October gave a
significant boost to base rate optimism in the UK stock market yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 Index moved strongly ahead, brushing off unimpressive UK
retail sales progress, leaving the market to face its next hurdle this
morning when it must respond to the outcome of the Nafta vote in the US
Congress.
A nervous start on Wall Street left London to close off the day's best
levels, with the FT-SE Index finally 22.5 up at 3,120. Reports that a
leading US investment bank had sharply downgraded its ratings on the Hong
Kong stock market also upset London.
The news that domestic inflation had fallen to an annualised 1.4 per cent in
October, from 1.8 per cent in the previous month, contrasted with market
expectations that the rate would be either unchanged or even slightly
higher.
A base rate cut of at least half a point - several analysts are going for a
full point reduction - moved right to the top of the stock market agenda
following the inflation announcement. Led by a strong premium on the
December stock index future, shares jumped sharply and took the Footsie to a
day's high of 3,126.1. The peak was held until Wall Street opened up sharply
lower before steadying during UK trading hours.
Interest rate optimism had already been encouraged by a rate cut in Belgium,
although with markets closed yesterday in Germany, London analysts were
taking a cautious view of the chances of a move by the Bundesbank at today's
policy meeting.
The market's renewed optimism was reflected in further recovery in the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index which gained 15.7 point to 3,436.7.
Seaq volume, again boosted by a large trading programme, remained high at
662.2m shares compared with 654.8m on Tuesday, when retail business returned
to more average levels with a value total of Pounds 1.32bn.
The focus turned towards the property shares, which have much to gain from
further cuts in domestic interest rates, and to the bank stocks which will
see their bad debts reduced as interest rate pressures recede.
But some store shares lagged behind the market, restrained by disappointment
with the very modest 0.1 per cenmt gain in retail sales in October - sector
analysts had looked for a rise of at least 0.3 per cent.
The poor retail sales number cast a shadow elsewhere in the market, since it
suggests that economic recovery is still lagging. Company trading statements
continued to unsettle the stock market yesterday, with Courtaulds joining
the list of leading British companies to receive rough treatment on the
stock market this week.
Some traders warned that the sharp rise in share prices at mid-session had
brought out significant selling orders from the bears which undoubtedly
continue to roam through the market.
The opening of equity trading this morning could well present traders with a
difficult picture as they struggle to respond to factors in other global
centres. Wall Street's performance in the wake of the NAFTA debate will
dominate early trading in London but dealers will also be watching the Hong
Kong market with some apprehension.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking erodes gains in
US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
INVESTORS took some profits yesterday, after Tuesday's record-breaking
gains, to leave US share prices slightly lower at the close, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average receded 6.42 to 3,704.35 and the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.93 to 464.81. The American SE
composite finished 2.19 off at 472.54 and the Nasdaq composite, hardest hit
by selling, fell 9.33 to 762.36. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted
to 319.6m shares.
The markets opened weaker, with the Dow posting a double-digit loss in the
first hour of trading as investors took the opportunity to book some of the
profits earned on the previous day, when the Dow broke through 3,700 for the
first time in its history.
The main attention of dealers and investors remained the Nafta vote in the
US congress, which was scheduled for late last night.
Since the weekend, hopes have been rising that the House of Representatives
would vote to approve the trade pact, but there was enough uncertainty
surrounding the final outcome to persuade many participants in the markets
to stay on the sidelines until after the result was known.
Bond prices were higher in early trading, which provided some support for
stocks, but the Treasury gave back most of its gains soon after midday. In
early afternoon trading the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond was little
changed at 6.15 per cent.
Philip Morris fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 and RJR Nabisco held firm
at Dollars 6 1/2 in heavy trading after broking house Merrill Lynch lowered
its ratings on the two stocks from 'neutral' to 'below average'. American
Brands, the other main cigarette producer, dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 34
1/8 in sympathy.
An upgrade from Merrill Lynch, however, lifted IBM, which added Dollars  7/8
at Dollars 53 5/8 on 4.4m shares dealt as the broking house's computer
industry analyst rated the stock a 'long-term buy'.
Hong Kong Telecom ADRs dropped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 57 1/8 as investors
reacted to news that Morgan Stanley had recommended to clients that they
reduce their weighting in Hong Kong stocks in the wake of the big gains that
the colony's market has recorded over the past few months.
General Motors remained strong following the recent positive auto sales data
and a forecast from the group's chief executive of a return to profits next
year. The stock climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO lost further ground in busy trading amid nervousness ahead of last
night's Nafta vote in the US and continued concern over the Canadian
government's deficit.
The TSE 300 index finished 20.7 lower at 4,236.5 and declines led rises by
477 to 334. Volume came to 69.5m shares valued at CDollars 722.7m.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Austerity package helps
Brussels to record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of themes attracted attention yesterday in the absence of
Frankfurt, which was closed for a holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
BRUSSELS finished at a record high following a cut in two leading interest
rates and the announcement by the government of its new austerity measures.
The Bel-20 index added 21.84 to 1,397.76, but was off an intraday high of
1,406.42.
Turnover was some BFr4bn.
The government's plans included measures to control social spending, slow
increases in wages and control unemployment. Among the day's performers,
Petrofina rose BFr130 or 1.3 per cent to BFr9,880 and Solvay BFr150 or 1 per
cent to BFr14,525.
AMSTERDAM fell back towards the close, with the CBS Tendency index closing
down 0.6 at 137.0, after a day's high of 138.8.
KLM was again among the most actives, slipping Fl 1.70 to Fl 38.60 on
continued uncertainty about the Alcazar talks, and reports of further
rumours concerning the choice of a US partner by the four European airlines
involved.
Nedlloyd, the shipping group, hit a new year's high during the session on
unconfirmed reports that Far Eastern container tariffs were to be increased.
The shares finally settled up Fl 1.40 at Fl 51.30.
Polygram also hit a new intraday high for the year, Fl 77.10, as more buyers
came into the market, partly as a result of the developing interest
multimedia. The shares finally closed up Fl 1.20 at Fl 76.30.
Elsewhere, Nutricia, the food group, saw its price tumble 7 per cent after
it said that it was recalling one of its products. The shares closed down Fl
11.00 at Fl 136.80.
PARIS was lifted by hopes of an interest rate cut, and by a stronger bond
market. The CAC-40 index put on 32.14 or 1.5 per cent to 2,147.99.
More turnover figures were released to whet the appetites of investors,
while Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez added FFr12 to FFr538, helped by news that it
had won a FFr400m US contract.
Three new additions made their entry to the index yesterday, BNP, CLF and
Promodes, showing respective losses of FFr4.80 to FFr294.20, FFr6 to FFr479
and FFr31 to FFr1,169. These companies replace Cap Gemini, Chargeurs and
Club Med, and thereby increase the market's total capitalisation by some 5
per cent.
MADRID was lifted by Wall Street and interest rate hopes, but its sheer
buoyancy brought profit-taking and the general index closed off its best at
306.93, up 4.00, or 1.3 per cent.
Turnover rose from Pta29.4bn to Pta43.2bn. The best gains came in electrical
utilities, where Endesa gained Pta170 to Pta6,530 and Iberdrola, the most
active stock of the day, rose Pta18 to Pta879. In banks, Argentaria closed
Pta150 lower at Pta6,260 after setting the price for its second share offer
overnight at Pta6,050 per share.
MILAN rallied late to finish higher on the first day of the new account, and
the Comit index adding 3.23 at 537.36.
Banks were firm, helped by a short selling ban on stock in Credito Italiano
ahead of the announcement of the privatisation price on December 4. Credito
added L103 to L2,460, for a cumulative two-day rise of 9.2 per cent, while
BCI was L227 ahead at L4,378.
Telecoms picked up after Tuesday's pressure. Sip added L111 to L3,121 and
Stet was L73 higher at L3,644. Sme, the retailer rose L116 to L3,755, after
a day's high of L3,990, on speculation about an offer for divisions which
have not yet been privatised.
Mediobanca, trading ex-dividend and launching its rights issue, rose L153 to
L11,519. Ifil, also launching its capital increase, rose L21 to L4,555.
ZURICH was steady in moderate volume, awaiting the outcome of last night's
Nafta vote. The SMI index eased 1.2 to 2,711.1.
UBS bearers, up SFr11 at SFr1,298, were helped by the bank's optimistic
statement on the outlook for this year and 1994. A SFr17 rise to SFr1,409 in
Zurich Insurance registered shares was attributed to a new option issue and
expiry of an old one.
Foreign demand for cyclicals took BBC Brown Boveri up SFr11 to a year's high
of SFr1,029. Alusuisse registered shares rose SFr9 at SFr523.
STOCKHOLM's advance was helped by a rally in Electrolux, the B shares
gaining SKr18 at SKr305 on a 30 per cent rise in nine month profits. The
Affarsvarlden general index rose 11.2 to 1,399.7. OSLO rose in the wake of
gains in domestic bonds, and a rise in the dollar which was good for
exporters and oil stocks. The all share index rose 8.53 to 608.55.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Mexico waits for news from Capitol Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attention has remained firmly fixed throughout the week on the political
machinations which have been taking place on Capitol Hill, Washington.
However, while it was by no means clear earlier yesterday that President
Bill Clinton and his administration had gathered enough votes to ensure that
the North American Free Trade Agreement would win US congress approval, the
Mexican equity market has behaved as though last night's vote was a
formality.
On five successive days Mexico's IPC index has reached record levels. But
data supplied by the IFC tells a slightly different story: the country
recorded a modest gain in dollar terms on the week, its improvement on the
year to date standing at just above 16 per cent, similarly restrained in
comparison to gains elsewhere in the region and the world.
Pakistan, for instance, saw the week's best performance as investors
responded to an improved political climate, while Thailand also moved on.
China and Zimbabwe have been added to the IFC data from this week.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hang Seng dives in
London as New Zealand recovers

<TEXT>
INVESTORS failed to respond to Tuesday's approval of the political reform
bill by a lower house parliamentary committee, and share prices moved lower
in thin trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 134.41 at 18,108.71 on arbitrage linked selling
after moving between 18,030.80 and 18,344.23. Volume was 216.5m shares,
against 264m. Falls led rises by 624 to 320, with 195 issues unchanged, and
the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 8.52 to 1,540.82. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.18 to 1,245.01.
Traders said fears of a plunge in share prices had eased to some extent: the
Topix index has not fallen far below the 1,530 level, currently regarded as
a technical support point. Many investors are now focusing on whether Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, will announce any economic support
measures during his meeting with President Bill Clinton on Friday.
However, Mr Alex Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, warned that
technical factors were still dampening sentiment, and said the Topix could
fall by another 10 per cent: 'Although underlying political fundamentals may
improve, shares still face pressure from arbitrage selling.'
Analysts reckon that arbitrageurs still hold up to 10 per cent of
outstanding shares of some stocks in arbitrage positions, which will need to
be sold in order to switch from the Nikkei 225 to the new 300.
Among the big blue chips, East Japan Railway closed unchanged at Y458,000,
while Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y10,000 to Y781,000.
Profit-taking depressed bank shares, which rose on index-linked buying on
Tuesday. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y3,280, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
Y20 to Y2,260 and Sumitomo Bank Y20 to Y2,340.
Large-capital issues were lower. Nippon Steel, the day's most active stock,
slipped Y7 to Y327 and NKK Y2 to Y250.
Daikyo closed Y70 down at Y876 on further selling following an announcement
earlier this week that it would post its first pre-tax loss ever for the
full year to March.
Daishowa Paper dropped Y49 to Y991. The company's share price has been
suffering since Mr Ryoei Saito, its ex-chairman, was arrested, allegedly for
bribing politicians.
Autobacs Seven, an autoparts maker, was the day's best performer, rising
Y300 to Y13,400 due to the popularity of its car navigation systems.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 154.42 to 20,290.18 in volume of 15.2m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, weakened Y90 to Y7,170.
Roundup
WALL Street's overnight advances were lost on the Hong Kong market.
HONG KONG took profits in its own time, the Hang Seng index falling by
176.67, or 1.8 per cent, to 9,506.98. Turnover contracted from HKDollars
9.08bn to HKDollars 8.04bn and professionals said that selling pressure was
not heavy.
However, London heard that Mr Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley strategist,
had moderated his support for Hong Kong, and some said that the colony's
weighting in the broker's global model portfolio had been cut by a couple of
percentage points from its recent 7.2 per cent. The indicated Hang Seng fell
a further 322, or 3.4 per cent, to 9,185, and there were fears of worse to
come when the domestic market opens today.
NEW ZEALAND recovered as the National party government gained one seat to
give it 50 seats in New Zealand's 99-seat parliament. The NZSE-40 index
finished 95.7, or 4.8 per cent, higher at 2,074.4.
Mr John Rattray at Ord Minnett said demand came from both foreign and
domestic clients. Turnover was high at NZDollars 90m, but not excessive.
Among market leaders, Telecom, which represents 23 per cent of the index,
closed 24 cents stronger at NZDollars 4.17 in good volume; and Brierley,
which dropped plans for a controversial executive share scheme at its annual
meeting on Tuesday, firmed 3 cents to NZDollars 1.19.
AUSTRALIA bid strongly for banks as the All Ordinaries index moved forward
20.5 to 2,104.3.
The market reassessed Tuesday's profits from ANZ and, although net earnings
of ADollars 246.5m were at the lower end of expectations, the shares
eventually closed 29 cents, or 6.5 per cent, up at a year's high of ADollars
4.73.
SINGAPORE ended off the day's highs, but with the Straits Times Industrial
index still 18.50 better at 2,096.51.
SEOUL saw individual investors pile in following institutional buying and
the composite index closed 7.52 higher at 810.17. The financials index,
however, declined 10.04 to 988.36 as investors avoided its highly priced
constituents.
JAKARTA attained another 1993 high as the JKSE index rose 9.99 to 538.18.
Here, banking stocks led the way, Bank Danamon putting on Rp500 at Rp5,400
and Bank Duta Rp550 at Rp5,750.
TAIWAN came off intra-session highs on a round of late profit-taking. The
weighted index lost a net 5.66 at 4,306.91, after reaching 4,345.86.
KUALA LUMPUR picked up slightly in uncertain trading, the composite index
rising by 6.51 to 957.81.
Rothmans firmed MDollars 1.70 to MDollars 18.80 on approval of a
restructuring plan from the Government and Securities Commission.
KARACHI fell back as investors took profits after the market's recent record
run. The KSE index was finally down 21.49 at 1,760.51, after a day's low of
1,746.27.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: D-Mark remains weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark continued to weaken against most European currencies, although it
managed to recoup some of its losses in late trade yesterday, writes Conner
Middelmann.
The German currency's slippage was triggered by Tuesday's 9 basis-point drop
in the Bundesbank's rate for two-week securities repurchase agreements which
spurred talk that the Bundesbank has embarked on a more aggressive easing
course.
'With the recession deepening, M3 headed back towards the target range and
inflation set to fall below 3 per cent in the first half of next year, the
economic fundamentals point to an acceleration of the easing course,' said
Mr Michael Burke, an economist with Citibank in London.
Still, most analysts said they did not expect to see a cut in Germany's
leading discount and Lombard rates at today's meeting of the Bundesbank's
central bank council.
The Belgian and French francs posted significant gains against the D-Mark,
the Belgian currency receiving an extra boost from a sharp cut in key money
market rates that was seen as injecting new life into the flagging Belgian
economy. The Belgian franc firmed to around its previous European exchange
rate mechanism floor of BFr21.0950 per D-Mark. It hit an intraday high of
BFr21.090 but closed slightly lower at BFr21.25.
The French franc reached its highest level against the D-Mark since the
summer ERM crisis, hitting FFr3.4560, compared to its floor of FFr3.4305
before the ERM trading bands were widened on August 2. In late London
trading it was quoted at FFr3.4615.
In spite of the franc's strength against the D-Mark, 'we did not see any
intervention by the Bank of France on the cross,' a Paris-based analyst
reported. The French central bank could have profited from the franc's
strength to replenish its foreign currency reserves, which were depleted
during the last ERM crisis and are slowly being rebuilt.
However, 'they may have done something via the US dollar,' he suggested.
This could involve selling French francs for dollars and then selling those
dollars for D-Marks - a less visible way for a central bank to operate in
the foreign exchange market.
Sterling largely shrugged off rate cut speculation following lower than
expected retail price and sales data, and shed only a pfennig to DM2.5175.
Against the US dollar, it finished at Dollars 1.4770, compared with Dollars
1.4855 at Tuesday's close.
The dollar rose early in London on hopes that the North American Free Trade
Agreement would be approved by the US congress, and received an additional
boost from strong housing starts data. However, it slipped on late
profit-taking to finish at DM1.7050, only modestly above Tuesday's DM1.7020.
Against the yen, it ended at Y107, up from a previous Y106.55. In New York
the dollar closed at DM1.7030 and Y106.87.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Belgium cuts rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER Tuesday's cuts in German and Dutch money market rates, Belgium lowered
its key interest rates sharply yesterday, taking advantage of the strength
of its currency, writes Conner Middelmann.
It reduced its central rate to 8.30 per cent from 9.40 per cent and its
discount rate to 5.50 per cent from 6.00 per cent. This followed a
government agreement on a programme of austerity measures designed to stem
the growing deficit in the social security budget, address unemployment and
boost companies' competitiveness.
The recent rash of European rate cuts spurred talk that France will be the
next to ease, with some dealers calling for a reduction in the 6.45 per cent
intervention rate at today's round of securities repurchase agreements. The
December PIBOR futures contract rose 10 basis points to 93.67.
However, many expect France to continue taking its time over rate
reductions. 'The Bank of France will let the overnight rate slide along with
the German repo rate, and will first try to reduce the gap between the
intervention rate and the overnight rate,' said Mr Dominique Barbet,
econ-omist with Paribas Capital Markets in Paris. The overnight rate traded
around 6 13/16 per cent yesterday and he said it could slip to 6 3/4 per
cent today.
'The French economy needs lower rates, but as long as the authorities want
the franc to stay firm, they will have to maintain a certain spread in
French short-term rates over Germany's,' he added. The French intervention
rate is 70 basis points above Germany's discount rate.
The Bundesbank's central bank council meets today, but according to a
Reuters poll, 18 out of 20 European economists surveyed did not expect the
German central bank to cut rates today.
In the UK money market, the short sterling contract jumped on lower than
expected retail sales and inflation data which fuelled speculation of
significant base rate cuts in, or around the time of, the November 30
Budget.
'Many people are now looking for a total one-point base rate cut before the
end of the year,' said a senior money dealer. The short sterling future rose
0.16 point to 94.63.
After announcing an initial shortage of Pounds 1bn, the Bank purchased a
total of Pounds 293m in its market operations and provided late assistance
of around Pounds 350m.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (20):
Playground for visitors - Tourism
</HEADLINE>

ONE industry where South Africa seems certain to develop a competitive
advantage is leisure. Even under sanctions and with high levels of violence
and political uncertainty, it is the continent's second largest tourist
industry, accounting for almost 20 per cent of regional tourist income, more
than double Kenya's 9.6 per cent. In 1991, Morocco headed the African league
with 24 per cent of tourist revenue.
Globally, South Africa is a tiny player accounting for less than 0.25 per
cent of the international tourist business. Excluding African visitors,
there were some 560,000 tourist arrivals last year, the bulk of whom (70 per
cent) came from Europe, with the UK as the main market (26 per cent)
followed by Germany (16 per cent) and the US (9 per cent). With a growth
rate of 18,5 per cent in 1992, the Asian market - especially Taiwan (4 per
cent) and Japan (1.5 per cent) - is becoming increasingly important. Growth
accelerated in the first seven months of 1993 with the number of arrivals
increasing 12.7 per cent.
Overseas tourists spend an estimated R4,800 (Dollars 1,750) per visit
(excluding air fares to and from the country) and the industry earned
R2.75bn (Dollars 1bn) in foreign exchange in 1991, making it the fourth
largest foreign currency earner, after manufactures, gold and other
minerals.
Aside from the lifting of sanctions, the main factor making for tourism
growth at a time of global recession has been the liberalisation of the
aviation policies and the expansion of air traffic capacity. In the past
three years, 18 new airlines have started services to South Africa.
A more market-driven aviation policy has resulted in more competitive market
prices and the opening up of the charter market. The number of tour
operators has more than doubled, while government has become more active in
tourism promotion allowing accelerated tax write-offs for the accommodation
industry, a R600m (Dollars 180m) loan programme for Eco-tourism projects and
support schemes for small entrepreneurs.
On the debit side, tourist perceptions of personal safety in South Africa
have deteriorated markedly. In January 1990, some 70 per cent of overseas
visitors rated the safety factor in South Africa good but by January this
year, this rating had fallen below 30 per cent.
The government's target is to more than treble the number of arrivals by
2000 reaching 1.75m visitors earning some R24bn in foreign exchange. With
hotels operating at below 50 per cent of bed-night capacity, there is
considerable scope for expansion without significant new investment in
hotels.
Nevertheless, three leading global players - Hilton, Hyatt and Sheraton -
have expressed interest in opening up in South Africa.

Continental launchpad - A look at the industrial potential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S return to legitimacy coincides with the growing
regionalisation of foreign investment decisions. As multinationals
rationalise and integrate their foreign operations to secure scale economies
and improve co-ordination, so they are looking more carefully at regional,
rather than national, markets. Invariably this means consolidating
operations at one, or a few, locations to serve a regional market,
especially where trade flows are being liberalised.
By any yardstick, South Africa is the logical launchpad for penetrating the
sub-Saharan market, worth some Dollars 250bn, of which South Africa itself
accounts for more than Dollars 100bn or more than 40 per cent. The South
African market, although small by global standards, is the only African
market large enough to justify a broad range of manufacturing activities.
The next largest is Nigeria, worth Dollars 34bn and set to shrink in foreign
currency with devaluation next year.
While few companies have yet rationalised their operations with the
establishment of regional headquarters in South Africa, this is likely to be
a pervasive trend, once the violence subsides and business confidence
returns. BP is one company that will establish a regional headquarters in
South Africa, while a number of manufacturing companies, such as Nissan, are
known to be actively considering developing their South African factories as
the platform for exporting into the region.
The reasons are obvious; South Africa has the best infrastructure on the
continent with first-world service industry back-up in banking, insurance,
capital markets, hotels and information technology. It has spare capacity in
energy and transport, a vast pool of unskilled labour, a rich natural
resource base, a better skills endowment that anywhere else in Africa -
though way behind Asian levels - and a large enough domestic market to
justify most industrial investments. By African standards the environment is
investor-friendly and there are few African locations that can match South
Africa's quality of life.
The disadvantages are essentially socio-political - political and criminal
violence, allied with the worry that, even if they are papered over in
1993/4, ethnic tensions will re-surface later in the decade. Labour
relations are also a possible reason for steering clear of South Africa
given the high cost of labour relative to that elsewhere in the region and
far higher levels of unionisation. Against that is the relentless decline in
the relative importance of direct labour costs in most business activities,
with raw materials, capital and transport costs assuming far greater
significance. These costs are likely to be lower in South Africa than
elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.
International business is likely to adopt one of two main strategies for
serving the African market in the 1990s:
It will export into the region from offshore using agents, licensees or
franchisees as a vehicle; or
It will use South Africa as the mode of entry, manufacturing or assembling
in the country primarily for domestic consumption while exporting residual
amounts to the region.
Clearly, neither strategy will work if African countries maintain tariffs
and other barriers against imports. But with the march of economic reform,
regional economies are being liberalised, thereby encouraging foreign firms
to sell into the usually-tiny markets from outside rather than setting up
shop behind high tariff barriers as was the pattern in the 1950s and 60s.
There are two polar views of how trade and investment flows will evolve in
Southern Africa. On the one hand, the locomotive theory holds that South
Africa will become the region's economic dynamo that helps turn the
sub-Saharan economy around.
The alternative school holds that South Africa, certainly for the immediate
future, has more than enough on its domestic plate to make much of a
contribution to the regional turnround. Indeed, there are even those in
Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe who predict that relocation will, in
fact, go the other way, with firms emigrating from South Africa to escape
political violence and industrial relations unrest, and exploiting more
tranquil labour market conditions - and lower costs - elsewhere.
This is an unlikely scenario given the growing tendency for manufacturers to
locate as close as possible to their main markets. The more likely scenario
is one in which South Africa becomes the platform for exploiting market
opportunities in east, central and southern Africa. South African business
is well placed, too, to participate in rebuilding the region's physical
infrastructure, on which massive amounts - much of it aid money - will be
spent. South Africa aside, there is little indigenous capacity in the region
to handle major physical infrastructural projects.
South African businesses will have the edge, too, in some African
privatisation programmes - their investment banks and mining houses are
already active in countries such as Mozambique and Zambia where
privatisation moves are gathering speed.
African leaders will be perturbed less at the prospect of growing South
African participation in their economies, than with the potentially one-way
traffic that this implies. Few countries in the region have much to sell to
Pretoria other than raw materials (oil, copper, coffee, cocoa, tobacco) and
tourism. The saving grace - though this will depend on close links with
multinationals, often with regional headquarters in South Africa - could be
the development of sub-contracting and components manufacture for final
assembly in the south. This would turn launchpad South Africa into a
positive sum game in which there are winners all round.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (19): In search
of recognition - Philip Gawith discusses foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

AFTER the isolation years, South Africa's business community is enjoying
being back in the fold, hoping the world will want to lend to the country,
trade with it and, above all, invest in it. First prize would be a headline
investment of the 'IBM to build Dollars 1bn plant' variety.
Clearly the optimists are going to be disappointed, for the time being.
First, the world has changed. Before isolation, the eastern bloc and China
were no-go zones and the Pacific Dragons had barely entered the business
lexicon. Nor had South America embarked upon widespread financial
liberalisation. Change in all of these areas has opened a host of markets
competing for the multinational investment dollar.
Second, save for special cases - such as investment flowing from the recent
issue of cellular telephone licences - it is unlikely any significant
investments will be made until it is clear South Africa has achieved a
stable transition.
This is not, however, to say that nothing is happening. On the contrary,
there is a ferment of activity. Examples include: Alfa Romeo is again
selling cars in South Africa and Volvo will soon be doing so: IBM is
probably going to return through an investment in a local distributor;
Hoechst has expanded its operation by paying R70m for a polyester fibre
plant; Foodcorp has signed a deal with Pillsbury; Lufthansa has added an
extra flight and is flying on a daily basis; ferrochrome producers Samancor
and Nippon Denko have formed a joint venture, while Mitsui will distribute
some of Sasol's chemicals in Japan and Korea. The list goes on.
So, while the headline investment may be absent, the incremental
internationalisation of the corporate scene is proceeding apace. The main
trend to be observed is as obvious as it is understandable: companies want
to establish a presence, but without any significant equity commitment. As
Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented recently in
Washington: 'They're offering us their services, not their money.' The deals
one is hearing about are thus in distribution, licensing and franchising.
At issue here is not only the question of who will come, but how they will
do it. Any future government is sure to have a very strong commitment to
black economic advancement, a process that many US investors, in particular,
are likely to want to support. Given the underdeveloped state of black
business in South Africa, franchising (sectors with strong potential include
hair care salons and fast food outlets) and joint ventures are the most
logical routes of assisting this process. There are, for example, many small
black business contractors, but often they will lack access to credit to buy
materials and have non-existent financial or administative systems.
The process of finding partners, however, will not be easy. Despite years of
activity in this field, the US embassy is still not in a position to offer a
list of potential partners.
According to the Reserve Bank, at the end of 1992 total investment in South
Africa by foreign residents amounted to approximately Dollars 30bn. This
included repayable debt of about Dollars 18bn and about Dollars 12bn of
South African corporate equities and bonds issued by government and other
public and private sector borrowers. About half of the latter sum is
'direct' investment - in South African subsidiaries and branches of foreign
companies - with the other half being invested by non-residents in rand
denominated paper ('portfolio' investment).
During the sanctions years, South Africa experienced a net outflow of
foreign investment from the country as many companies, especially US ones,
disinvested. The stock of US fixed investment in South Africa shrunk as a
result by a third, to roughly Dollars 1bn and 110 companies. Although some
UK and European companies also left, most stayed and already have a presence
in South Africa. From an investment perspective, the Japanese and Asian
presence is negligible.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, speculates that the order in which foreign
countries will 'carry the baton' when they return might be: US, Japan, UK
and other Europeans. How will they be received by a future government? The
key policy document in this regard is the 'Agreed framework in relation to
foreign direct investment', a product of the National Economic Forum, and
endorsed by the ANC. This is largely a motherhood-and-apple pie affair, but
points worth stressing are:
Realisation of the importance of stability and 'consistent, credible
economic policies';
The view that South Africa should not introduce special tax incentives to
attract FDI, the object rather being 'the equal application of reasonably
low corporate tax rates which remain stable';
During the transition assurances will be provided on security of investment,
foreign exchange policy, and minimisation of bureaucratic obstacles;
Industrial incentives will be equally available to foreigners and locals.

SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional agreement will intensify US corporate and
investor interest, but few American companies seem likely to move quickly
into the Republic.
Mr Jonathan Huneke, investment policy manager at the US Council for
International Business, which represents some 300 multinationals, thinks
they will re-enter 'very cautiously, very quietly and very slowly'.
More than 200 US companies left South Africa in the 1980s, under pressure
from state and local government economic sanctions, which will take time to
be lifted.
With a constitutional agreement in prospect, many US companies have been
examining options in South Africa. Mr Tony O'Reilly, head of foods group HJ
Heinz, travelled to the country two years ago on an initial exploratory
trip.
A few companies have already taken the plunge. The Investor Responsibility
Research Center, a Washington-based monitoring group, reckons that at least
28 companies have gone into the Republic since mid-1991.
Large Wall Street brokerage houses and fund management groups, which stopped
handling South African securities in the 1980s are also preparing to get
back into the market.
Yet despite this surge of interest, most American corporations remain wary
of a significant exposure.
There remains a lingering distrust of the African National Congress, and
there is concern about the stability of the country after next year's
elections.
Analysts say these worries mean that many US companies will re-enter the
market through cautious routes - such as exports, joint ventures and
licensing agreements - and many will seek partners in the black community.
The same concerns mean that large US fund managers, who have been snapping
up stocks in so-called 'emerging markets' in Latin America and Asia, may be
leery of rushing into South African securities.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (13): A quantum
leap - Johannesburg Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>

BACK in 1986 when sanctions began in earnest, the US sold and Europe bought.
Now, at least as far as the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is concerned,
the positions are reversed. Europe is cautious, the US euphoric.
Down on Diagonal Street, home of the JSE, brokers groan pleasurably at the
stampede of US investors knocking on their door - a veritable Wall Street
who's who. Of course, the US presence on the JSE has already been highly
visible in 1993, being largely responsible for driving the bull markets in
bonds and gold shares. But since ANC president Nelson Mandela called for the
lifting of economic sanctions in September, interest has soared. Once
limited to speculators, hedge funds and specialists, especially on the gold
board, the heavy artillery is massing just over the brow.
It will be some time yet before the debris of US state and municipal
sanctions is finally cleared, and fund managers who are responsible to
trustees will keep a watchful eye on political developments before making
any significant decisions. The view on Diagonal Street, however, is that it
is now a question of when, rather than if, funds flow. A broker comments:
'If you aggregate the figures we've heard, there'll be a lot of sheep trying
to get through a very narrow gate.' One Hong Kong fund manager
visitingJohannesburg said he was convinced investors would drive the
price/earnings ratio of the JSE from 15 to 25, as they have with other
emerging markets.
As JSE-watchers point out, it is hardly a typical emerging market - more
than 100 years old and with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 145bn
(at the financial rand exchange rate of R4.30/Dollars 1), it is one of the
10 largest in the world. There are about 80 stocks with a market
capitalisation of more than Dollars 200m, the cut-off point often used by
international fund managers to identify stocks they are prepared to hold.
Hence the preference among analysts for describing the JSE as a
're-emerging' market.
Two caveats need to be entered about the bull scenario for the JSE. First,
if the main international stock markets crack, the Dow Jones industrial
index in particular, then the JSE is sure to follow. Second, South Africa
must achieve a relatively stable political transition.
Assuming these hurdles are cleared, then the case for the JSE is easily
developed. US investors and fund managers are looking to invest an
increasing portion of their assets outside the US to improve returns. Given
the JSE accounts for about 0.9 per cent of total world stock market
capitalisation, and most US fund managers hold little if any SA stock, it is
reasonable to assume a flow of funds. Until recently, virtually no US
analysts followed South African stocks. As they start to cover them, so
funds are likely to follow.
A recent study of 47 global emerging market funds (mostly UK and US) by the
UK group Micropal shows that as at June 30, 1993, only 0.07 per cent of
their Dollars 8bn assets were invested in South Africa. This process will
gather impetus when Morgan Stanley develops a South Africa index for
inclusion in its world index, and should the International Finance
Corporation grant the JSE emerging market status. (SA stocks qualify because
domestic per capita income is below the Dollars 7,910 cut-off).
The case for the JSE is considerably hardened by fairly reliable talk of six
to seven South (or southern) Africa country funds being established.
Alliance Capital Management Corporation, one of the largest investment
management funds in the US with about Dollars 110bn of funds under
management, and backed by Merrill Lynch, has already lodged a prospectus
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch The Southern Africa
Fund - a closed end investment company. These funds could easily raise
Dollars 500m. Dollars 500m
The chief concern about any large inflow of funds is whether the JSE, with
its notoriously poor tradeability, can manage them. Latest JSE figures show
annualised liquidity at about 7 per cent, but in recent years this has been
closer to 4 per cent. Figures from Johannesburg brokers Ivor Jones, Roy &amp; Co
show the most liquid domestic industrial stock, SA Breweries, has a monthly
turnover of only Dollars 12m. The most liquid stock, by a long margin, is De
Beers, with a monthly turnover of about Dollars 57m. The main cause of the
low liquidity is exchange control. South Africa's large institutional cash
flows - about R40bn per annum, of which at least a quarter will make its way
into equities - are forced to chase a small pool of domestic quality scrip.
Understandably, the good stock they get they are inclined to hold. If strong
buying pressures do materialise, then the upward trend of prices will help
loosen stock. The yield-driven, short-term focus of some of the speculative
funds already in the JSE will make it more volatile, and also boost
liquidity.
South African bonds will also attract attention. Real yields on long bonds
of around 8 per cent for foreign investors compare favourably with the
returns available in industrial countries. South Africa is a good risk not
to default, the market is well organised and liquid, with more than Dollars
1bn daily trading volume common, the bonds offer prospective capital gains
from the fall in inflation, and there is the possibility of currency gains
from the appreciation of the financial rand.
Investments on the JSE are done through the volatile financial rand, whose
movements are capable of wiping out gains in the underlying investments. For
investors coming into the bond market in particular, where volumes are quite
large, they have to buy the currency before the bond. As one broker
commented: 'The currency leg is the narrow gate, not the bond.' Political
stability will help stabilise this market, but investors should treat it
with caution.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (16): A dip in
uncertain waters - France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DELEGATION from the French employers federation was in South Africa last
week to restore the country's position in South Africa's economy.
The political turmoil and violence of recent years, coupled with strong
French government backing for international sanctions against apartheid, had
the effect of reducing France's share in foreign direct investment in South
Africa from 8.6 per cent in 1980 to around 2 per cent today.
Recent negotiation between South Africa and France of treaties on reciprocal
protection of investment and avoidance of double taxation should encourage
more French companies to dip their toes in South African waters.
It is to help smaller French companies in the South Africa market that the
French Patronat employers federation and the Industrial Development
Corporation of South Africa last year set up a joint organisation, aimed at
modernising South African industry and developing higher value-added exports
by South Africa.
There has long been a traditional French interest in South African gold
stocks. Several South African gold stocks are quoted on the Paris Bourse
and, for example, a majority of the shares in East Rand Proprietary Mines
(ERPM) are held by French individuals, according to one French banker.
'But this traditional interest in gold has not spread to other South African
shares,' the banker says. The latter are relatively expensive, with a high
price/earnings ratio, he says. This is due to the controls on capital
movements which mean that South African investors have difficulty investing
abroad.
But the French investor's main worry says Mr Christian Graeff, leader of
last week's Patronat delegation, is 'the current image of violence and the
prospect that there will be no coherence in policy for some time to come'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (12): A game of
wait and see - Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN businessmen are well aware of the potential of the South African
market - but they are also acutely conscious of the risks.
The attractions lie in the country's well developed industrial
infrastructure, a cheap labour force and the market of 125m consumers in
southern Africa. The downside is equally obvious and can be summed up in one
word: instability.
'German companies will invest,' commented a German diplomat in South Africa
earlier this year at a trade fair to promote trade between the two
countries, 'but only when the framework is in place: that means stability, a
market economy and the removal of the danger of nationalisation.'
As the BDI, the Federal Association of German Industry, put it in a
memorandum last month, the next government in South Africa will face massive
challenges in restoring the country's economy.
That government may indeed find itself on a collision course with the
expectations of the black majority.
For the moment German companies have less risky, highly attractive markets
on their own doorsteps, in the countries of the former eastern block. China
and other markets in the far east are growing so quickly that they form a
central part of many Germany companies' medium-term expansion plans.
That said, German investment in South Africa should not be underestimated:
there are about 350 German businesses or subsidiaries of large German
companies in the country, employing 50,000 people.
German investors and trade-partners are well-liked in South Africa - not
least because German companies adopted a pragmatic approach to sanctions.
But that liking is unlikely to be reciprocated further until South Africa
offers a degree of stability to investors.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (17):
Unthinkable achieved - Stock market structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YES, the PAC needs some good investment advice,' said a senior cadre of the
most militant grouping involved in South Africa's multi-party democracy
process as he shook hands with a broker last week in the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (JSE) building.
The meeting, unthinkable three years ago, may suggest to some that the Pan
Africanist Congress is mellowing. It could also be read merely as a sign of
how politicised everything in South African commerce has become. Arguably it
always was: investors prospered under apartheid and a claim by the JSE, in a
booklet aimed at blacks, that its record is 'one hundred years of creating
wealth for all South Africans' will be found by many to be tendentious.
But stockbroking firms, in a business as divorced as is conceivable from the
daily realities of most people, now eagerly court all the main black
movements in the hope that they will be smiled on after next April.
The very structure and operation of the JSE threatens to develop into a
political issue. Indeed, if it does, this will at least in part have been at
the instigation of the exchange itself, which set up a sub-committee 18
months ago to examine its workings 'on the basis that South Africa is going
through changes,' says Mr Roy Andersen, JSE president.
The sub-committee was charged with examining the market's old-style system
of individually liable brokers, trading on fixed commissions and only on
their clients' behalf rather than also on their own account. Its report is
in its final stages and due in February. Most local brokers think
Johannesburg will not have a Big Bang - but there may be a 'phased phut' in
which many of the market's traditional practices will be overturned and new
entrants allowed in.
The problem for an administration headed by the African National Congress
will be that most of these would-be entrants are the country's big banking
groups, which have extensive equity links in industry and other financial
sectors. Should a transitional government sanction a further concentration
of economic power, which leading ANC members have long wished to diffuse, or
should it give its blessing to what others will call a cosy club of vested
interests?
There are further questions. If banks, brokers, insurers and industrial
companies are allowed all to come under one corporate roof, in a small
financial community what prospect is there that Chinese walls will be
impermeable? And if black workers are to be given a stake in their
employment future, say through share option schemes as a means of promoting
productivity gains, how will it look if dealing costs for small investors
suddenly rise relative to those of the big financial houses?
Though Mr Andersen is coy about the contents of the report, leading
stockbrokers think some sort of change is inevitable. The best guesses
circulating in broking firms' offices above the Diagonal Street trading
floor are that the JSE will at least initially remain an agency market but
that a sliding scale will replace the 0.5 per cent standard commission -
becoming freely negotiable for trades over a certain size  - and that firms
will be able to sell a stake of perhaps 30 per cent to a corporate
shareholder.
Suggestions that the banks, if dissatisfied with the pace of change, might
set up a screen-based dealing system for the biggest and most liquid stocks
are largely discounted on regulatory grounds. But it is a stick which has at
least been waved in the distance, and the JSE is believed ready to open up a
gap or two in the laager of its trading floor to ease pressure.
Changes are likely to come gradually, starting next year, and the mood will
not be one of the Eighties London bonanza. Although a large number of the
50-odd brokers will sell out to banks, the lesson has been learned from the
fancy price/earnings ratios paid to City firms before the 1987 crash, says a
partner in one Johannesburg securities house. He adds: 'Those with the means
or the products can survive' - as independent entities if they wish.
This also appears to be the wish of many of the country's fund managers.
They are by no means convinced that, in a thinly traded equity market,
commissions on buying good lines of stock would fall - even for them. At the
same time, they are concerned that any squeeze on brokers' margins might
force JSE member firms to cut research output which they commonly use in
tandem with in-house analysis. And they see their choice of broker
potentially narrowed because some would have tied up with a rival financial
institution.
'We want quality of service - in dealing skills and research input - and we
are more inclined to accept higher commissions to get it,' says one.
Whatever the outcome, as free elections approach and the country's
reconstruction needs are thrown more to the fore, black political groups are
setting aside their old hostility to the exchange as an institution. While
they are likely to have much to say in the coming year about how the JSE
should conduct itself to the benefit of all South Africans, even the PAC's
slogan seems to be changing slowly from the notorious 'One settler, one
bullet' to something which may be more like 'One settlement, one bull
market'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (11): Playing
hard to get - International capital markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW that the sanctions have been lifted and agreement has been reached on
its repayment of the Dollars 5bn of foreign debt caught in the 1985
standstill, only the elections in April stand in the way of South Africa's
return to the international capital markets.
However, since it has been shunned by the international investment community
for so long, South Africa is playing hard to get with the numerous banks
that have come courting.
Although the gold and foreign exchange reserves have fallen, there is no
urgent need for South Africa to raise funds internationally. An Dollars 850m
loan facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be
forthcoming by the end of the year and South Africa also has access to
short-term credit lines from several banks.
Nevertheless, bankers expect South Africa to launch its first international
bond issue since January 1992 after the elections.
South Africa is likely to test the waters with a Eurobond issue denominated
in D-Marks. If the D-Mark Eurobond issue is successful, South Africa will
then consider an offering in the higher-profile eurodollar sector. Offerings
from parastatal issuers are likely to follow.
The main bone of contention is the interest rate South Africa would have to
pay to raise funds in the Eurobond market. Borrowers who want to raise funds
in the Eurobond market have to pay a 'spread' or premium over the yield in
the domestic government bond market. The size of the yield spread is
determined by the market's perception of the borrower. The bigger the
spread, the riskier the borrower.
Bankers say that as long as South Africa is classified as an emerging market
it will have to pay a yield spread of between 225 and 275 basis points over
underlying government bonds. This is well above the yield spread of around
175 basis points which South Africa is prepared to pay.
As a result, South Africa could refrain from coming to the international
bond market until the pricing issue has been resolved.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (15): Still in
courtship phase - Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH Japan has long been a significant trading partner for South Africa
the strength of that relationship has not been matched by high levels of
investment.
'There is an awareness that South Africa is a promising market,' says Mr
Sota Sakai, manager of the Middle East and Africa Section at Marubeni, the
trading house. 'But when it comes to investment, this is like a marriage so
it will take more time to reach that point,' he notes.
While Japan was South Africa's fourth largest trading partner in 1990 after
West Germany, Great Britain and the US, due to international sanctions there
has been no Japanese direct investment in South Africa for at least the past
10 years, the ministry of finance says.
The political situation is still a strong concern. The Japan Bond Research
Institute, gave South Africa a 5.9 general rating in its latest July report,
which was up from 5.4 in January and 4.0 in January, 1989. The Institute
attributed the higher ranking to the positive aspects of the government's
fiscal and monetary policies as well as enhanced international trust in
South Africa.
Geography is also a problem. 'Japan is not that internationalised yet,'
explains Mr Sakai.
Japanese businesses also believe that the entire business environment in
South Africa needs to be improved before the country can expect to see a
significant influx of investment from Japan.
Greater communication between the two countries is also necessary before
Japanese businesses are likely to feel comfortable with the idea of
investing in South Africa. For much the same reasons, there is little
interest in Japan in South Africa's capital markets.
Meanwhile, the activities of Japanese banks with regard to South Africa have
been frozen since the country declared a debt standstill in 1985. It is
believed that no new lending will be forthcoming from banks, Japanese or
other, until that situation is resolved.

Starry-eyed optimism - Philip Gawith finds that business is looking on the
bright side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S business community is either foolish, or possessed of great
faith. Whichever the explanation, it is difficult to find a senior business
executive who is not optimistic about the future. Considering the seismic
changes occurring in the country, this is an amazing state of affairs.
In part, businessmen are simply talking to their book. Businesses will stand
or fall depending on how the country's fortunes wax or wane. With the
alternative too ghastly to contemplate, they choose, understandably, to look
on the bright side.
There is also the punch-drunk factor. Businessmen reason that having lived
through and survived the 1980s, there is little left to fear. Then business
was faced with a government that did not care a fig for it, in a country
experiencing serious domestic political unrest, and pariah status in the
international world. Can things get worse?
Clearly they can, and it would be wrong to suggest that business is
possessed of a facile optimism at odds with events in the country. Indeed,
there has hardly been an annual report issued in the past two years where
the detrimental effects of violence and political instability on business
has not been lamented. But people rightly treat the possibility of
uncontrollable violence as a worst case scenario and plan from a more
optimistic premise.
More plausible a scenario is that a future government, set on advancing the
lot of black business, could make onerous demands that seriously impede the
ability of companies to operate freely.
But this scenario is not given much credence in the business community. With
the country just emerging from a four-year recession, businessmen are not
about to let politics quench their ardour. Although some companies reporting
recently have turned in good results, this has in most cases been due to
extraneous factors, such as a weak exchange rate and lower corporate tax, or
simply running a tight ship.
But although trading conditions remain grim, business is keen to whet its
lips again looking to the rise of more than 30 per cent per annum in
corporate profits in the late 1980s.
This optimism explains why the South African Chamber of Business's (SACOB)
confidence index rose to a three-year high in October.
However, there are some who believe next year's trading conditions will be
poor because of disruption during the elections.
Time could prove the business community to be starry-eyed in its benign
assessment of the impact of political change. This optimism, however, is not
baseless. While business and the ANC may not yet have reached the position
of being ideological bedfellows, the toenadering (coming together) that has
taken place since the ANC was unbanned has been remarkable. ANC leaders'
diaries are chock-a-block with appointments to breakfast, lunch or dine with
businessmen. Businessmen, for their part, are not averse to letting slip
that they are on first name terms with ANC heavyweights.
Indeed, one of the more interesting features of the 'new South Africa' is
watching how companies try and position themselves for the future. Lining up
in the robust corner is Anglo American, South Africa's largest company,
which has always followed the adage 'We don't want to be loved. We want to
be respected'. To its credit, it has never been afraid to stand up and be
counted, and there can be little doubt that this has borne fruits. In the
area of anti-trust for example, while the jury is still out on what sort of
policy South Africa will eventually get, Anglo's muscular defence of its
size has helped focus and improve the quality of debate.
Others, however, favour the softly-softly approach, down-playing
deficiencies in ANC policy and not seeing all differences as issues of
principle that need to be confronted. Businesses normally arrive at this
perspective by two different routes. Some have genuinely good relations with
the ANC, the product of commendable liberal track records and a belief that
they are dealing with 'good' men. Others are opportunistic, jumping ship
after years of obeisance to the National Party. This is not necessarily a
bad thing. They may lack principle, but they are 'operators' and their
willingness to engage with the ANC has played its part in selling the case
for business.
Just as companies take different views on how they relate with politicians,
so they take different approaches to how they should respond to change. All
businesses, of course, are required to take a closer look at 'soft issues'
such as affirmative action, black advancement and social responsibility
programmes, safe in the knowledge that a new government will pay more
attention to these issues. Although politicians may never be satisfied with
business efforts, there can be no doubt about the considerable time and
effort going into these areas.
Beyond these issues, however, the scope to do business differently depends
to a large extent on the business you are in. With production-driven
business such as mining, the basic process of pulling ores out of the ground
and shipping them to foreign markets remains fundamentally the same,
regardless of political and social changes. Not so, however, for companies
that interface more closely with the consumer. Here the battle is on to
capture the spending of the emergent black consumer and this produces
distinct challenges in product development.
The consumer market, of course, is not the only growth market of the future.
Indeed, optimists are inclined to argue that political democratisation will
unleash enormous benefits for the economy as a whole. Mr Grant Thomas,
executive chairman of consumer industrial group Malbak, comments: 'South
Africa's huge advantage is that enormous multiplier effect within its own
borders, greater than anywhere except China and the old Soviet Union. The
market traditionally only served 20 per cent of the people.'
For South Africa's larger companies, a key benefit of political reform is
that it has again allowed them to play on the world's stage. Mr Brian
Gilbertson, chairman of Gencor, comments: 'If you have a good product you
don't just stay in your home town.' South Africa's large corporates were,
during the sanctions era, severely hamstrung.
But the catch-up process has now begun. South African mining houses are
swarming over the rest of Africa and in parts of South America and Europe,
while industrial companies like Sappi and the then Royal Foods (now Del
Monte International) have made large offshore transactions. Exchange control
remains a considerable impediment to the internationalisation of activities,
but South African companies are at least part of the hunt again.
While change is the word on the minds of most businessmen, others also see a
large measure of continuity - if not in the way they do business, then
certainly in the challenges that face them.

Expectations may be too great - Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOWETO-ON-SEA, one settlement has been dubbed. Families living in shacks in
a river flood plain in the Eastern Cape city of Port Elizabeth are being
moved there en masse. But this is not the dawn bulldozer raid of the old
South Africa - the squatters are going, voluntarily, to set up home on a
plot of land which each will own.
Another shanty town, in Welkom in the Orange Free State, is relocating to a
new settlement nearby which they have called Vukuzenzela - in translation,
'Wake up and do it yourself.'
The name is apposite, because the squatters are not being rehoused. What
they get is a 'serviced site,' with at least water and sewerage laid on. The
building work is up to them. The two are among the 100-plus such projects
around the country undertaken by the Cape Town-based Independent Development
Trust since it was launched in 1990 with the political endorsement of the
African National Congress and Inkatha and R2bn of government money. Further
project funds have since come from other donors such as the European
Community.
The IDT has spent some R850m establishing more than 110,000 sites, in the
process becoming the biggest provider of new homes without ever having built
a house. The number represents nearly 10 per cent of the 1.2m households it
estimated had no proper roof over their heads, no mean feat in three years.
But that figure is rising as blacks gravitate towards the cities to seek
elusive employment, and the trust's 'toilet towns' - that is their sole
fitting - are barely holding the line.
Some 10m people are without drinking water at home, 15m lack sanitation, and
23m have no electricity. The IDT estimates that the country is short of
50,000 classrooms, a number which it expects to double by 2000. Some 1,000
more primary health facilities are needed.
Redressing this legacy will be a daunting task.
Eskom, the state-controlled electric utility, for example has a five-year
programme to electrify 1m households, and new connections are running at
25,000 to 30,000 a month. However, this still leaves some 30 per cent of
homes without power by 2000, beyond the five-year life of next year's
transitional administration.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister and former head of mining house Gencor, says
bluntly of the country's social infrastructure needs: 'I don't think the
market is going to do it.'
His downbeat view echoes that of many in the private sector who insist that
institutions with the financial clout which could make a tangible
difference, notably the life assurance offices, have a fiduciary duty to
their shareholders or policyholders which would not allow them to justify
investing in or lending to ventures where the risks are large and the
returns uncertain.
But the market is at least trying. Mr Steven de Bruyn, assistant general
manager of UAL, the merchant banking arm of the Nedbank group, says ways
need to be found to make the risk palatable. These would often require
government involvement, say in setting up a US-style mortgage guarantee fund
so home loans could be extended to those without the financial track record
which usually only whites can meet. Such a loan book could then be
securitised.
This is not too far a jump from the capital markets issue which UAL this
year put together for Eskom, the state electricity supplier, to fund its
electrification programme aimed mainly at black residential areas. The R590m
first tranche was fully subscribed locally after the Reserve Bank deemed the
detachable warrants on the bonds allowed foreigners too much scope to
exploit the country's dual exchange rate system.
Preventing defaults on mortgages may be less easy, but at least there is
supposed to be an income stream to repay an investment outlay. What of
education and health, where no such evident return exists? Even here,
schemes are being examined. In tertiary education, for instance, a loan fund
has been mooted along the lines of a model being explored in Australia.
Borrowings would be repaid from students' eventual earnings, debited
directly, and the fund would become self-sustainable as these flows gain
pace.
Outside agencies will now play a greater role. The World Bank and
International Monetary Fund themselves arouse both hopes and fears, given
the stringency of their prescriptions in the rest of Africa. A letter of
intent between South Africa and the IMF is ready for signing next month (but
loans from the Washington institutions are in the main thought likely to be
used initially to refinance existing bank borrowings rather than provide a
slew of new development cash.
In a recognition of the scale of the task, Derek Keys says large-scale
community upliftment 'needs an entrepreneur - maybe it needs 10,000
entrepreneurs - to organise. I hope a representative government is in a
better position for that than our government.'

NEXT TO violence, political instability and concerns about ANC economic
policy, what investors like least about South Africa is exchange control. In
fact, outside of a few lawyers and tax advisers, it is difficult to find
anyone who likes it. Even the Reserve Bank, which administers the policies,
never tires of saying that it would like to rid the country of this
albatross.
Earlier this month Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented:
'An early end to the dual-currency system is not in the offing.' He also
noted, that 'the financial rand will remain as long as the domestic
political and social instability . . . continues'.
With South Africa facing an election on April 27, 1994, and the immediate
aftermath a great unknown, few believe the financial rand will go before the
end of 1994 at the earliest.
While most exchange control regulations are aimed at stopping people taking
money out of the country, it is the dual-currency system that most affects
foreign investors. In terms of this system South Africa has a commercial
rand, the official rate of exchange used for all normal commercial
activities; and the financial rand which is basically a currency for
non-resident investment or disinvestment.
The aim of the financial rand is to protect the country's foreign reserves.
The system is designed to ensure that when foreigners repatriate their
investments, they do not do so at the expense of the country's reserves.
Foreign investors need to pay close attention to the financial rand as it is
a highly volatile currency easily capable of negating any gains made in,
say, an investment in equities or bonds. Indeed, many foreigners suffered
heavy losses in the second half of 1992 when the currency weakened
dramatically. Although turnover in the market has increased, it remains a
very thin market, skittish and difficult to predict, and easily moved by a
large order.
Financial rands are created when a non-resident sells his South African
investment to a South African. He must be paid in rand, which rands are then
deposited in his account with an approved dealer in foreign exchange (all of
the main banks). Once in his account, the rand becomes financial rand which
can only be sold by the non-resident owner to another non-resident against
payment in a foreign currency.
By definition, residents can never own, and hence sell, financial rand
(though, in very limited circumstances, locals may use financial rand for
offshore transactions). Residents are also not allowed to buy financial rand
as this would require foreign exchange - precisely what the system is
supposed to avoid.
In considering when the financial rand might be abolished, it must be
remembered that this subject is inextricably bound up with South Africa's
debt standstill arrangements. These were introduced in 1985 and covered the
country's repayable foreign debt (then Dollars 13.6bn, now down to Dollars
5bn in terms of a final agreement reached last September).
The government's position was that it would have been unfair if a
restriction had been placed on repayment of foreign debt at that time
without also restricting the repatriation of foreign investment in South
African equities. This would have led to undesirable arbitrage transactions
 -hence the introduction of the financial rand.
Likewise, it is most unlikely that the Reserve Bank will scrap the financial
rand system while foreign creditors remain subject to a debt repayment
scheme. The latest scheme is due to run for eight years. For South Africa to
consider ending it before then - that is, repaying the affected debt - will
either require that it manages to roll over a substantial amount of the
Dollars 5bn still subject to the scheme, or that its reserves grow to the
position where it feels they can withstand a sizeable capital outflow.
Current levels, which cover only about six weeks of imports, are a long way
short of the required level.
The best indicator that the financial rand is ripe for abolition will be
when the discount to commercial rand, currently about 20 per cent, either
narrows considerably or disappears altogether. This is unlikely before South
Africa is seen to have achieved a stable and sustainable transition.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (8): Retailers
woo black buyers - Consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB and PHILIP GAWITH

<TEXT>
'CHOOSE BLACK Like Me' exhorts a poster at the World Trade Centre, the
Johannesburg venue for the multi-party talks. But it turns out to be
addressed to the consumer rather than the voter, advertising nothing more
epoch-making than a range of hair care products.
Black consumers, particularly those in urban areas, are becoming the focus
of the South African retail sector in recognition of the sheer size of the
market and the expectation that wage differentials with whites will continue
to narrow.
On average a black household still has an income only one sixth of that of
its white counterpart, is likely to have more offspring to support, as well
as dependent members of the extended family often living in rural areas. A
survey by the Bureau of Market Research at the University of South Africa
shows that metropolitan blacks commit 7.5 per cent of their household
expenditure to the support of relatives.
This compares with only 0.2 per cent for those living in the
quasi-independent 'homelands' who are more likely to be recipients of
remittances from city breadwinners.
Given such burdens, opportunities for discretionary spending - and for those
businesses seeking to attract it - seem limited. Holidays, for example,
absorb a bare 0.3 per cent of black outgoings.
So, it is no surprise that the South African retail and consumer products
industries have most conspicuously reorientated themselves to urban blacks
in sectors such as food (which takes 20.4 per cent of their household
spending), clothing and footwear (8.1 per cent), alcohol (6.5 per cent) and
tobacco (4.8 per cent).
Edgars, the clothing chain with nearly a fifth of all sales in its sector,
now has close to half its revenues coming from blacks, according to a retail
industry analyst at a stockbroking firm.
Blacks now consume some 80 per cent of all lager drunk in the country,
shifting away from home-brewed sorghum beer and helping the near-monopoly
South African Breweries (SAB) maintain volumes.
Checkers, the supermarket chain which merged with Pepcor, owner of the
down-market Pep clothing shops, has converted many of its stores into
cheaper-line Shoprite outlets and held prices down.
Mr Mervyn Serebro, managing director of OK Bazaars, says: 'Our customer is
now the emerging nation. There is no embarrassment in saying we are not in
the crayfish and caviar business.' OK is targeting middle-income blacks
rather than the 'fringe of affluence,' of whatever colour.
All advertise extensively in black media such as the Sowetan newspaper,
conscious of the need to establish their brand while there remain few
black-owned companies with the capital to compete. Billboard campaigns in
particular convey the imagery of egalitarian multiracial bonhomie which
exists more in the minds of advertising agency creative departments than on
the street, beach or bar terrace which form their backdrops.
At the same time, though, some companies have pursued particular strategies
to boost demand among blacks. CNA Gallo, which runs a chain of
newsagent/stationers as well as cinemas and a record label, has become the
largest seller of postage stamps apart from the Post Office itself. This is
not because that business is itself lucrative - rather, it gets blacks
coming into its stores, previously an apparent preserve of white reading
matter.
Malbak, an industrial group which has interests in food, pharmaceuticals,
packaging, furniture and appliances, has examined each of these sectors to
see where potential black demand offers scope for expansion. For example, it
is placing emphasis on the supply of generic drugs which are cheaper than
their proprietary equivalents - the Unisa survey shows urban black
households allocate as much as 20.7 per cent of their spending to medical
and dental needs.
Mr Grant Thomas, chairman of Malbak, argues: 'If you look at the new South
Africa, where will the money be spent? Housing, health, transport,
education. If you build a house it will have at least one plug. Then look at
what they want: lights, TV, fridge, cooker.' Beyond that, the family would
be likely to buy packaged foods once they have a refrigerator, thus neatly
covering two more of Malbak's bases.
With demand for household durables such as fridges at near-saturation among
whites, the source of growth for electrical goods manufacturers and
retailers is clear. Rapid urbanisation following the abolition of the
restrictive pass laws in the 1980s has brought around half South Africa's
black population to the cities.
As electrification of the townships progresses, and some residents trade up
into previously white inner-city areas, black spending should help fuel a
consumer-led recovery if one takes off. Baring Securities estimates that
overall private consumption expenditure, which has begun to revive this
year, will grow by 2 per cent in 1994 and add a percentage point each year
through 1996.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (6): From civil
war to consensus - Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Derek Keys took over as South Africa's finance minister in May 1992,
one of his key priorities was stopping the economic 'civil war'. It is a
measure of the progress made towards achieving consensus on economic policy
that he can now pronounce this 'done'.
Certainly there will continue to be disputes between the main political
players, business and labour. The past two months have offered ample
examples: the issue of cellular telephone licences, a rise in the petrol
price, trade union rights under a future constitution - all these elicited
threats from the ANC and its trade union ally Cosatu (the Congress of South
African Trade Unions) ranging from mass action and a national strike, to
nationalisation.
In the event, deals were struck and disruption avoided. This represents
enormous progress. In the past economic disputes often ended in mass action
and conflict. Now they are managed, and a satisfactory resolution is
normally achieved. It is a fair guess that this spirit of compromise will
inform South Africa's economic policy under a new government. Mr Keys
comments: ''There is always a way' - for this job, that is my motto.'
If praise is due, then Mr Keys stands at the front of the queue. More than
any other factor, his skills as manager and deal-maker, coupled with an
engaging personality and intellectual authority, account for this change.
Considerable assistance, however, has also come from other quarters. Most
obviously, the National Economic Forum (NEF), the tripartite body where
business, government and labour seek agreement on economic policy, has
performed a critical role. The ANC has also played its part with Mr Trevor
Manuel, head of the Department of Economics and Planning, spearheading a
more flexible and considered approach to economic policy.
The results are impressive. Recent months have seen South Africa make
significant economic commitments, all of which enjoyed multi-party support.
These include signing a final debt rescheduling deal, which runs for eight
years; agreeing the terms of an Dollars 850m loan from the IMF; agreeing the
terms of a revised offer to GATT, whereby South Africa's tariff book will be
substantially simplified and the average tariff lowered; and agreeing the
terms of future relations with the World Bank.
To ensure that South Africa's commitments in these areas enjoyed the
necessary political legitimacy, Mr Keys established an ad hoc committee, the
Economic Technical Committee (ETC), on which government, the ANC, PAC and
Inkatha were represented. In all four of the above cases, the ETC agreed the
final terms.
Tensions still exist between - roughly - the ANC/Cosatu on one side, and
government/business on the other but the crucial differences are the way in
which these issues are handled.
The latter is testimony to considerable policy movement from the ANC in
particular. Certainly, the organisation and some of its leaders have not
totally shaken off their socialist vision. Both Mr Mandela and Mr Ramaphosa,
ANC secretary-general, have let the dreaded nationalisation word slip in the
past two months. But, as one commentator noted: 'The movement is clear, if
not always convincing - but it's not a trick.'
Currently, the ANC is best characterised as being a reluctant convert to
market economics. If it has left behind the days in which it was firmly
committed to nationalising the mines, banks and 'commanding heights' of the
economy, it still retains a touching faith in the state as a powerful agent
to do economic good. It remains as sceptical as ever, however, of Adam
Smith's invisible hand. The search is on, therefore, for some sort of 'third
way', with countries such as Germany and Sweden, notwithstanding their
respective difficulties, cited admiringly.
Although some ANC spokesman have started increasingly to say 'the right
thing' - justifying, for example, their commitment to a vigorous anti-trust
policy in terms of the need to promote the efficiency of markets - some
doubts remain.
Thus, while Mr Mandela has taken to vigorously beating the foreign
investment drum since calling for the lifting of economic sanctions in
September, he still continues to 'invite' investors to come to South Africa
to 'help', as if that were their main concern.
Domestically, the economic focus of an ANC government will be on a programme
of 'national reconstruction', with the aim being to visibly uplift the lot
of its followers. This will basically be a case of 'more of the same' since
the past three budgets have already had a heavy emphasis on redistribution,
with essentially the same purposes in mind.
While this envisages a heavy role for the state in areas such as publics
works programmes, this should take place within reasonable fiscal limits.
Not only is the ANC on record as saying macroeconomic balance must be
maintained, but it has also acknowledged that South Africa is already highly
taxed. It is committed, in terms of the IMF loan letter of intent, to
limiting the budget deficit (6 per cent of GDP is the target in 1994/5).
There is also little evidence that a new government will interfere with
monetary policy, though business is likely to lobby for some let-up in
pressure.
Of privatisation, little is likely to be heard. While commercialisation of
state corporations - notably Posts and Telecommunications and Transnet - is
under way, the ANC remains set against the concept. Mr Keys's judgment is
that 'the final step to privatisation will require substantial
disappointment with other routes first'.
A much more difficult longer term question facing a new government will be
the restructuring of trade and industrial policy. Sanctions, and efforts to
combat them, have left some areas of the economy uncompetitive in the
international market.
Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman of pulp and paper group Sappi, cites
the example of the truck that draws up to his factory gate: it probably
costs 100 per cent more than the price his international competitors pay,
the tyres are probably 30 per cent more expensive and the spares double the
cost. He adds that if he were able to buy five chemicals at the price his US
competitors pay for the same products, he would virtually double Sappi's
earnings.
Ironing out these distortions in the economy will take wisdom, time and
sacrifice. How much is available is unclear. While Gatt has said it
understands South Africa needs time to address these problems, this has not
stopped it rejecting what it regards as excessive tariff protection for
South Africa's beleaguered clothing and textiles sector (proposals of 60 per
cent for clothing and 45 per cent for household textiles under the latest
Gatt offer).
In terms of its other international economic relations, a future government
is likely to take a fairly robust stance. The ANC/Cosatu, for example, has
made clear that it has no taste for a supplicant relationship with the IMF
and World Bank, with economic policy decided in Washington. Current economic
policies are broadly consonant with IMF norms, and no World Bank finance is
expected much before the end of 1994. Funds for development are available
locally; the priority now is to work out how these should be spent. Only
later will the need for Bank finance emerge.
The other two important relationships will be with the European Union (EU)
and neighbours in the region.
The former is important because South Africa does not belong to any economic
grouping, and the EU is its largest trade partner. It looks unlikely that
South Africa will accede to the Lome convention, which offers concessionary
trade terms. More likely will be some sort of bilateral framework agreement
which can be negotiated much more quickly, while also offering substantial
market access benefits.
As to the region, a new government will probably want to join the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), if only to show solidarity with many
of its allies in the frontline states.
Present indications are, however, that co-operation is likely to focus
initially on functional issues such as power and transport with more
grandiose visions of economic integrations lying some way further in the
distance.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (5): Business
is sitting on its hands and waiting - The recession is ending, inflation is
in single figures, but many hurdles remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BARRING dramatic political setbacks, the worst is past for the South African
economy.
In the closing months of 1993, the country is beginning to emerge from its
longest ever recession, with economists predicting marginal GDP growth of
around 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating gently to around 1.5 per cent to
2 per cent in 1994. Thus far, the recovery is mainly attributable to the
rebound in agriculture from last year's drastic drought, with mining and
manufacturing remaining in the doldrums. But from next year all sectors of
the economy should start to benefit.
The policy environment is markedly friendlier than in the 1980s. Corporate
taxes have been cut, inflation is in single digits (9.7 per cent forecast
for 1993) for the first time in 20 years, a new tariff structure is about to
be launched and both real wages and real interest rates have started to
fall.
The balance of payments remains a problem area as capital outflows continue
and Pretoria is committed to repay over Dollars 1bn annually for the next
eight years. Bankers and stockbrokers say the country is underborrowed -
which it is, with a foreign debt of Dollars 17.3bn or 15 per cent of GDP -
leaving scope to refinance previous commitments. But such rollovers merely
provide a breathing space rather than a solution. This suggests that - in
the absence of strong export growth - there will be little room for
abandoning the financial rand and liberalising exchange controls, at least
until 1995.
The strength, and duration, of the upturn will depend on three main factors;
the new administration's ability to restore confidence to a badly-mauled
business sector; developments in the global economy, especially the
commodity price cycle, and the economic policy framework that evolves in the
'new' South Africa.
There are grounds for cautious optimism on all three counts. A reduction in
the violence and general acceptance of the election results, would do
wonders for business morale, simultaneously opening the door to a strong
upturn in public works spending on housing, electrification and roads. On
the policy front, finance minister Derek Keys has managed through the
National Economic Forum to put together a middle-of-the-road consensus to
secure agreements on resolving the debt standstill, an Dollars 850m IMF
loan, future relations with the World Bank and the crucial GATT Uruguay
Round submission that will liberalise and streamline South Africa's tariff
structure.
Disconcerting though the latest EC and Japanese numbers may be, South
African economists are modestly confident that the commodity cycle has done
its worst and that demand and prices for many of the country's key exports -
especially gold - will recover in 1994-95. Even so, the upturn is going to
be relatively limp through next year, as investors and businessmen sit on
their hands until the elections are out of the way and they have some idea
of who will be holding the reins of economic power.
Many hope and expect that Mr Keys will retain the finance portfolio, while
Dr Chris Stals, whose term as governor of the South African Reserve Bank
expires next year, and whose tough monetarism has done so much to reduce
inflation, fiscal follies notwithstanding, will be reappointed.
Continuation of the Keys-Stals double-act would certainly calm business and
banking nerves, abroad as well as at home, providing much-needed continuity
and stability. But whether the ANC is ready to allow whites to retain
control over key economic management decisions is unclear.
Mr Mandela and his close aides may be happy with such a transitional
arrangement - for two or three years - but already there are demands lower
down the ANC hierarchy for some relaxation of monetary and fiscal policy.
Fiscal policy is going to be crucial. While some in the ANC exude
moderation, insisting that large tax increases are not necessary, this begs
the Dollars 64 000 question - how is the country to fund the proposed social
upliftment and job-creation programmes? Professor Dennis Davis, an ANC tax
adviser, has suggested increased estate duties along with differential rates
of VAT so that some basic necessities can be zero-rated while higher rates
are applied to luxuries. Some rationalisation too of tax-breaks seems
probable thereby raising the effective rate of corporate tax - from around
20 per cent at present - while leaving the basic rate unchanged at 40 per
cent. One senior ANC economist, Mr Tito Mboweni, has ruffled feathers with
his suggestion of a once-off 'reconstruction levy,' though this has since
been played down.
ANC economists believe there is scope to fund upliftment programmes by
restructuring government spending.
This is questionable; the 'peace dividend' from defence cutbacks has been
largely siphoned into increased spending on the police, and in a country
where crime levels seem destined to remain uncomfortably high, there is
little room for savings. Nor is there going to be any 'apartheid dividend'
since the elimination of wasteful, duplicative spending on social services
for blacks and whites, will be offset by a larger public service and the
need to establish regional governments and structures. Mr Keys himself
believes there is likely to be a net increase rather than saving, and sees
his job as minimising that 'hump.'
One of the conditions of the IMF loan is a reduction in the budget deficit
to 6 per cent of GDP in 1994-95, down from the 6.8 per cent forecast for the
current year. Mr Keys says that 2 per cent of this represents public sector
investment spending, while 2.5 per cent is needed to build up the civil
servants pension fund in terms of already-announced political guarantees. He
hopes to achieve savings by eliminating the remaining 1.5 per cent of
'discretionary' deficit, but it is hard to square his plans with the social
upliftment goal.
It has been estimated that racial parity in social service spending would
cost almost a quarter of GDP, with education alone requiring 15.4 per cent,
more than double the 7.3 per cent provided in 1993-94. Indeed, a 'parity
budget' would mean shifting 10 per cent of GDP into the social services
budget from a budget total of 28 per cent (excluding debt-service
expenditure). Since such a target is out of reach, the likely implication is
that the ANC's sweetness and light on the tax front will fall foul of
political realism on one hand, and the need to deliver some form of
liberation dividend on the other. Cost-recovery in the public sector, in the
form of user charges for education and health, targeted initially on the
better-off, could well be necessary.
The fragile economic strategy consensus will come under strain too on the
labour front. While there is broad agreement on the need to put job creation
ahead of wage increases, optimism that the lifting of sanctions and
increased investment will make a significant dent in unemployment looks
misplaced.
Unemployment, estimated at a frightening 46 per cent by the SARB, is the
most important single challenge that will face the next government. The
optimists argue that the SARB's doomsday scenario exaggerates the problem,
citing the 1991 census which found that 19 per cent of the workforce were
actively seeking jobs, with one quarter of the black workforce falling into
this category compared with only 4 per cent of the whites.
Critics accuse employment pessimists of ignoring the vibrant, fast-growing
informal sector that is crucial to any strategy for easing the crisis. In
1989, the Central Statistical Service (CSS) estimated that there were some
304,000 fulltime black informal sector operators in South Africa to which
can be added 1.9m part-time informal sector entrepreneurs and 350,000
employees, making more than 2.5m or almost a third of the
economically-active black population. Unfortunately though, much of this
informal sector activity is described as 'survival' rather than 'voluntary'
entrepreneurship, implying that many self-employed would sooner have a
formal sector job.
The formal sector employment conundrum raises a question that few South
Africans feel confident to answer: where can the new South Africa develop
competitive advantage? Primary sector activities with value-added through
beneficiation of minerals is perhaps the most obvious answer, but hardly
reassuring given the probability of continued sluggish growth in primary
product demand and the possibility of ongoing excess capacity. In any event,
such operations are highly capital intensive, creating few jobs.
The finance minister is optimistic though, pointing out that Samcor, which
assembles vehicles, takes 34 hours to produce a motor car compared with 44
hours in Western Europe. In the pulp industry, productivity is higher at one
South African plant than in Germany, 'We have nothing to worry about in
terms of productivity,' says Mr Keys confidently, arguing that low black
worker productivity under the apartheid system reflected demotivation.
'There was nothing in it for them.' Black people could not move to better
areas, nicer homes or send their children to better schools. They were not
motivated to improve productivity.
South African businessmen acknowledge that they cannot expect to match the
Asians in terms of costs, work ethic or productivity. Their competitive edge
is in resource-intensive activities, low-cost energy, a superb
infrastructure, and in services such as banking and information technology.
In manufacturing though, competitive advantage will depend on investing in
skills, technology and training and since this kind of investment does not
yield quick returns, success in manufacturing is more likely to be found in
niche operations than in any single industry.
Even if the foreign investor is satisfied that the country has put political
violence and instability behind it and has the capacity to develop
competitive advantage in specific areas, the nagging question remains: why
should South Africa be different from the rest of the continent?
Mr Keys brushes all doubts aside. 'South Africa is totally different -
always has been,' he says, putting his finger on what few would dispute is
the country's single most important advantage - its powerful,
battle-hardened, diversified private sector. 'We have' he says, 'a lot of
indigenous capital here making a return and which has every intention of
going on doing that.'

people in waiting - Patti Waldmeir identifies who's who in the new South

AFTER nearly four years in the news, everyone knows Messrs Nelson Mandela
and FW de Klerk, who are likely to remain the two most important men in
South African politics. Their relationship will change: Mr Mandela is
overwhelmingly likely to take over as president, while Mr de Klerk will be
relegated to the status of second deputy president, behind another deputy
from the ANC who will act as de facto prime minister to Mr Mandela. But
their strengths and weaknesses will remain the same, however their titles
may change: to the outside world, they are largely a known quantity.
But the new government will be influenced by a host of politicians whom
outsiders know either less well, or not at all. Some have emerged from the
trade union movement, some from the ranks of the African National Congress
in exile, some from its guerrilla wing and others from the enlightened wing
of the National Party. Others still come from Inkatha, or the corporate
world.
Predicting who will be who in the new South Africa is inevitably an inexact
science: partly, it will depend on the scramble, only now beginning, to
reach the top of each party's electoral list (voters will not choose
individual members of parliament, but will vote a straight party list).
Lists will be chosen by parties themselves: in the case of the ANC, after
strong input from the membership.
But some individuals seem almost certain to rise to the top of the pile,
whether electorally, or by exercising influence outside parliament. They
are:
Thabo Mbeki: recently promoted to the post of ANC national chairman, Mr
Mbeki could well fill the post of first deputy president under Mr Mandela.
(This post might naturally have gone to Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary
general, but he insists he does not want it). Mr Mbeki, for many years the
head of the ANC's department of international affairs, is urbane, moderate,
articulate and the darling of the business community.
Son of one of the ANC's most famous elder statesmen - radical Govan Mbeki,
83, who is now retired - Mr Mbeki was born in 1942 and took an MA in
economics from Sussex University. During nearly 30 years in exile, he
developed the kind of middle-class tastes which reassure whites, and cheer
the hearts of foreign investors: nattily dressed and puffing on the
ubiquitous pipe, Mr Mbeki speaks the language of the monied classes while
mysteriously retaining grassroots support at the same time.
Cyril Ramaphosa: No less charming than Mr Mbeki - and becoming a rapid
convert to South Africa's unrivalled version of the 'good life' - Mr
Ramaphosa insists he will not enter parliament, but will stay to build the
ANC for the crucial, post-liberation elections in 1999. Mr Ramaphosa had a
solid popular base in the National Union of Mineworkers which he left to
become ANC secretary-general in 1991 but has spent almost all his time since
locked in negotiations with the government and other parties. His image has
suffered as talks have dragged on, and he risks being blamed for concessions
made; but the truth is that this witty 41-year-old, a consummate negotiator,
has outmanoeuvred the government on many crucial issues, and delivered a
deal which favours the ANC. His economic views lean toward the socialist -
though he keeps them hidden - and he is likely to prove effective in
building the ANC's constituency.
Derek Keys: Mr Mandela can send no more powerful signal to foriegn investors
than to keep Mr Keys on as finance minister in the new Government. As
National Party minister of finance, Mr Keys, 62, has trodden carefully with
the anti-apartheid opposition, bringing them along with him every step of
the way to a new debt rescheduling deal, a joint pitch on foreign
investment, and a commitment on fiscal discipline to the International
Monetary Fund. After 30 years as one of South Africa's top businessmen, Mr
Keys is a technocrat rather than a politician, and may well survive into the
new era. Likewise, his respected counterpart at the South African Reserve
Bank (central bank), Chris Stals, who has done much to tame inflation and
restore international financial credibility.
Roelf Meyer: chief government negotiator, Mr Meyer, 46, hails from the ranks
of the enlightened nationalists. He and colleagues Leon Wessels, Dawie de
Villiers and Sam de Beer see a bright multiracial future where whites will
continue to exercise influence by virtue of their strength in the civil
service, the economy and the security forces.
Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist Party, has arguably done
more to deliver a moderate constitutional deal than anyone apart from Mr
Mandela himself. Despite his socialist economic views, he is likely to be a
force for pragmatism for some time to come. Jacob Zuma, one of the few
leading Zulus in the ANC, is almost guaranteed a top position. Sober and
reasonable, he has handled delicate negotiations with Inkatha well. Tokyo
Sekwale, voted the sexiest man in Johannesburg in a recent radio poll, is a
charismatic populist of far more radical views; he is likely to try to push
ANC economic policies in a radical direction. Sam Shilowa, recently elected
general secretary of the largest union federation, Cosatu, will fight for
union independence under the new government, and will not be shy to use his
power if government forgets its commitments to the masses. Moses Mayekiso,
head of the South African National Civic Organisation, will also prove a
radical focus.
Last and most difficult to assess, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the
Inkatha Freedom Party, will play a principal role from within or without the
new government. With his irritable and unpredictable personality, he is
likely to prove difficult to manage, whether he accepts or rejects the deal.
Only time will tell which he will choose.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (3): A
convenient cohabitation - Industrial relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress is heading for power next April with the
Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the country's main labour
grouping, as its chief backer. Former Cosatu organisers will be prominent on
the ANC slate of election candidates, and the ideological compatibility
between the two is close.
Still, however, their relationship is little more than a convenient
cohabitation. Backroom spats and whispered recriminations are becoming more
audible, though both parties will continue to attempt to stifle such noises
until after polling day.
A break-up is likeliest to come in the 1994 public sector pay round, when
Cosatu will demand its palimony.
Last Thursday, Cosatu called off a one-day national strike planned for
Monday - aimed largely at curbing employers' constitutional rights on
lockouts - after the ANC leadership made clear that it would not countenance
such disruption in what should be a triumphal week. Cosatu leaders, summoned
to private talks at the World Trade Centre, were provided with a face-saving
formula but no real gains.
Mr Sam Shilowa, Cosatu's new general secretary, is unrepentant. 'Trade union
independence is very important,' he says. 'Cosatu would be foolish if it
cannot look at the (draft) constitution and ask what issues would adversely
affect its own members.'
Asked what the threatened stay away, followed by climbdown, achieved, he
adds: 'One can say that the struggle for worker rights has begun. We are not
a junior partner or appendage of the ANC.' Disagreements between the two, in
other words, would not always end in this way.
Mr Andrew Levy, a labour consultant, warns: 'Cosatu will determine what
happens to this economy.'
With some 1.2m members spanning sectors from mining to textiles to banking
to teaching, Cosatu has an agenda which is in some ways supplementary to
that of the ANC and in others places differing stresses or priorities on the
same basic goals.
As would be expected, both say they will seek to ensure an end to workplace
discrimination, on gender and other grounds as well as race. Beyond that,
they require affirmative action to purge the legacy of apartheid.
Neither of these is yet much of an issue for large employers, particularly
multinationals which have been running ahead of the game in promoting
blacks. Unsurprising disgruntlement is being heard from some white staff in
such companies, but rather more acute workplace difficulties may surface
next year if black unions decide that, even so, the pace of change is not to
their satisfaction.
What is likely to set the ANC and Cosatu apart is wage restraint. This would
be part of 'co-determination', currently the most commonly bandied catch
phrase in industrial relations. Mr Shilowa professes not to know what it
means - and fairly so, because its usage seems to vary.
In the public sector, the implication from the ANC government-in-waiting is
that black workers are already substantially better off than the 45 per cent
or so who are without any formal employment. Thus they should accept wage
rises next year substantially below the country's 9 per cent inflation rate
so that cash can be channelled to upliftment programmes elsewhere. In
return, unions should be given a say in reconstruction and development
planning.
Private sector companies, equally loath to make inflationary pay awards, are
here and there offering seats on the board for labour representatives to
instil a sense of participation in decision making. From Cosatu's point of
view, though, these are often baubles rather than ballast for its cause.
Some sort of accommodation between labour and capital is necessary to set
the new dispensation on course; all but the most radical agree, but attempts
at cosmetic corporatism are being treated with suspicion. Labour activists
are demanding that a strategic view be taken across each industry, with
retrenchments and new entrants alike being given equal scrutiny. To take
three examples:
At the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) - one of
Cosatu's two largest member unions along with the National Union of
Mineworkers - Mr Bernie Fanaroff maintains that some of the country's
vehicle assemblers are already matching the cost structures of plants in
Asia. But, he adds, the three dozen model variants for new cars are too
numerous for the market, and further productivity improvements may depend on
following Australia in shedding whole ranges.
Never mind cars. Mr Shilowa, arguing for an audit of where investment is
most needed, asks simply: 'Why don't we produce bicycles?' All are imported,
most of them from Taiwan.
Charity shops selling second-hand clothes donated from Japan and North
America have at times been occupied by protesting members of the South
African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu) on the grounds that even
such outlets might erode their jobs. The union is now, however,
concentrating on the real threat to employment in its industry posed by
prospective Gatt reductions in import tariffs.
What the three have in common is a recognition that solutions to labour
questions within specific companies will not in themselves secure, let alone
increase, jobs. On imports, there is an acceptance that tariffs will have to
be lowered in many instances, but unions argue that this should happen only
after inefficiencies have been sorted out and an upgrade taken place in
manufacturing technology run down by sanctions and a general decline in
capital spending.
Such talks would happen on a tripartite basis among employers, unions and
government, and foreign investors would have to accept that they did not
have an unfettered right to manage, Mr Shilowa makes clear.
'We want to be involved in industrial restructuring,' he says. 'To improve
productivity, one has to feel a sense of ownership.'
He offers some assurances: unions would keep their side of the bargain and
could not justify breaking a wage agreement within its lifespan. But any
other grievances which surface would be dealt with as Cosatu saw fit. 'If
co-determination means we are prepared to work with employers - yes. If it
means us entering into social pacts without being allowed to strike - no.'

ahead - The political parties

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S first elections are likely to be dominated by the issue of
liberation from apartheid, and as the primary party of liberation, the
African National Congress (ANC) can count on a large 'vote of thanks' from
black South Africans.
With the widely respected Mr Nelson Mandela as leader, the ANC is expected
to win the largest share of the vote - recent opinion polls have shown its
support at between 46 and 58 per cent, though pollsters believe a two-thirds
vote for the ANC is possible if many of the 25 per cent undecided voters
choose not to vote at all (an outcome which would favour the ANC, whose
voters are more motivated).
ANC policies are not likely to exert a significant influence on voting
patterns in the first elections; opposition will come from those who accuse
the ANC of involvement in violence, or from those who view the organisation
as Xhosa-dominated (many top ANC officials belong to the Xhosa tribe).
The ANC's stated goal is to create a non-racial multi-party democracy with a
mixed economy.
National Party
The new multi-racial National Party appeals primarily to ethnic minorities
such as whites, Coloureds and Indians, though it may also win a substantial
number of votes from blacks who fear domination by the ANC, or who yearn for
law and order.
The National Party's share of recent opinion polls has fallen as low as 11
per cent though it seems likely that this represents a protest vote which
could disappear. Most Afrikaners, along with most other whites, are likely
to vote for the National Party, along with a large share, perhaps a
majority, of Coloureds and Indians. The party's policy is similar to that of
the ANC: multi-party democracy with a free enterprise economy (probably
freer than that envisaged by the ANC); but the National Party also pledges
to fight for minority rights.
Inkatha Freedom Party
Primarily a Zulu party based in Natal, the IFP can probably also claim
substantial white support in its regional base. The IFP scores poorly in
opinion polls (9 per cent) which focus on towns. However, IFP support is
concentrated in rural Zululand and in townships where violence makes polling
difficult.
The IFP, like the other two parties, supports multi-party democracy and free
enterprise, but believes in strong regional government. It is likely to
fight the election on a law and order ticket.
Conservative Party
The white-supremacist Conservative Party gained 800,000 white votes in the
1992 referendum though its support has certainly waned since then.
Still, it represents the only home for whites who reject the new South
Africa, and wish to cast a protest vote. It seems unlikely to win a major
share of the vote nationally, and may not even win a majority of Afrikaners.
Democratic Party
South Africa's liberal party, the Democratic Party will be lucky to get the
5 per cent of the national vote required for a seat in the cabinet. Though
it, too, fought apartheid through the decades, the DP is likely to reap no
liberation bonus. Viewed as a weak party, it has no obvious constituency
except affluent whites in Johannesburg and some Coloureds and blacks.
Pan Africanist Congress
This ultra-radical black party scores in low single figures in opinion
polls. It is likely to fare badly in the first election, although its policy
of rejecting accommodation with whites could well become more popular,
particularly among young unemployed black South Africans, if the first
post-apartheid government fails to deliver immediate fruits of victory. The
PAC is a socialist party and its policies are basically pro-black and
racist.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (1): A new
nation starts to take shape - Nearly four years after Nelson Mandela's
release, South Africa begins a fresh era
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
YESTERDAY South Africa broke the twisted mould of apartheid, and cast away
the bits.
After decades spent fighting the tide of history, which submerged other
racist regimes long ago, South Africa yesterday opted to join the modern
world. It can now play a full role at the United Nations, rejoin the
Commonwealth, become a member of the Organisation of African Unity, and play
a much-needed, constructive role in the development of southern Africa and
beyond.
Yesterday's agreement on a post-apartheid constitution is the first
irrevocable step on the path to full democracy; but it is only a first step.
The next few months and years will show whether South Africa's tenure as a
democratic nation will be nasty, brutish and short, or stable, happy and
prosperous; whether it will substitute black domination for white
repression; whether it will defy the logic of divided societies worldwide,
and nurture true multi-ethnic democracy.
Though the mould of apartheid has been broken, Africa provides other
unfortunate models for the new state: tyrannical regimes which abused power,
crushed dissent and lay waste whole economies through maladministration,
corruption and theft.
South African politicians, black and white, bridle at the comparison:
Finance Minister Derek Keys offers the consensus view when he insists that
South Africa 'will be totally different from the rest of Africa. It always
has been and it always will be'.
Economically, that is obviously so. Mr Keys points to South Africa's clear
superiority in terms of 'indigenous capital', both human and financial. The
new leaders will manage the continent's most powerful economy, with gross
domestic product equal to 75 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's gdp, with an
economic hinterland which stretches as far north as Zaire, generating half
of Africa's electricity. Even in broader international terms, it compares
well: with a well developed stock market, banking sector, and body of
company law, South Africa offers more to the investor than, for example,
eastern Europe; and with foreign debt at USDollars 17.3bn, or 15 per cent of
gdp, it is underborrowed by any standard.
In political terms, too, South Africa is different. In 1957, when Ghana
became the first African nation to gain independence from Britain, Kwame
Nkrumah inherited a position of largely unfettered power. But South Africa's
first black president - likely to be the African National Congress leader,
Nelson Mandela - will find his room for manoeuvre far more circumscribed, in
law, and more importantly, in fact.
'South Africa is too big for the ANC,' says one ANC member who bemoans the
complexity of a society which imposes manifold constraints on the party of
government: he believes they will inhibit the ANC's ability to transform
South Africa virtuously; others welcome these constraints as curbs to abuse
of power. But all would agree that South Africa does not fit the classic
African mould of a society which easily falls prey to bad government.
Strong interest groups counterbalance the power of government: chief among
them is a strong, diversified and battle-hardened corporate sector; the
1.2m-strong labour federation Cosatu, historically allied to the ANC, has
recently begun flexing its independent muscle, and is well organised and
powerful enough to play the role of democracy's watchdog. The highly
politicised and motivated township 'civics', or community associations,
could also prove an important check on government power: for South Africa's
'masses' are not the fawning crowd which greeted Kwame Nkrumah, African
liberator; they are demanding, well organised, and used to fighting their
political corner.
The list of powerful interest groups outside the ANC's sphere goes on and
on: the 1.2m strong civil service is dominated by Afrikaners, who are
scarcely natural allies of the ANC. The defence force, though professional
and committed to supporting the government of the day, is also
Afrikaans-dominated, as is the police.
Last, and arguably least of the factors constraining an ANC government, is
the constitution agreed yesterday by the main political parties. That
constitution was meant to prevent majority domination through power sharing:
it was supposed to guarantee democracy by ensuring that the minority losers
in any majority-rule election would still enjoy a powerful say in
government. It falls some way short of so doing: minorities will be
represented in government, with every party earning 5 per cent of the
national vote entitled to a seat in cabinet; but the power of minority
parties in cabinet is precarious.
The ANC, which will have both a president and a deputy president, will have
its own way on any disputed decision. And though it has promised regular
consultation with the second deputy president, drawn from the second largest
party (probably Mr FW de Klerk, current president), he will have no
statutory powers to frustrate Mr Mandela's will.
The constitution fails to deliver other checks and balances which the ruling
National Party had insisted were essential. The party's 1991 constitutional
proposals called for political power to be divided between three tiers of
government - central, regional and local - with each tier to have 'original
and entrenched authority with which other tiers of government may not
interfere'.
In fact, central government retains wide powers to 'interfere' with regional
governments: the constitution authorises central government to intervene in
terms so vague (to impose uniform national norms and standards, to ensure
proper regulation, and where there are implications for national security or
economic policy) as seriously to undermine regional autonomy. And with
regions barred from imposing taxes without central government approval, it
is hard to accept Mr de Klerk's claim that the new state will be 'federal'.
National Party negotiators believe that they will not need entrenched
constitutional provisions to play a powerful role in restraining the ANC:
they believe the ANC's assurances that it does not wish to govern alone (and
does not believe it could do so effectively); and they judge their electoral
strength will give them an important say in cabinet, though only if they are
able to better their poll showing of 11 to 13 per cent.
But clearly, the National Party has settled well below its bottom line on
crucial issues; probably, it had no choice. As a minority government whose
power diminishes by the day, negotiators calculated that a deal done now
would be preferable to that available next month or next year. And whatever
the shortcomings of the constitution, agreement is better than continuing
deadlock. Though it is not strong enough, it is far from illiberal, and
should help to reinforce democratic forces.
But if South Africa does escape some of the more grotesque abuses of power
for which Africa is famous, it is scarcely likely to become a prosperous
liberal democracy overnight.
The new bill of rights enshrines tough emergency powers which can be used to
restore stability after the April 27 elections. Agreement seems to exist
between the ANC and NP that restoring stability, through temporary
repression, is the highest post-election priority.
According to this scenario, democracy will be a temporary casualty while the
new government pursues stability and economic development; and if it
succeeds in restoring law and order without repeating the oppression of the
past, it will be widely popular with an electorate (white and black) fed up
with crime and violence.
Much will depend on whether the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi can be persuaded to participate in next year's
elections: though he has made clear that he rejects yesterday's
constitution, he could decide he has more to gain by fighting rather than
boycotting an election. If he actively opposes the poll, the security
situation could become untenable, especially if the white right wing, now in
tactical alliance with Inkatha, also opposes the election. The ANC and NP
must guarantee that there is critical mass at the political centre, and that
the crackdown need only suppress the lunatic fringe. If Inkatha and the
right wing, with their numbers and their firepower, are to be suppressed in
unison, stability may be unattainable.
But in the end, it is economics - and not politics - which will seal South
Africa's fate. For yesterday's constitution marks a decisive shift in
electoral power from the 'haves' to the 'have-nots' of South African
society.'
Popular expectations will soon strain the intentions of even the most
benevolent government; at that point, it must either give in to populism, or
suppress it.
The latter now seems most likely: the new South Africa will start with a
hefty dollop of the old. That will be unfortunate, but bearable; what will
destroy South Africa's democratic prospects forever is failure to deliver a
better economic deal to the masses. It is a tall order.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norske Shell says leaking tank
shut down platform

NORSKE SHELL, the Norwegian subsidiary of the Royal/Dutch Shell group,
disclosed yesterday that two small holes in one of seven storage tanks of
the NKr2bn (Pounds 180m) Draugen concrete oil platform had caused an
estimated 1m tonnes of crude oil to leak into the Norwegian Sea.
The leak was discovered late on Sunday and production of 20,000 barrels a
day was shut down for a period of 36-hours. Shell said that it had deployed
the Seaway Condor diving vessel, which is equipped with a remotely-operated
underwater robotic vehicle, to make video recordings of the leaking areas of
the storage tank.
The holes in the tank had not affected the structural integrity of the oil
platform, Shell said, adding that safety of the platform was not endangered.
The company said that there had still been a small stream of crude oil
leaking from the tank yesterday.
The concrete, single tower platform was constructed by Norwegian Contractors
 -a subsidiary of Norway's Aker group - which has contributed to the
membership of a four-man team established by the two companies to determine
a course of action to repair the tank.
NC has built 15 concrete platforms over the past 20 years - including the
Sleipner A platform, which sank in the west Norwegian Gands fjord in August
1991.
Aker's shares were little affected yesterday on the Oslo bourse by the
disclosure. A-shares closed down NKr0.50 to NKr85 and B-shares lost NKr1.50
to NKr92.
The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the country's oil industry watchdog,
yesterday received a preliminary report on the incident from Shell, but a
final report will not be available until the underwater vehicle's
inspections are completed.
Bad weather and water depth of 280m had made the inspections of the storage
tank difficult, but not impossible, Shell said.
The leaking tank has been drained of oil and re-filled with water.
Draugen's seven seabed tanks have the capacity to store 1.4m barrels of oil,
or about 11 days' production.
The platform came on stream on October 19 and is expected to achieve a
plateau production rate of 90,000-95,000 barrels a day by the middle of next
year.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India expects cotton crop close
to last year's record
</HEADLINE>

INDIA EXPECTS to harvest another bumper cotton crop of 13.5m bales (170kg
each) during the season that began in September, only marginally down from
last season's record.
'A 13.5m bale crop is only the beginning of the season forecast,' said an
official of the Eastern India Textile Mills Association. 'As has always been
the case in the past the crop estimate will keep changing as the season
progresses. Last year, the initial crop estimate was only 12m bales. But we
finally ended up with a record production of 13.6m bales. All this happens
because the country so far has not been able to develop a reliable crop
forecasting system.'
According to the government-owned Cotton Corporation of India, among the
major cotton growing states in the country, Maharashtra is expected to
record an output rise of 250,000 bales to 2.3m and Madhya Pradesh's
production is projected to be 200,000 bales higher at 1.2m. However, there
will be a major crop loss of over 450,000 bales, to 1.8m, in Gujarat, where
large areas suffered drought.
The cotton crop will be maintained in other major centres, like Punjab,
Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The quality of the crop
is reported to be satisfactory.
As India opened the season with comfortable stocks of nearly 3.3m bales and
it is heading for a bumper crop, the government has announced the first
instalment of export quota of 500,000 bales for 1993-94. Last year the
country exported 1.3m bales out of a total sanctioned quota of nearly 1.8m.
India releases cotton exports in stages, depending on the progress of the
harvest. This policy attempts to ensure remunerative prices to growers and
adequate supplies to textile mills. Indian mill consumption in the current
season is expected to be 11.5m bales and non-mill consumption 800,000 bales.
The organisations of growers and traders have found in the agriculture
ministry a champion of freedom of cotton exports. According to the
parliamentary committee on agriculture, the ad hoc export policy is not
farmer-friendly and India should remove all controls on cotton exports. The
committee believes there is scope, through improved productivity, to
increase exports to 2m bales a year. India manages an average yield of only
270kg a hectare, compared with the world average of 600kg.
According to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, cotton export
prices in the current season are likely to remain below average, even though
imports are projected to increase by 200,000 tonnes to 6.1m tonnes. Latin
American importers are expected to account for most of the rise.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A QUARTER of the Earth's plants and animals are in danger of extinction in
the next 30 years, raising fears for food supplies for future generations,
according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the
United Nations.
Global food production will have to increase by more than 60 per cent in the
next 25 years, the organisation estimates, and 'biodiversity' is essential
for this. Yet about three-quarters of the genetic diversity of agricultural
crops have been lost since the beginning of the century, says the FAO, 'and
the world is increasingly dependent on fewer and fewer crop varieties'.
The world's population obtains about 90 per cent of its calories from 30
crop species, it says. Four plants - rice, maize, wheat and potatoes -
account for 50 per cent of total calorific intake. Yet there are an
estimated 75,000 potential food species in existence, many of them in the
tropical forests.
While the introduction of high-yielding varieties of rice, wheat and maize,
under the so-called 'green revolution' has raised yields, it has caused the
replacement of thousands of local varieties of those crops by a few,
genetically very uniform varieties. That loss of biodiversity means less
plant breeding material is available for the development of new strains of
crops, the FAO warns. If a disease wipes out a crop, it is considered vital
to have new strains available for farmers so that output can be maintained.
The organisation was one of the chief supporters of the green revolution in
the 1960s, but it now stresses that 'intensified food production can be
achieved by the sustainable use of a broader range of species and genetic
material'.
'Biodiversity is the source of economic and food security,' says the FAO's
director-general, Mr Edouard Saouma. The world's richest nations contain the
least diversity, while the poorest countries have the richest reserves,
'which underscores the interdependency of all nations'.
Tropical forests and woodlands contain at least 50 per cent of all known
plant and animal species, but are being destroyed at the rate of 15.4m
hectares a year, the FAO estimates, causing reductions in the number of
species. It believes only about 10 per cent of those forests are being
managed in a way that will enable the output of timber to be sustained.
Properly managed tropical forests could provide both timber and non-wood
products while safeguarding genetic resources. A number of studies have
shown that harvesting non-timber products is more remunerative than logging
trees or burning them down.
One study estimated that a hectare of forest on Mishana, Peru, produced
fruits and rubber worth Dollars 700 a year. After deducting collecting and
transport costs, net annual revenues to farmers were just over Dollars 400 a
year. If a farmer with a hectare of trees chopped them down, earnings would
come to around Dollars 1,000. In that situation it therefore paid farmers to
leave the trees standing and to harvest fruits and rubber from them to earn
a regular annual income.
The FAO says the rate of extinction of animal breeds has increased
dramatically in the past 100 years, mostly due to the highly specialised
nature of modern livestock production. Animal production contributes about
30 per cent to the total global value of food and agriculture. About a fifth
of existing breeds are at risk of extinction the FAO estimates, with
endangered breeds more likely to be in developing countries.
Although the world fish catch has more than quadrupled over the last 40
years, it is now under considerable pressure, with over-fishing and the use
of intensive modern technology having a damaging impact on many fish stocks.
The catch in 1992 declined for the third year in a row, to just under 97m
tonnes, compared with a record 100m tonnes in 1989.
The overall figures hide an even steeper decline in the fish caught at sea,
the FAO says. In 1992, the marine catch was about 80m tonnes, down from
about 86m tonnes in 1989.
Commercial fleets are driving some fish species close to biological
extinction, destroying natural ecosystems such as coral reefs and seagrass
beds. Climate change could affect stocks of fish 'in an unpredictable
fashion'; global warming could cause changes in the marine habitats and
plankton that might lead to shifts in distribution and production.
The FAO plans a major conference on biodiversity in 1995. 'Biodiversity is a
life-support for the planet - cut it off and we will die,' warns Edouard
Saouma.

Turkmenistan, the gas-rich Central Asian republic, has awarded two tenders
to western companies to explore and develop some of its oil-fields, one to
Occidental Petroleum of the US and another to a US-Turkish consortium,
Interfax news agency reported yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Occidental was reported to have paid a bonus of more than Dollars 20m to
develop the Burun oil field, in western Turkmenistan, with known reserves of
35m tonnes.
A consortium called Oil Capital-Lapis Holding won the right, paying a bonus
of Dollars 30m, to develop offshore reserves in the Caspian Sea. A tender
for another oil-field, Barsa-Gelmez with reserves of 31m tonnes, was not
awarded because interested companies needed more time to prepare their bids.

There were some signs this week that the wool market recovery might have
spent itself, if only for the time being. In Australia the market indicator
after rising to 511 cents a kg. fell back to 503 yesterday, and clearances
at two of the three selling centres, Fremantle and Sydney, were less than
90%. softness in the Australian dollar has also had a slight cheapening
effect for buyers in many countries. A setback after almost three months of
rising prices and an advance of 25% overall is not causing great concern in
the trade.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY farm ministers yesterday broadly agreed measures to
reinforce controls on subsidised exports to prevent fraud, Belgian farm
minister Andre Bourgeois said, reports Reuter from Brussels.
'Ministers achieved virtual unanimity. . . they just need to finalise the
text,' added Mr Bourgeois, whose country is the current holder the EC
presidency, after a meeting of the community's agriculture council.
Under the plan officials would be given flexibility to concentrate
inspections where the risk of fraud was greatest. They would be required to
inspect 5 per cent of all subsidised exports, instead of 5 per cent in each
product sector as at present.
Customs officials at EC frontiers would also check a certain volume of
exports cleared in the interior to safeguard against substitution of goods.
'It's a confidence building measure for member states and for the public,'
the Belgian minister said.
The ministers will discuss the issue again at the next agriculture council,
which is scheduled to start on December 13.

London Commodity Exchange COFFEE and COCOA prices moved higher in the
afternoon. Cocoa, after only a slightly steadier morning, took off with a
vengeance in late trading afternoon, the near March jumping Pounds 13 at one
point to Pounds 1,027 a tonne, the highest second position's highest level
since July, 1988. Dealers said the market was running into little or no
producer selling, which was helping to accentuate the rise. But they thought
strong resistance was likely before Pounds 1,050. An absence of producer
selling was also cited as a factor in coffee's continued advance, which took
the January position to Dollars 1,296 a tonne at the close, up Dollars 40.
Base metal prices rallied from earlier lows during late trading at the
London Metal Exchange. The three months delivery COPPER price rallied from
Dollars 1,630 a tonne on speculative buying and short-covering, touching
Dollars 1,640 before closing at Dollars 1,634, down Dollars 7 from Tuesday.
The ALUMINIUM market found strong support on dips towards the Dollars
1,050-a-tonne level for three months metal, which bounced to close at
Dollars 1,056.50, a tonne up Dollars 6.50 on the day.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ to spend Dollars 500m at
Utah copper complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, is to spend USDollars
500m over five years to expand and upgrade tailings (waste) facilities at
its Bingham Canyon copper complex in Utah.
This takes RTZ's financial commitment at Bingham to Dollars 1.4bn as it has
already started a Dollars 880m project to build a new smelter that will take
annual copper output from 155,000 to 272,000 tonnes and use up all
production of concentrate (an intermediate material). At present Bingham
sells 50 to 60 per cent of its concentrate.
Also, Kennecott, the RTZ subsidiary that operates Bingham, recently finished
an expansion of the concentrator costing Dollars 219m. Kennecott is the
third-largest copper producer in the US, with about 15 per cent of the
nation's supply.
The tailings expansion will eventually cover 4,100 acres and is designed to
provide waste storage for Bingham for the next 25 to 30 years. Kennecott
hopes permits will be awarded in time for construction to start early next
year, which will enable the project to be completed in 1998.
Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer, has reached agreement
for a group of international banks to provide USDollars 105m for its heap
leach joint venture near the Muruntau mine in Uzbekistan, the biggest open
pit gold mine in the world.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide half the
money and a group of 13 commercial banks are putting up the rest. EBRD said
this was the first mining project finance it had provided, it was the first
syndicated financing for the former Soviet Union and the first limited
recourse private sector loan for Uzbekistan in any of the capital markets.
Newmont estimates the cost of the project, where its heap-leach technology
will be used to extract at least 5m troy ounces of gold from old waste dumps
at Muruntau over 16 years, will be Dollars 150m. Production at the so-called
Zarafshan-Newmont joint venture is scheduled to start in early 1995 at the
rate of 450,000 ounces a year. Annual output over the life of the project is
forecast to average 310,000 ounces.
Newmont's joint venture partners are Uzbekistan's state committee of geology
and mineral resources and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combinat, each
with 25 per cent.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco sees nickel market heading
for deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE IS building that points to a big cut in Russian nickel production
and exports. This has lead Inco of Canada, the largest western producer, to
claim that nickel supply and demand are virtually in balance this year and
the market is heading for a deficit in 1994.
Sumitomo Metal, Japan's leading nickel producer, has publicly predicted that
Russian nickel exports to the west will plunge by 35 per cent to 85,000
tonnes this year from an estimated 130,000 tonnes in 1992.
Mr Mars Altibaev, logistics manager for Norilsk of Russia, the world's
biggest producer, joined the debate yesterday when he told a Metal Bulletin
conference in Florida that his country's nickel exports in 1993 and 1994
would be no more than 90,000 tonnes each year. He suggested that Norilsk's
output this year would be at least 20,000 tonnes below recent western
estimates of 230,000 tonnes.
The International Nickel Study Group estimates that world nickel production
fell by 70,900 tonnes or 11 per cent in the first nine months of 1993, to
581,300 tonnes, and that most of the drop occurred in the Confederation of
Independent States. The INSG calculated production in the CIS plunged by
more than 30 per cent, by 57,000 to 126,000 tonnes, in the nine months.
Inco 'guestimates' that Russian production will be flat at about 180,000
tonnes in 1994 and that in the first quarter of next year world demand will
exceed supply by 50m lb (22,686 tonnes).
'I believe the stories we hear from all quarters, including Norilsk, of
reduced Russian production are correct,' says Mr Peter Salathiel, Inco's
executive vice president of marketing.
'Mining problems abound, essential equipment and supplies seem to be
lacking. The result is an involuntary production cut of truly staggering
proportions - some 120,000 tonnes or 265m lb in two years.
As for Russian exports, Mr Salathiel suggests that supply to the west of
'backdoor' - or illegally exported - nickel has dropped sharply this year
since Norilsk took over from the state the allocation system for Russian
consumers. Previously some customers were exporting nickel illegally in
order to survive a big fall in domestic consumption. 'Knowing its customers,
Norilsk has been better able to match deliveries with customer requirements
and hence the supply of backdoor nickel has been sharply reduced,' says Mr
Salathiel.
He suggests that total imports of Russian nickel to the west will fall by
40,000 tonnes to a 'miserly' 80,000 tonnes next year.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Belgium interest rate cuts inspire
continental markets
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN and UK government bond prices soared yesterday, propelled by hopes
of lower interest rates.
Belgium provided the main inspiration for the continental bond markets as
the combination of a government economic recovery plan and sharp cuts in key
interest rates lifted bond prices by as much as a point.
The Belgian 10-year yield spread over German government bonds - which was
about 120 basis points earlier in the month - narrowed from 109 to 94 basis
points at one stage yesterday but ended at around 98 basis points.
The Belgian government's package of spending cuts and tax increases, aimed
at reducing the deficit while lifting competitiveness and employment,
allowed the central bank to cut its key interest rates.
The Belgian rate moves inspired rallies in several other European markets,
raising hopes of interest rate cuts elsewhere, while expectations that the
North American Free Trade Agreement would pass contributed to the markets'
generally enthusiastic mood.
FRENCH bonds ended sharply higher on hopes of a near-term rate cut by the
Bank of France.
Although the German market was closed for a public holiday yesterday, the
Liffe bund futures contract ended a quarter of a point higher on the day,
having traded in a range of 99.95 to 100.35 and ending at around 100.27.
While there is some speculation that the Bundesbank may announce cuts in the
key German interest rates today at the regular council meeting, dealers said
the majority view appeared to be for an easing in December. The
keenly-watched money supply figures are due this week while cost-of-living
data is expected next week.
NEWS of a sharp fall in inflation and a weaker-than-expected increase in
retail sales led to a sudden jump in UK government bond prices and renewed
speculation of a base rate cut in the near future.
Gilt prices rose across the board and ended as much as a point higher on the
day. The rally enabled the Bank of England to sell the remainder of its
outstanding tap issues.
LONG-DATED Japanese government bonds bounced back to life late in Tokyo
trading, with the result that cash and futures prices ended higher on the
day.
The market started on a weak note as medium-dated issues - which enjoyed
much of the recent rally in the bond market - underperformed and dragged the
rest down.
However, shortly before the futures market closed the market surged on
strong domestic investor interest and dealers covering short positions.
LONGER-dated US Treasury prices fell back after early gains on hopes of a
Nafta approval from Congress.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/8 at 101
13/16 , yielding 6.184 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.059 per cent.
Although trading remained quiet, dealers had been confident that the House
of Representatives would pass the trade pact and longer-dated prices rose in
the morning.
Prices had been aided by expectations that the Federal Reserve would conduct
a coupon pass - an outright purchase of government securities - to meet
seasonal reserve requirements. Prices fell when the coupon pass did not
materialise.
THE Spanish Treasury will make its first issue of 15-year bonds in the
domestic market on December 2, the longest maturity previously being 10
years, Reuter reports from Madrid. The issue will carry a coupon of 8.20 per
cent, with amortisation in 2009. The Bank of Spain said the minimum amount
in this first tranche would be Pta100bn.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Argentaria sale raises
Pta170bn for Spain

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, the banking corporation controlled by the Spanish government,
netted about Pta170bn for the Spanish exchequer yesterday when it placed 25
per cent of its equity on the domestic and international markets in its
second public share offering this year.
The share issue, which took place just six months after the the
corporation's first share offer, brought the government- held equity stake
in Argentaria down to just over 50 per cent.
In spite of setting a price of Pta6,050 per share which was at the top of
its previously announced range, Argentaria's paper was heavily
oversubscribed.
The offer price represented a 5.61 per cent discount on Tuesday's closing
price of Pta6,410 and demand among US and UK investors was between four and
five times the available paper.
The strong bids for Argentaria shares mirrored the success of the earlier
placement when the equity was offered at a price of Pta3,800 and was also
strongly oversubscribed.
Investor interest has been fuelled by firm third-quarter results and by the
potential for further growth on the back of cross-selling among the group's
well-established niche units.
Argentaria controls a group of state-owned financial institutions which
include the post office savings bank as well as units that are market
leaders in the domestic mortgage sector and in lending to the local
administration.
It is the fourth biggest group by market capitalisation on the Madrid stock
market after Endesa, the electrical utility, Telefonica and the energy group
Repsol.
Argentaria is 23 per cent owned by foreign institutions, although no single
share-holder owns more than 1 per cent.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is to issue about Dollars 500m in 10-year dollar-denominated
global bonds next month, refinancing debt falling due in December.
Mr Daniel Marx, finance under-secretary, said yesterday the new bonds would
'be an updated model of Argentina's traditional Bonex (external bonds) and a
blend of global Eurobonds'.
Argentina had Dollars 3.82bn in dollar-denominated Bonex outstanding in July
1993.
They enjoy an unrivalled reputation in the local market since the government
has never skipped an interest payment and never postponed repayment.
Argentine private and government borrowers have been issuing record volumes
of bonds on the Euromarket. However, the federal government has been rolling
over redemption, existing debt or reshaping its debt profile rather than
raising fresh funds.
Mr Marx said the new fixed interest Global Bonex would be priced early next
month.
The issue is being handled by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers of the US
and Argentina's Banco Rio. The bonds will be listed in US, European, Asian
and Latin American markets.
They will also be registered with the US Securities Exchange Commission.
Mr Marx said previous Bonex issues had been cumbersome, with settlement
requiring physical exchange of certificates, which inhibited trading. The
new global Bonex should benefit from improved settlement procedures and
therefore become more liquid.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Kepco launch hampered by investor
fatigue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR fatigue appeared to be hampering the launch yesterday of the first
global bond offering by Korea Electric Power Company, South Korea's
partially-privatised power utility.
Lead manager Lehman Brothers said it had seen strong demand for Kepco's
Dollars 1.35bn offering of 10-year global bonds following its international
roadshow and that it had built up a large book of more than Dollars 1bn.
However, Lehman Brothers acknowledged that other banks in the group were
finding that their bond allocations were selling slowly. Syndicate managers
in the group said that in some cases, investors who wanted to buy the bonds
had placed their orders through Lehman Brothers.
They noted that many investors had retreated to the sidelines and were
reluctant to take on new investments so close to the end of the year. In
addition, some investors were having to make credit decisions because of
Kepco's single-A rating.
As a result of the feedback from investors and the recent uncertainty in the
US Treasury market, the yield spread on Kepco's bonds was set at around 90
basis points over 10-year Treasuries, up from a target of 75 to 80 basis
points. The bonds are due to be priced today.
If Kepco's bonds are priced at 90 basis points over US Treasuries, they will
carry a coupon of about 6 1/2 per cent. Traders said this coupon should
appeal to investors looking for high-yielding paper.
Lehman Brothers expects about 65 per cent of the bonds to be placed in the
US where Kepco is well-known as a result of its issues in the Yankee market,
the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. US investors tend to be
more receptive than their European counterparts to borrowers with single-A
ratings. The remainder of the bonds are likely to be placed equally in
Europe and Asia Pacific.
Elsewhere, there was a flood of new issuance in the Euroyen sector and in
the Samurai market, the Japanese domestic bond market for foreign borrowers.
The Bank of Greece raised Y100bn in the Samurai market through a Y40bn
offering of four-year floating-rate notes and a Y60bn offering of 12-year
bonds. Lead manager Nomura said the different maturities reflected funding
needs.
Syndicate managers at Japanese banks said they expected more yen-denominated
issues to emerge before the end of the year since many borrowers believed
that Japanese interest rates were close to the bottom of their cycle.
A number of European sovereign borrowers are expected to tap this sector
soon.
The managers added that borrowers could achieve favourable terms in the yen
market because Japanese investors were willing to pay a little more in order
to avoid having any foreign exchange exposure.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Statoil borrows Dollars 1bn
through five-year loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, has raised Dollars 1bn through a
five-year syndicated loan. The loan will re-finance two expiring revolving
credit facilities totalling Dollars 600m and raise fresh funds for the
company.
Bankers involved in the deal said that the lack of high-quality corporate
borrowers seeking to raise funds in the syndicated loans market had enabled
Statoil to achieve aggressive pricing.
Banks had been willing to agree to the terms in the hope that it would lead
to more business with Statoil.
Statoil said that 41 banks had been involved in the expiring facilities but
that a core group of 19 banks were participating in the new loan.
Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan are joint co-ordinators of the loan, which is
due to be signed on November 24.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Wall St savours Boston Chicken -
The fast-food chain had a successful IPO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boston Chicken, a fledgling fast-food chain, became the new darling of Wall
Street last week. It launched the most successful initial public offering in
two years, as investors snapped up the shares in the belief that the
company, a relative newcomer, would be more than just flavour of the month.
The recipe that attracted investors to Boston Chicken is a promising
marketing concept and an experienced management team. Analysts, however,
questioned whether the willingness of small investors to take a risk was
prudent.
In last Tuesday's IPO on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market in New York, the
stock sizzled from the opening bell. With 1.9m shares, or about 10 per cent
of the company, offered at Dollars 20 each, trading started at Dollars 45
1/4 , and the issue climbed as high as Dollars 51 before closing at Dollars
48 1/2 .
At that price, the company, which two years ago operated only 33
restaurants, was valued at more than Dollars 800m.
Ms Linda Killian, analyst at Renaissance Capital of Greenwich, Connecticut,
said there had been much talk before the launch of the IPO, intensifying
buying pressure from small investors who were excluded from the Dollars
20-a-share offering.
The company, based in Chicago, started eight years ago with one restaurant
in Newtonville, Massachusetts, just west of Boston, and has quickly grown to
175 locations. It was acquired by a group led by several former executives
of Blockbuster Entertainment in March 1992.
Chicken, of course, is no stranger to fast food. The new wrinkle pioneered
by the Boston Chicken is roasting it on a spit, rather than frying it. The
menu is rounded off with family-style side-dishes, such as mashed potatoes,
corn bread and steamed vegetables.
So the chain provides fast-food customers with healthy, back-to-basics
options to burgers and french fries, while retaining snappy service and low
prices.
With Americans becoming more health conscious, the concept seems to have
struck a chord and many industry observers believe it will grow in
popularity.
Sales of roasted chicken this year are expected to reach Dollars 2bn,
compared with sales of fried chicken at Dollars 7.5bn, according to the
annual Top 100 survey of fast-food restaurants conducted by Nation's
Restaurant News, a trade publication.
Boston Chicken is emphasising take-away meals, which account for about 70
per cent of its business, a much higher proportion than at other chains.
Mr Mark Stephens, chief financial officer, said a central pillar of their
marketing strategy was to capitalise on the increasing number of take-away
meals.
Most analysts agree Boston Chicken has strong potential. However, in the
light of its limited operating experience, many have raised questions over
its stock-market value.
As a result, the issue has started to lose some of its lustre. By the close
of trading on Tuesday, the share price stood at Dollars 42.
There is sufficient evidence to support a sceptical view. Revenues last year
were a mere Dollars 8.3m, and the company posted a net loss of Dollars 5.7m.
Even at Tuesday's Dollars 42 a share, the stock was trading at about 76
times estimated 1994 earnings of 55 cents a share. In 1995, net income is
estimated by analysts at 85 cents a share.
Mr David Lebowitz, senior vice-president and director of research at
Republic New York Securities, said it was difficult to justify the current
stock price.
'Boston Chicken is too young and too small to apply the normal yardsticks,'
he said.
In the short term, at least, Boston Chicken is poised for substantial
growth. The company said revenues in the nine months of 1993 were Dollars
28m, against Dollars 5m last year, and it has become marginally profitable.
Full-year turnover will reach Dollars 35m-Dollars 40m and Dollars
55m-Dollars 60m in 1994, according to Renaissance Capital's estimate.
The management has outlined an ambitious expansion plan. The chain has
tripled in size over the past year and within three years, the number of
restaurants is expected reach 600, with locations in most leading US
markets.
Boston Chicken will finance the building programme with the Dollars 55m
proceeds from the IPO, plus a concurrent offering of 900,000 restricted
shares to management.
Ms Killian said one of the pivotal elements of the chain's successful
expansion since 1991 was its 'tight control of franchising'.
Unlike most fast-food chains Boston Chicken provides a large portion of the
development capital for new locations in the form of loan. The debt is later
convertible into equity, giving the company greater control over the
network.
Mr Scott Beck, the company's chairman and a former vice-chairman of
Blockbuster, used a similar financing scheme in the 1980s to develop the
video-rental enterprise into the 3,000-store empire with annual revenues of
Dollars 1.2bn. Clearly, many small investors are hoping for a repeat
performance.

deeper losses
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the Austrian motor group, expects losses to rise sharply
this year to about Sch320m (Dollars 27m). This would represent a marked
deterioration compared with the 1992 deficit of Sch65m. Parent company
losses are expected to be about Sch180m.
The company said yesterday the sudden worsening of its position stemmed from
the downturn in the automotive industry world-wide. Several group companies
are running below capacity. The armoured vehicles division has stopped
production because of government export restrictions on military equipment.
Group turnover for the first six months of 1993 was Sch5.59bn, down
Sch2.54bn on 1992. The group said small improvements may be achieved next
year, but a return to profit would have to wait until 1995.
The company has been restructuring with the workforce falling from about
7,700 employees to 5,500 this year. Further lay-offs are expected before the
end of the year.
SDP is 71.2 per cent owned by Creditanstalt Bankverein, the large Austrian
bank in which the state has a 49 per cent stake but 70.5 per cent of the
vote. The bank wants to sell most of its industrial holdings.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Aoki holds talks on hotels
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AOKI, a medium-sized Japanese construction company which owns the Westin
Hotels chain, said that it was in discussion with a number of parties with
the aim of selling its Westin interests in North America.
The companies being put up for sale include the operating company of the
Westin Hotels chain in North America and the North American hotels. Sale of
those businesses would in effect end Aoki's hotel business in the US, which
makes up about two-thirds of the company's hotel interests.
Aoki plans to use the funds it raises through the sale of most of its stock
in the Westin Hotels chains and the North American operating company based
in Seattle to reduce its debt burden, which totalled over Y300bn (Dollars
2.8bn) at the end of March this year.
It hopes to be able to conclude a deal as early as before the end of the
year.
The construction company also plans to sell its holding in Westin
International Europe, the operating company based in Hamburg, Germany, which
runs some of its North American hotels and hotels in Europe, if conditions
are suitable.
Aoki acquired the Westin Hotels and Resorts chains jointly with a US company
in 1988 for Dollars 1.35bn of which the Japanese group paid Y1.1bn. The
company is not revealing what kind of price it is looking for the hotels.
Aoki has extensive operations outside of Japan and operates hotels in
Brazil, Panama, Taiwan and Shanghai as well as the US and Germany.
With the business downturn in the west, however, the company is looking to
concentrate its energies on the growing Asian market.

KRAFT Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss foods group which is part of Philip Morris
of the US, is buying 80 per cent of Republika, Bulgaria's leading chocolate
producer. The remaining 20 per cent will be offered to employees. The total
investment for purchasing and modernising Republika will amount to Dollars
16m over the next five years.
This is one of the first successful large privatisation deals in Bulgaria
involving a western partner.
Mr Bernhard Hubert, the vice-president of Kraft Jacobs Suchard responsible
for central and eastern Europe, said the acquisition was an important step
in the east European strategy of the company.
Kraft Jacobs Suchard, which employs 32,000 people in 20 European countries,
is expected to have operating revenues of Dollars 9bn in 1993. Since last
year, it has positioned itself in eastern Europe through the acquisitions of
confectionery, wafer and coffee producers in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech
Republic, Poland and Lithuania.
In Bulgaria, the company will continue to market Republika's local products
and will also introduce some of its brands, such as Milka tablets and Prince
Polo wafers.
Republika, the country's oldest confectionery manufacturer, was founded in
1905. Last year, it produced over 8,000 tonnes of confectionery. Its output
satisfied up to 35 per cent of the Bulgarian market.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: TPC puts block on new sugar
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, to form a
major sugar industry joint venture with the Mackay Sugar Co-Operative
Association and London-based trading house ED&amp; F. Man, have run into
opposition from the Australian Trades Practices Commission.
The joint venture was announced in August, when CSR said it would join with
Mackay Refined Sugars - a joint arrangement between Man and MSCA - to form a
white sugar production, marketing and distribution operation. CSR was to
hold 50 per cent of the company, with MSCA and Man each taking 25 per cent.
CSR would have contributed refinery assets in Perth, Melbourne and Auckland,
while Mackay would have supplied its new low-cost refinery, being built in
Queensland, along with bulk storage facilities.
The partners claimed that the venture would create a refined sugar export
industry in Australia, which has traditionally exported raw sugar only.
Annual turnover of the joint venture company was forecast at ADollars 500m
(USDollars 327m).
Yesterday, however, the TPC claimed that the proposal would substantially
lessen competition in the refined sugar industry and push up prices for
sugar and products containing it.
The TPC said that the companies were pooling refining capacity which would
have given them a joint market share of over 50 per cent and that 'having
combined the assets, the companies would not compete'.
It suggested that CSR was insulating itself from competition which would
otherwise have been generated by a new Mackay refinery, and said that the
proposed export benefits had been overstated. The TPC also rejected the
argument that imports would be an effective constraint on prices, given high
freight and handling costs.

<TEXT>
CASIO Computer, the leading maker of digital watches and electronic
calculators, yesterday reported a plunge in parent pre-tax profit as it
suffered the impact of the sharp economic downturn in Japan and the rapid
rise of the yen.
Casio suffered a 67 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y2.8bn (Dollars
26.16m) on sales that were 7 per cent down to Y159bn. Operating profits
plummeted 82 per cent to Y1.3bn.
The company blamed the severe drop in private capital spending and personal
consumption as well as the devastating impact of the yen's rapid rise for
the deterioration in its business performance.
Casio is revising its forecast for consolidated sales and profits in the
full business year due to the sharp rise of the yen and continuing weakness
in major economies. It now forecasts sales of Y415bn rather than Y450bn as
predicted in May and pre-tax profits of Y11bn, rather than Y14.5bn.
For the parent company, Casio forecasts sales of Y330bn and pre-tax profits
of Y9.3bn.
The company was particularly hard hit by falling overseas demand,
particularly in Europe.
Calculator sales were modestly up on the same period last year but
electronic clocks and watches, electronic musical instruments and electronic
office equipment all suffered a setback.

DAIHATSU Motor, the Japanese carmaker belonging to the Toyota Motor group,
returned to the black during the first six months to September, due to
cost-cutting efforts, including the reduction of seasonal workers.
The company posted pre-tax profits of Y551m (Dollars 5.15m) against an
interim loss of Y4.9bn a year earlier. Operating profits totalled Y643bn, up
from a loss of Y4.3bn, while after-tax profits totalled Y536m against a loss
of Y4.9bn. Half-year sales, however, fell 7.2 per cent to Y362.8bn.
Daihatsu said it lost Y7.2bn in profits through foreign exchange losses and
the fall in sales, but managed to generate profits of Y12.1bn by cutting
1,000 seasonal employees.
Vehicle sales during the April to September term fell 6 per cent to 383,067
units. Domestic sales fell 8.8 per cent while exports rose 5.1 per cent.
Domestic sales fell in all vehicle categories, with sales of agricultural
machinery especially weak due to cold summer weather and typhoons.
For the full year to March, Daihatsu expects sales to fall 8.3 per cent to
Y720bn. Pre-tax profits of Y2bn are expected against a loss of Y4.4bn, while
after-tax profits are forecast at Y2bn, up from a loss of Y3.5bn last year.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: JR East blames sluggish railway
operations for pre-tax downturn

EAST JAPAN Railway, the semi-privatised regional railway group, said
sluggish railway operations due to the economic slump caused a marginal fall
in interim pre-tax profits.
The earnings announcement, JR East's first since its listing on the Tokyo
stock exchange last month, reflected rising operating costs amid lower
revenues. Pre-tax profits for the first six months to September fell 1.2 per
cent to Y73.6bn (Dollars 687.85m) while overall revenue fell 0.6 per cent to
Y995.2bn. After-tax profits fell 6.5 per cent to Y38.1bn.
The company has not benefited from its stock flotation since the proceeds
have gone to JNR Settlement, which holds debts and shares of seven regional
companies created in 1987 through the break-up of national operator, Japan
National Railways.
JR East's half-year revenue from its railway operations eased 0.7 per cent
to Y954.8bn, while operating profits fell 3.8 per cent to Y231.7bn. Revenue
from its other businesses including real estate leasing and retailing
operations, rose 2.1 per cent to Y40.3bn, although operating profits fell
28.7 per cent to Y3bn.
For the full year to March, the company expects a 0.2 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y101.2bn on a 0.6 per cent fall in overall revenue to
Y1,968.2bn.
Meanwhile, securities industry officials yesterday expressed worries over
further flotation of state-owned companies following the recent decline in
share prices believed to have been triggered by the JR East flotation.
The Japanese government wants to float Japan Tobacco, a state-owned tobacco
and salt company by the end of next March, and the remaining seven railway
groups next fiscal year. Mr Masaru Aratani, chairman of Japan Securities
Dealers Association, said that he was cautious over the impact of listing
large-capital state owned companies.
Mr Aratani said the JR East listing came at a bad time for the sluggish
stock market. His comments counter those of Mr Minoru Nagaoka, Tokyo stock
market president, who has denied claims the market's decline was caused by
JR East.

<TEXT>
BRAMBLES, the Australian transportation, waste management and equipment
services group, warned yesterday that profits in the current year could be
up to 10 per cent lower than in 1992-93. This would be a second successive
year of falling profits; in the 12 months to end-June, after-tax earnings
dipped from ADollars 180m (USDollars 118m) to ADollars 166m.
The warning was provided by the company's chairman, Mr Gary Pemberton, who
told Brambles' annual meeting that current trading projections 'indicate
that there is virtually no upside on last year, but a downside containable
within ten per cent'.
'We must accept that the maintenance of full-year profitability at the
1992/93 level is at some risk,' he added.
Mr Pemberton said the sudden change in the US hazardous waste market and the
downturn in European economies were the two major factors dominating
Brambles' short-term outlook.
'Given the realities of the current situation in Europe and the US, profit
forecasting is difficult, particularly this year when we are anticipating an
uneven half to half result with a number of factors pointing towards a
stronger second half,' he commented.
He noted there had been some UK improvement, Germany was 'showing signs of
levelling out', but France remained 'under pressure'.

The US rocket engine producer, which does most of its business with NASA,

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON Corporation, the Canadian-controlled travel and publishing group,
blamed adverse exchange rates and competitive pressures in several of its
key publishing businesses for near-stagnant third-quarter earnings.
Net earnings edged up to USDollars 226m before preferred share dividends, or
39 cents per common share, from Dollars 221m, or 38 cents a year earlier.
Sales dipped to Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.94bn.
If exchange rates had remained unchanged from average 1992 levels, earnings
would have been 44 cents per share and sales Dollars 2.12bn.
Nine-month earnings rose to Dollars 249m, or 42 cents a share, from Dollars
244m, or 41 cents.
The brightest spot so far this year has been the travel business. Although
UK-based Thomson Travel's nine-month operating profit dipped to Dollars 143m
from Dollars 146m, the company said there was an 18.6 per cent jump measured
in sterling.
Thomson Tours' volumes rose 11 per cent last summer, and sales of winter
holidays are 16 per cent ahead of last year.
The company said summer 1994 bookings have been 'exceptionally high' since
its brochures were launched in late August, leading to a 'significant'
improvement in market share.
An official ascribed the improvement to a stronger UK economy and last
summer's poor weather, which has encouraged many people to book a holiday in
the sun.
In the publishing and newspaper divisions, there were poor performances by
the UK and US professional, business and academic publishing groups, and
Thomson's Canadian newspaper chain. But UK regional newspapers' operating
profits were well ahead.

VARD, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, saw nine-month pre-tax
losses widen substantially to NKr148.9m (Dollars 17.8m) from NKr3.23m in the
same period last year, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The deterioration is due largely to higher operating and interest expenses,
foreign currency losses on debt, and an extraordinary charge of NKr69.8m.
Group revenue rose to NKr5.46bn from NKr4.11bn and operating profits
advanced slightly to NKr478.6m from NKr437.9m, as interest income increased
to NKr13.37m from NKr6.47m. Interest expenses, however, rose to NKr500.34m
from NKr330.22m last year.
Vard said its Kloster Cruise subsidiary was being restructured, the results
of which would take some time to be reflected in the company's accounts.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris shares hit by
warning of cost cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Philip Morris fell yesterday after the US tobacco and food
products group revealed it might take a fourth-quarter charge against
earnings.
In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Philip Morris,
the world's largest cigarette-maker, said it would present several options
for cutting costs in its tobacco and food operations at a board meeting next
Wednesday.
The stock closed Dollars 1 3/8 down at 55 7/8 on Wall Street after Merrill
Lynch downgraded its rating on the issue.
The SEC filing, however, was not unexpected.
Revenues from its US tobacco operations have fallen sharply since April,
when the company slashed cigarette prices by 40 cents a pack as part of a
strategy to stem a declining market share for Marlboro and other premium
brands. In the third quarter, net income was down 25 per cent from the 1992
level.
In October, the group warned that lower cigarette pricing and the market's
continued volatility would 'make fourth-quarter earning comparison
unfavourable'.
Mr Ron Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson, the New York
securities house, said he 'would not be surprised' if the cost-cutting
measures under consideration included redundancies and plant closures. He
estimated the charge at about Dollars 100m.
In the final quarter of 1992, the group posted net income of Dollars 1.9bn,
or Dollars 1.34.
Last week, Philip Morris said it would raise wholesale cigarette prices by
four cents a pack, matching an increase by RJR Nabisco and other cigarette
manufacturers.
Analysts responded to the move by upgrading their estimates of 1994
earnings.

<TEXT>
HEWLETT-Packard, the US electronics and computer systems company, reported
strong growth in sales and earnings for its fourth quarter. But concerns
about increased costs and inventories drove down the shares Dollars 3 3/4 to
Dollars 73 3/4 .
Net earnings for the quarter rose to Dollars 298m, or Dollars 1.18 a share,
from Dollars 68m or 28 cents in the same period last year when the company
took a restructuring charge of 36 cents a share. Net revenue rose 32 per
cent to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 4.3bn.
'This quarter was a big improvement over last year's fourth quarter,' said
Mr Lewis Platt, HP chairman, president and chief executive. 'But upward
pressure on cost of sales continued, and inventory levels were higher than
we'd like.'
HP's cost of sales for the fourth quarter was 61.4 per cent of net revenue,
against 58.1 per cent in the same period last year. Price cuts and a
continuing shift toward products carrying higher sales costs were factors,
the company said.
Inventories increased 41 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn from Dollars 2.6bn at the
end of the last fiscal year. Part of the increase was attributable to new
product introductions, the company said.
Operating expenses rose 11 per cent to 30.2 per cent of net revenue from
35.9 per cent in the year-ago quarter.
For fiscal 1993, revenue rose 24 per cent to Dollars 20.3bn, from Dollars
16.4bn. With revenues of Dollars 15.6bn from computer products, service and
support, HP has become the second-largest US computer company, after IBM,
overtaking Digital Equipment.
Net earnings for the year were Dollars 1.2bn, or Dollars 4.65 a share,
compared with Dollars 549m, or Dollars 2.18, last time after special
charges. Before these charges, HP earned Dollars 972m, or Dollars 3.85 a
share last year.
Mr Platt said the company would launch important new products in several
sectors in fiscal 1994 and efforts to reduce expense structures would remain
a high priority.

<TEXT>
DONNA KARAN, the New York fashion house, yesterday threw a bucket of cold
water on the over-heated market for sexy initial public offerings (IPOs) by
suspending its plans to go public.
The company, which is known for its upmarket collections of clothing and
accessories, said it had decided to delay its initial public offering
because sales and operating earnings in the third quarter had fallen short
of its expectations. It blamed 'a soft retail environment'.
Ms Donna Karan, the designer who founded the company in 1986, said: 'We
don't feel that a public offering at this time would reflect the potential
value of the company.'
The decision to delay the offering comes at a time when investors are
especially keen to invest in IPOs by companies with high-profile businesses.
Last week, Boston Chicken soared 143 per cent higher than its offering price
of Dollars 20 a share on the issue's first day of trading on the Nasdaq
over-the-counter market.
The Donna Karan issue of 11m shares, or 57 per cent of the company, had been
expected to come to market this month. However, in an amended registration
statement filed in October with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company hinted that a snag might develop.
It indicated that some of its clothing lines for men and children would
continue to generate losses during the rest of 1993.
The original filing statement said that the operations would begin to break
even in 1993.
The offering, with an estimated listing price of Dollars 15 to Dollars 18 a
share, was expected to raise about Dollars 159m.

<TEXT>
MAPLE Leaf Foods, the Toronto-based food processor controlled by the UK's
Hillsdown Holdings, reported a small rise in third-quarter earnings, with
improved agri-business and baking results offsetting slimmer margins from
processed foods.
Net earnings climbed to CDollars 20.8m (USDollars 15.8m), or 26 cents a
share, from CDollars 19.4m, or 24 cent. Sales rose to CDollars 778.5m from
CDollars 695m.
Mr Brent Ballantyne, named yesterday as president and CEO, predicted that
fourth-quarter earnings would also exceed a year earlier.
Maple Leaf said the cost-cutting and rationalisation in its feed, poultry
and rendering operations have paid off in sharply higher earnings.
But earnings from processed foods were hit by higher raw material costs and
a move by consumers to cheaper products.
The company said it aims to improve performance by launching new products
and cutting costs, giving greater attention to private labels, and by
further inroads into the US market.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, General Motors' chief executive and president, outlined plans
to return the carmaker's troubled North American operations to an after-tax
profit in 1994.
It aims to increase US sales, taking the group's market share to 33 - 34 per
cent from around 31 per cent, and further cut costs.
Contributing to the turnround this year have been a Dollars 2bn cut in the
cost of materials and a 12 per cent reduction in assembly time to 24 - 25
hours. Also, 1993 US sales are expected to reach 14.1 vehicles, up 7 per
cent from last year.
In its last quarter, GM's North American operations made a net loss of
Dollars 1.12bn, after plant closure costs and other items which resulted in
a net charge of Dollars 289m.
The company is planning a 5 per cent increase in vehicle sales in the US in
1994, to 14.8m. Even if this target is not met, Mr Smith said GM should make
the planned return to net profitability in North America.
Mr Gerald Knetchtel, head of North American operations, said next year's
targets are not based on further job cuts. The sale of various units and
normal attrition would push staff levels down to around 245,000 next year,
he said.

A MORGAN Stanley property fund has agreed to pay about Dollars 600m for the
Red Roof Inns hotel chain in a deal that is new direction for the fund.
Until now, the Dollars 840m Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund has bought
distressed properties from banks and the Resolution Trust Corporation, the
government agency handling the sale of assets owned by bankrupt savings and
loan companies.
With the Red Roof deal, it is branching out into going concerns. Red Roof is
a solidly profitable chain of 210 low-cost motels spread across the US, with
one of the highest occupancy rates in the industry.
Morgan Stanley said the current management will continue to operate the
chain.
Mr Paul Kazilionis, president of the fund, said: 'Red Roof Inns is a
well-known brand name with a loyal clientele. The acquisition fits with our
strategy of identifying and acquiring attracting real estate opportunities
along with their successful existing managements.'
Red Roof was owned by a private trust created by the chain's late founder,
Mr James Trueman. The Morgan Stanley fund will pay the trust an undisclosed
amount of cash, and assume the existing mortgage debt on the chain's motel
properties. The total amount comes to just over Dollars 600m.
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund was established in 1991 with money from the
New York investment bank and a group of institutional investors. It has
invested in properties with capital worth more than Dollars 2bn. Recent
acquisitions include the California resort of Carmel Valley Ranch, and the
Doral Telleruide ski resort hotel in Colorado, both in joint ventures with
the Westcor Partners investment group.

The company also said it signed an agreement in principle with Madrid-based

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: EDS in multimedia joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors, yesterday announced
a joint venture with France Telecom and US West, the US regional Bell
operator, to provide inter-active financial transaction services to the home
and business markets.
The joint venture, called Interactive Transaction Partners, marks a further
advance in the multimedia ambitions of EDS and the telecoms groups.
EDS, which will provide the processing, has taken a 50 per cent stake in the
joint venture. France Telecom and US West, which have developed the
applications software, each have a 25 per cent stake. The investment plans
of ITP are undisclosed.
ITP will offer integrated home banking, bill payment and bill presentation
services. It will be accessed by phone or personal computer with modem, with
the potential for interactive television and screen phones as they enter the
market.
Mr Neil Marcous, manager of EDS's Electronic Commerce Division, said the
joint venture was a further step on the 'information superhighway,
integrating more kinds of consumer-oriented relationships'.
Services will be available in the US from next April, and may be extended to
Europe.
The three partners are leaders in the drive to produce multimedia services.
Earlier this year British Telecommunications engaged in unsuccessful
negotiations to buy EDS, which has operations in more than 30 countries.
US West, which serves the Rocky Mountain states and Pacific Northwest,
earlier this year made a Dollars 2.5bn investment in the cable entertainment
operations of Time Warner, the second largest cable operator in the US and a
leading producer of filmed entertainment. With its Minitel project, France
Telecom is one of the most pioneering of Europe's public telecommunications
operators in the provision of inter-active services.
Mr Francois Olibet, president of France Telecom Intelmatique, said that
'seamless multimedia services' like home banking would be the key to future
success in the telecoms market.

REISEBUERO Kuoni, the Swiss travel agency group, said net income tumbled 20
per cent in the first nine months of 1993 to SFr35m (Dollars 23.35m),
reflecting depressed demand and prices in the travel sector. Sales were off
6 per cent to SFr1.8bn.
The group, in which Kaufhof of Germany last year bought a 50.1 per cent
stake (with 26.4 per cent of the votes), forecast that net income in the
full year would fall 18 per cent to SFr40m.
It described this performance as 'satisfactory, given market conditions'.
Business was off in all regions, except the UK and Germany. In the UK, the
group's biggest market outside Switzerland, sales were flat in Swiss franc
terms, at SFr343m, in the first nine months, reflecting near-16 per cent
growth in sterling terms. German sales were up 15 per cent to SFr117m.
The group, controlled by the Kuoni-Hugentobler foundation, said revenue from
tour operating was up 4.5 per cent, while retail business was off 4.3 per
cent to SFr400m.
Business travel turnover was down 3.1 per cent to SFr155m.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hungarian bank admits extent of
capital shortfall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MAGYAR Hitel Bank, Hungary's largest commercial bank, yesterday revealed a
much larger capital shortfall than estimated. It said it was discussing a
Ft50-60bn (Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m) government bail-out.
The capital injection and deteriorating capital ratio figure were revealed
by Mr Istvan Torocskei, managing director, ahead of today's expected cabinet
decision on recapitalisation of the troubled banking sector.
The authorities propose to restore the capital adequacy ratios of the main
banks to zero per cent for this year's international accounts, and to 4 per
cent next spring. The standard set by the Bank for International Settlements
is 8 per cent.
Mr Torocskei's estimate means Hitel Bank has a negative capital adequacy
ratio of at least 16 per cent. The Ft50-60bn of extra capital he is seeking
represents a fifth of the bank's estimated risk-weighted assets of Ft240bn.
Hitel Bank's capital deficiency, according to the latest figures, is double
the minus 7.9 per cent projected for 1993 in a World Bank aide-memoire on
the Hungarian banking system written this year. That report concluded that
most of Hungary's banks were 'technically insolvent', according to
international accounting standards.
Hungarian officials and bankers, however, rule out collapse of the big
banks. 'Hitel Bank's liquidity has never been as good as now,' Mr Torocskei
said.
Mr Imre Tarafas, a deputy chairman at the National Bank of Hungary,
cautioned that banks were exaggerating their loan losses to qualify for
larger government injections.
Clearly, though, there has been a substantial deterioration at the big
banks, which officials blame largely on the recognition of bad equity
investments and contingent liabilities, as well as substandard loans.
Given Hitel Bank's capital demands, the government's recapitalisation of the
sector is likely to cost more than the Ft100bn estimated by the World Bank
earlier this year.
The capital strength of Hitel Bank, Kereskedelmi Bank and Budapest Bank, the
three large state-owned commercial banks, deteriorated after Hungary
implemented a new bankruptcy law at the start of 1992.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nutricia warns of food recall
damage

<TEXT>
SHARES in Nutricia, one of Europe's largest producers of baby food, fell
sharply yesterday after a warning that a recall of 1m jars of baby food
would affect its profit forecast for 1993. It could also influence results
in 1994, the company cautioned.
Nutricia, a Dutch-based company 30 per cent-owned by Unigate of the UK, is
recalling some lines of its Olvarit brand of baby food because jars
containing pork and beef may contain traces of a disinfectant. The recall
affects jars in the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and Portugal.
More than 1m jars of the food still stored in Nutricia's warehouses will
also be destroyed.
Nutricia's shares fell steeply on the Amsterdam stock exchange yesterday,
closing down Fl 13.20, or 8.7 per cent, at Fl 138.20. In London, Unigate's
shares ended the day down 12p at 355p.
Nutricia, the biggest European baby food producer after Nestle of
Switzerland, said the source of the disinfectant was not its own Olvarit
factory in Wells, England, but the premises of one of its Dutch suppliers of
pork and beef. The disinfectant, p-TSA, is used to clean meat-cutting tables
and equipment.
The Olvarit jars were recalled after traces of the disinfectant were found
during a routine check in the Netherlands by Dutch food inspectors. Olvarit
products without meat, or with other types of meat, were not included in the
recall.
The company said there was no danger to health unless the suspect food was
eaten frequently and over a long period.
The company said the recall would affect its profit forecast for 1993, which
earlier called for a 'clear' increase from 1992 net profit of Fl 87.2m
(Dollars 30.7m). Meals, drinks and cereals for babies and toddlers accounted
for around 16 per cent of Nutricia's 1992 sales of Fl 1.25bn.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Krona's weakness helps Sandvik
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANDVIK, the Swedish engineering group, improved profits by 23 per cent to
SKr1.44bn (Dollars 175m) in the first nine months. The advance came without
any upturn in business conditions.
The revival has been attributed mainly to the weak Swedish krona, which
enabled the group to push up sales by 27 per cent, to SKr15.8bn, and orders
by 30 per cent to SKr16.5bn. Sales fell 5 per cent if currency factors and
acquisitions are excluded.
Mr Per-Olof Eriksson, chief executive, said demand remained 'very weak' in
Europe and Japan, but the outlook was more positive in other parts of the
world.
He highlighted Latin America, Australia, China and south-east Asia as areas
of strong growth, and noted a 'gradual increase' in North America.
The biggest expansion of sales came in North America, with 56 per cent
growth to SKr3.18bn, followed by Latin America, where sales climbed 43 per
cent to SKr997m.
Steel was the group's top performing division, due to a four-fold rise in
profits, to SKr354m from SKr89m. This was achieved despite falling prices.

SHARES in Teleco Cavi, the Italian maker of power and telecommunications
cables, were suspended yesterday after Siemens of Germany launched an agreed
takeover bid.
Siemens is spending L104bn (Dollars 62.5m) to buy control of GCR, the family
holding company which owns just over 50 per cent of Teleco Cavi's ordinary
shares.
Almost 70 per cent of GCR is owned by the founding Bruni family, which is
selling its entire stake. The remainder is held by BICC, the UK industrial
group, and Fornara, an Italian industrial holding company.
Siemens will have to launch a public tender offer for the remaining Teleco
Cavi stock, in line with new Italian stock exchange rules. However, the
German group said it intended to maintain the company's stock-exchange
listing.
Siemens said the purchase was part of a strategy to consolidate its position
in the rapidly changing European cables business.
Teleco Cavi, which is based in the Abruzzo region of southern Italy, made
group net profits of L256bn last year on sales of L256bn.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE recovery in the Swedish banking sector was underlined yesterday when
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank, announced
sharply reduced losses for the first nine months.
The bank's operating loss fell to SKr92m (Dollars 11.2m) from SKr3.75bn as
it benefited from increased revenues, cost-cutting and reduced loan losses.
The third-quarter profit of SKr206m built on the SKr310m second-quarter
surplus, but was insufficient to reverse losses of SKr608m in the first
three months. The healthier trend underscored the bank's decision to
withdraw its request for state aid in August and rely instead on a SKr5.3bn
rights issue to rebuild its capital base.
Operating profits before credit losses rose 64 per cent to SKr7.63bn,
showing successive improvements in every quarter. Lower interest rates
positively influenced the performance, as did SKr560m in gains from bond
sales. Costs were reduced by 2 per cent to SKr5.69bn, partly due to staff
cuts.
Credit losses at SKr7.72bn remained high, but they were down 8 per cent
compared with last year. The bank said 44 per cent of write-offs related to
the real estate sector, where collapsing values did more than anything to
provoke the crisis in the Swedish financial sector.
Net problem loans at September 30 were SKr21.5bn, down 17 per cent from the
total at the end of last year.
SE Banken also announced it had sold its remaining shares in Skandia,
rounding off a saga that began in 1990 when it tried to forge a giant
Scandinavian banking and insurance combine by buying a 28 per cent stake in
the insurer.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: France sharpens missile strategy
 -David Buchan examines global reorganisation of the defence industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French missile-makers' international negotiations are gathering pace. Matra
is pledged to form a joint missile company with British Aerospace (BAe) by
the end of the year. Aerospatiale is locked into similar discussions with
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) with a view to merging their missile interests
into a single unit with a market share rivalling Hughes of the US.
The role of the French missile companies will be crucial to any industry
reorganisation. For one thing, there are more of them than in any other
European country. In addition to Matra and Aerospatiale, there is
Thomson-CSF, the heavyweight of French defence electronics, and a host of
smaller electronic suppliers.
France has also cut its defence equipment budget by less than other European
countries in the last three years, and plans to increase it slightly next
year, to FFr103bn (Dollars 17.5bn).
The French defence sector's total turnover has declined from its high point
of FFr124.5bn in 1990 to FFr113bn last year, largely due to the drop in
export deliveries, to FFr29bn.
New orders, however, hit a record FFr45.7bn last year, with Taiwan's
decision to buy Dassault's Mirage jets and Matra's missiles, and Abu Dhabi's
purchase of the Leclerc tank made by France's state-controlled Giat
Industries.
A recent parliamentary report forecast that 40,000 jobs would disappear from
the defence and aerospace sectors, but that the precipitous fall-off in
civil aviation business and space research was mostly to blame for this.
Mr Henri Conze, procurement chief in the French defence ministry, believes
the current merger talks among missile-makers may set in train a wider
reorganisation in defence electronics.
Mr Conze, who runs Europe's biggest defence equipment budget, predicts that
'1994 will be the year of mergers and concentrations in the European missile
industry'.
The most advanced of the talks is the planned joint venture between Matra
and BAe, whose missile products and markets complement each other. Mr Dick
Evans, BAe chairman, recently confirmed that the marriage was likely to be
consummated by the end of this year.
Formal control will be split evenly between the two parent companies.
However, Matra is confident of gaining management control because, even
without its Taiwan order, its dowry of missile orders is larger than BAe's.
Aerospatiale acknowledges that its talks on merging its missile business
with Dasa are less advanced, and points out that the two companies took more
than two years to negotiate their Eurocopter joint venture. However, the two
companies have already worked together for 20 years in their joint
Euromissile arrangement.
In any event, the German orientation of Aerospatiale should do the company
no harm with Mr Conze, who has proposed setting up a Franco-German arms
agency as the possible precursor of the European arms agency, foreshadowed
in the Maastricht treaty.
Might these two joint entities then merge to form one big European
missile-maker? Matra, BAe, even some people at Dasa, favour that.
Aerospatiale says it is open-minded at this stage. So is its owner, the
French government.
'It is not impossible,' says Mr Conze, 'though at present it is impossible
to say whether the two joint ventures would stay apart, or come together, or
have some gentleman's agreement to share markets or products.'
However, he believes that the imminent mergers in the actual manufacture of
missiles could lead to changed relationships in other parts of the missile
business.
These include 'upstream' designers of entire weapons systems, such as
Thomson and BAe, which are also to be found 'downstream' as suppliers of
missile components. There is also French companies such as Dassault
Electronique, SAT, and Sagem; German companies such as TST (part of Dasa)
and BGT (part of Diehl); and British companies such as GEC-Marconi.
'Sorting out the missile-makers is the easiest part, but other areas may
have to be tackled,' says the French arms chief.
Having formed a joint venture with Shorts of Belfast on very short-range
missiles last March, Thomson-CSF is standing aloof from the current missile
merger game. Its president, Mr Alain Gomez, has a more urgent dossier on his
table: the government's desire to know soon whether the defence company
should be privatised with or without Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE).
The privatisation of Aerospatiale is clearly more distant. And this is not
just because of deepening losses - FFr 870m in the first half of this year -
which Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, hopes soon to remedy with a
capital increase.
Presenting the company for sale before the 1995 election would almost
certainly provoke a row with President Mitterrand, who has on several
occasions proclaimed his opposition to putting France's nuclear
missile-maker into private hands.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Vosper to boost acquisition level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOSPER Thornycroft Holdings, the shipbuilding and engineering group, intends
to increase the size and frequency of acquisitions, with a view to lessening
its dependency on warship orders.
The Southampton-based company reported a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 9.08m in the six months to October 3.
Sales rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 114.6m, of which 84 per cent is for
export.
Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said the group had so far been justifiably
cautious on making acquisitions, having purchased businesses for about
Pounds 1m each. However, he was now prepared to buy one or more businesses
at about the Pounds 20m level, if and when suitable candidates were
identified.
Mr Martin Jay, managing director, said about 15 per cent of sales were
already not connected to warship orders, which could be erratically phased,
although some of this work was still defence related.
The group had cash balances of Pounds 137m at the half-year, although the
total was inflated by the receipt of a large stage payment for work in hand.
The underlying cash position is about Pounds 60m.
The order book of work yet to be performed is worth more than Pounds 600m,
with over 95 per cent for export.
Mr Usher said he looked forward to tendering for the next batch of Royal
Navy minehunters.
'Despite uncertainties over the level of UK defence expenditure, we are
encouraged that the minister for defence procurement stated last month that
the Royal Navy needs more single role minehunters.'
The group has completed an Pounds 8m investment programme in shipbuilding
facilities.
In preparation for the Common New Frigate which is foreseen for the Royal
and European navies, the company has also become partners in a bidding team
for the project with GEC and British Aerospace.
Earnings per share increased by 10 per cent to 19.6p (17.8p), while the
interim dividend is lifted by 13 per cent to 5.3p (4.7p).

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Creditors approve scheme of arrangement for
Kwelm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS yesterday approved proposals for a scheme of arrangement under
English insolvency law for the Kwelm insurance companies by a significant
margin, paving the way for an exit from provisional liquidation at the end
of the year.
Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and one of the
provisional liquidators, said creditors had voted 'overwhelmingly in favour'
by both number and value of claims at a meeting in Alexandra Palace in
London.
An estimated 200 creditors turned up to vote, and by Monday evening this
week Mr Hughes had already collected proxies in favour from creditors owed
Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 2.08bn). Those against were valued at Dollars 25m.
Total creditors' claims are estimated at above Dollars 6bn, and the schemes
must be approved by three quarters of creditors by value.
The approval for an exit into a scheme of arrangement will require
ratification by the High Court in London on December 8, followed by similar
approvals in Bermuda and then in the New York courts on December 14.
Mr Hughes said he hoped to be able to offer a first dividend to creditors by
the end of June next year, estimated at between 3 per cent and 12 per cent
for the different companies.
All the Kwelm companies are subsidiaries of London United Investments, the
insurer now in administration. They are Kingscroft, Walbrook, Lime Street
and Mutual Re.

the shares at 180p, which will capitalise the company at Pounds 63m.
A placing and offer for intermediaries by James Capel, the securities house,
will raise some Pounds 20.4m net.
A total of 9.38m shares have been placed firm with institutions and a
similar number have been placed subject to recall to satisfy valid
applications under the intermediaries offer.
On the basis of earnings per share for the 12 months to September 30 1993 of
11.2p (or 10.7p on a fully diluted basis), the price puts Fenchurch on a
multiple of 16.1, or 16.8 on a fully diluted basis.
After adjusting for the demerger of Fenchurch Underwriting Agency, effective
from November 16, the multiple falls to 14.1, or 14.7 fully diluted.
Of the money raised, Pounds 15.3m will be used to repay bank and other debt
assumed at the time of the management buy-out in 1989; Pounds 4.1m will be
used to redeem preference shares, while the balance will provide additional
working capital.
The directors believe the listing will enhance the profile 'with clients and
in insurance markets'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Jarvis Porter helped by purchases
</HEADLINE>

   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS HELPED Jarvis Porter, the specialist label printer for the
spirits, toiletries and pharmaceutical industries, report an 84 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits.
Pre-tax profits grew to Pounds 3.42m (Pounds 1.85m) in the six months to
August 31. Earnings per share increased to 7.2p (5.1p); the interim dividend
goes up to 1.65p (1.5p).
The shares, which have risen steadily in the past year, yesterday gained a
further 7p to close at a new high of 277p.
The growth in profits was fuelled by higher turnover and a small increase in
margins. Turnover increased by 71 per cent to Pounds 28m (Pounds 16.4m),
including Pounds 3.67m from the acquisition of two self-adhesive label
producers, Dolphin in Lewis and Irwin Packaging in Cardiff, in March.
Overall, Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive, said recent acquisitions,
including those made last year, accounted for about Pounds 10m of first-half
turnover.
Operating profit increased by 92 per cent to Pounds 3.54m (Pounds 1.84m),
including Pounds 373,000 attributable to Dolphin and Irwin. Excluding
acquisitions profits increased by about 10 per cent.
While the core label production business achieved 'creditable results
through additional business and improved efficiencies,' the group's
promotional print businesses, John Quarmby in the UK and Waterlomat in
Brussels, which both produce beer mats, also performed well.
Despite paying Pounds 4.6m in cash for Dolphin and Irwin and assuming Pounds
1.5m in debt, the group ended the period with net debt of just Pounds
900,000, equivalent to gearing of 5 per cent, compared to net cash of Pounds
3.2m at the end of February.
Mr Brewster said the group is considering further acquisitions, particularly
in continental Europe.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds defends core activities'
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SIPKO Huismans, Courtaulds' ebullient chief executive, yesterday strongly
defended the performance of his main divisions.
'I'm in very good heart about our core businesses which are in fine fettle.
But we are a chemical company and it's tough out there. We defied the
recession for a couple of years, but if we could walk on water we'd be
called something different,' he said.
The coatings division reported operating profits down from Pounds 28m to
Pounds 27m on sales of Pounds 390m (Pounds 354m). The fall in profits
included a Pounds 7m charge for restructuring. Mr Huismans said the division
had 18 manufacturing plants in North America and Europe, and he expected
those to be reduced by a third.
He stressed the UK remained the group's favourite location for manufacturing
in Europe. 'Germany provides an outmoded socialist environment. That country
has a long way to go to reach the efficiency levels of the UK,' he said.
Performance materials registered trading profits up from Pounds 7m to Pounds
13m on sales of Pounds 120m (Pounds 94m). Sales and profits benefited
strongly from the light armoured vehicle contract which is now being
completed. The difficulties in the civil aviation and defence industries
held back demand for aerospace sealants and coatings.
Packaging operations generated operating profits up from Pounds 7m to Pounds
9m on turnover of Pounds 80m (Pounds 67m). Sales of tubes grew at 20 per
cent, while profits from rigid packaging improved on unchanged turnover. The
chemicals division reported trading profits down from Pounds 19m to Pounds
14m on lower sales of Pounds 108m (Pounds 99m). Profits in acetate filter
fell from mid-summer as a buying freeze in China upset the international
balance of supply and demand.
The fibres and films businesses generated trading profits down from Pounds
31m to Pounds 28m, on turnover up from Pounds 306m to Pounds 321m.
The credit squeeze in China also hit the European acrylic fibre market and
in the US, the viscose market was affected by Far East imports.
The company announced a reorganisation of its business areas from five
divisions to three. The new divisions are coatings and sealants, fibres and
chemicals, and polymer products.
Under the new organisation, coatings and sealants reported operating profits
of Pounds 32m (Pounds 33m) on turnover of Pounds 443m (Pounds 401m); polymer
products posted trading profits of Pounds 18m (Pounds 10m) on sales of
Pounds 184m (Pounds 147m); and fibres and chemicals registered operating
profits of Pounds 41m (Pounds 49m) on turnover of Pounds 367m (Pounds 365m).

MORAN Holdings, the USM-traded tea producer, freight forwarder and property
developer which came out of administration in July, cut its annual losses
from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 274,000 pre-tax.
The improvement reflected record profits from the freight forwarding
division and 'substantially' better results from the Indian tea company.
Group turnover for the 12 months to June 30 advanced from Pounds 36.7m to
Pounds 45.9m. Interest charges were cut to Pounds 410,000 (Pounds 563,000)
and losses per share emerged at 16.64p (46.32p).
In the High Court in July the administration order was discharged following
a rescue package being approved by shareholders.

LOWER INTEREST rates helped Young &amp; Co's Brewery, the south London-based
real ale brewer, report a 5 per cent increase in interim profits.
Despite reduced turnover of Pounds 36.1m (Pounds 37.4m), reflecting
difficult trading conditions - there were no signs of recovery, the company
said - the pre-tax line for the six months to September 25 edged ahead to
Pounds 2.58m, against Pounds 2.45m, struck after gains of Pounds 23,712 on
asset sales.
Interest payable dropped to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.7m).
Heavy interest charges have held back the group's growth in the 1990s as it
funded the purchase of new pubs and expanded into hotels.
Export markets showed signs of improvement. The US side was doing 'very
well', the company said. A substantial drive into Hong Kong and China would
begin soon, initially with the group's lager brands.
The UK, in contrast, continued to suffer from recession.
The introduction of Oatmeal Stout into some 60 outlets, however, had
performed 'beyond expectations'.
The product developed an 'enormous following' in the US following its
introduction there in 1989 and a more general release into the group's UK
estate was anticipated.
After tax of Pounds 901,464 (Pounds 808,826) earnings per 50p share emerged
at 12.52p, up from 12.27p last time.
The interim dividend goes up 0.25p to 7.25p.

Creditors to Andrew Weir Insurance, which is in provisional liquidation, can
ultimately expect to receive 50p to 60p in the pound, according to details
of a proposed scheme of arrangement under English insolvency law circulated
this week.
A summarised balance sheet for the year to December 31 1992 showed estimated
assets of Pounds 111.1m, against liabilities of Pounds 142m.
The document said that Weir had gross reserves of Pounds 122.6m and
estimated that additional gross reserves for environmental pollution might
be Dollars 62m (Pounds 41.6m).
An initial pay-out to creditors is likely to be about 15 per cent.
The scheme of arrangement has been proposed by Mr Richard Boys-Stone and Mr
Colin Bird, partners with Price Waterhouse and the provisional liquidators
to the company.

Eurotunnel, the company which will operate the Channel tunnel, is to seek
the approval of its shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on December 15
to issue 192m new shares.
Eurotunnel has said it needs a further Pounds 1bn of working capital on top
of the existing capital of Pounds 8.9bn to meet its financing needs in the
period following its opening next May. It is not expected to break even on a
cash basis until 1998.
The additional finance to be raised roughly equally in the form of equity
and loans.
The company said it the size of the authorisation sought was no indication
of the shares which might eventually be issued or of the terms of any rights
issue.
The number is the same as that obtained by its French counterpart,
Eurotunnel SA from its shareholders in June.

FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Aer Lingus workforce poised to
take 5% equity stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IPounds 50m (Pounds 47.2m) cost-cutting rescue plan for Aer Lingus,
Ireland's state airline, appeared to have passed one of its final hurdles
last night, after the Irish government agreed terms with unions for the
workforce to be given a 5 per cent equity stake in the company in return for
a two-year pay freeze.
In addition, a sum equivalent to a 5 per cent stake will be paid in cash to
the employees if the airline returns to profitability.
'Workers have achieved a major breakthrough . . . and secured a strategic
stake in Aer Lingus. This is also a first in European national airlines. Aer
Lingus workers will immediately become real shareholders in the company and
be able to influence its strategic direction,' Mr Paul O'Sullivan, the main
union negotiator, said.
Earlier this month, SIPTU, the trade union representing the majority of the
airline's 5,500 workforce, accepted payroll cuts amounting to IPounds 21m
and 'radical' changes in work practices, involving 800 voluntary
redundancies.
Agreement had not been reached, however, on pay awards for the coming two
years, and it was decided to refer this matter to arbitration.
A tribunal ruled last week that there should be a pay freeze for two years,
but which would be softened by an IPounds 2m fund to be distributed to the
workforce in 1995 on condition that payroll cost-cutting targets are met.
SIPTU was unhappy with the ruling and decided to suspend a ballot of its
members on acceptance of the overall rescue package until the government
improved an offer to give a 5 per cent equity stake in the airline to the
workforce.
SIPTU had earlier demanded 15 per cent; one of its officials pointed out:
'This is far less than the 45 per cent stake that has been given to the
workforce in some US airlines'.
The negotiations with the government were handled by the Irish Congress of
Trade Unions, which views the outcome of the negotiations as creating a
yardstick for rationalisations and pay awards in other state enterprises,
such as Telecom Eireann, which are being groomed for eventual privatisation.
The first IPounds 75m tranche of a IPounds 175m equity injection by the
government is due to be made in December, but is conditional both on
acceptance of the rescue package by the workforce, and approval by the
European Commission. The injection is required to fund restructuring of the
airline and the voluntary redundancies, some of which are already taking
place.
The airline's rivals on the intensely competitive Dublin-London route are
opposed to any of the equity injection being used to set up a new low-cost,
no-frills service on the route, and are lobbying intensely in Brussels to
block the plan.

<TEXT>
BOWTHORPE, the international electronic and electrical components group, has
strengthened its environmental monitoring instrument operations with the
acquisition of Colorado-based Lear Siegler Measurement Controls for Dollars
21m (Pounds 14m) cash.
The instruments manufactured by the company are mainly used to measure
dispersed gaseous pollutants outdoors and the opacity of emissions from
industrial chimneys.
Commenting on the acquisition, Mr John Westhead, Bowthorpe's chief
executive, said: 'This business will fit extremely well into Bowthorpe's
data acquisition and environmental sector.'
Bowthorpe's data acquisition and environmental operations already comprises
six companies which bring together US and UK-based expertise in electronic
data gathering and monitoring for environmental, advanced research and
aerospace applications.
Lear Siegler Measurement Controls, which is based in Englewood, Colorado, is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Lear Siegler and is a leading designer and
manufacturer of gaseous pollutant monitoring instruments and integrated
systems.
The net assets being acquired by Bowthorpe were valued at Dollars 4.5m at
the end of June. For the year to June 30, Lear Siegler reported a loss of
Dollars 300,000 on turnover of about Dollars 30m.
The business is now trading profitably.
Under Bowthorpe the business will operate as Monitor Labs, but will continue
to be run by its current management.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Land Securities edges ahead to Pounds
118.9m - Pounds 2.9m boost from sale of investment properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND SECURITIES, the UK's biggest property company, yesterday lifted its
interim dividend as pre-tax profits edged ahead to Pounds 118.9m for the six
months to the end of September.
The outcome compared with a previous Pounds 116.5m. Earnings per share were
ahead from 16.58p to 17.22p; the dividend is lifted by 4.8 per cent from
6.3p to 6.6p.
Excluding the Pounds 2.9m proceeds on the sale of investment properties,
pre-tax profit was almost unchanged at Pounds 116m (Pounds 116.2m). Net
rental income improved from Pounds 187.6m to Pounds 192m.
Mr Peter Hunt, chairman and managing director, said the results confirmed
his view that, until rental growth fed through into higher rents, net
revenue from the group's existing portfolio was likely to remain flat.
He described the recovery as slow and fragile. Rents were continuing to fall
in central London, but increased enquiries and a falling level of high
quality space suggested that 'rental levels for the best property may be
close to reaching a floor.'
The group, which in May raised Pounds 140m for new property investment
through a convertible bond issue, spent or committed Pounds 70m on purchases
during the six months. The biggest purchase was the Bridges Shopping Centre
in Sunderland. At the end of September it had just over Pounds 295m of funds
available for future acquisitions, developments and refurbishments.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 59m to Pounds 65.1m.
Mr Hunt said the group had made considerable progress in reducing voids from
about 4 per cent of the rent roll to 3 per cent, excluding vacant buildings
held for future development.
The group would continue its policy of cutting the level of voids and
overheads, rebalancing its portfolio with retail and industrial/warehouse
acquisitions, and keeping its property in the best possible condition.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Banner seeks Pounds 3m and full listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANNER HOMES, the Buckinghamshire-based housebuilder, yesterday called for
Pounds 2.9m via a rights issue and also announced plans to move from the USM
to the main market.
The cash call is of 3.61m new shares at 89p, fully underwritten by
Charterhouse Bank, on a 2-for-7 basis. Brokers to the issue are Charterhouse
Tilney Securities.
The money raised will enable Banner to 'finance its plans based on its
strong land position.' It will also help to reduce debt.
Mr Stuart Crossley, chairman and chief executive, together with connected
interests, currently own 10.1m shares - or 79.8 per cent of the equity. In
addition to the money raised, they are to place their rights entitlement,
amounting to 2.88m shares, with institutions, leaving their interest in the
company at 62.1 per cent.
The move to a full listing is expected to take effect from December 13.
Banner now owns or controls 38 sites with potential for building 800 units.
Its target is to complete some 70 units in the year ending March 31 1994 and
to increase this to about 150 units by end-March 1995.
The group currently manages two BES housebuilding companies and holds a 10.7
per cent interest in each.
It has entered into a put and call option to acquire all of the assets and
liabilities of the two companies in April 1995.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Pittards to close clothing division - Exit
from fashion business will cost Pounds 6.5m and lose 300 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITTARDS, the leather company, yesterday accepted defeat in its four-year
battle to stay in the fashion business with the announcement that it had
decided to close its clothing division at a cost of Pounds 6.5m and 300
jobs.
The decision will leave Pittards with losses estimated at about Pounds 7m
for the 1993 year and has cast doubt on the dividend payment. Pittards said
it was unlikely to return to 'a normal level of distribution' in light of
the announcement.
Pittards, along with its main rival Strong &amp; Fisher, has been struggling to
recover from the effects of extremely volatile sheepskin prices in the late
1980s. Strong &amp; Fisher survived only after a rescue cash injection from
Hillsdown Holdings, thefood group.
Mr John Buckley, finance director, said the costs of closing the Abingdon
factory, together with property write-downs and advance corporation tax
write-offs, would result in an Pounds 8.5m reduction in the group's net
assets to Pounds 22.1m. This would have forced Pittards to breach several of
its banking covenants. However, these had been waived after negotiations
with the group's bankers.
Pittards has debt of Pounds 17.4m, leaving gearing at about 80 per cent. The
redundancy programme would push gearing up to 90 per cent by the end of the
year. Its banking facilities are up for renegotiation in March.
Pittards first entered the fashion business in 1986 with the acquisition of
Garner Booth. The closure leaves Pittards with its original businesses of
chamois leather, gloving leather and shoe and other leathergoods.
Mr Buckley said he was optimistic that Pittards would return a profit next
year. The clothing division, which has returned losses for each of the last
four years, is estimated to have incurred a deficit of about Pounds 1.5m for
the 10 months of this year. Analysts are forecasting a return to profits of
about Pounds 2m in 1994.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Dalgety in talks to buy BP petcare business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DALGETY, the food and agriculture group, is in talks with British Petroleum
over the purchase of its Paragon Petcare business for between Pounds 40m and
Pounds 50m. The company hopes to complete the purchase within the next five
weeks.
Paragon is one of the few remaining businesses in the BP Nutrition division,
which the company put up for sale a year ago. Paragon has sales of Pounds
103m spread across Europe and makes a profit, although neither company would
reveal how much.
Dalgety holds a 25 per cent share of the UK market with its Spillers
Petfoods group and its main Winalot brand, with roughly 8 per cent of the
European market. 'There are several elements we find attractive . . . it
will give us a much wider geographical spread throughout Europe and a
management presence in Europe,' said Mr John Martin, Dalgety's finance
director.
Paragon has its headquarters in Bunnick, the Netherlands, with plants in the
UK, Germany and France. It will also add to Dalgety's presence in branded
dry petfoods with its Beta product in the UK market where the agriculture
company has not such a strong presence.
BP has sold its main nutrition businesses leaving a few peripheral companies
active in fish farming and chicken breeding still to sell. Earlier this
year, it sold Purina Mills, the largest supplier of animal feeds in the US,
to the Sterling group, a venture capital organisation.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, said yesterday that it
had bought the National Bank of Canada's mortgage book.
Purchase of the mortgage portfolio, worth Pounds 24.1m, marks the bank's
departure from the UK mortgage business, which it entered in 1988. Neither
the bank nor the Nationwide would reveal the price that had been paid.
The portfolio will be managed by Nationwide Home Loans, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the building society, bringing its assets to Pounds 147m. The
society itself has assets of over Pounds 34bn.
National Bank of Canada said that it had sold the mortgage book because its
core business was in treasury and corporate matters rather than on the
retail side.
In August, the bank reported a strong recovery for the third quarter and
nine months.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Housing starts help Meyer to Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEYER INTERNATIONAL, the building products group, said yesterday that the
fragile recovery in the UK housing market and thus the outlook for its own
profits hinged on the Budget later this month.
'We would see a neutral budget as reasonably positive for our business,'
said Mr John Dobby, chief executive, as he reported a jump in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 19m.
Meyer was helped by the full benefit of a lower cost base after three years
of cost-cutting.
Sales in the six months to September 30 rose to Pounds 600.8m compared with
Pounds 540.5m, stripping out a Pounds 17.7m contribution from Cadel, a
plumbers' and heating merchants sold last year.
Meyer, which raised Pounds 70m in a rights issue in April, is holding its
interim dividend at 4.2p, payable from earnings up at 11.3p (5.9p restated),
and expressed cautious optimism about prospects.
It said: 'We have seen a modest increase in demand in the first six months
and we have seen that continue in October and November to date.'
Mr Dobby said Meyer had been helped by housing starts climbing 'steadily
upwards' because of the 'direct relationship' with its main product, timber.
He said prices had risen between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent on an
annualised basis after 'many years' of falls, with the price of timber
lifted a little more.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 24m (Pounds 17.9m). The 191-strong Jewson
builders' merchants chain, which closed 11 branches last year, improved its
contribution to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 7.1m) on sales up at Pounds 215.1m
(Pounds 209.4m).
Meyer may add branches and said bad debts in the division fell to 0.74 per
cent (1.5 per cent) of sales.
Profits in the forest products division were Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 6.1m) on
sales of Pounds 180.3m (Pounds 155.8m). In continental Europe profits were
Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5m) on sales ahead at Pounds 195.3m (Pounds 168.6m).
US laminates delivered profits of Pounds 200,000 against last year's neutral
contribution on sales ahead at Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 6.7m).
Net interest payments fell to Pounds 5m (Pounds 6.8m) as the rights funds
helped reduce net borrowings to Pounds 69.1m (Pounds 138.4m). Gearing was
20.6 per cent (53.9 per cent).
COMMENT
Loyal shareholders deserve some recovery after last year's dividend cut and
stumping up for the rights issue which critics pin to the Pounds 63.4m net
cost so far of Meyer's unhappier diversifications. The company is not alone
in such mistakes and has some successes, such as Pont Meyer in the
Netherlands and the US laminates business, to its credit.
Taking the positive with the negative, analysts have upgraded full-year
pre-tax forecasts to between Pounds 39.5m and Pounds 41m giving a range of
multiples between 17 and 20 - in line with the sector. Buyers expect
earnings growth on margin recovery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers, the publishing, printing and retailing
group, increased pre-tax profits by 10 per cent from Pounds 3.39m to Pounds
3.75m in the half year to September 25, on turnover 5 per cent higher at
Pounds 54.9m, against Pounds 52.3m.
All group companies improved profits, apart from Portsmouth Publishing &amp;
Printing which suffered a further decline in its market place.
In response to these poor conditions, PP&amp;P closed a free newspaper,
Streetlife, and also continued to reduce manpower elsewhere.
These actions resulted in rationalisation costs of Pounds 639,000 (Pounds
290,000). Excluding these costs, underlying profits before tax increased by
19 per cent.
Earnings per share slipped to 20.2p (20.6p). In line with the board's
intention of paying an interim of about one third of the previous year's
total, the interim is 3.12p (2.84p).

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rover loses instigator of revival - The
large vacuum at the top left by George Simpson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTURE of Mr George Simpson from British Aerospace to become chief
executive of Lucas leaves a large gap at the top of Rover group, BAe's motor
vehicles subsidiary.
The emergence of Rover as one of the more unlikely success stories of the
European motor industry in the last couple of years has owed much to Mr
Simpson's leadership.
He has been instrumental in driving forward the strategy of so-called -
moving the former chronically loss-making, state-owned carmaker increasingly
up-market into more lucrative segments dominated by producers such as BMW
and away from the dogfight of the volume carmakers.
The architect of this bold marketing strategy for the transformation of the
old, ailing British Leyland volume carmaker into an market manufacturer of
executive cars, was Sir Graham Day, Mr Simpson's predecessor as Rover group
chairman and the man responsible for returning Rover, then BL, to the
private sector in 1988 with its takeover by British Aerospace.
Sir Graham picked Mr Simpson to put the strategy into action, however, when
he appointed him managing director in 1988, and since 1991 he has been both
Rover chairman and chief executive.
The decision to leave Rover has not been an easy one. Mr Simpson, a Scottish
accountant, has been in the motor industry for most of his career, and
virtually all of this time since 1969 has been spent with Rover in its
various earlier guises as BLMC, British Leyland or BL.
Among his earlier posts he was variously managing director of Coventry
Climax, of Freight Rover (BL's van operations), and of Leyland Trucks. He
became chief executive of Leyland Daf, when the BL truck operations were
taken over by Daf of the Netherlands in 1987 but was brought back to Rover
only a year later.
After all the years of frustration, decline and restructuring the ugly
duckling of BL is fast becoming a swan in the shape of Rover. Mr Simpson has
had to weigh up the chances of possibly leading Rover into some form of
independence, if BAe should choose to cash in and float off the car-making
operations at an opportune moment. The carrot dangled by Lucas was the
certain opportunity to head a leading UK manufacturing group now, removing
any uncertainty posed by the vagaries of BAe's corporate manoeuvres.
Mr Simpson leaves Rover in better shape than it has been for decades. The
management team led by Mr John Towers, group managing director, and now
BAe's most senior Rover executive, inherits an operation that is moving
sharply back into profit this year in vivid contrast with most of the
European motor industry that is slipping steeply into loss.
Rover group is the only significant carmaker in Europe to have increased its
sales volume this year helped by the increase in the UK market and a strong
performance - albeit from a small base - in the contracting markets of
Germany, Italy and France. Its sales in west Europe have jumped by 12.9 per
cent in a market that has fallen by 15.3 per cent. Its sales of four-wheel
drive Land Rover vehicles have been growing strongly, and - amidst the
swathes of job cuts in the European auto industry - Land Rover has been
adding jobs.
Rover will be in profit for the full year in 1993 after two years of losses,
says Mr Simpson. In the first six months Rover cut its operating loss before
interest to Pounds 19m from Pounds 31m in the corresponding period last
year.
The first half loss included redundancy and restructuring costs of Pounds
22m. Excluding the one-off rationalisation charge Rover's trading
performance in the first six months improved by Pounds 34m from a year ago
and already resulted in a small profit of Pounds 3m.
Rover has forecast 'a significant recovery' in its financial performance in
the second half of this year.
Production, which fell by 6.4 per cent to 200,872 in the first half under
the impact of significant stock reductions, has risen significantly in the
second half. The benefits from last year's devaluation of sterling, which
were delayed by currency hedging arrangements, are also being fully
reflected in the second half.
The UK car maker's first half financial performance was impaired by launch
costs of around Pounds 10m for the new Rover 600 executive car, which was
introduced in April.
In the second half Rover has benefitted from strong UK sales in August, when
its registrations increased by 23.7 per cent in an overall market, which
rose by 17.8 per cent.
The group has increased its market share in the UK and profitability is
being helped by an improving 'model mix' with an increasing proportion of
sales coming from its larger Rover cars and fourwheel drive Land Rover
vehicles.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hanson sale gets under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, will today signal the start of the sale
of many of its smaller businesses by announcing the disposal of Axelson oil
and gas in North America.
Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive recently given the additional
title of deputy chairman, is understood to have given the go-ahead to raise
more than Pounds 500m from the sale of non-core businesses on both sides of
the Atlantic.
The group has decided to take advantage of the appetite for new issues in
the US and UK markets by drawing up plans for a number of flotations,
although it is still planning to dispose of many of its smaller companies
through trade sales.
Both Mr Bonham and Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries,
the group's US arm, have long been in favour of rationalising the group by
concentrating its resources on big businesses such as coal, building
materials, tobacco and chemicals.
The rise in the group's net debt to Pounds 3.5bn, however, has underlined
the importance of bringing borrowings down through disposals.
Net debt rose significantly after last summer's acquisition of Quantum
Chemical Company in the US, which had Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.67bn) of
borrowings.
The new management is understood to have received the unanimous backing of
the board to proceed with the rationalisation programme.
Mr Bonham, according to one of the group's advisers, believes Hanson must
now degear the balance sheet in order to position the group to take
advantage of any potential acquisitions in the future.
Axelson is seen as a typical example of the kind of business Hanson has now
lined up for sale.
Since the group has no plans to be a big force in oil and gas it did not
believe it could justify management time spent on Axelson which has sales of
Dollars 60m and an annual profit of Dollars 9m. It is being sold to a US
company for about Dollars 80m.
Other US companies earmarked for disposal include housebuilding, consumer
products and recreation and leisure companies.
In the UK Hanson is talking to Electra, the development capital group headed
by Mr Michael Stoddart, which is backing a management buy-out team
interested in buying a number of British businesses which could raise as
much as Pounds 90m.

A REDUCTION in underwriting losses helped Commercial Union, the largest
composite insurer, increase pre-tax profits to Pounds 144.2m for the first
nine months of 1993, against Pounds 6.1m for the same period of last year.
The figures were roughly in line with expectations and the shares rose 10p
to close at 606p.
'The substantial improvement in general insurance trading, especially in the
UK, continued in the third quarter and life profits again made a significant
contribution,' said Mr Tony Brend, chief executive.
UK underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 59.8m (Pounds 128.6m), with London
market losses of Pounds 70.9m (Pounds 65.8m) offsetting profits on other
lines.
CU said that although market conditions were continuing to improve, there
'are signs of increased competition for private motor business'.
General insurance premiums rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 3.1bn (Pounds
2.46bn), and life premiums increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds
1.3bn). Investment income advanced to Pounds 263.4m (Pounds 212.4m) - after
charging external loan interest of Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 35.1m) - reflecting
the benefit from higher cash flow, the proceeds of capital issues and
exchange rate movements.
Group underwriting losses fell to Pounds 215.3m (Pounds 302.3m). Associates
contributions were Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 14m). Non-life profits amounted to
Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 75.9m losses) and life profits were Pounds 86.4m
(Pounds 82m). The figures include a loss of Pounds 3.7m, which relates to
the termination of activities in Argentina.
Shareholders' funds at September 30 increased to Pounds 2.31bn (Pounds 1.5bn
at end-1992), which included Pounds 428m from the rights issue and Pounds
81m from shares in lieu of dividends.
COMMENT
Results this week from Royal, General Accident and Commercial Union leave no
doubt about the recovery in the UK insurance market. The main question for
investors is which of the five large composites to favour. On some grounds
CU looks a shade expensive. The company should comfortably achieve full year
profits of Pounds 180m. So at yesterday's closing price, CU is on a
prospective multiple of about 21, one of the highest ratings in the sector.
However, in other ways the company appears to be a safer bet than its
rivals. A historic gross yield of 5.1 provides firm underpinning. Less
volatile life business provides a much higher percentage of CU's earnings
than at any of its four main composite rivals. At the nine months stage,
life provided 30 per cent of income and nearly 60 per cent of operating
profits.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 49% Volex surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLEX GROUP, the electrical interconnection products company, lifted pre-tax
profits 49 per cent, from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds 4.8m, in the 26 weeks to
September 30.
However, Mr Ken Hooper, finance director, said that the corresponding period
did not include Mayor, the Singapore-based maker of data and power cord
assemblies acquired in October 1992 for Pounds 6.5m, or CMS, the US moulded
cable assemblies maker bought in January 1993 for Pounds 3.1m.
Group turnover grew 47 per cent to Pounds 72.5m (Pounds 49.4m) and operating
profits advanced 61 per cent to Pounds 4.83m (Pounds 3.01m). Investment
income rose to Pounds 448,000 (Pounds 222,000) though interest payable also
rose to Pounds 478,000 (Pounds 18,000).
Mr Oliver Chapple, who became chief executive in October after Mr Howard
Poulson had been head-hunted by Farnell Electronics in May, said that Volex
now had three poles of operations - the Far East, Europe and the US. After
the rapid expansion of the last two years - especially overseas; 60 per cent
of sales are now outside the UK - Volex now had an international capability
in marketing and supply.
Volex had to become 'a unified force' within the global market, Mr Chapple
said, with its sourcing rationalised and with co-ordinated marketing
initiatives. Then organic growth would follow. Mr Bill Goodall, chairman,
added that Volex would still be looking to make another important strategic
move - along the lines of the Mayor acquisition.
In cable assemblies, Pencon continued to benefit from legislation over the
pre-fitting of plugs to electrical appliances. In Europe sales grew to the
personal computer industry but fell to the mainframe market. The US 'stood
still', said Mr Chapple, though the group was now also focusing on the
medical sector which he expected would have a high growth rate.
Specialist cables and wiring harnesses performed less well though Volex
Wiring Systems had now been restructured.
Earnings fell to 10.5p (11.2p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 6.5p.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Unilever puts a smile on Chinese faces with
toothpaste venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER IS to set up a joint venture with Shanghai Toothpaste Factory in
China for the production and marketing of oral care products.
Unilever will have a 60 per cent share in the venture - its sixth in China -
which will employ 1,350 people.
Shanghai Toothpaste claims to be China's largest toothpaste manufacturer -
producing more than 550m tubes a year - and with about 5 per cent of world
production, is also the largest manufacturer in Asia.
Its brands Zhonghua (China) and Maxam are well known in China, while Maxam
is also exported to several Asian and African countries.
With a population of over 1.2bn, the Chinese oral care market has
substantial growth potential. Toothpaste is already widely used and there
are significant opportunities as oral hygiene consciousness increases,
prompted by educational programmes aimed at the predominantly young
population.
Shanghai Toothpaste and Unilever will team up to utilise technological and
marketing expertise to further develop the Chinese brands, together with
Unilever's existing international brands which will be introduced in China.
Unilever's brands include Signal, Mentadent, Pepsodent and Close-Up.
The transaction will be subject to the approval of the Shanghai authorities.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting and rising output behind
earnings surge at Lonrho SA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST CUTTING and increased output helped boost income after tax at Lonrho
South Africa's platinum interests by more than 100 per cent in the year to
end-September, from R27.8m to R56m (Pounds 8.75m).
However, the fall in the price of rhodium, by 44 per cent from the 1992
average, hit cash flow so borrowings increased by R80.4m to R807.9m.
Lonrho SA said that production of refined platinum group metals rose by 27.8
per cent to more than 938,000 troy ounces. Unit costs, from mining through
to production of metals in matte, fell by 8.2 per cent to R19,807 a kilo,
excluding a one-off cost of redundancies, and by 7.3 per cent to R19,990
including this cost.
Turnover at the division, which takes in Eastern Platinum in Bophuthatswana
and Western Platinum in the Transvaal plus Western's refinery near
Johannesburg, rose by 10 per cent from R830.2m to R913.7m.
Net income, after an extraordinary item of R91.66m (R11m) associated with a
reduction in deferred tax liability following a lowering of the tax rate,
was R147.7m (R38.9m).
Lonrho said capital expenditure, excluding interest capitalised, was R100m
and would be about the same this year.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Simpson move to Lucas confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the UK automotive and aerospace components group,
yesterday confirmed that its next chief executive would be Mr George
Simpson, currently deputy chief executive of British Aerospace and chairman
of Rover Group, BAe's vehicles subsidiary.
The Midlands-based group has been trying for months to secure the services
of Mr Simpson, 51, who is given much of the credit for the revival in
Rover's fortunes. His appointment will go a long way to allaying City
concerns over Lucas's protracted choosing of new management.
Lucas would not reveal Mr Simpson's salary, but dismissed industry talk of
his being offered Pounds 1m a year and a Pounds 3m bonus as 'ridiculously
out of line'.
There was some surprise that Mr Simpson would not be joining Lucas until May
1 and that Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of Lucas since
1987, would continue as non-executive chairman. However, it is expected that
Sir Anthony, 63, will only stay on for as long as it takes to choose a new
chairman, in whose appointment Mr Simpson will be fully involved.
Mr Simpson's official statement left no doubt as to who would be in charge.
He said: 'I am delighted to be joining the successful Lucas team and to be
taking over its leadership from Tony Gill. My experience at Rover and
British Aerospace tells me that there are few more competitive business
sectors and I fully understand the magnitude of my new challenge.'
Sir Anthony was asked last year to postpone his retirement until the
succession was resolved. The group's finance director and head of aerospace
had both left after failing to get the job of chief executive.
Lucas was cited as a possible takeover target after recession caused profits
to slump and its shares touched a five-year low of 78p in September last
year. They have since recovered to 177p as the group has cut thousands of
jobs and sold several businesses. The restructuring helped pre-tax profits
double to Pounds 50.3m this year, but that is still a tiny return on sales
of Pounds 2.56bn.
In addition to Rover, Mr Simpson has responsibilities for some of BAe's
problem areas, such as property development, construction and space systems.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Electrolux recovers strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTROLUX, the largest European white goods manufacturer, has swung into a
SKr198m (Pounds 16.5m) profit in the third quarter, after financial items,
from a SKr22m loss a year earlier.
The better-than-expected performance lifted the group's shares SKr18, or 6.3
per cent, to SKr305 yesterday. It took profits for the first nine months to
SKr961m, up 31 per cent.
Sales for the third quarter climbed 35.5 per cent to SKr24.6bn, while
operating income increased to SKr646m from SKr370m.
The figures reflected the benefits of a weaker krona, restructuring, and the
development of new product ranges. They also demonstrated that problems in
the North American and Spanish markets, which cost SKr500m during the first
six months, were largely over.
Analysts said the third quarter performance reflected strong growth in
operating income in outdoor products and industrial products. The outdoor
business, which saw sales climb 66.6 per cent to SKr2.55bn, was boosted by
krona weakness with its orientation towards the US.
The picture within domestic appliances, the group's biggest division, was
mixed, even though sales rose 32.1 per cent to SKr14.7bn.
Bright spots were an increase in operating income in the group's US white
goods operation and a bottoming out of the sharp downturn in the Nordic and
Spanish markets.
However, demand fell in Germany after growing throughout the first half, and
Italy was one of a number of other countries to show weaker growth. Only the
UK showed improvement.
Currency factors helped group sales rise 26 per cent in the first nine
months to SKr74.2bn, as volumes rose 4 per cent. Operating income climbed 20
per cent to SKr2.26bn.
Mr Staffan Ostlin, an analyst at Carnegie in Stockholm, said: 'Electrolux is
through the worst but it is still looking at a tough market. European
appliance sales could fall by 1 per cent next year.'
Carnegie expects the group to record a full-year profit of around SKr1.4bn,
compared with SKr1bn.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Italians are lured towards the big sell-off: The launch of a
long-awaited privatisation drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For millions of Italians, the face of privatisation will be a former Miss
USA, wearing a double-breasted suit and tie. The lady from Credito Italiano,
the state-controlled bank kicking off Italy's first big sell-off, may become
as familiar as the 'Sid' of British privatisations.
Tomorrow sees the start of the international roadshow for Credito Italiano,
Italy's sixth biggest bank. Two weeks later, the shares will be priced, with
placing begining on December 6.
The L10bn (Pounds 4m) advertising budget - directed through the press rather
than television - highlights the scale of the task. Italy is going through
political convulsions caused by the corruption scandal and the prospect of
elections next year.
Meanwhile, the earnings outlook for banks is extremely gloomy because of
recession. Credito Italiano is heavily exposed through its traditional
emphasis on lending to big companies - it is one of the five biggest lenders
to the struggling Ferruzzi group.
The advertising campaign must also raise public awareness of other
privatisations. In February 1994, the treasury plans to float up to 30 per
cent of the financial services group, Istituto Mobiliare Italiano. Soon
after, Iri, the state holding company which is selling the 67 per cent
Credito Italiano stake, will dispose of its 57 per cent interest in Banca
Commerciale Italiana, another big bank.
By the end of next year, flotations should be concluded of the Ina insurance
group and the Enel electricity generating authority. In 1995 Stet, Italy's
state telecommunications group, is to be fully privatised after
re-organisation. Later investors may get a first taste of the state's
lucrative oil and gas activities after Eni's restructuring.
It is not clear how much Italy's treasury, struggling to bring down one of
the world's biggest budget deficits, will make from the sell-offs. Officials
are wary of issuing forecasts, and next year's budget omits privatisation
income.
Credito Italiano should net about L2,000bn. Receipts from IMI depend on how
much is sold. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said this week it
would be 25-30 per cent. That is twice as much as first forecast and implies
proceeds of about L1,500bn.
Estimating the income from BCI is more difficult, as it depends on whether
the government will accept the creation of a 'hard core' of institutional
investors, grouped around Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank. Depending
on the premium for control, analysts reckon Iri's shares could be worth
L2,400bn.
Next month's start to privatisation ends a tortuous process begun in 1992 by
prime minister Mr Giuliano Amato.
Much of the work during his government's term of office was technical,
including steps to change the public entities into joint stock companies and
cut a swathe through layers of party placemen on many of the boards.
Among the obstacles were ingrained party political patronage and MPs' fear
of plant closures in their constituencies. Trade unions were far from
supportive in view of likely redundancies. Ideologically, privatisation was
no certain vote winner.
But public acceptance for sell-offs, pushed ahead by the present government
of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was undoubtedly reinforced by the groundswell of
support for change provoked by the corruption scandal. Privatisation has now
reached 'the point of no return', according to Mr Barucci.
But ministers are still crossing their fingers that the first deal goes
well. The Milan bourse remains thin by the standards of London or Frankfurt,
although turnover has surged this year because of new laws forcing banks to
deal on the bourse and introducing computerised screen-based trading.
But while daily volumes have risen almost tenfold from the lows of summer
1992, Milan often remains dependent on fickle foreign investors. Attempts to
boost domestic investment in equities through new legislation have so far
had little effect. A long-awaited law to create private pension funds, which
could revolutionise institutional share buying, has so far failed to produce
a single taker. Measures put forward in 1992 to stimulate private equity
purchases using tax breaks have run aground because of a ministerial wrangle
about the fiscal consequences.
Such setbacks explain the stress being placed on preparing the market, with
daily full-page advertisements featuring Credito Italiano's smiling lady.
Her face will not just launch a deal, it should also condition Italian
investors to expect a thousand more.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Courtaulds hit by China squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS, the chemicals and fibres group, yesterday warned that the
Chinese credit squeeze had hit sales of three of its most important
businesses. The company explained that European and US prices had been
affected by Asian production being diverted from the slowing Chinese market.
The shares fell 44p to 432p.
Pre-tax profits rose 9 per cent in the six months to September 30, from
Pounds 88.4m to Pounds 96.4m, helped by a Pounds 24.4m net gain on
disposals. Operating profits fell from Pounds 92.5m to Pounds 86.4m on
turnover of Pounds 991.7m, against Pounds 911.7m.
The results were flattered by currency changes. At constant exchange rates,
turnover and operating profits would have been Pounds 46m and Pounds 5.8m
lower respectively.
Courtaulds warned it would make a restructuring provision of Pounds
35m-Pounds 45m for its north American and European coating operations.
Capital spending would also be considerably higher in the second half.
Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said the anti-inflation drive in China
had serious knock-on effects. 'Production of acrylics and acetate tow that
were previously going to China have been diverted to Europe, although some
Chinese acrylic buying has lifted prices a bit.' Surplus viscose from China
had started reaching the US and would adversely affect second-half sales.
Mr Huismans said he was not overwhelmed by the recovery in the US economy.
'Consumer confidence has returned . . . but you need confidence to sanction
capital projects.'
Mr Huismans said sales of Tencel, its innovative fibre, were constrained by
capacity. The board announced it would invest Dollars 134m (Pounds 90m) in a
new 30,000-tonnes-a-year plant in Alabama. Another plant would be built, at
Kelheim in Germany or Grimsby in the UK.
Net borrowings were down from Pounds 300m last September to Pounds 183m. Net
interest was, however, up from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 15.4m, partly due to a
lower pension fund credit and less return on sterling deposits. There was a
net cash inflow of Pounds 35.9m compared with an outflow for the same period
last year of Pounds 66.5m. Earnings per share rose from 18.1p to 19.5p. The
dividend was raised from 3.8p per share to 4p.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Future of Merrett Group in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the Merrett Group, one of the largest agencies at the Lloyd's
of London insurance market, was in question last night after the breakdown
of a US plan to provide new backing for the group.
Merrett said that Travelers, the US insurance company, had withdrawn a
scheme to underwrite business alongside syndicates managed by Merrett on a
so-called 'consortium' basis.
Travelers, recently taken over by Primerica, the financial services group,
would also have bought a sizeable stake in the Merrett managing agency, in a
deal which would have helped offset a sharp decline in support for Merrett
syndicates from Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally
backed the Lloyd's market. Travelers refused to comment last night.
Merrett is seeking the backing of other Lloyd's agents, but it is is
understood that talks earlier this week between Merrett and AJ Archer
Holdings have so far been unsuccessful.
The affair completes an unhappy year for Mr Stephen Merrett, one of the
market's most powerful underwriters, who is chairman of the Merrett Group.
Mr Merrett resigned as deputy chairman of the market after intense pressure
from Names and their agents in August.
Executives of Primerica are said to have viewed the Merrett deal as an
unnecessary complication when their plans to take over Travelers were
incomplete.
Mr Bob Clements, president of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, which owns the
world's largest broker, and helped engineer the Travelers deal, yesterday
reaffirmed support for the group, describing recent criticism of Mr Merrett
as 'personalised and without regard to underlying fundamentals'.
A Bermuda-based company, set up earlier this year by Marsh and JP Morgan, to
provide reinsurance for Merrett syndicates would continue to operate.
However Marsh, and JP Morgan, would not now be taking stakes in the Merrett
agency, a move they had agreed as part of the Travelers plan. 'There is no
point in us taking a stake except in so far as that was a catalyst to
attract other capital,' said Mr Clements.
Merrett will seek to generate support from members' agents, which handle the
affairs of Names. But agents left a meeting with Mr Merrett yesterday
distinctly downbeat about the group's prospects. One agent said that the
group had 'few options available'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Britain threatens to limit US flights into Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRANSATLANTIC air war flared up again last night with the British
government threatening to limit US flights to Heathrow in retaliation
against efforts to undermine British Airways' rights in the US.
The UK's tough reaction is expected to revive tensions over transatlantic
air services and threatens to complicate the already difficult negotiations
on a new 'open skies' agreement between the two countries.
The UK is accusing Washington of seeking to curtail BA's rights to offer
joint code sharing services with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier in
which BA owns a 24.6 per cent stake.
Code sharing is a growing trend in the airline industry and enables two
airlines to use their respective ticketing codes. This enables an airline to
offer a service with a single code even if part of the journey is made on
the other carrier.
In the case of the BA-USAir partnership, BA operates the transatlantic legs
while USAir serves the US domestic sectors.
UK airlines obtained rights to code share with US carriers under the
so-called Heathrow Deal negotiated in 1991 which allowed American Airlines
and United Airlines into Heathrow, the world's biggest international
airport.
The latest row follows an application to the US government by BA in August
to expand its code sharing services with USAir. After a three months delay,
the US announced last Friday it would only give approval for the new BA code
sharing services for the next 60 days instead of the usual 12 months.
Lord Caithness, the UK aviation minister, described the US decision as a
'provocative act quite contrary to our agreement with the US'. He added the
UK government felt the move would prejudice BA because airlines cannot plan
on a 60 days basis.
The UK is not taking immediate action, but has given notice it will withdraw
permission for one flight a week each by American Airlines and United
Airlines from Heathrow to Chicago and Washington respectively from 12
January - the date BA's code sharing approval expires, unless renewed by the
US before then.
It is the first time the UK has threatened to block flights by US carriers
in London, but Lord Caithness said the government felt it had no option
after the 'surprising' US decision.
He said the UK was committed to liberalisation, but the 'open skies'
negotiations with the US were a separate issue with the existing Heathrow
agreement.
Washington had so far given no explanation for its action, except to state
that the decision was linked to the current bilateral talks with the UK over
a new aviation agreement.

FT  18 NOV 93 / EU budget plans pose threat to unity says Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SCATHING attack on European Union spending plans is launched today by the
Bundesbank, which says they threaten progress towards monetary and political
union and will worsen Germany's budget difficulties.
In its monthly report for November, published as members of the central
bank's decision-making council meet today in Frankfurt to consider further
interest rate cuts, the Bundesbank cautions that the financial disciplines
embraced by member states under Maastricht could be undermined by EU
spending.
'The effectiveness of individual countries' monetary policy may be
restricted through the increased granting of direct credits and subsidised
lending at the community level,' the Bundesbank says. This would 'scarcely
be helpful' on the path to economic and monetary union.
Adopting the tone normally reserved for its critique of domestic spending,
it says the EU's budgetary behaviour must be in harmony with broader
macro-economic and monetary objectives.
The Bundesbank stops short of urging the government to curb its contribution
to the EU budget, but says Germany's transfers to the union are set to
increase in the context of a projected steep rise in total EU spending.
Total EU spending on structural measures is set to be Ecu176bn (Pounds
134bn) in 1993-99, compared with Ecu67bn in 1988-92.
It predicts that Germany's gross transfer of funds to the union will grow
from DM38bn (Pounds 15bn) currently to DM52bn in the next five years, an
average annual growth of 8 per cent - far higher than the intended increase
in total government spending. Net transfers - with the inflow of funds to
eastern Germany - will climb from DM22.4bn in 1992 to DM30bn in 1997.
Germany's role as largest contributor to EU finances may have been justified
before reunification but, the Bundesbank argues, it is questionable now,
following reunification. Germany is now, in purchasing power terms only the
sixth most prosperous country in the union, having been the second after
Luxembourg.
The Bundesbank also says that economic fundamentals are more important in
determining the stability of a currency than institutional arrangements such
as the European Monetary System.
Thus the increased flexibility in the exchange rate mechanism since the move
to wider bands did not reduce the chances for stable relations between
currencies - so long as countries pursue the objective of medium-term
economic stability.

FT  18 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After an agonisingly long wait, Lucas has finally got its man. It is more
than a year since the company renewed its search for a chief executive to
replace the retiring Sir Anthony Gill, and two years since the quest
originally started. As a new leader for Lucas Mr George Simpson is a
near-perfect candidate. His experience in helping to transform Rover will be
invaluable, as will his aircraft industry connections with British
Aerospace, so it is a pity that Lucas did not find him earlier. The delay
will have done little to boost morale and, in that context, it is
unfortunate that BAe now wishes to hang on to him until May.
Still, however belatedly, Mr Simpson is just the man to take the difficult
decisions which Lucas faces. The company will have to examine how many
expensive development projects it can afford to fund. Its applied technology
division may need further rationalisation. Most importantly, he will need to
motivate and encourage the management team to turn the company round in much
the same way that he did at Rover.
All of that should underpin Lucas's nascent recovery. Unfortunately for the
incoming chief executive, the company's share price already discounts most
of probable earnings gains over the next two years. He may thus have to wait
for his efforts to be reflected in the stock market. BAe, meanwhile, has
suffered a heavy blow. Yet given Mr Simpson's talent for promoting good
people to support him, it should be able to make good the loss.

FT  18 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Land Securities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having basked in glory throughout recession thanks to its defensive virtues,
Land Securities has seen its halo dim as the property sector has revived.
Although its shares have shot up from 355p to 734p since sterling's ejection
from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, Land has still underperformed the sector
by 12 per cent. Its weighting of the quoted property sector has dropped from
35 per cent of the total to 27 per cent over that time.
Nevertheless, Land should not be ignored altogether until the next recession
looms. Its great rent collecting machine keeps rolling and its balance sheet
strength makes it one of the precious few property companies capable of
sustaining aprogressive dividend policy. Moreover, while property shares
remain so far ahead of underlying market fundamentals, Land will continue to
provide a relatively safe haven against economic setbacks. The company,
however, remains cautious about prospects. Recovery is fragile, with
occupational market rents continuing to fall in central London.
But Land will have to step up its acquisition programme if its shares are
not to be left behind when recovery grips. It was a pity, therefore, that it
was unable to commit more than Pounds 70m in the first half when the
opportunities appeared greatest. The flood of institutional investors into
property has now damped yields, making it difficult to buy on good terms.
Nevertheless, Land's expertise may yet enable it to unearth some nuggets and
it can easily gear up to spend Pounds 500m. That scale of spending may be
required, though, if Land is quickly to re-ignite its rental and earnings
growth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After last week's somewhat disappointing news on wholesale price inflation
and consumer credit, UK markets were beginning to accept that the
chancellor's room for manoeuvre on interest rates was limited. In the light
of yesterday's retail prices index, they may have to think again. October's
small rise in clothing prices and an actual drop in household goods prices,
as well as cuts on food, reveal little immediate inflationary pressure.
There is a danger in reading too much into one month's set of figures, but
the starting point for the inflationary blip forecast by the Bank of England
now looks lower than previously expected. It also appears that, at least in
the domestic market, consumers' price consciousness is preventing companies
from pushing up margins much.
This background will make it much harder for Mr Clarke to resist pressure to
follow continental European interest rates lower, especially if sterling
continues to rise against the D-Mark. Fierce price competition among
supermarkets should also damp inflationary expectations. In theory Mr Clarke
could cut rates even if he announced minimal tax increases in the Budget.
Since there is little prospect of the PSBR significantly undershooting the
treasury's Pounds 50bn forecast, he has in practice an even better
opportunity to tackle the deficit as well.

FT  18 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds catches cold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The message from chemicals companies gets bleaker by the day. Like BOC on
Tuesday, Courtaulds sees no sign of an upturn. In addition to the cyclical
pain, it is suffering renewed pricing pressure in some of its most
profitable markets. The proximate cause is the credit squeeze instigated by
the Chinese government, which has led to surplus capacity worldwide in
products ranging from viscose fibre to cigarette tow. Yet it is a measure of
the fragile balance that such incidents are destabilising. While consumption
in developed markets remains stagnant - and price rises are elusive -
chemicals companies will be vulnerable to nasty shocks.
How long the China syndrome will last is unclear. On a rosy view, the credit
squeeze will prove a hiccup in an otherwise uninterrupted pattern of growth.
China has resumed buying acrylic fibres in recent weeks. The worry is that
low-cost Asian producers which switched output into profitable markets such
as US viscose will be loath to retreat even when China returns. Courtaulds
would then have to live with lower margins. Exciting long-term prospects
such as Tencel - Courtaulds' new fibre - cannot deliver earnings growth
unsupported.
Whatever the eventual outcome, Courtaulds faces a tough year. The company
continues to squeeze the most out of its existing business. The proposed
joint venture with Hoechst in fibres should bring another slug of turnover
for Courtaulds' management to get to grips with. The hope must be that
another round of provisioning will carry it through 1994, by which time
cyclical recovery may at last be within reach. Yesterday's 9 per cent fall
in the shares suggests the stock market is unwilling to look that far ahead.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Wider powers for DTI in deregulation bill: Government aims
to repeal 'hundreds' of measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry is to receive sweeping new powers
enabling it to repeal hundreds of regulatory measures without having to
refer to parliament.
The new powers will be contained in a deregulation bill, to be announced in
today's Queen's Speech.
While the details of the bill will remain under wraps until later next
month, Mr Neil Hamilton, minister of corporate affairs, said the government
planned to get rid of 'hundreds of regulations' without seeking primary
legislation.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Mr Hamilton, who is
spearheading the government's deregulation initiative, said: 'We are
planning to clear out the accumulated dross of a number of bills without
seeking primary legislation which would clog up parliament.'
He made it clear that the DTI would have new powers to repeal by order many
statutory instruments, which allow ministers to make regulations without the
specific order of parliament.
Mr Hamilton was scathing about many of the country's 'mushrooming
regulations', which he said had become an intolerable burden on bus-iness.
The minister plans to use the new powers to roll back the boundaries of
regulation, although he has not yet decided which specific regulations will
be repealed.
But he made it clear that he is prepared to question all red tape by
singling out the Financial Services Act, which underpins City regulation. He
said it had given rise to many non-statutory rules.
In response to well-publicised fraud cases in the 1980s, Mr Hamilton said
the government was criticised by parliament for not being 'draconian enough'
in cracking down on insider dealing. So it had introduced more regulation in
the form of the FSA.
'This goes to the heart of the problem,' he said. 'You either take a
proportionalist or absolutist view of how to deal with problems.'
Mr Hamilton said he was aware that much of what he was proposing was
controversial, but said it was essential that somebody asked difficult
questions. 'In the past there has been no scientific method of opposing
regulation.'
A series of seven business taskforces is busy identifying regulations that
could be scrapped after the contents of the deregulation bill are published.
The bill will also ensure that before new legislation is introduced,
ministers will be forced to complete what Mr Hamilton called a compliance
cost assessment - how much it will cost industry and small businesses.
Mr Hamilton said he would not allow what he called the 'Sir Humphrey
syndrome' in Whitehall to cause his initiative to run into the sands.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Howard to seek bar on industrial action by prison officers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government plans today to raise the stakes in a confrontation with the
Prison Officers' Association by seeking a High Court injunction banning the
traditionally militant union from taking industrial action.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will argue that, since prison officers
hold the office of constable, industrial action involving breach of contract
is outside employment law. If the courts endorsed this view, it would
prevent the union taking most forms of industrial action at a time when it
feels threatened by the introduction of private prison management.
A ballot of POA members approved action short of an all-out strike over the
government's market testing programme, which will extend private management.
The union is also protesting over transfer of work to support-staff, as well
as prison violence and overcrowding.
Action started last week with little disruption so far, but the union plans
to refuse to accept most new admissions to prisons next Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday. This would mean up to 2,000 prisoners having to be held in police
cells as an emergency measure.
Mr Derek Lewis, director general of the Prison Service, said the action
could represent a 'serious threat to the operation of the criminal justice
system and law and order'. The home secretary will seek the injunction this
afternoon unless, as appears unlikely, the union executive calls off the
proposed disruption by midday.
Prison officers, said Mr Lewis, shared some rights of detention with police
officers and held the office of constable. According to his legal advice,
this meant they were not workers within the terms of the Trade Union and
Labour Relations Act. Their dispute was not a trade dispute as defined by
the act, and the POA did not enjoy immunity under it. The union leadership
could not incite prison officers to breach their contracts of employment.
The POA leadership stood by its decision to call next week's action. Mr John
Bartell, chairman, described Mr Howard's proposed action as a 'cynical
attempt to neuter a union that is causing difficulties for the government'.
Britain already has two private prisons and the contract to run a third, at
Doncaster, will be awarded next month.
The POA, which has a hardline reputation, feels under attack because private
operators are unlikely to recognise it. It appeared to go hesitantly into
the present dispute, but the position being adopted by Mr Howard confronts
it with the risk of losing its ability to call action in the future.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Next chapter of the railway children: The competition
between European groups for high-speed rail contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Claude Darmon is right, the world's railways may be entering a new
golden age. The head of transport operations at GEC-Alsthom has a vision of
sleek high-speed trains running at more than 300 kph (187 mph) between many
of the world's largest population centres, cutting journey times and curbing
pollution.
'We are looking at one of the biggest ventures of the next century,' he
says, comparing the new generation of high-speed railways to the development
of international highways and telecommunications.
From Europe to Asia, Latin America and the US, the growth of urban
populations, national wealth and rail technology lend weight to his view.
But if the potential is great, so is the competition.
Mr Wolfram Martinsen is Mr Darmon's greatest competitor and rival as chief
executive of Siemens Transportation Systems. His group, with Daimler-Benz's
subsidiary, AEG, leads the consortium behind the InterCity Express (ICE)
train, which is seeking to erode the lead enjoyed in the world market by
GEC-Alsthom's Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV). It is a classic tale of European
rivalry.
Mr Martinsen is slightly less sanguine than Mr Darmon in his assessment of
the market. 'Within the whole world market for railways, the high-speed
market accounts for a maximum of 15 per cent,' he reckons.
The clearest example of the high stakes involved in the industry rivalry has
come from South Korea. In August, GEC-Alsthom beat off a furious challenge
from Siemens-AEG to win sole negotiating rights to build a high-speed link
between Seoul and the south-eastern port of Pusan. Final details of the
Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.61bn) contract to supply the trains and technology
are now being hammered out.
Siemens is still protesting at the decision, as is the Japanese consortium
led by Mitsubishi, which manufactures the Shinkansen, or bullet trains; but
their chances of a Korean change of heart appear slim.
The battle for the Korean contract, however, is just one round of the fight
for dominance between the three principal players in the industry. Already,
they are preparing to fight for the next contract. First is a possible
project to link Taipei with the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung. Bids
are expected to be invited towards the end of 1994.
Also on the drawing board are plans for high-speed rail links in Canada,
possibly linking Toronto and Quebec via Ottawa and Montreal; in the US,
between Washington, New York, and Boston, as well as in Texas (from Houston
to Dallas), Chicago, California and the north-west; and between Sydney and
Melbourne in Australia.
Siemens and AEG have just spent DM17m (Pounds 6.7m) sending a full ICE train
to the US, first to undertake a coast-to-coast promotion trip ('Ride the ICE
train, the hottest thing on rails' goes the blurb), and now to run for a
three-month trial period on the Amtrak lines from Washington to New York.
Both sides have taken in US partners: GEC-Alsthom has linked up with
Morrison-Knudsen, and Siemens-AEG with General Motors. Even so, Mr Martinsen
believes, 'the US market will develop quite slowly'.
In Europe, therefore, the potential may be greater. At the moment the
economic environment is difficult. The effects of recession and the
constraints on government budgets have forced the postponement of several
TGV orders. Last month, GEC-Alsthom was forced to announce a cost-cutting
plan which includes the loss of 660 jobs from its French workforce of more
than 9,000. But the first steps of a significant expansion in European
high-speed rail links are under way.
The decision by the French government in September to build a new high-speed
line between Paris and Strasbourg raises the prospect of the TGV travelling
across the border into Germany. It will already do so on the planned
Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam and Cologne route, for which 27 trains have been
ordered.
The French authorities have also authorised an extension of the
south-eastern line from Lyon to Marseilles and to Montpellier. That would
all appear to be to the clear advantage of the TGV.
In Germany, however, the ICE consortium has just won the DM2.2bn
next-generation contract for an ICE-2, half the size of the original train,
but capable of being linked in pairs to provide greater flexibility. ICEs
are now running between Hamburg in the north and Berlin in the east to
Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart and Zurich in the south and west. In its 1994
summer timetable, the German Bundesbahn plans to extend the ICE to Vienna.
While the prospects for demand appear healthy, the competition to supply
high-speed rail contracts is likely to remain fierce. This is largely the
result of the nature of the industry. The market for such networks is
comprised of a relatively small number of large projects which come up only
every few years and which last for many years. The South Korean contract,
for example, is not expected to be completed until 2002.
For GEC-Alsthom and its rivals this time lag makes each contract critical.
The experience acquired on one puts the manufacturer in a stronger position
for the next. Similarly, the economies of scale obtained by winning several
contracts allow cheaper pricing in future bids.
German industry is still reeling from its setback in what Mr Martinsen calls
'the Korea shock'. The final decision in favour of the TGV was said to be
because the French train had proved itself for more than a decade, whereas
the ICE has only been running since 1991.
Government support is essential to win such massive prestige contracts, Mr
Martinsen says. 'It is a question of lots of money, and long-term
co-operation. This is only possible if the political will exists.'
Yet he admits that in the US market, for example, the successful contractor
will be decided on the basis of 'technology, price and local content. It
won't help us much if Chancellor Kohl goes over there'.
Two crucial developments lie ahead. The first is the need to develop
multi-system, cross-border trains. If the European links are to become
reality, the trains must be able to deal with a host of electricity
voltages, signalling systems, and safety standards on different national
rail systems. They must also become decidedly cheaper.
This all adds up to good news for the consumer. But for the producers, it
raises the question of whether all can survive.
Mr Darmon believes not. 'I doubt very much there is room for three
high-speed train manufacturers in Europe,' he says, referring to
GEC-Alsthom, Siemens-AEG, and the five-company Trevi consortium, the Italian
high-speed train venture led by Breda. 'The investment in R&amp;D and the cost
of developing prototypes is too high if you don't win contracts,' he adds.
The intensity of competition could encourage collaboration. 'We are open to
co-operation with anyone, and why not Siemens?' asks Mr Darmon. Such a view
is supported by the French and German governments, which last year appointed
representatives to examine possible co-operation.
The representatives have a delicate task in accommodating national rivalry.
Mr Darmon says co-operation would have to consider the fact that 570
high-speed trains have been manufactured by or ordered from GEC-Alsthom,
while the comparable figure for the German consortium is 120. He adds that
any partnership between the two groups should be based on cost and
efficiency considerations and not national and political splits.
Mr Martinsen seems to be more interested in a link-up with the Italian
consortium. 'I am convinced we will have two trains in Europe,' he says.
'There is a big enough market at the moment. Whether we can keep that for
good is another matter. But that is a question for the railway companies,
and the politicians.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Talking to the Chinese
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 15 years of market-oriented reform, China is transforming itself into
an economically liberal, open and powerful market economy. Its cities look
more and more like other Asian cities with new office and apartment blocks,
busy department stores, karaoke bars, and traffic jams caused by cars
instead of bicycles. The economic achievement of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's
senior leader since reform began, is already substantial, as today's FT
survey, makes clear. And this process is almost certainly irreversible:
political power is too decentralised, the constituency which has benefited
from reform too widespread and entrenched.
Yet for the outside world, the enduring image of China remains that of tanks
crushing the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square, a dark reminder that China's
spectacular economic success has been built on a repressive one-party state.
It is this contrast between China's economic dynamism and political
backwardness which continue to make China's relations with the rest of the
world so difficult.
The country is, without doubt, an economic force to be reckoned with, as
demonstrated by the fact that the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, will hold
one-to-one meetings with the Japanese, South Korean and US leaders at this
week's Apec meeting in Seattle. Companies from east Asia and, increasingly,
the US, have responded to China's open door policy by investing billions of
dollars. The rest of the world's economic stake in China's development is
large and growing fast.
Inefficient bureaucracy
Not that the reality of China's economic development fully lives up to its
image. The state enterprise sector remains an inefficient drain on the
economy, social welfare provision is undeveloped and 100m Chinese still live
in absolute poverty. Reform has also brought problems. By unleashing strong
provincial ambitions, Beijing has weakened its ability to exercise
macroeconomic control. Meanwhile, huge ranks of poorly-paid bureaucrats,
still with considerable powers, mean that China's bureaucracy is both
inefficient and riddled with corruption.
But it is the manner in which China conducts its internal affairs which
remains the biggest problem for many outsiders, particularly in America. The
rule of law and freedom of speech remain subservient to the party line,
while documented human rights abuses are legion. Little wonder that the US
has been tempted to link economic concessions - in particular on trade - to
progress on non-economic issues.
Human rights
President Bill Clinton's success in persuading Congress to renew China's
Most Favoured Nation status this year depended, in part, on his willingness
to link next year's renewal to China demonstrating 'substantial progress' in
tackling human rights abuses, progress which China has yet to demonstrate
convincingly.
Yet to try to ostracise China from the world community or to blunt its open
economic development with trade restrictions would be a grievous error.
Market reform in China may be irreversible, but the outside world has the
power to speed or impede that process. And the pace at which this change
occurs is, almost certainly, the most important determinant of the rate of
political change.
The evidence from elsewhere - South Korea and Taiwan are good examples  - is
that economic growth and liberalisation intensify the pressure for political
freedom and democratic change. Closing the door on China, and thus
effectively slowing the flow of western capital, practices and ideas into
the country, can only slow that change.
In short, renewal of China's MFN status is the best way to encourage
political change, a fact that in recent weeks Mr Clinton has shown he
recognises. His desire to engage China in a co-operative rather than
antagonistic relationship is the right course. China's new wealth and status
mean that it too has bigger responsibilities - to honour its obligations to
counter nuclear proliferation, accelerate progress on human rights and
resolve outstanding trade disputes. But progress is more likely to be
achieved if US concerns are carefully explained rather than delivered with
menaces.

Has samizdat spread West? Coincident with lengthening shadows over press
freedom in the UK comes the launch of a monthly current affairs magazine.
The New Reporter will be published over the desk top by Lizard Press in
Cornwall and edited by husband and wife duo, ex-FT features editor John
Bourne and ex-Guardian journalist Jean Stead. But the seat-of-the-pants
nature of the operation seems to be underlined by Stead's admission that,
presently, the money only stretches for the first six months. Hardly
surprising seeing the cover charge for the 20-page mag is just one quid.

<TEXT>
Among all the clamour in Sweden over the planned Volvo-Renault merger, there
has been a deafening silence from the Wallenberg family, the titans of
Swedish industry.
But at last Peter Wallenberg, the current doyen of the dynasty, has
pronounced - and it is welcome news for Volvo boss Pehr Gyllenhammar, who
has long been the most powerful rival to Wallenberg industrial dominance. In
a newspaper interview, Wallenberg backed the merger in principle, saying the
three-year-old alliance between Volvo and Renault was a 'half-cooked egg'.
His comments are a considerable disappointment to the anti-merger camp, led
by Aktiespararna, the small shareholders association.
Everyone in Sweden remembers the occasion in 1979 when Marcus Wallenberg,
Peter's late father, dealt a knock-out blow to Gyllenhammar's grand scheme
of the time, to sell 40 per cent of Volvo to the Norwegian government in
exchange for North Sea oil concessions.
Peter Wallenberg's comments should dispel rumours that he was working
quietly against the current deal. But in fact any other public stance would
have been strange, given that the Wallenbergs sold 50 per cent and
management control of Saab cars to General Motors a few years ago.

Lord Healey, who as plain Denis Healey sent British troops into Northern
Ireland 25 years ago when defence minister in a Labour government, yesterday
delivered a volte-face of impressive stature.
Speaking at The Irish Fund of Great Britain's annual City luncheon, which
despite its name was held in Whitehall, Healey revealed that his grandfather
had been 'a Fenian from Fermanagh', and that he himself was a 'great
believer in muck and magic'.
But despite such a bellicose background, he chose to praise Prime Minister
John Major for 'opening the door to talks'. There really was no practical
alternative to talking to terrorists to solve political problems, he said.
If only that thought had occurred to him 2 1/2 decades ago.

Education secretary John Patten seemed deeply hurt this week when Sir Claus
Moser's National Commission on Education published its report without
tipping him off in advance about its contents.
This caused a few raised eyebrows at the NCE since it had bent over
backwards to try to ensure that Patten would be one of the first to get an
advance peek. Problem was Patten's officials refused to give out their
boss's personal address or phone number.
Undeterred, the NCE agreed to bike an advance copy of the report to the home
of Jim Coe, Patten's chief press officer, in leafy Hampshire. Coe is
normally formidably efficient, but on this occasion, two days later, he had
still not managed to press a copy of the report into his master's hands. So
Patten was completely unable to comment.
How inconvenient.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Men still on top: Women's jobs are increasingly being
poached by the opposite sex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Hubner, aged 27, of Wigton, Cumbria and Liverpudlian Mr Charles
Shiells, 50, have yet to make an impact as the male equivalents of the
suffragette Pankhurst family.
But history books might reserve them a footnote each. After decades in which
women have battled to take jobs traditionally held by men, the roles are
being reversed.
Last month, Mr Hubner was awarded Pounds 2,000 by an industrial tribunal
after he failed to get a Pounds 90 a week job at a Carlisle factory. The
tribunal accepted his complaint that he was rejected because he wanted to
take advantage of the company's subsidised child-minding scheme, available
for women workers.
In an earlier case, Mr Shiells won Pounds 600 compensation after being
rejected for a job as a nurse at Tuebrook Tots nursery in Liverpool.
The driving force behind men's encroachment into previously female territory
is primarily economic. The official male unemployment rate - almost 14 per
cent of the workforce in September - is more than twice the equivalent
female rate.
Mrs Lilian Bennett, chairman of Manpower UK, the employment agency, says
there are no figures showing the number of male to female job applicants but
reports 'a noticeable increase in the numbers of men entering the temping
market for jobs that women have expected to do'.
Mr Hubner and Mr Shiells represent only the tip of a small, but growing,
iceberg. The Equal Opportunities Commission says that of the 1,253
complaints it received last year about sex discrimination in companies'
hiring and recruitment policies, 40 per cent had come from men - a 10
percentage point increase on the previous year.
The EOC also says males are 'more stroppy' about complaining. 'Men are
quicker to take advantage of equal opportunities legislation - so much so
that, because of lack of funds, we are having to prioritise in women's
favour,' says the EOC's Ms Fiona Fox.
At the same time, the recession is forcing changes in corporate behaviour. A
Confederation of British Industry paper earlier this year noted that high
unemployment had reduced the pressure to bring members of under-represented
groups into the labour force and to improve their skills.
Though joblessness largely explains the behaviour of companies and
individual males, there are also some in the equal opportunities field who
detect a backlash against positive discrimination for women. According to a
Department of Employment official, 'positive action is being targeted as
unacceptable at a time of the highest male unemployment since the 1930s'.
No company would admit publicly to dropping commitments to promoting women.
But the Labour party recently provided evidence of a possible groundswell of
male opinion against affirmative action; Labour MPs reacted to what some
described as an 'assisted places scheme' for females in shadow Cabinet
elections last month by throwing two women, Ms Harriet Harman and Ms Ann
Clwyd, off the front bench team. However, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
reinstated Ms Harman as shadow Treasury chief secretary.
Meanwhile, the EOC has received complaints from several would-be male Labour
MPs about the party's proposed ban on men standing in half the parliamentary
seats where the local constituency organisation is looking for a new
candidate.
All this is bad news for those trying to improve the position of women in
work, as the hurdles they face seem as high as ever. A survey of 179
countries by the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation said that,
on current trends, women will take 475 years to achieve equality with men in
'managerial' or 'decision-making' positions in all sizes of companies.
While men have risen rapidly to the top of almost every female-dominated
profession they have entered, women have no comparable success in
traditional male dominated fields - such as the civil service.
For instance, males make up just 7 per cent of all qualified nurses in
Britain. But above the level of senior nurse, men outnumber women, according
to the Royal College of Nursing. 'Men are more assertive because they are
not worried about getting pregnant and interrupting their careers,' says Mr
Jamie Fleming, of the RCN.
Similarly, of 35,000 practising midwives in the UK, only 53 are male. But
one, Mr Paul Lewis, who qualified in 1979, already has one of the country's
top midwifery jobs - director of women's services at West London Hospital.
Though women may envy male success, there is a case for arguing that they
should not gripe about the readiness of men to resort to the law to increase
their job chances: the EOC argues that any act that increases awareness of
sex discrimination by companies can only be beneficial to all in the long
run.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Last lap in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S historic agreement leaves South Africa within reach of what once
was a dream. Over 300 years of white domination will end when the country's
electorate goes to the polls next April, under a constitution which
enfranchises the black majority.
It marks the penultimate step in the dismantling of an evil system that
brought pain and humiliation to millions. The ending of minority rule has
been made all the more remarkable by the fact that President F W de Klerk
has had the wisdom and courage to preside over the dissolution of white
minority rule. Equally remarkable has been the part played by his main
political adversary, Mr Nelson Mandela, who emerged from decades in jail
calling not for revenge, but for reconciliation.
But the last stage of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy
may prove the most hazardous. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the
predominantly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, and the white-led rightwing
Conservative Party, reject yesterday's outcome.
Even if they can be persuaded to participate, the battle for power through
the ballot box will demand unprecedented tolerance in a sharply divided
society where more than 12,000 people have already died in politically
inspired violence since Mr Mandela's release in February 1990. Maintaining
law and order will challenge the integrity of security forces predisposed to
white minority rule.
But above all, the coming weeks will pose the first test of the
constitution. How voters cast their ballot - indeed whether some vote at all
 -will be determined as much by their assessment of the merits of the
constitution as by the appeal of the parties themselves.
Careful examination
Many South Africans are only now taking in what their representatives have
won or lost at the negotiating table. This calculation will require careful
examination of a constitution whose final shape did not emerge until last
night.
In many respects, what has been published is a model for other African
countries. Proportional representation guarantees that any party winning
five per cent of the vote will have a seat in the executive. The Bill of
Rights accommodates cultural differences while guaranteeing equality under
the law. There is also a formula for equitable allocation of state revenue
to the provinces.
It is not the winner-take-all constitution that was the basis for majority
rule in the rest of the continent. But some critical issues need
clarification, and the outcome could help decide whether Inkatha and the
white right decide to participate in the poll, or try to sabotage it.
Adequate role
Although the constitution envisages a government of national unity, it
remains to be seen whether minority parties are given an adequate role in
the exercise of executive power. And although Mr Mandela's African National
Congress (ANC) has shifted from its opposition to provincial assemblies, the
extent of the powers they are accorded are either not clearly defined, or
subject to being overruled by central government.
Given these uncertainties, the role of the 11-member court that will
arbitrate in constitutional disputes is critical. Yet composition of this
body will be determined by the post-election majority party, putting the
court's independence in question.
If whites' and other minorities' concerns and fears prove well founded, as
this complex agreement comes under wider and closer scrutiny, defections
from the ruling National Party to Inkatha or the far right Conservative
Party will weaken President de Klerk's authority in the demanding months
ahead and heighten the prospect of extreme rightwing violence.
If the powers offered provincial assemblies are of little substance, it may
be impossible to persuade Chief Buthelezi to participate in the election,
raising the frightening prospect of further conflict in his home province of
Natal.
Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela were the architects of the new constitution: they
must address these concerns, and reassure the doubters, if they are to keep
South Africa on course for democracy.

COLLISION
By Maryann Keller
Doubleday/Currency Dollars 25, 285pp
At General Motors, the stumbling giant of the world car industry, it took an
unprecedented two-stage coup last year by the company's outside directors to
oust the old management in a last-ditch effort to drive the company out of
the biggest losses recorded in US corporate history.
Volkswagen, the leader of the European car industry, is racked by losses.
The high-cost producer of the world car industry, it is enduring a corporate
and cultural revolution.
A large part of its senior management has been discarded in less than a
year; its chief executive looks more isolated each day and is fighting a
lonely battle, with his closest colleague under investigation by the German
public prosectutor for alleged industrial espionage.
Toyota, the leader of the Japanese industry, is much less obviously in
trouble, but its previous air of invincibility is being undermined. The
stubborness of the domestic Japanese recession, the surging yen and sales
problems in foreign markets have combined to all but wipe out its operating
profits. It too faces a leadership crisis, as the company struggles to move
beyond the era of the Toyoda family dynasty.
Must Toyota face a crisis as severe as those of GM and VW in order to
change? The question is posed by Maryann Keller, a leading US financial
analyst of the world auto industry, whose latest book, Collision, is a
compelling account both of the storms buffeting the world's carmakers and of
the executives struggling to stay at the helm.
'Toyota is clearly losing momentum and is bogged down by its
responsibilities as Japan's number one corporate citizen. Whether the
company slips into mediocrity or retains its leadership role depends upon
Tatsuro Toyoda (Toyota president since September 1992), a man not known for
decisive action at a time when the company needs vision and leadership,'
argues Keller.
She has set out to chart the fluctuating fortunes of GM, Toyota and
Volkswagen, the leaders of the auto industries of North America, Japan and
west Europe, as they career along a collision course not so much with each
other but with the unfamiliar challenges of the 21st century.
Misleadingly, Keller has chosen to coin the phrase the 'global big three' to
describe her target companies. The industry is dominated by at least a
global big five. Ford, the number two US carmaker, is bigger than both
Toyota and Volkswagen. Nissan, the number two Japanese carmaker, vies with
Volkswagen in size.
Keller is not interested in such niceties, however. Her subjects were not
chosen in deference to the industry's pecking order, but to use the
companies as a way of exploring the national cultures in which they are
embedded.
At such an elevated level the book falls short. In particular, as Keller
travels away from North America it often becomes little more a travelogue
and a beginner's guide to the cultural histories of Germany and Japan.
Within the more narrow focus of the world motor industry, however, Collision
provides a riveting look at some of the forces that have shaped the fortunes
of the three carmakers during recent decades, and provides intriguing
insights into the personalities at the top of the world's dominant
manufacturing industry, as well as those who have fallen by the wayside.
Best-documented by Keller is the upheaval that has riven GM, the company
where her inside knowledge is greatest. She gives a damning portrait of GM
during the era of Roger Smith's 'wild destructive reign' in the 1980s, and
during the unhappy and short-lived tenure of his successor Mr Robert
Stempel.
By the beginning of the the 1990s, 'GM reflected more the crumbling decay of
Detroit's inner city than the durability of its granite and marble
headquarters building . . . A visit to the 14th floor (the executive office
suite) was like entering a time warp from GM's glory days. General Motors
was a perfect example of the contemporary corporate malaise, where income
and privileges bore no relation to performance.'
While many of the GM leaders suffer from the acid of Keller's pen, she is
equally telling in her description of the leading personalities at
Volkswagen, Mr Carl Hahn, chief executive until the end of last year, and Mr
Ferdinand Piech, the man who has spent 1993 struggling with his
predecessor's doubtful legacy.
'Piech was cut from a different cloth than Hahn. While Hahn was smooth as
silk, a consummate charmer who enjoyed the public stage, Piech was balding,
slope-shouldered and haggard - always uneasy in the spotlight.'
At Toyota Keller leaves no doubt that she believes that the company is
heading for a leadership crisis, and that in one of its most difficult
periods the family has chosen a weak leader in the shape of Tatsuro Toyoda,
not groomed like his brother and predecessor Shoichiro, to lead the
corporation. 'At Toyota, regardless of how high the rank might be, everyone
bowed to Shoichiro. But at Toyota Motor Sales, Tatsuro bowed to others.'
The case arguing the relative weakness of Toyota only partially succeeds,
but nonetheless she is ready by the end of Collision to pick her winner.
VW is dismissed for having 'spun in its own narrow orbit' for most if its
history. 'Of the three companies it may be the least adaptable to change.'
Toyota is the most complex because it is standing where GM was 30 years ago.
'It knows how to be successful. The question is: does it know how to
function in a less secure environment?'
Which is the best car company in the world? 'I am compelled to answer, 'The
one that has most recently overcome great problems.' Right now that company
is General Motors.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Perfume ruling cannot go unchallenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof D G RHYS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So now we know. An industry which sells products in such a way as to
preserve an up-market image and to charge prices that generate a retail
profit of 40-60 per cent of the retail price, and which refuses to supply
outlets which might reduce that price is not acting against the public
interest.
At least, so says the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in its report on the
way, mainly foreign, fragrance companies distribute perfume products in the
UK ('Perfume outcome surprises observers', November 12). The report cannot
be clearer in its support of high prices when it says: 'Fine fragrances are
marketed as luxury products and the MMC accept that the suppliers need to be
able to control their distribution in order to protect their brand images
which customers evidently value. There is no shortage of other fragrances at
much lower prices.'
In other words, perfume companies must be allowed to restrict distribution
and supply in order to keep prices high; only if they are paying high prices
do consumers think they are obtaining value.
The MMC judgment on the perfume distribution is perverse and cannot be
allowed to stand unchallenged. Otherwise, all future cases of relatively
high prices can be justified on the grounds of protecting the brand image to
the benefit of consumers. This is not right and is unsupported by mainstream
economics.
When confronted with the MMC decision the question provoked is - who guards
the guardians? One answer could be a House of Commons select committee. If
the Office of Fair Trading, MMC and Department of Trade and Industry cannot
protect the consumer from price exploitation parliament had better ask why.
After all, to remove the barrier to lower prices would reduce the upward
pressure on the retail price index and persuade government to be more
positive in stimulating growth.
To undermine the position of fragrance houses, high price supermarkets,
electrical and audio visual shops and so on would be a genuine supply-side
improvement that reduced the natural rate of unemployment.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unfortunate advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY BEECHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tony Baldry's advice to local authorities on tendering is misguided, if
not wrong. He states (Letters, November 16) that 'it is not possible to
decide whether Tupe applies until the contractors' proposals are seen'. Not
only is it often possible to make such a judgment, legal advice we have sent
to local authorities indicates it would be absurd in many cases not to.
Indeed, we have found that contractors often prefer the certainty of knowing
what the position is when making their bid.
Mr Baldry believes he has issued further advice on this matter. I thought we
were currently consulting him on this. He has clearly already made up his
mind. That is unfortunate as his advice flies in the face both of the law
and common sense. His letter is symptomatic of the government's attitude to
Europe - seeking to evade its responsibilities. Local authorities, however,
recognise they have obligations under European law and will act in the light
of them.
What must be deplored is Mr Baldry's attitude in threatening local
authorities that if they do not do as he says he will take action against
them. It is time for a more considered and helpful approach to this problem.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Economic Viewpoint: New light on 'trust versus law'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the course of preparing some essays for publication, I had to look at a
chapter I had written for a book which appeared in 1989, to commemorate the
10th anniversary of the Thatcher government. The point was to see what, if
anything, should be added by way of postscript.
The answer was: Surprisingly little. That government made a start in
removing some of the impediments to economic success. During the
post-Thatcher years the ground seemed to have been lost again, first because
of the resurgence of inflation and the high interest rates needed to combat
it; and afterwards by the recession which proved longer, more drawn out and
more debilitating than almost anyone expected. Recently, however,
international comparisons have moved in favour of the UK again. Recovery, if
patchy and uncertain, has arrived earlier than in continental Europe, while
Japan is stuck in a deep recession; and the economic debate has moved to the
labour market rigidities which the UK has taken a lead in removing.
But the statistical dust of at least another business cycle will have to
settle down - and the last one went on for over a decade - before any
quantitative conclusions can be drawn. Thus I was glad to come across a book
which moves away from inconclusive numerical comparisons and sheds some
light on why even someone who welcomed the 1980s emphasis on competition and
deregulation should still feel uneasy about some of the cultural aspects of
the Thatcher revolution, including those that live on under the Major
government.
The book in question is The Economics of Business Culture by Mark Casson
(published by the Clarendon Press in 199l). It may be a surprising one for a
advocate of market competition to cite. For the author seems to hanker after
something like the 'business plan for Britain' with which John Smith wooed
gullible CBI members at Harrogate this week. And Casson does not devote
nearly enough attention to the role of competition in providing new products
and new processes, and putting downward pressure on prices.
Yet the best way to approach such a book is to see what can be learned from
it rather than where it is open to question. Professor Casson's object is to
develop a rigorous economic theory which retains the central position of
rationality in traditional economics and of the individual as the unit of
decision, but which drops the postulates of materialism and selfishness.
Without having worked through all the detailed chapters, it is difficult to
say how far he has succeeded - the book deserves more attention than it has
received. Most of the analysis relates to the internal relations of
organisations. The pupil who shared my first year economics supervision at
Cambridge, and who worried about the selfish motives of the textbook
businessman who tried to equate marginal cost with marginal revenue, might
still not have known how to react, even if he had been able to foresee this
book. Nor is it clear how the advice of top Treasury officials such as Sir
Terence Burns or Professor Alan Budd about the forthcoming UK Budget would
be different if they had absorbed Casson's message.
Yet the basic thought behind it is sound. This is that the largest costs in
a modern economy are transaction costs, and that these are minimised in an
atmosphere of trust - in contrast to an atmosphere where everyone tries to
take advantage of everyone else, and no-one moves without a lawyer. An
example of what can go wrong has just been given by a so-called rightwing
member of the British cabinet, John Redwood, when he spoke of the growth in
the number of distant Health Service 'managers in grey suits' all too ready
to solve their problems by closing down hospital wards.
What Casson does not explain is how to combine co-operation and trust within
organisations without this extending to anti-competitive collusion between
them. I still think the best solution is the one outlined in my 1985 Wincott
Lecture: an honest explanation of the benefits of competition and the profit
motive as a means to the general welfare, without making this part of the
'devil take the hindmost' view of life, so bitterly satirised in J B
Priestley's play An Inspector Calls, now enjoying such a successful revival
in London.
Competition as a system of economic relations need not be based on personal
hatred or mutual hostility. Rival small entrepreneurs linked by electronic
cable to their main customers or suppliers need hardly be more aware of each
other's existence than the small farmers of Thomas Jefferson's ideal
republic.
Market economics comes in many shapes and sizes. Casson puts his finger on
the mark when he writes that that the supply side package imported from the
US 'comes laden with certain cultural presuppositions - amongst them the
view that because people cannot be trusted, formal methods of enforcing
competition between them are essential in all areas of activity . . . The US
emphasis on the law as an enforcement mechanism is a related cultural
attitude which may not 'travel' well.' He also describes the way in which
these attitudes have been borrowed from the US when many successful private
enterprise organisations are making their management styles more human and
informal, supposedly under Japanese influence. Thus his unease extends
beyond British admirers of US economic and management styles and extends to
the tenor of the advice that the mainstream international organisations are
giving the former communist and developing countries. How does this analysis
apply to current contentious issues, such as the (now stalling) initiative
to reform the civil service through devolution to smaller agencies and
through market testing of services to ascertain whether they should stay the
public sector?
Casson seems to see such initiatives as characteristic of an authoritarian
leader who not only does not trust other people in general but 'cannot even
trust a few people to do his monitoring for him. The leader will also favour
strong interpersonal competition, sustained by making people rivals for one
another's jobs. The intensity of competition may be further raised by
creating a pool of unemployed or marginal members who are ready to step into
other people's jobs at short notice.'
These words may be a good description of how cabinets are reshuffled in
Britain. But if one wants a more co-operative style in government in
general, smaller units are the first essential. Loyalty and non-material
satisfactions are likely to be more important in an independent hospital or
in a hived-off administrative unit than in a vast organisation like the
National Health Service.
Nor, indeed, did proposals to hive off units originate with the Thatcher
administration. They date back further. I first came across them in a 1960s
Fabian pamphlet. Permanent secretaries who are obstructing the hiving-off
drive, or proposals to advertise senior Whitehall appointments, are behaving
more like male baboons fighting for territory than crusaders for higher
values.
Many people have described the paradox that market liberalisation has gone
hand-in-hand with a shift of power from intermediate sources of authority to
central government. Casson is right to detect incipient authoritarianism
behind free market rhetoric.
But another factor has surely been an excess of caution. Governments have
not had the courage to undertake the drastic reforms which would make, for
instance, local authorities or universities responsible for the bulk of
their own financing. This is why Whitehall centralisers have acquired their
hold. Perhaps the answer to the paradoxes generated by the Thatcher attempt
to get the state off the people's back is to carry it further and really
mean it.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Other ways to connect N American
economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CAMERON DUNCAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on the results of the state and local elections in the
US ('Democrats in retreat', November 4) included the assertion that 'there
is no doubt that the US economy would benefit from Nafta'. There are many
members of Congress, as well as citizens in Canada, Mexico and the US who
would disagree with you and would favour a different sort of economic
integration.
Nafta, they have discovered, is not simply a 'free trade' agreement
integrating the economies of North America. It is also a programme to
entrench the conservative practices of the Reagan-Bush era. By tying
restrictions on government regulations and services to an international
trade deal, Nafta makes the implementation of new public services and
environmental protection much more difficult.
If Congress does pass Nafta, environmental regulations, health and safety
standards, educational policy and labour law will all be affected. Social
policy will be taken outside of the democratic process, restricted by an
international agreement and regulated by unelected trade bureaucrats. Under
Nafta, any US laws that restrict the sales of goods because of the way they
are produced - either by environmentally-destructive processes or unfair
labour practices - would be subject to challenge by Mexican or Canadian
companies.
Even more important, social gains in one country would often be difficult to
maintain. Why should a company comply with costly labour or environmental
laws in the US when it could avoid them by moving to Mexico? There are
alternative ways to connect our economies. A new Nafta could, for example,
include a social charter that would protect environmental and labour laws
and provide funds for raising incomes in poorer regions. We could enjoy the
advantages of international trade without enshrining the 'free market' as an
unlimited mechanism for organising economic life.
Greenpeace does not oppose international economic integration, but on social
and economic grounds we oppose the sort of integration that this agreement
would provide.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: West can aid former Soviet bloc
nuclear clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER HAYES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bronwen Maddox's trip to Chernobyl (November 15/16) has highlighted the
need to clean-up the contamination caused by the world's worst nuclear
accident. She was also right to point out that there is no evidence to
support claims that 8,000 people have died as result of the accident.
However, the fact that 42 people did die and considerable contamination
remains, illustrates that the nuclear industry in the former Soviet Union
needs all the help it can get to put things right.
The British nuclear industry has been at the forefront of providing the
necessary help. Take contamination. A British consortium, involving among
others AEA Technology, has recently developed a 'Chernobyl clean-up
strategy' which has been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's
'know-how' fund. This project will help the Ukraine to secure the funding it
needs for specific projects designed to return contaminated land to more
normal conditions.
Russian Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors were not built to western safety
standards and they had inherent design weaknesses which were exposed in the
1986 accident. In response, Britain leads a consortium of European countries
involved in a Ecu7m project, funded by the EU. This project will identify
how to upgrade the safety features of RBMK reactors and how to make them as
close to western standards as possible.
Britain and other western nuclear powers have the ability to put right what
is wrong in the former Soviet bloc. Your correspondent's report has made a
helpful contribution by keeping the whole topic in perspective.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: Fine Tuning - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A pretty label for a very good concert of microtonal music
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that is, music that employs some non-standard intervals between notes,
smaller or larger than our 'equal-tuning' system accommodates - was what
James Wood gave us in the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday, with his New
London Chamber Choir and an ensemble from his Centre of Microtonal Music.
(This concert is going on tour for the Arts Council's Contemporary Music
Network; see below.)
Microtones include, for example, 'blue notes' in jazz, and certain notes in
various folk-music scales (or modes, or Indian raga) that are too sharp or
flat to be represented on a modern pianoforte. In the 'Fine Tuning'
programme, every piece either had pre-tuned instruments or used microtonal
slides for colouristic effects.
Kevin Volans' 1982 suite White Man Sleeps plays the ethnic card with its two
harpsichords and its viola da gamba, a sort of cello with frets, pre-tuned
to African modes. For some time, that seems to be the only piquant thing
about its gentle dances; but a gamba solo with soft drums develops more
inwardly, and later the composer begins to invent rhythmic patterns and
counterpoint beyond anything in the original material. 'Unacceptably
Germanic,' he now thinks (he wrote the suite while studying with Stockhausen
in Cologne) - but without those twists the piece would be little more than a
curio.
Yliam for ten female voices, by the eccentric recluse Giacinto Scelsi
(1905-88), explores the disconcerting effects of microtonal slides within
sustained, almost motionless harmony. It freezes one's attention for its six
minutes. For a dozen mixed voices, the 1968 Nuits of Iannis Xenakis is a
dramatically varied cry of painful sympathy for political prisoners; as
often with Xenakis, the raw punch that it packs overwhelms any doubt about
whether it is music, exactly.
Jonathan Harvey's recent Valley of Aosta (after an apocalyptic Turner
canvas) conjures up wild aural vistas, using its microtones - pre-tuned on
harps and synthesisers - to misdirect any ear hoping to find a clear
harmonic path through the music. We surrender to the radiant, mercurial
colours. Through them, the two synthesisers cast sharp-focus streams of
bright, even notes - but they are tuned a quarter-note apart.
Wood's own Phainomena, premiered a year and a half ago but much revised last
summer, earns its right to serve as climax for the programme. Though he is a
prolific composer as well as conductor and percussion virtuoso, Wood's
earlier pieces have been distinguished chiefly by ingenuity and eclectic
resource. The extreme, pungent contrasts in Phainomena are theatrical as
could be - but dramatic music, not music-theatre. It sounds like a composer
discovering his own cogent means to a strong, original purpose, rich and
strange.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: Mae West, I'm No Angel - Musicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I feel like a million - but one at a time.' Who else? Had Mae West not
invented herself, someone else would have concocted her. When I heard that
I'm No Angel was a Mae West musical, I imagined one of those
biography-with-songs shows - and feared the worst. As it turns out, I'm No
Angel simply focuses on Mae during her 1948 season in London. She admits to
45, is discussed by journalists as 55 (but as looking 40) and is actually
57. She has her loyal old manager (Gordon Sterne) in tow (who may once have
been the only man she truly loved) - and, while in London, she has an affair
with an 18-year-old boxer (Paul McNeilly) and also starts a friendship with
a 55-year-old nun (Philippa Urquhart).
The boxer and the nun - both, I guess, fictitious - respectively draw out
the flesh and the spirit in our Mae. Not that her flesh and spirit clash
with each other; the author of I'm No Angel, Ayshe Raif, gives Mae an easy
ride. Too easy, actually. Mae steams through her time in London, a
determined symbol of sex and fun, and the main traumas that occur are in
those around her: the boxer, the nun, the manager.
Still, there is something terribly believable about that. The real Monstres
sacres never doubt that they can sin and go to heaven; otherwise they
wouldn't be sacres. Mae has her teenage hunk, she pays his mother hush
money, and meanwhile she consults the nun, chiefly about her late mother.
Yet she listens, too. We get to know the vulnerable sides of the lesser folk
better than we do hers. I'm no Angel would be better if it showed just how
terrifyingly invulnerable Mae is.
What about the one-liners and the songs that Mae was famous for? They are
here in plentiful supply. The jokes are ingeniously worked into the
dialogue: Nun: 'I've heard so much about you'. Mae: 'But you can't prove a
thing.' Nun, laughing: 'I laughed so much when I first heard that line.' The
songs are simply part of Mae's routine - her London show, her daily work
around which she fits in sex with the boxer and psycho talk with the nun.
Lynda Baron plays Mae. Like the show, hers is a sightly superficial view of
Mae, but my only big complaint is that her more vehement scenes lack force.
She sings well - well enough to make you attend to all the wordplay in 'I
Want to Feel that Lowdown Music Trickle Up my Spine'; and she speaks the way
she sings. No doubt the original Mae had more bite, danger, voluptuousness.
But Baron combines fun, heavy-eyed glamour, grit, and sheer camp, all with
enough finesse to make you believe, at least, in her Mae.
Patrick Sandford directs. Much of the first half's dialogue could be paced
with more conviction, but the show runs smoothly and entertainingly. If it
dared to take a more searching view of the ruthlessness, deceptions and
doubts involved in preserving Mae West, it would be more memorable. More
sexy also. As it is, it is a happy reminder of why Mae remains an icon. 'A
lot of men like a gal with a past. They hope that history will repeat
itself.'

The Disney company may be in trouble in Europe, where the once-roaring mouse
now squeaks in terror at its quarterly bank statements. But in America,
corporation and rodent have ridden high throughout 1993, mostly on the back
of a single film Aladdin. Disney's new animated feature has outperformed
last year's Beauty And The Beast to become the highest-grossing cartoon
feature of all time.
Why? How? What is happening? Ten years ago paint-and-brush animation was
pronounced dead or dying by many observers, including, I regret to say, me.
The art had been hounded to an early grave - we all said - by such new
pretenders as modelwork, animatronics and computer graphics.
Now look at the blushes on our faces. Aladdin has been the year's second
favourite film after That Dinosaur Movie and a mere five minutes in your
seat will tell you why. Having seduced us with romantic traditionalism in
Beauty And The Beast, Disney now turn 180 degrees and go for comedy mixed
with high kitsch. The decor in Aladdin is out of Kismet via The Thief Of
Baghdad. The characters are spoofy and (post)modern: led by a Tom
Cruise-like Aladdin and a Robin Williams-voiced genie with a genius for
mimicry. And the pace is so fast, so sure, that British Rail should take a
look at Disney's Advanced Passenger Carpet as a serious potential design
model for 2002.
The story, we know, is simple enough to suit the breakneck pace. Boy meets
lamp; boy rubs lamp; boy, after minor setbacks, is helped by lamp to girl of
his dreams. All the film's directors John Musker and Ron Clements need do is
follow the narrative arrows. We begin with melodrama, mugged with a
marvellous opening conceit: the 'cave' is the mouth of a giant sand monster
and Aladdin is chased from its innards by a roaring, bilious spume of lava.
Further metamorphic fun is sketched in by the villain Jafar and his staff
that becomes a cobra. Then Robin Williams's genie arrives, seizing the
spotlight, the microphone and the movie's transformation franchise.
Williams's performance is less a star turn, more a one-man galaxy expounding
its chaos theory of comedy. When one inspired routine burns out, another
flames up to take its place; all in nanoseconds rather than light years. The
demented tinkling of an air stewardess's voice; Peter Lorre's feline murmur
for a line of necromantic apology ('I can't bring people back from the
dead]'); here some Robert De Niro, there some Bette Midler, there again some
Jack Nicholson. And the vocal gymnastics are matched by visual. The Disney
artists swish their scene-stealer through all the lighting likenesses his
voice invokes, calling on the latest computer technology to do so.
At times the movie's modernist attack can feel like assault and battery. The
princess, in keeping with feminist writ, is less a shrinking violet than a
ballbreaking career girl: I have met her kind behind many a Hollywood
executive desk. And as for Jafar's parrot Iago - need it be quite so
deafeningly vaudevillian in its locutions? 'Oh dat's a big surprise] I tink
I'm gonna die of surprise]' etc.
But why are we complaining of too much energy from a studio that not long
ago, after Walt's death, seemed to be slipping into irreversible coma?
Aladdin and Beauty And The Beast prove there is undreamt-of life both in
Disney and in the art of feature animation. And we we have not even
mentioned the songs. Music by Alan Mencken; lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim
Rice; and my favourite was not the Oscar-winning 'A Whole New World' but the
preposterous, elephant-swaying, over-the-top, out-Intolerancing-Intolerance
'Prince Ali.' Take the children, buy a sack of popcorn, enjoy.
Half a Mel Gibson is better than no Mel Gibson. But The Man Without A Face,
directed by Mr G, shows how stars do like to put their own charisma through
the mincer whenever they get behind the camera.
'Pizza face]', 'Hamburger head]' - these are among the friendly sobriquets
lobbed by local children at the reclusive ex-schoolteacher with the
burn-ravaged features (Gibson) who lives in a sea-washed mansion in Maine.
Turn our hero to the right and we get a perfect Mel profile. Turn him to the
left and we get Elm Street squishiness. Ergo: it takes no small act of
courage for fatherless young Chuck (Nick Stahl) to approach old pizza-face
and request some tuition for his military school entrance exam. He does not
tell mother (Margaret Whitton); for, good heavens, what would she think?
Especially since the man is suspected of having molested a boy years before,
just prior to his scarring car crash.
Can you think of an odder choice for a movie star's directing debut? Then
you have not followed the fashion in these things. Film idols, when they
become film makers, love to deface or deprecate their own glamour. (See
Eastwood giving us wrinkles-and-all in Unforgiven). It shows that they are
serious artists not just pin-ups. Gibson's film, though, never feels focused
enough to offer either serious art or serious image-critique. Apart from
some vague tut-tutting at small-town gossip and vaguer support for
persecuted sexual minorities - Mel's mystery-man may be gay, even if he is
unjustly suspected of abuse - the movie swills around in a soft stew of
buddyism and surrogate-parent sentimentality, varied by the odd morsel of
red-herring Gothicism.
How we distrust those we do not know. This is the theme for the week's
live-action movies. The Stranger is Satyajit Ray's last film: sedentary,
even sciatic in its staging, but grace-touched in its mastery of faces and
feelings. Is the long-lost uncle (Utpal Dutt) who hoves in view to reclaim a
long-waiting bequest an impostor or not? And how can Mr and Mrs Middle-Class
Calcutta Couple, the supposed relatives with whom he stays, find out without
being rude?
Like all Ray's late films, this one features characters stuck as if by
superglue to the ancestral armchairs. Occasionally, stiffly, they rise to
walk about the room. And always they talk. But do not expect songs,
knees-ups or Aladdin-ish pacing. What you get is a subtler dance of
bewilderment: a soft-shoe shuffle of the soul, a grand old
image-choreographer laying out steps to prove that in this world Nobody
Really Knows Anybody.
Can you even know that your newly-wedded bride is not a serial killer? Mike
Myers, aka Wayne of Wayne's World, has this problem in So I Married An Axe
Murderer. High-street butcher Nancy Travis seems so pretty, so nice . . .
Yet her CV does seem to correspond with that of the multiple murderer
headlined on the front page of the tabloid rag Myers glimpses in his
scandal-hungry parents' kitchen.
This is Hitchcock's Suspicion with swapped sexes and often very funny, not
least when it allows an irrelevant riff to get going. I loved Alan Arkin's
cameo as a kindly police chief begged by his officers to be louder and more
brutal. (They have seen too many TV cop shows.) As for Myers, his moon-faced
sincerity and permanent state of attentive wonder  - the candour of the
apprentice lunatic - suggests there is mileage in this actor's
mock-innocence even after he has finished with Wayne's Worlds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
. . .
Oh that Myers had wandered debunkingly, a Candide for our age, into the
cumbrous landscapes of Posse and The Stolen Children. The first is a black
Western spurred towards pretension by director-star Mario Van Peebles (of
New Jack City): much racial sermonising, much sculptural posturing in the
mise-en-scene. Gianni Amelio's The Stolen Children is a sentimental,
prize-laden Italian film about two siblings orphaned by the law. Carted off
towards a care home from delinquent Momma - she had put the 11-year-old girl
into prostitution - they pal up with their young escorting officer. Result:
tender, truant wanderings across Italy as humanity begins to glow through
the trio's sullen armour. The idea intrigues; the execution is a touch
maudlin and more than a touch longwinded.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: Fun with Faustus - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Because it is so seldom performed one forgets just how much of Christopher
Marlowe's Dr Faustus is made up of knock-about comedy rather than grand
verse. The appearance of Helen of Troy and Faustus's immortal lines in
response stick in the memory more than the seven deadly sins or the antics
of Faustus and the friars in the Vatican. Yet the production at Greenwich,
where Philip Franks moves from an acting to a directing role for the first
time, has a good shot at putting it all together.
Some details are perverse. The good and bad angels are a pretty scruffy pair
of women, made peripheral to the story. Lucifer makes his first appearance
in what look to be his underpants. The scene is set in a bed-sit, admittedly
a very large one, possibly close to the University of Newcastle.
One guesses the place because Jonathan Cullen's Faustus has a distinct
Geordie accent - or has it become the fashion after Alan Cumming's Scottish
Hamlet that heroes now come from the north? As a student he must be on a
grant since, for such a learned man, he has very few books around.
Presumably he borrows the key texts from the library.
It takes time to adjust to this cultural shift. Mephistopheles helps to put
it in place. Played by Hugh Ross, he is a very tall, suited figure in a long
overcoat. He might be the vice-chancellor, or a senior, defeatist civil
servant who has seen it all before; a very fine performance.
Some of the high jinks come off remarkably well, especially the seven deadly
sins. Pride appears through the mirror. Covetousness climbs cleverly out of
a suitcase lying on the floor. Gluttony falls out of the fridge. Sloth
crawls up through the sofa. Lechery looks all that her name implies, and
more: it is entirely fitting that the same actress, Allie Byrne, should also
play Helen.
The Vatican scenes, where an invisible Faustus plays havoc with priestly
rituals, come out on the right side of amusing. The horse coursing scene
just misses, and this is the trouble with playing Faustus in full. The more
low comedy there is, the more it distracts from the tragedy and poetry of
Faustus the man.
Playing the complete text means that Faustus only comes into his own towards
the end when he has a sudden rush of spectacular speeches disproportionate
to the rest of the piece. It is only shortly before he has but one bare hour
to live that Cullen's Faustus emerges as a tragic hero. He delivers the
wonderful final soliloquy with great passion and intelligence. One cannot
help wondering, however, why he has to live in quite such drab surroundings.
There is some very striking accompanying music to the play composed by
Jeremy Sams, yet again it has the effect of being slightly too elegant for
the set.

More than anybody else, David Attenborough makes television respectable.
However thick the anti-TV bile in cocktail party conversation, among people
who give themselves away by knowing the plot of 'Neighbours' too well,
everybody is happy to admit to watching David. He forms a link to the days
of Uncle Mac when the role of the broadcaster was to explain the
complexities of the world. Today, as we shall see in the opening episode of
Life In The Freezer (BBC1, 8.00), he combines that avuncular quality with
exploitation of the most modern technology. This six-part series on wildlife
of the Antarctic - penguins, whales, seals and so on - has necessitated all
sorts of new techniques simply to make filming possible at extremely low
temperatures.
That is followed by yet another new series, Goodnight Sweetheart (8.30),
written by Marks and Gran, creators of 'Shine On Harvey Moon'. This time,
instead of merely harking back to the 1940s the writers have enabled the
hero, TV repair man Gary Sparrow played by Nicholas Lyndhurst, to flit
between 1940s and 1990s via a time-warp pub.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: The Grub Street Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Fielding (1707-1754) managed more in one lifetime than most people
could in several. He was a playwright, a novelist and then, when his
libertine desires outstripped his failing capacities, a magistrate. He wrote
The Grub Street Opera in 1731, when it was banned by the Prime Minister. The
Magnificent Theatre Company presents it at the Lilian Baylis Theatre in what
it claims is the first staging. A fine, genial and good-humoured evening it
makes, too, all partridges and bumpers of ale.
Fielding comes over as a sharp lyricist and a facile plotter. In fact, the
plot is a cipher, and hardly matters. The opera has 60 airs, spontaneous
soundbites of song which punctuate the action. There are songs in praise of
roast beef and ale, preparation for the orgies of consumption in his novels;
and a deliciously rhymed paean to tobacco which leaves most current West End
lyricists out of puff.
Grub Street was an area of London near Moorfields full of 'scabrous hacks'
and hired scribblers. The Grub Street Opera teems with the extinct
worldliness of the 18th century. Alongside the usual imprecations - 'Lookye
. . . Egad . . . Pshaw' - Fielding trades in perfidy, reputation and rank.
All his characters are intelligent and capacious.
The production, directed by Ben Crocker, fizzes along, but fails to find
anything worth caring about, and has to jump-start itself after every song.
The travelling set is a simple, inventive raised platform strewn with
playbills and billets-doux. The acting, particularly from Richard Pocock as
the resident fop, is precise and deliciously overdone. The cook wears an
apron of quilted poultry and brandishes a rolling pin, the maids twitter,
the butler curses and the parson drinks: a perfect Georgian symmetry.
At the centre is Sir Owen Apshinken, a Welsh gentlemen slowly drinking
himself asunder to escape his shrewish wife. Their frisky son, Master Owen,
all flounce and flutter, chases the maids but runs out of ideas when the
chase is up. Below stairs, an entire petty larceny of servants cheat their
way through life.
Behind Grub Street lies Fielding's satire of the dim George II, the
pretentious Queen Caroline and their lecherous son Frederick Prince of
Wales. Since the satire has not been altered to suit the present times, the
strength and scandal of Fielding's original has been lost. But on this form,
and theirs, the royal family should be grateful Fielding stopped writing two
and a half centuries ago.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Technology: Russians show their mathematical might
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN CONSTANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virtual reality can be bad for you. It can disorientate the brain and make
it hard to readjust to the real world.
This is the view of Bill O'Riordan, a professor at Imperial College, London,
and head of advanced research at ICL, the UK computer group owned by Fujitsu
of Japan. He believes the creators of virtual reality have made a
fundamental error by failing to base their world on the laws of physics.
Yet he is confident a solution can be found - in Russia, where software
experts bring a mathematical scrutiny to bear on computing problems that
contrasts with the west's more pragmatic approach.
Central to O'Riordan's concern about VR's dangers is the belief that
inaccurate representations of the real thing can retune people's minds to a
false set of rules. Those who spend too long immersed in a computer
environment - especially with a headset - can emerge confused. They may not
realise it, but their brain may have been reprogrammed. What happens when
they are behind a car wheel? How do they know their reaction times have not
been subtly altered?
O'Riordan's conclusion is that the laws of physics and mathematics are being
simplified, even ignored. He has several criticisms: if VR objects move at
all, they follow pre-determined paths; their interaction with other objects
is often not taken into account; scaling is inaccurate; and the use of
shading often bears little relationship to the light source.
'The west is making a big mistake in failing to base much of its technology
on sound mathematical principles. VR is perhaps the most serious example.'
To help put this right, he has organised talks between ICL and top
scientists from the former Soviet bloc.
Because it was isolated by the iron curtain, Soviet computing followed a
different path of evolution - one firmly rooted in mathematics - from that
of the west. The result was highly developed skills in programming and
algorithms, the building blocks of computer language.
Western computer companies, by contrast, were able to throw money and
sophisticated hardware at problems, and became 'seduced by graphics' as they
strove to make more user-friendly products.
'The computer games boom is partly to blame,' says O'Riordan. 'We have been
bombarded by 'virtual worlds' created on the PC, although the complexity of
recreating reality is such that no PC can yet handle it.'
He finds proof of Russian expertise in the country's military and space
technology. He is not alone in his views. David Hughes, a professor at the
University of Plymouth who chairs the British Computer Society special
interest group on computer-aided design, has also worked with institutes in
Russia and Ukraine.
'Their work is mathematically -based, and despite very low levels of
technology, their programming skills are formidable. They have been able to
get far more out of low-power systems than we would have believed possible.'
The Russian mentality may be a result of 50 years of political repression,
says Doron Swade, senior computer curator at the Science Museum in London,
because anything which had a practical application was centrally controlled.
'The only way they could escape the controls was to embrace the abstract.'
The Science Museum put ICL in contact with the Institute of Informatics
Systems in Siberia, which led to the first talks last month. O'Riordan was
enthusiastic. 'The Russians know how to make a machine sing - their
programming doesn't waste a bit or a byte,' he says.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Technology: Advice on some burning issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When Mike Lyons speaks about the buildings he sets on fire, you could be
excused for thinking that he is a pyromaniac. Fortunately, the buildings and
the fire's victims only exist on a computer's virtual reality program.
Lyons is general manager of Colt Virtual Reality, set up by the UK
ventilation and environmental control group to provide advice for architects
and builders. Colt uses VR to study the movement of people in and around
buildings, ships and tunnels.
Lyons says there is a tendency to make simple assumptions about people's
behaviour.
'Suppose you have a store with 100 people in it, and exits at the front and
back. If there's a fire, it is traditionally assumed that 50 will go out
through the front and 50 through the back.'
A better understanding can be obtained by using a VR database to create
individuals based on the psychology and behaviour of real human beings.
These are then in the building when the blaze starts.
Allowance is made for the elderly moving more slowly, parents stopping to
collect their children and individuals whose curiosity or bravery sends them
against the flow to find the source of the blaze.
With random elements included, the sequence is run up to 100 times and the
evacuation time established. When changes are made to the building design,
the process can be repeated.
Such studies can show surprising results. In one minute, about 120 people
can push through a doorway of the standard 74cm width. But if that is
increased by 20cm, almost twice as many can leave in the same time.
London's planned Pounds 2bn Crossrail project will be designed with the help
of Colt VR, which has been brought in by British Rail and London Underground
to help with station design for normal use and emergency evacuation.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Technology: Artificial look into the real world - Virtual
reality is taking off in the games field, but its impact on industry has so
far been limited. That is now set to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
To most people, virtual reality means video games and entertainment arcades.
The idea of using the technique - in which three-dimensional surroundings
are created by computers for viewing on headsets or desk-top terminals - has
hardly penetrated beyond the leisure industry.
But manufacturers are turning increasingly to this artificial, 3-D world for
help with the design and development of new products. The virtual reality
research programmes run by universities and other research centres have
attracted a number of companies, including Caterpillar, the US manufacturer
of earthmoving equipment, and two UK groups, Rolls-Royce and VSEL (formerly
Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering).
The potential of VR for helping business and cutting costs was demonstrated
in the Netherlands earlier this year when the Calibre Institute at the
University of Eindhoven developed a system for construction companies. It
enabled prospective house buyers to 'walk through' new homes at a greenfield
site before they had even been built. An increase in sales was reported
while VR was in use there.
Caterpillar has based its research work at the National Centre for
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. Much of the work
is experimental, but the company is using stereo glasses and full-immersion
headsets to develop operator cabs for backhoe loaders and wheeled shovels.
'We use the system as a design tool to check operator visibility and
evaluate performance of design,' explains Richard Ingram, Caterpillar's
manager of university relations. He is guarded about the financial savings
that Caterpillar expects, but compares VR's possible impact with the way
spreadsheets and personal computers revolutionised the accountancy
profession.
'It can take from six months to a year to design and build a prototype
vehicle. With virtual reality, we can put a new design into the lab in a
week,' he says. Caterpillar invites digger operators to the centre's
laboratory where they sit in a conventional cab seat wearing a headset.
Immersed in a virtual world, they can glance outside the virtual cab and
watch the machine's bucket rise and fall as they control it with real
levers. Functions, however, are kept simple, dictated by the speed at which
computers can display the movements in real time. If the operator dislikes
one cab, an alternative design can be called up.
In the UK, a close-knit community of universities and small research
companies is now starting to attract support from industry. 'Virtual reality
is not yet a finished production tool. And even though basic systems cost
around Pounds 40,000, companies will initially prefer to work with centres
of excellence,' says Seamus Morley, sales manager of Division Group, a
leading UK-based supplier of VR systems for industrial applications.
Division has sold more than 50 fully immersive systems worldwide and a few
weeks ago shipped what it describes as the world's largest commercial VR
system to Matsushita Electric in Japan. Valued at some Dollars 500,000
(Pounds 331,000), the system will enable three people to share the same
virtual world.
Coventry School of Art and Design, part of Coventry University, purchased a
VR system in March. It is now collaborating with companies such as Ford,
Rover and Motor Panels, the truck cab specialist. 'We're using virtual
reality for design evaluation and interaction,' explains David Pryce-Evans,
project researcher. The aim is to enable vehicle designers to see and
interact with a full-sized car without going to the expense of building one.
The next step is to expand the breadth of interaction, says Pryce-Evans, and
move into consumer products such as kettles and cameras. Rolls-Royce and
VSEL are among a number of companies which have joined a research programme
run by Advanced Robotics Research, a company based at Salford University.
Rolls-Royce, which joined the programme in July, wants to convert
computer-aided design models of its Trent high-thrust aero-engine into
real-time VR images. 'The aim is to put engineers next to a virtual rather
than real model of the engine,' explains Robert Stone, technical manager of
Advanced Robotics.
Rolls-Royce says it has been interested in VR for a year and believes there
will be a 'clear financial pay-off' if the system proves to be a practical
tool. VSEL has been using advanced three-dimensional Cad modelling with
full-sized and one-fifth scale models of submarines for eight years. Now, it
wants to eliminate the real models and allow engineers to 'enter' virtual
submarines for design verification.
Despite an impressive membership list which also includes ICI and British
Nuclear Fuels, Stone says he is concerned at the 'apathy' shown by much of
industry. 'The UK is leading the way in VR research, but people still see it
as a computer game; there's too much hype from the leisure industry,' he
says.
He admits that introducing VR to manufacturing industries will not be easy.
The technology is still relatively expensive and the clarity of images
comparatively poor.
A new convert to virtual reality is the supermarket sector. Britain's
Co-operative Wholesale Society recently joined the programme run by Advanced
Robotics. Its corporate technology department is keen to have a virtual
supermarket so it can study customer flows and space planning. Presumably,
though, it will stop short of virtual customers and virtual profits.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Accountancy Column: Putting finance directors in a larger
frame - Why a traditional accountancy background may no longer be enough for
a complex job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW PRESSURES are transforming the finance directors of British companies
from aloof and authoritarian figures into executives with different
abilities and approaches - and, in the process, raising questions about the
traditional dominance of the job by accountants.
One set of pressures is the shifting balance from finance director as
controller to businessman, from score-keeper to commercial operator. Where
once there was a specialist fiefdom, there are signs that barriers between
finance and other parts of the business are breaking down. The finance
director is becoming a team player, more a general manager than a technical
expert.
On the other hand, recent changes in accounting standards and in corporate
governance - partly linked to the Cadbury Report - are re-emphasising the
finance director's status as watchdog and corporate policeman. Non-executive
directors, newly conscious of their monitoring duties and more visible to
the outside world, look to the finance director for technical guidance.
At the same time, some of the activities for which he or she is responsible,
such as treasury and foreign exchange, have become much more complicated.
The finance director has to have a firm grasp of the sophisticated
techniques of risk management.
Another source of pressure, especially for large companies, is the growing
emphasis on external communications. While the importance of investor
relations is not new, large institutions are probing more deeply into the
companies in which they hold substantial stakes. The finance director is
closely involved in maintaining these relationships.
The increasingly demanding nature of the job is one of the themes which
emerges from a survey of finance directors carried out by Professor Peter
Abell, Mike Cranna and myself at the London School of Economics, and
sponsored by the Financial Executives Group of the Board for Chartered
Accountants in Business*.
There is no disagreement about the weight of the job in corporate
decision-making. In most companies, the finance director has a closer
relationship with the chief executive than any other board member. For
investors in a company, the appointment of a new finance director is an
important event. For the chief executive, it is vital that the
qualifications of the new incumbent should fit the job that needs to be
done.
The requirements of the job vary according to the nature of the business.
The finance director generally has a larger influence in diversified groups,
where he or she provides a counter-weight to the heads of the operating
companies, than in single-industry businesses where technical and marketing
factors are central. There is a difference between the skills needed in a
company in the throes of restructuring and those in a more stable
environment.
Nevertheless, the survey highlights a move away from a dominant concern with
financial reporting and control towards broader business responsibilities.
As one respondent put it, the finance director 'has to understand the
company's strengths and weaknesses and shift from reporting history to
driving the need for change throughout the organisation'.
There is stress on the effectiveness of operations in all aspects, with
non-financial measures being given greater weight. The director of a
German-owned company said German finance directors tend to have a deep
understanding of the product and the customer, in contrast to the more
detached stance of their traditional British counterparts.
The need for an open, participative style was stressed. The finance director
has to 'de-mystify the numbers'. With the wider accessibility of management
information and the greater numeracy of departmental managers, the finance
director 'is no longer the sole keeper of knowledge' and 'will need the
skills of an orchestra conductor or theatre director more than those of a
regimental commander'.
The five most important skills mentioned for the future were: knowledge of
information technology, personnel management, strategic planning, marketing
and general management. Experience outside finance was considered important,
perhaps essential. 'Finance directors are sometimes too remote from the
sharp end; a spell in line management has a humbling effect and creates a
common bond with colleagues'.
A majority agreed that finance directors would become more entrepreneurial.
While there were some warning voices, the consensus was that the finance
director should not be a technical specialist standing apart from
operations, but 'a highly motivated team member dedicated to growing the
company'.
Given those changes, is accountancy training still the best starting point?
Most finance directors of large British companies are chartered accountants
by background, but there is concern about the inroads being made by masters
of business administration (MBAs) and by other accountancy qualifications.
A majority of the chartered accountant-trained finance directors thought
their training was appropriate (though critical of parts of it), but a
sizeable minority took a different view. This latter group emphasised the
irrelevance of much of their training for the world of business and
industry. 'Unless the training changes,' one respondent said, 'chief
executives will decide that the key aspects of the job are more closely
matched by other qualifications; finance directors will have accountants
working for them in the same way as tax or treasury specialists, but the
high ground will have been lost to MBAs.'
Not surprisingly, some of the MBAs in our survey felt that an accountancy
background was irrelevant for a finance director as long as there was a good
core of accounting expertise in the finance function. 'Accounting skills in
the traditional sense represent an increasingly small proportion of the
finance director's duties'.
On the other side of the fence were the hard-line accountants who saw no
merit in MBAs: 'The MBA doesn't provide enough training in monitoring and
control'.
If there was a common strand, it was the need to combine the best of both
worlds. 'The accountant's ability to spot inconsistencies in numbers is a
vital counterpoint to the MBA's strategic management thinking'; 'The best
route is accountancy plus an MBA, with broad management experience'.
Many finance directors who had trained as accountants insisted that their
time in the profession had given them a feel for figures, a professional
discipline and an objectivity which were immensely valuable.
The sense of many responses was captured by the comment that the 'finance
director will play a bigger role in managing change, especially by being
involved in the restructuring of businesses to make them more flexible and
more responsive to customers'. To make this contribution, the finance
director needed to have an entrepreneurial approach, but without losing the
financial control skills which remain at the heart of the job.
The accountancy profession can no longer take it for granted that this
watchdog/entrepreneur role is best performed by accountants. If the
profession is to maintain its dominance among senior finance directors, it
has to take note of the changing nature of the job and, like the finance
department itself, open itself out to different skills and disciplines.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A little luxury goes
a longer way - A demand for durable products has replaced the throwaway
ethos of the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sultan of Brunei recently spent an agreeable afternoon shopping at
Tiffany and treated himself to a Dollars 70,000 (Pounds 50,000) trinket.
The sultan must have been a welcome sight at the Manhattan store which, in
common with the rest of the luxury trade, has had a tough time recently. The
industry is still under pressure as illustrated by the recent takeovers of
Gucci, the Italian leather company, and Yves Saint-Laurent, the French
fashion house. But the situation is improving as the global economy edges
towards recovery. The surviving companies must adapt their marketing
strategies to meet the new demands of the luxury market after the recession.
During the 1980s, the dominant theme in the luxury business was expansion,
as new customers entered the traditional markets of Europe and North America
and Japan emerged as a dynamic new market for expensive western goods.
Whereas the industry's old customers had preferred to pay more for products
which were distinctive - either because they were made in limited editions
or designed to particular specifications - all that the nouveau consumers
wanted were instantly recognisable status symbols.
The most successful luxury products were the obvious ones: Chanel suits with
tell-tale double Cs on the gilded buttons and Louis Vuitton luggage
emblazoned with LV initials.
The recession has weeded out some of the nouveau consumers and reshaped
consumer taste after the ostentation of the 1980s. 'People show off less
than they used to,' says Francoise Jollant-Kneebone, design director of
Louis Vuitton, the French luggage house. 'They're still prepared to spend a
lot of money on an expensive product, but only if they're certain that it is
of really high quality and that it will last.'
The most successful companies of the early 1990s are those that have
recognised these changes. Hermes of France has prospered by sticking to its
specialist niche at the top of the market with its 135 scarves and 1,970
hand-made bags: as has Asprey, the British concern, that has turned its Bond
Street store into the gift shop for the world's super-rich.
'This business is all about scale,' says Peter Wallis, director of SRU, the
London-based management consultancy. 'It's perfectly possible for people to
operate successfully in luxury goods today, but they have to accept that
there are limitations to the size of the market.'
Hermes and Asprey have acknowledged the constraints. Hermes plans to
continue to expand the international network of shops that fuelled its
growth in the 1980s: but Jean-Louis Dumas, chairman, has said the pace of
openings will be slower in the 1990s.
Naim Attallah, group chief executive of Asprey, is adamant that he will not
expand the original Asprey company. 'It's a very special business,' he says.
'If we opened Aspreys all over the world, we'd risk ruining it.'
The luxury companies have had to adapt their product ranges to meet the new
demands of the 1990s. The backlash against the 'throwaway' ethos of the
1980s means people are buying fewer expensive items, but are prepared to pay
more for them if they are convinced they will last.
Jollant-Kneebone says fewer of Louis Vuitton's customers 'come back to buy a
new bag every six months', but there has been a sharp increase in sales of
customised luggage, which is often more expensive than standard lines.
In design terms this has triggered a shift towards classic styles which will
not date. The focus of fashion has swung from the glitz of Chanel to the
subtler looks of designers such as Jil Sander in Hamburg and Prada in Milan,
which have both expanded despite the recession.
The change in taste is already reflected in luxury advertising. The glossy
advertisements in Vogue and Vanity Fair now tend to dwell on exclusivity,
craftsmanship and the long history of their companies, rather than the
materialistic imagery of the 1980s.
Service is an increasingly important component of luxury marketing as
consumers demand more reassurance about the quality and durability of the
products they are buying. 'Our customers are more discerning,' says
Attallah. 'We must make sure our staff are properly informed about
everything in our range.'
Repairs and renovation are also expanding. Customers of Cutler &amp; Gross, the
London optician, can calm their ecological consciences by paying Pounds 35
to have their sunglasses reconditioned, rather than spending Pounds 70 on a
new pair.
The financial strains on the luxury business are now easing as the US and UK
come out of recession and the growth of the emerging Asian economies - South
Korea, Taiwan and, most recently, China - compensates for the weakness of
Japan. But no one expects the industry to return to the heady growth of the
1980s and the themes of exclusivity, high quality and sophisticated service
are likely to dominate luxury marketing into the 1990s.
'A lot of people in the 1980s thought that this business was all about
marketing in the conventional fast-moving -consumer-goods sense,' says
Wallis of SRU. 'It might have been at the time but it certainly isn't now.
It's about developing a brand with a clearly-defined market position.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Dangerous liaisons -
Celebrities can bring instant fame to a brand, but they can also fall from
grace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago Roger Enrico, then president and chief executive of
Pepsi-Cola, was talking excitedly to the company's chairman, Don Kendall.
'There's this young fellow Michael Jackson. He's a singer and he's very,
very hot. And we think we can get him - and his brothers - to be in our
advertising.
'I've had them checked out. The reports came back sterling. These people
haven't been near alcohol, much less drugs. They're very religious. Very
family-oriented. They're not political. I see very little chance of
embarrassment for us here.'
If Enrico were this week to re-read his words, contained in his 1986 account
of the war with rival Coca-Cola, he would surely blush. Over the past few
days Pepsi has pulled its multi-million dollar sponsorship of the star's
'Dangerous' concerts as Jackson has abandoned his world tour because of
addiction to pain-killers and stress caused by allegations, strongly denied,
that he sexually molested a 14-year-old boy.
It is not the first time a celebrity has turned into a marketing nightmare:
Pepsi has already abandoned commercials in the US featuring pop star Madonna
after a furore over a video; the actor Burt Reynolds' divorce petition
became an embarrassment to advertisers; and sportsgear endorsements halted
abruptly for 'Magic' Johnson, the basketball player, when he announced he
was HIV positive.
But far from becoming fed up with the extraordinary fees that stars demand
for their endorsement of products - and the danger that if a celebrity goes
off the rails the brand may go with them - the trend, if anything, is
towards the increased use of big names.
Kenneth Miles, director general of the Incorporated Society of British
Advertisers, sees the use of celebrities as an extra weapon on a battlefield
where differences between brands are not always apparent. The value of using
stars has been proven, he claims, particularly when it comes to getting
through to young people. Instead of personalities being employed solely in
advertisements, they are increasingly being integrated into all aspects of a
marketing campaign.
Chris Powell, president of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and
chief executive of agency BMP DDB Needham, says using a celebrity can have
the benefit of giving instant fame to a product but 'the ever-present danger
is that it can blow up on you'.
As Mike Walsh, Ogilvy and Mather's London chairman puts it, one of
advertisers' greatest fears is that 'the celebrity becomes the hero, rather
than the product they're marketing'. An example repeatedly mentioned in the
industry is the series of advertisements for Cinzano, featuring actors Joan
Collins and Leonard Rossiter. Some people believe the characters so dwarfed
the product that consumers may have had trouble recalling the brand.
If the identification of a star with a product is very strong it can also
make brand development difficult, says Tom Brannan, a vice-chairman of the
Chartered Institute of Marketing and a director of agency Primary Contact.
The weening process may need careful thought: for example, when Sony needed
to move away from using John Cleese in its ads, it used the 'ingenious'
interim device of a robot-style figure which resembled the actor, says
Brannan.
Personalities, meanwhile, cannot be guaranteed to be the best ambassadors
for the products they are paid to promote - contracts therefore need to
specify the standards expected, says Powell. The magazine Marketing cites
examples of the 'kind of situations that make ad agencies weep': model Jerry
Hall saying she used Bovril to clean her boots; Paul Gascoigne, the British
footballer and then Brut man, denying he wore aftershave, and English
cricketer Ian Botham calling Dansk low-alcohol lager 'gnat's piss'.
Clean, but not so squeaky clean to be boring, seems to be the maxim for
selecting a celebrity. That most desired attribute of all when marketing to
the young - street credibility - was gained by the former sick-bed drink
Lucozade when it started using the Olympic athlete Daley Thompson to promote
the brand. Thompson's irreverent streak definitely helped, says Walsh, whose
agency created the ads.
However, sporting personalities bring their own problems. Says Miles: 'They
do have a high wear-out rate,' although, carefully chosen, their promotional
value can outlast their ability to win medals. Michael Jordan, the
basketball player, earned about Dollars 32m (Pounds 23m) last year,
according to Forbes magazine, from promoting a range of products including
Nike shoes. He will continue his activities in retirement, even if the ads
are modified to take account of his less-active status.
One tip from Dominic Mills, editor of the UK advertising weekly Campaign, is
to spot a celebrity early: 'If you get them before they're really famous you
can ride on their back.' It is also possible, presumably, to benefit from
less-inflated fees. Actor Paul Hogan's link-up with Foster's is a good
example, says Mills. Hogan only moved from cult to mass-market status with
Crocodile Dundee, which came after the first Foster's ads.
In selecting a celebrity, says Brannan, it is also very important for
companies to analyse which values they are trying to build into their brand.
For example, Sir Robert Mark, the former UK Metropolitan Police
commissioner, is a good choice to promote the trustworthiness of Goodyear
tyres. Beware, says Powell, loose connections between celebrities and brands
 -'borrowed interest', as he calls it.
That close fit is exactly what Pepsi had for a number of years with Jackson.
Jay Coleman, an arranger of deals between rock stars and corporations,
brought the idea of Jackson to Pepsi. As reported in Enrico's book, Coleman
says as part of his sales pitch: 'Cars, liquor - for a dreamy, clean-living
kid like Michael, these make no sense. He needs a product that's soft,
cuddly, harmless and fun. And that's soda.'
And that, even if every letter of advice from the experts is followed, is
celebrities - potentially high rewards, with the inevitable high risks to
match.

FT  18 NOV 93 / People: End of an era for insolvency name
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Cork is severing the last remaining family links between the famous
insolvency firm Cork Gully and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, with which it merged in
1980.
Cork, below, who is the son of insolvency doyen Sir Kenneth Cork and
grandson of W H Cork, founder of Cork Gully, is leaving his position as a
senior partner with Coopers to join Moore Stephens.
In a statement recently circulated to Coopers' partners, his departure is
explained as the result of 'differences of opinion' with the firm over the
future of Cork Gully.
Coopers has been gradually playing down the status of Cork Gully. In the
last few months it has been dropping the firm's name from many of its
activities.
Cork Gully is now used primarily in liquidations. In other insolvency work,
Coopers believes the name has a destructive connotation, when much of its
work is connected to companies which can be salvaged.
Cork, who has worked at Cork Gully for 24 years, will join Moore Stephens in
January to lead its small corporate recovery practice. He trained with the
firm in 1965-69. His grandfather and the founder of Moore Stephens were
friends and simultaneously founded their respective firms.
'Although Moore Stephens is an international firm of some standing, it has a
very small insolvency division,' he said. 'I am very sad to be going but I
was at loggerheads with the management.'
Four generations of the Cork family have been involved in insolvency work.
One of Roger Cork's cousins is a partner with Booth White, whose son has in
turn just qualified as an insolvency practitioner.
Moore Stephens is the UK's 14th largest firm with total fee income of Pounds
42m. Coopers is the largest firm in the country, with fee income last year
of Pounds 553m and insolvency income alone of Pounds 73m.

FT  18 NOV 93 / People: Work for economist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite his periods at Essex University and the London School of Economics
in the late 1960's, James Robertson's career has taken a most
unrevolutionary path as a civil service economist.
This is just as well because on Monday he will take over as the new chief
economist at the Employment Department. Robertson replaces Pam Meadows, who
has left to become director of the Policy Studies Institute.
Robertson, 44, joined the civil service as an Employment Department
economist in 1975.
He has since worked in the Department of Energy; headed the Regional
Economics Branch in the DTI; and after a brief spell in the Department of
Transport he rejoined the DTI as head of Industrial and Regional Economics
and Statistics.
His promotion to under secretary, with a staff of 100, will not come as a
surprise to people who have worked with him. 'He has always seemed a young
man in a hurry', says a colleague.
And there may be some political logic to his move, in the light of
continuing discussion of a merger between the DTI and the Employment
Department.
'I welcome the opportunity to draw closer links between the two departments.
You cannot look at labour markets in isolation from product markets,' says
Robertson.

Willis Corroon group, one of the world's foremost insurance brokers, has
appointed William Schreyer to its board as a non-executive director, with
immediate effect, and simultaneously see the retirement of another
non-executive, Arthur Vorys, who has been on the board since 1990.
Schreyer, right, 65, retired earlier this year as chairman and chief
executive of Merrill Lynch, where he had been since 1948. His first post
with Merrill was as a management trainee, but over the decades he held many
posts with the company, reaching the peaks of first president and chief
executive in 1984 and then chairman in 1985.
Besides his new non-executive role with Willis Corroon, Schreyer is a
director of Schering-Plough and is vice chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange. Moreover, he acts as a special financial adviser to the Vatican in
Rome, a Papal appointment.
He takes an active interest in international relations, being affiliated to
the Centre for Strategic and International Studies and the Council on
Foreign Relations, as well as academic life, through his position on the

When Michael Bett announced earlier in the year that he would fulfil his
role as deputy chairman of BT in a non-executive capacity, he said that he
wished to spend more time on community and social interests.
His new appointment as chairman of the government's Social Security Advisory
Committee from January 1 will fill around one day a week in his diary.
The committee advises the secretary of state on social security matters
other than industrial injuries, war pensions and occupational pensions.
Most social security regulations must be submitted to the committee before
they are made.
Bett, who is also chairman of Cellnet, was previously managing director of
BT and personnel director of the BBC.
In January, Bett, 58, was pipped at the post for the chairmanship of Acas,
the government conciliation service.
He will be well-placed to pick up signals from social security claimants
when things go wrong with benefits: since 1985 he has been Chairman of
Bromley Citizen's Advice Bureaux.
He recently became chairman of Save the Children Fund and president of the
Institute of Personnel Management.
Bett replaces Sir Peter Barclay who is retiring after nine years as
chairman.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Pay rises at 15-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE no signs of an upturn in the rate of wage increases and
productivity is continuing to improve, according to the Confederation of
British Industry's pay databank series for the third quarter of the year,
published yesterday.
Increases in pay for the January-September period were on average 2.3 per
cent, the lowest level recorded by the CBI since it started collecting pay
data in 1977.
Pay deals in manufacturing averaged 2.3 per cent, down from 3.9 per cent for
the same period last year. There was a rise of 2.6 per cent in the private
services sector, compared with 4.3 per cent.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said yesterday: 'These figures
are generally encouraging, showing that the need for tighter control of pay
remains well understood by employers and their workforces.'
The CBI added that the databank findings meant 'continued good news for
British competitiveness' with reported provisional productivity gains in
manufacturing running at 3.9 per cent, well ahead of wage settlements.
The overall third quarter CBI pay figures compare with a 3.9 per cent
provisional figure for the same period last year and 2.3 per cent for the
second quarter of this year.
The CBI said that one in five pay deals in the manufacturing and services
sectors involved wage freezes.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Bank 'should be free' on policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England should be free to set monetary policy independent of the
Treasury, with the sole objective of pursuing price stability, while coming
under much greater parliamentary scrutiny, a high-level independent panel
says today.
In a report published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a
London-based think tank, the panel chooses a middle way between the German
Bundesbank model and that of the New Zealand Reserve Bank for a more
independent UK central bank.
It builds on the increased responsibility given to the Bank for achieving
price stability since sterling's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992.
Noting that the new system 'has so far had an easy ride', the report's
authors, chaired by Lord Roll of Ipsden, the president of S G Warburg Group,
say that now is the best time to equip Britain with a stronger monetary
anchor before inflation reappears. The best available anchor is a more
independent Bank of England.
The 12-man panel consists of academics, City luminaries, former central
bankers and erstwhile finance ministry officials from Britain and abroad,
including an expert in constitutional law and a former Bundesbank director.
The panel has attempted to take account of the UK's history of high
inflation in recent decades and its powerful parliamentary institutions. It
has therefore rejected the German approach to central bank independence,
which relies on the Bundesbank's strong counter-inflation reputation that
gives it a free hand in implementing policy, and the New Zealand system of a
legal framework of contracts to govern the setting of targets and conduct of
policy. Instead, the panel emphasises transparency, monitoring and
accountability.
The panel proposes that:
Price stability should be the Bank's sole statutory objective and the Bank,
not the Treasury, should formulate and announce a medium-term target for
inflation.
The Bank should have full control of short-term interest rates. The Bank's
conduct of monetary policy should be subject to routine parliamentary
review, primarily through the Commons Treasury and civil service committee.
The Bank should also submit its inflation target to parliament via the
chancellor, who would be expected to comment on the Bank's actions. The Bank
would be expected to explain how far its monetary policy options were
constrained by government fiscal policies.
The Bank should have no powers to lend money to the government.
Sterling's exchange rate should be primarily left to the foreign-exchange
markets.
In a crisis the government must have the power to overrule the Bank and take
over economic policy, including monetary policy, for a limited period of
time. But such a temporary suspension of the Bank's objectives would require
parliamentary approval. The report explicitly rules out small overrides of
targets, which it says would be a recipe for 'target drift'.
The Treasury said yesterday that the report was an interesting contribution
to what would be a lengthy debate on the future of the Bank and that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would not pass judgment before the debate
was concluded.
Although Mr Clarke has given the Bank more freedom to attack inflation, he
made it clear at the Confederation of British Industry's conference in
Harrogate this week that he was not convinced that it should be independent.
Officials at the Bank pointed out that its priority was to achieve price
stability, and independence would only be possible if the British people and
parliament wanted it.
The next stage in talks about the Bank will come with the publication of the
Commons committee's report.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Retail price cuts push RPI down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS' attempts to woo consumers by holding down prices pulled the
annual rate of inflation back down to 1.4 per cent last month, compared with
1.8 per cent in September.
Competition was fiercest among supermarkets, clothes shops and
household-goods retailers. Their efforts to undercut each other led to a 0.1
per cent fall in retail prices on the month, the first October fall since
1962.
A steep fall in seasonal food price inflation, from 4.1 per cent
year-on-year in September to - 0.3 per cent last month, shaved 0.1
percentage points off the retail prices index. The fall mainly reflected
special offers on fruit, potatoes and home-killed lamb.
The monthly reduction in non-seasonal food prices was the sharpest for 21
years with inflation in this category falling from 3 per cent in the 12
months to September to 2.4 per cent last month. Cheaper beef, poultry, milk
and processed vegetables were behind the fall.
Statisticians said that the reductions in food prices were fairly evenly
spread across stores and that since the October figures were collected many
supermarkets had introduced further price reductions.
Petrol prices also fell slightly in October, having risen sharply in the
previous October, a move which cut a further 0.1 percentage points off the
headline inflation rate.
The slowdown in price rises was not confined to the traded-goods sector.
Motoring expenditure inflation fell from 6.1 per cent in September to 4.9
per cent in October, reflecting the lower petrol prices and reductions in
second-hand car prices, which outweighed rises in motor insurance premiums.
Fares and other travel costs rose by 4.7 per cent in the year to October, an
improvement on September's 5.1 per cent. Household services inflation over
the same period was 3.6 per cent compared with 3.7 per cent in September.
But the big reductions occurred among retailers. Clothes shops in particular
attempted to avoid price rises even though the season's new fashions entered
the shops last month. Consequently price increases in this sector were the
smallest for any October since 1984 and the inflation rate for clothing and
footwear fell to 0.8 per cent compared with 1.8 per cent in September.
The 0.3 per cent month-on-month fall in household goods prices was the
biggest for any October since records started in 1956.
The Central Statistical Office said special offers and sales in furniture
continued throughout October while prices for electrical goods changed
little at a time when there are usually increases.
The UK inflation rate is now one of the lowest in the European Union and
well below the G7 average of 2.6 per cent.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Labour urges reforms to corporate tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday demanded urgent reform of corporate taxation and an
immediate cut in interest rates to rescue Britain from an economic crisis
caused by declining investment.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said continued low inflation and
faltering retail sales left Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, 'no economic
reason not to cut' rates.
Setting out Labour's pre-Budget document, Mr Brown said it was 'totally
wrong' for the chancellor to postpone a cut in rates until after the Budget.
He also urged the government to extend capital allowances for investment,
offer grants to help small businesses boost investment and develop new
technology, and set up a task force to accelerate private involvement in
infrastructure projects.
The document - Rebuilding Britain - sets out a 10-point plan to create jobs,
including the phased release of local authority capital receipts for
homebuilding and a one-year holiday from national insurance contributions
for employers recruiting the long-term unemployed.
Mr Brown said the government faced a choice between allowing the Budget to
continue the 'short-term stop-go economics of drift' and implementing
radical measures to boost investment.
Mr Andrew Smith, a shadow treasury minister, said there was a growing
consensus that tax on investment spending was not fair at the moment. He
said the government's refusal to allow tax relief for investment financed
from retained earnings had an impact on investment proposals equivalent to
up to 2 percentage points on interest rates.
Mr Smith called for the government to start urgent consultations on the tax
treatment of investment to establish a consensus on reform. Labour would
undertake a consultative review involving industry, commerce and
professional organisations to draw up options for government action.
He added: 'If a significant increase in productive and profitable business
investment could be secured by reform, as studies have suggested, every
effort must be made to bring it about . . . It is important that as wide as
possible a consensus is established on the best way ahead.'
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said government
attempts to involve private capital in infrastructure projects had been a
spectacular failure. She said 'a real sense of urgency' was required to
identify projects which were in the national interest.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Cambridgeshire County Council votes to ban cycles from two
pedestrian streets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cambridgeshire County Council has voted to ban cyclists from two central
pedestrian streets in Cambridge.
Cycle City, as it is known to CB enthusiasts, will no longer welcome
bicycles between 10am and 4pm, on Sydney Street, a shopping thoroughfare,
and Market Street (above). A survey showed that while 2,800 pedestrians used
Sydney Street per hour, so did 430 cyclists.
The ban, designed to improve safety and enhance the environment for
shoppers, has split public opinion, both between town and gown and between
the main parties.
The Labour-controlled city council is against the ban, while the Labour
group on county council supported the Tories, who introduced an experimental
ban in the summer of 1991.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Six tender for Pounds 300m London-Heathrow link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH, German, French and Japanese companies are among six bidders for the
main tunnelling contracts for the Pounds 300m Paddington to Heathrow rail
link.
The privately financed scheme is to be built by a joint venture between BAA,
which runs Heathrow airport, and British Rail. Japan's Export Import Bank
recently agreed a loan facility of up to Pounds 135m to help finance the
project.
The tunnelling works will be the main cost. Taylor Woodrow, the UK
contractor, has been appointed overall construction manager for the 25km
line.
The tender list for the tunnelling works comprises Balfour Beatty from the
UK and five joint ventures involving UK and overseas companies:
Amec, with Hochtief (Germany);
Sir Robert McAlpine, Taylor Woodrow, Wayss &amp; Freytag (Germany) and Bachy
(France);
Miller, Tarmac, Kumagai Gumi (Japan) and BEMO-NATM (Austria);
Kier, Murphy and Kunz (Germany);
Nuttall, Trafalgar House and Zublin (Germany).
The works involve constructing escalator and lift shafts as well as driving
two 2.95km tunnels from north of the M4 to underground stations connecting
to terminals 1, 2, and 3 at Heathrow. A further 3.2km single track tunnel
will connect with Terminal 4.
Tunnelling for railway stations is highly specialised and only a small
number of British and international companies have the necessary expertise.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Gummer plans bonds guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to issue guidelines to ministerial departments which
demand performance bonds from construction companies which are awarded work,
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said yesterday.
Contractors have become concerned at the use of 'on-demand' bonds which
allow customers to withhold payments without having to prove first that
contractors are in default.
Mr Gummer said: 'There appear to be circumstances where departments consider
it reasonable to seek bonds linked to specific conditions. We need to be
sure, however, that where they are used the practice across government
reflects best procurement policy.
'The guidelines will take as their starting point the unacceptability of
on-demand bonds encashable without regard to performance. Such bonds are
unfair. They can restrict industry's funds and undermine the recovery.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Scrutiny of professions urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S professions should be scrutinised for restrictive practices by the
Office of Fair Trading, according to Mr Graham Mather, president of the
European Policy Forum, the cross-party think-tank.
Mr Mather yesterday told the Royal Institute of British Architects that
professions such as medicine and law had escaped the reforming zeal of
Thatcherism. They lagged behind other businesses, the utilities and
public-sector organisations in the quality of service they gave to their
customers, he said.

FT  18 NOV 93 / National print deals to resume
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL PAY bargaining is to resume in the printing industry in 1994 after
a year's suspension, it was announced yesterday by the printing employers'
federation and the GPMU print union.
The decision follows intensive negotiations between the two sides and
widespread consultation among printing companies. It represents a climbdown
by the employers federation, which made clear earlier this year that it
wanted to scrap the national wage agreement in favour of company deals. But
the federation found its affiliate members were almost evenly divided in
their views on whether to return to national pay bargaining. While larger
printing companies saw the value of dealing with pay themselves, medium and
smaller-sized companies preferred the stability ensured by a centralised
agreement.

FT  18 NOV 93 / House sales slow ahead of Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL house purchasers are delaying purchases ahead of this month's
Budget, causing a slowdown in activity in the housing market, says a survey
of more than 100 estate agents in England and Wales published today, Andrew
Taylor writes.
The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says there is a
shortage of properties being put up for sale. But buyers are snapping up
homes when they are keenly priced. Almost 90 per cent of agents questioned
last month said prices had remained unchanged over the previous three
months. Only 3.7 per cent reported price rises while 8.7 per cent said
prices were still falling.
The institution said the Budget was casting a shadow over the market with
buyers and sellers concerned that Mr Kenneth Clarke's measures might
undermine confidence.
Estate agents and housebuilders are concerned that Mr Clarke should not
announce further reductions in mortgage tax relief. The rate of relief is
due to fall from 25 per cent to 20 per cent next April.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Boundary change threat to Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSED boundary changes in Scottish constituencies could result in Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, having to contest a marginal seat at the next
general election.
Under proposals announced yesterday by Scotland's Boundary Commission Mr
Smith's Monklands East constituency near Glasgow would be reshaped and
become vulnerable to the Scottish National Party.
A new seat of Cumbernauld and Airdrie would take in areas of Cumbernauld,
where the SNP is strong.
At last year's general election Mr Smith had a majority of 15,712.
The SNP calculated yesterday that ward-by-ward voting in last year's
district council elections in the proposed Cumbernauld and Airdrie
constituency gave the SNP 47.1 per cent of the vote against Labour's 45.2
per cent.
Mr Jack McConnell, secretary of the Labour party in Scotland, said that on
voting records going back for several years he was confident that Labour
would win the seat comfortably 'especially with the leader of the party
standing'.
But Mr McConnell added that the proposed new boundaries for the area would
be challenged, resulting in a public inquiry, because they cut across
identifiable communities. The boundary commission might then have to come
forward with new proposals.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Shake-up of professions urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S professions should be scrutinised for restrictive practices by the
Office of Fair Trading, according to Mr Graham Mather, president of the
European Policy Forum, the cross-party think-tank.
Mr Mather yesterday told the Royal Institute of British Architects that
professions such as doctors and lawyers had escaped the reforming zeal of
Thatcherism. They lagged behind other businesses, the utilities and
public-sector organisations in the quality of service they gave to their
customers, he said.
'Many professions have failed to stamp out wildly misleading underestimates
of likely charges, dilatory approaches to work, and a detachment from their
customers' priorities, timetables and commercial constraints,' he added.
Their restrictive practices should be reviewed and dealt with, he said.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Contractors see shift in bids policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authority contractors believe that a letter written by Mr Tony Baldry,
the environment minister, to the Financial Times signals a change in the
government's guidance on the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees)
regulations.
Where Tupe applies a successful bidder for a local authority contract must
take over the workforce on existing terms and conditions, making it harder
for private sector companies to compete.
In his letter Mr Baldry said: 'It is not for local authorities to dictate in
advance whether Tupe applies when they put their services out to tender.
This will depend on the contractor's proposals.
If they (local authorities) prejudge the issue, and restrict the range of
proposals they are prepared to entertain, I will not hesitate to use the
powers available to me in law to take action against them.'
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, of Clause 26, the contractors' pressure group,
welcomed Mr Baldry's comments. He said they contradicted the government's
draft guidance to authorities issued at the end of September, which said
that in the event of disagreement between a contractor and an authority Tupe
would be held to apply if the local authority received legal advice to that
effect.
According to contractors this would allow authorities which chose their
legal advisers carefully to 'drive a coach and horses through compul-sory
competitive tendering'.
The environment department said that no decision had yet been made on the
draft guidance to authorities, and that Mr Baldry's comments referred only
to the advertisements which local authorities place seeking tenderers. At
this stage local authorities are not allowed to take a view on Tupe.
According to the department they are allowed to do so only after they have
seen the contractor's proposals.
Mr Baldry's letter also came under fire from local authorities.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, said his advice flew in the face 'both of the law
and of common sense'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Eggar backs market forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG restatement of the government's determination to allow market
forces to rule in the energy market was given yesterday by Mr Tim Eggar, the
energy minister.
He said the government wanted to ensure that people and businesses got the
energy they wanted at competitive prices. 'This is achieved most efficiently
and effectively through competitive markets, which expose real costs and
lead to keenest pricing.'
He speech comes when the government is addressing issues such as the
monopoly in the gas market and the future of nuclear power. The only hint Mr
Eggar gave of these issues was when he referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission's recent recommendation to break up British Gas.
He made no reference to the state-owned nuclear power industry whose future
will soon be decided in a government review.
Mr Eggar's speech coincided with a plea from Mr James Hann, the chairman of
Scottish Nuclear, that the government cast the review in wide terms.
'As far as we can judge the key question, if not the only question in
ministers' minds for the forthcoming nuclear review, is whether and on what
basis our industry might be privatisable,' he told a Financial Times
conference on world electricity in London yesterday. He added: 'I regard
this attitude with concern.'

Mr John Slough, managing director of JSL (Hereford) is seeking Pounds

FT  18 NOV 93 / Mount Banking owners appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OWNERS of Mount Banking, the Asian-controlled bank in administration,
have appealed in the High Court against a ruling that vindicated the Bank of
England's regulatory action against them, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah and Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah are appealing
the verdict of the Banking Appeal Tribunal on a point of law that the facts
on which its decision was made did not justify its conclusions.
Mount Banking was placed in administration last year after a petition for
provisional liquidation to a High Court judge by the Bank which said that
the Shahs were not 'fit and proper' to be hold their positions as directors.
The Bank acted on suspicions of money-laundering of the proceeds of a fraud,
and other matters against Standard Chartered and the Indian Stock Exchange.
The tribunal found that the Bank had not found the evidence to back up many
concerns, but that it was justified to act based on these suspicions. The
Shahs maintain their innocence.

FT  18 NOV 93 / 'Sophisticated' Pounds 100m fraud deceived banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of Wallace Smith Trust Company, the collapsed London merchant
bank, swindled about Pounds 100m from other banks in a sophisticated fraud
which deceived both the Bank of England and Deloitte Haskin &amp; Sells, the
bank's auditors, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.
Mr Wallace Duncan Smith used and re-used certificates of deposit to obtain
loans for several million pounds from different banks, said Mr Timothy
Barnes QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office.
Mr Smith also defrauded the Discount Bank and Trust Company of Dollars 37m
(Pounds 25m) by entering into 'repo' transactions with the bank using
non-existent Canadian bonds.
The bank lost all the money when Wallace Smith Trust collapsed in 1991 owing
Pounds 100m, Mr Barnes said.
Mr Smith denies two charges of obtaining the Dollars 37m by deception, three
charges of the theft of certificates of deposit worth Pounds 4m, two charges
of false accounting and one charge of fraudulent trading with intent to
defraud creditors.
By 1990 the merchant bank had started to run into financial problems, Mr
Barnes said. To keep trading, Mr Smith, who was also joint managing
director, raised funds by illegally using the same certificates of deposit
as security for further loans from institutions including Life Assurance of
Scotland.
Much of the money was then routed into two shell companies in Canada
operated by Mr Smith. He claimed these companies had substantial assets in
the form of land, oil and gas interests, and a wide-ranging portfolio of
shares.
Both companies were complete shams, Mr Barnes said. They had no assets,
operated out of one-room offices and employed no staff. Nevertheless, the
Wallace Smith Trust charged substantial fees to the Canadian companies for
investment advice and other services.
'To both the Bank of England and Deloitte, it appeared that the bank was
properly managed by people of integrity, was trading profitably and had
substantial capital behind it,' Mr Barnes said.
By late 1990 senior staff within Wallace Smith Trust were challenging Mr
Smith about his methods. But in April 1991 he carried out the largest single
fraud, raising Dollars 37m from Discount Bank using the bogus Canadian
bonds.
In April 1991, however, the bank's senior staff, led by Mr Michael Hamilton,
its other joint managing director, challenged Mr Smith to prove the
existence of the bonds, Mr Barnes said. When he was unable to do so they
prompted Mr Smith to go to the Bank of England. Mr Smith was arrested and
the bank liquidated within two days.
The trial, expected to last several months, continues.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Insolvency work could go private, report tells DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL PARTS of the work carried out by the government's Insolvency
Service could be handed over to the private sector, according to a
consultant's report submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry.
The report, which was commissioned by the DTI in July from accountants Stoy
Hayward, suggests that up to Pounds 42m of the Pounds 50m in annual work
conducted by the Official Receivers' office could be privatised.
The findings may lead to an announcement in parliament in the next few weeks
by Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, on whether to proceed
with a second detailed study to consider the feasibility of privatisation.
The consultants conclude that the private sector could handle most of the
mechanical processing of bankruptcy and compulsory liquidations work,
leaving officials to concentrate on their investigative role.
But the report says that it is 'unclear' from the initial study whether
contracting out would yield significant savings or improved value for money.
The areas which would prove most difficult to privatise include public
examination and court appearances, creditor queries and sanctions for
liquidators and trustees.
It suggests that 'managed service providers' would be best placed to take
over the work on grounds of economy, efficiency, effectiveness and value for
money. These would include a mix of both local and regional contractors.
Of six different 'scenarios' it calls for most close examination of one
which would involve the private sector as soon as possible after a petition
was lodged. But it concedes this might give rise to conflicts of interest
and interference with the Official Receivers' investigations.
Two alternative scenarios it suggests are feasible would introduce the
private sector after interviews or meetings with those involved in
bankruptcies or insolvencies.
The report stresses that changes in the law would be required for
implementation of the proposed changes. It recommends a further feasibility
study and the launching of pilots of the different approaches.
Mr Keith Ellis, a spokesman for the trade unions at the Insolvency Service,
said: 'The services we have provided in the past, our professionalism and
experience will be destroyed by large-scale privatisation. We will be
approaching MPs to win support for our cause.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Income up at Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY higher turnover on the London Stock Exchange in the six months to
June 30 led to a 4 per cent rise in income to Pounds 98.1m from Pounds 94.5m
the year before.
After costs, which include a Pounds 10.3m charge related to development of
the system designed to replace the SEAQ price display system, the exchange's
operating surplus was Pounds 8.6m, compared with a Pounds 1.5m loss the year
before. The 1992 results included a Pounds 13.5m charge relating to the
development of the now-abandoned Taurus settlements system.
New equity issues raised Pounds 8.6bn in the period, more than double the
level of the first six months of 1992. Turnover in UK equities rose by 24
per cent to Pounds 268bn.
The exchange said that it expected its costs in the second half of the year
to match its income closely.
The exchange noted that its tax charge of Pounds 7m was disproportionately
high in relation to the pre-tax surplus. 'This arises because a significant
proportion of our expenditure is not allowed against current income for tax
purposes,' the exchange said.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Anti-tax lobby offers history lesson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD BULLOCK, the historian, yesterday offered a little historical
perspective to the debate over the possible imposition of value added tax on
books and publications.
Lord Bullock, who is chairman of The Hands Off Reading Campaign, appealed to
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to respect 132 years of 'educational and
political wisdom and keep reading free of tax'.
It was in 1861, Lord Bullock, told a press conference, that Mr Gladstone,
when chancellor, removed the UK's last tax on learning and literacy, the
stamp duty on newspapers.
Lord Bullock said that the argument against VAT on publications was
'primarily an argument about literacy'. Current levels of literacy in the UK
were little short of scandalous, with about 6.5m people over the age of 16
suffering serious reading difficulties, he said.
The government, Lord Bullock said, had made improving levels of literacy its
main target in education. It therefore made no sense to 'make it more
difficult to obtain books and other reading materials'.
Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, publishers of the
Daily Mail, highlighted a NOP survey suggesting that marketing's C2, D and E
social groups read nothing other than daily or Sunday newspapers. They were
the key targets for the government's illiteracy campaign.
He said that if VAT were introduced for newspapers it would be the first
time that there had been a simultaneous price rise and the effect on
circulations could be serious.
Mr Ian Locks of the Periodical Publishers Association warned that as many as
1,000 magazines could move to continental Europe to avoid VAT by posting
copies to subscribers.

FT  18 NOV 93 / OFT to rule on bus and rail clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAGECOACH Holdings, the only company to have run its own service on British
Rail, is to seek a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading on whether it may
run bus and rail services in the same area.
Mr Brian Cox, managing director of Stagecoach's rail division, said
yesterday that if the OFT did not give its approval some bus companies
considering bids for franchises to run trains on the privatised British Rail
network might withdraw.
He said: 'We don't want to put a lot of effort into bidding for a franchise
and then find it has been referred (to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission). We will take a test case to the OFT. If it doesn't come out in
favour, several people will have to think again.'
Stagecoach has expressed an interest in bidding for Scotrail and routes from
London Waterloo to the West Country. The company ran overnight carriages,
attached to a British Rail sleeper train, between London and Aberdeen for 18
months but pulled out after making losses.
Mr Cox told a conference on rail privatisation that providing other bus
operators were allowed to link their services to the rail network, there
should be no objection to a bus operator also running trains. Stagecoach
would object, however, to competing rail operators being granted 'open
access' to routes for which it had won a franchise.
He said that 'open access entrants simply cannot be allowed in at a marginal
cost' to help Railtrack, the track owner and manager, meet its targets.
'This would cream off the profitable routes and the whole edifice would
tumble.'
Mr Cox called for clear franchise specifications between the train operators
and Railtrack to keep interference from the franchising director and rail
regulator to a minimum.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Salmon farmers angered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH salmon farmers yesterday expressed dismay at the response of the
government to the crisis in the salmon industry, where a surge in production
of salmon by Norway has led to a 60 per cent fall in prices.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has written to the European Commission
urging 'appropriate measures' to deal with the problems of Scottish salmon
producers.
But he did not request 'safeguard action' under which the Commission would
be obliged to consider measures to restrict imports of Norwegian salmon,
such as setting a minimum import price or limiting volumes that can be
imported.
Mr Lang's more modest request for 'appropriate measures' is believed to be
the result of the Scottish Office and the Ministry of Agriculture being
overruled by Treasury ministers, who oppose trade protection measures.
The Scottish Office said yesterday that since the Irish Republic, another
salmon producer, had already requested safeguard action, a further request
was not needed.

THE two campaign groups opposed to deregulation of Sunday shopping in
England and Wales joined forces yesterday and said they would present a
single option to MPs, who will vote on the issue within the next few weeks.
The Keep Sunday Special Campaign, backed by the main churches and the John
Lewis retail group, and Retailers for Shops Act Reform, which is backed by
retailers including Marks and Spencer, House of Fraser, and Burton, support
strict regulation of Sunday opening, but had previously presented separate
options.
They differed over RSAR's proposal that all shops be allowed to open on the
four Sundays before Christmas, and KSSC's insistence that workers should
receive double time payments on Sunday.
Negotiations aimed at uniting the groups foundered last month, but the
groups announced yesterday they were combining their options after KSSC
dropped its opposition to pre-Christmas opening.
The decision removes the danger of the anti-deregulation vote being split.
The Home Office said it welcomed the decision and had agreed to reduce the
number of options in the forthcoming Sunday Trading Bill from four to three.
MPs will choose between:
Total deregulation.
Partial deregulation allowing small shops to open all day and large stores
to open for six hours.
Strict regulation, prohibiting large shops from opening except on the four
Sundays before Christmas, but allowing some small shops, garden centres and
DIY stores to open.
The first reading of the bill is expected within days.
The KSSC and RSAR said the move followed representations from cross-party
MPs, and the groups agreed a need for 'a unified front to protect the more
vulnerable elements of society and the long-term interests of the consumer'.
It is also thought to have been prompted by the decision of Usdaw, the
shopworkers' union, to switch its support from KSSC to the Shopping Hours
Reform Council, which is sponsoring the partial de-regulation option. The
union said its decision was conditional on adequate protection being
extended to Sunday workers, but it had recognised the support among its
members for Sunday working.
The SHRC, backed by retailers including J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Boots and
Kingfisher, said the KSSC and RSAR move was an 'admission of defeat'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Puzzle over two Nadir witnesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUESTIONS continue to surround the credibility of the two witnesses who
claim to have been behind allegations that Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive
businessman, attempted to bribe his trial judge.
A number of doubts remain as the attorney general yesterday rejected calls
for a public inquiry into the conduct of the police investigation into the
allegations. The calls were repeated yesterday by Mr Nadir, Mr Michael Mates
MP, and Mr Anthony Scrivener, Mr Nadir's barrister.
In a statement released on Tuesday the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed
that Mr Michael Francis and Ms Wendy Welsher had triggered the original
police investigation.
Mr Francis has a criminal record. Ms Welsher is known to have handled a
valuable painting claimed by Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy. Both are now
believed to be in northern Cyprus, where Mr Nadir fled after illegally
jumping bail in May.
Officials involved in the case yesterday questioned why the two witnesses
were now staying so close to Mr Nadir if they had - as they now claim -
fabricated the evidence to support suggestions that he had attempted to
bribe Mr Justice Tucker.
If the witnesses did make up the evidence - which they now allege was done
at the prompting of senior police officials - they could face severe
penalties for perverting the course of justice.
The police have rejected any suggestions that they were involved in such a
conspiracy. One possible motive for their alleged involvement would be that
the Serious Fraud Office believed Mr Justice Tucker was too sympathetic to
Mr Nadir.
It was Mr Nadir, however, who appealed to the divisional court to change the
judge in March this year in response to concerns that his trial may have
been prejudiced by the allegations.
The original allegations of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice
were first made in open court during a hearing on Mr Nadir's case in
November last year by Mr Robert Owen QC on behalf of the Serious Fraud
Office.
The investigation was taken up by the Metropolitan Police which, according
to the Crown Prosecution Service, delivered a report on November 5 this year
which contained no 'credible' evidence to support the allegations.
Documents circulated by Mr Nadir during the summer reproduce what is claimed
to be the only evidence of the conspiracy, a piece of paper signed by Safiye
Nadir, Mr Nadir's mother, and Bilge Nevzat, his sister, agreeing to
guarantee payment of Pounds 3.5m to Mr David Kent, a pseudonym for Mr
Francis.
This is supported by a letter saying the SFO was notified of the document on
October 1 1992, with allegations that the money was to be paid to Mr Justice
Tucker following Mr Nadir's successful departure from the UK.
One question for the police - emphasised by both Mr Scrivener and Mr Nadir
yesterday - is whether this was sufficient to justify making the allegations
in court.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Redwood stems NHS controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, the Welsh secretary, moved swiftly yesterday to defuse a
cabinet row over bureaucracy in the National Health Service.
Mr Redwood was forced to contact Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, to explain remarks he was said to have made in a briefing for
journalists on Tuesday.
He was reported to have said that there was 'restlessness' among Welsh
medical staff 'about the number of men in grey suits'. He was also said to
have complained that the government's NHS reforms had led to the appointment
of 1,500 more administrators in Wales in the last three years and only 20
more doctors.
Mr Redwood said last night that much of what he was reported to have said
was 'a lot of nonsense'. He said Mrs Bottomly was 'very happy' with the text
of his comments, which showed they were 'both pursuing very similar
policies'.
Mr Redwood's prompt move to smooth raised hackles means that Mrs Bottomley's
unhappiness about his blunt intervention in NHS matters is likely to abate.
The episode is an embarrassment to Mr Redwood, a standard bearer of the Tory
right who is one of the strongest supporters of the government's health
reforms.
The health department said there was no truth in claims that it was making
the NHS too bureaucratic. Officials said the elimination of regional health
authorities in the next two years and the creation of eight regional offices
inside a new management executive would reduce bureaucracy.
Meanwhile there were new calls yesterday for NHS executives to seek
private-sector finance for capital projects.
Mr Tom Sackville, parliamentary secretary for health, said that too few
hospital trusts and district health authorities were giving fair
consideration to private-sector alternatives when purchasing programmes.

FT  18 NOV 93 / TUC plans tough poaching fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS WILL face heavy fines from the TUC after the end of this month if
they poach members from one another, the TUC's employment policy committee
agreed yester-day.
The move, likely to be approved at next week's TUC general council meeting,
is an attempt to maintain harmony between unions after November 30. A
provision of the government's Trade Union Reform and Employments Right Act
comes into force at the end of the month, giving workers a legal right to
choose the union they wish to belong to - undermining the 1939 TUC
Bridlington agreement which aims to prevent unions competing for members.
Unions found by the TUC to be actively recruiting members from other unions
will have to pay compensation of up to two years' lost subscription for
every member recruited.
The union leaders have also agreed that legally qualified individuals will
in future chair the TUC disputes committees that deal with inter-union
poaching cases.
In the past the TUC could threaten recalcitrant unions with expulsion if
they poached members from other unions. The TUC believes it still has legal
power to require cash compensation from any union defying a TUC ruling over
poaching.
The TUC will not, however, be able to seek cash compensation from unions
which find themselves with additional members who have joined voluntarily
rather than being poached.
The TUC is concerned that if it does not introduce a new code of practice on
inter-union relations, backed up by financial sanctions, union members and
employers may run out of patience, sparking hostility over collective
bargaining. It fears this could encourage employers to derecognise unions.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Mates denies he talked to Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>

   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL MATES, former Northern Ireland minister, last night rejected
claims that he had talked to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, on
the government's behalf.
'It is absolutely untrue. I have never heard such complete rubbish,' said Mr
Mates.
Mr Mates was identified by a leading unionist politician as the previously
unnamed envoy alleged to have talked to Sinn Fein earlier this year.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, has bluntly denied that
any contacts have taken place with Sinn Fein, other than talks on local
issues with the party's elected representatives.
Both unionist and republican political leaders continue to claim privately,
however, that contacts took place until just before the Ulster Unionist
party agreed to support the government on the crucial Commons Maastricht
vote.
Republican sources say Sinn Fein was represented by Mr Martin McGuinness,
its vice-president, who is said to have close links with the IRA.
Mr Mates, who resigned as Northern Ireland security minister earlier this
year because of his involvement with Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Cypriot
businessman, said the allegations were 'black propaganda' put out by Sinn
Fein.
However, Mr Mates said: 'I suppose it is possible that some loony freelance
Tory backbencher could have gone and had a meeting without telling anybody
because you can never tell what loony Tory backbenchers are going to do.
'But I think I would have known about it if it had happened during my time
(at the Northern Ireland Office) because we have ways of knowing these
things.'
The impression that progress towards peace in Northern Ireland is
accelerating was reinforced yesterday by the UUP, which said it would
continue to support the government even if it had been having secret talks
with Sinn Fein. Mr Jim Wilson, UUP general secretary, said that in such
circumstances, relations with Mr John Major, the prime minister, would be
'severely strained', but the party would not withdraw its support.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said on a visit to the US that there
were 'grounds for hope and encouragement' in the offer made on Monday by Mr
Major to talk to Sinn Fein if the IRA lays down its arms. He also called for
'an urgent response' to peace plans from Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and Mr
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Vauxhall may drop union deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL, the motor manufacturer, is threatening to abandon its joint
negotiating agreement with unions and introduce a single union deal for its
9,000 manual workers.
The company is furious at the decision taken by the TGWU general union
locally to start an overtime ban from today at the company's Ellesmere Port
plant on Merseyside.
Postal voting has not yet been completed among Vauxhall's manual workers at
Luton - nor among members of the AEEU engineering and electrical union at
Ellesmere Port, where the TGWU held its ballot earlier.
The unions are balloting members on whether they would back industrial
action against the company's two-year 'final' pay offer of 2.5 per cent this
autumn with a further 3.0 per cent plus 1 per cent lump sum in September
1994.
In a letter sent earlier this week to the TGWU's regional office on
Merseyside Mr Bruce Warman, Vauxhall personnel director, said that the
union's unilateral action suggested that it wanted to abandon the joint
union machinery.
Mr Warman said: 'If it is your intention that from now on separate union
groups at each of our locations will take industrial action unilaterally
without any co-ordinated or formal response to Vauxhall through the joint
negotiating committee, then we on the management side must seriously
question the role and need for a joint negotiating committee.'
In response the TGWU on Merseyside has told the company that the early
action at Ellesmere Port is starting with shop steward approval because of
what the union calls 'unavoidable delays in collecting the information
required by the ballot scrutineers' in the rest of the company which
prevented co-ordination of voting across the Vauxhall plants.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Prison staff face ban on jobs action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans to raise the stakes in a confrontation with the Prison
Officers' Association today by seeking a High Court injunction banning the
traditionally militant union from taking industrial action.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will argue that as prison officers hold
the office of constable, industrial action involving breach of contract is
outside employment law. If the court endorses this view the union will be
prevented from taking most forms of industrial action at a time when it
feels threatened by the introduction of private prison management.
A ballot of the union's members approved action short of an all-out strike
over the government's market testing programme, which will extend private
management. The union is also protesting over the transfer of work to
support staff, as well as prison violence and overcrowding.
Industrial action started last week. There has been little disruption of the
service so far but the union plans to refuse to accept most new admissions
to prisons on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. This would mean up to 2,000
prisoners having to be held in police cells as an emergency measure.
Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, said the action
could represent a 'serious threat to the operation of the criminal justice
system and law and order'.
The home secretary will seek the injunction this afternoon unless the union
executive calls off the proposed disruption by midday. This appears
unlikely, however.
Mr Lewis said prison officers shared some rights of detention with police
officers and held the office of constable. According to his legal advice,
this meant they were not workers within the terms of the Trade Union and
Labour Relations Act. Their dispute was not a trade dispute as defined by
the act, and the union did not enjoy immunity under it. The union leadership
could not incite prison officers to breach their contracts of employment, Mr
Lewis said.
The union's leadership stood by its decision to call next week's action. Mr
John Bartell, chairman, described Mr Howard's proposed action as a 'cynical
attempt to neuter a union that is causing difficulties for the government'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Smith could face SNP challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSED boundary changes in Scottish constituencies could result in Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, having to contest a marginal seat at the next
general election.
Under proposals announced yesterday by Scotland's Boundary Commission Mr
Smith's Monklands East constituency near Glasgow would be reshaped and
become vulnerable to the Scottish National Party. A new seat of Cumbernauld
and Airdrie would take in areas of Cumbernauld, where the SNP is strong.
At last year's general election Mr Smith had a majority of 15,712.
The SNP calculated yesterday that ward - by - ward voting in last year's
district council elections in the proposed Cumbernauld and Airdrie
constituency gave the SNP 47.1 per cent of the vote against Labour's 45.2
per cent.
Mr Jack McConnell, secretary of the Labour party in Scotland, said that on
voting records going back for several years he was confident that Labour
would win the seat comfortably, 'especially with the leader of the party
standing'.
But Mr McConnell added that the proposed new boundaries for the area would
be challenged, resulting in a public inquiry, because they cut across
identifiable communities. The boundary commission might then have to come
forward with new proposals.
Under the commission's proposals Glasgow will lose one of its 11 seats, all
of which return Labour MPs. The commission has already proposed the creation
of an additional seat in Aberdeen, reflecting the fact that the population
of the Grampian region has risen while Glasgow's has declined.
The commission's proposals for the Ayr constituency mean that Mr Phil
Gallie, the sitting Tory MP whose majority is 85, would probably lose his
seat.

FT  18 NOV 93 / LDP members told to vote against reform proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERSHIP of Japan's divided opposition Liberal Democratic party
yesterday called on members to unite and vote against government plans to
clean up the scandal-ridden political system.
The call, by Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president, is unlikely to upset the
government's predicted victory in today's parliamentary vote to reform the
electoral system and curb political donations.
Political observers expect the proposals to get a four-to-five seat majority
today, after which they pass to the upper house, the final hurdle before
becoming law.
The upper house, where the seven-party coalition government also has a
majority, is expected to take about a month to clear the proposals.
Prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa had hoped to reach agreement with the LDP.
But he was forced to break with tradition and put the four reform bills to a
vote after negotiations broke down on Tuesday morning.
Later that day, the bills won a 20 to 19 majority in a parliamentary
committee, opening the way for them to proceed to the full house.
Despite Mr Kono's attempt to restore party discipline, more than 10 LDP MPs
are expected to vote for the government's plans.
Two to three times that number are thought to be considering leaving the
LDP, which has 227 seats in the 511-seat lower house. That would seriously
weaken the LDP, which ruled Japan for 38 years until last July.
The coalition looked set to hold together in today's vote, despite the fact
that amendments, made in an attempt to win LDP support, have offended some
members of the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member.
Socialist officials said three to four members might vote against the
government despite calls for party unity, but this would not be enough to
deprive the coalition of a majority.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Emperor's MP wants to keep multi-seat system unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KAORU YOSANO, a member of parliament for the Liberal Democratic party,
was an unhappy man yesterday .
Mr Yosano, 55, represents the central Tokyo district which includes
parliament and the emperor's palace. He is one of the mainstream of LDP
politicians who will today vote against the government's plans for political
reform.
Mr Yosano, winner of six elections and former vice-minister of the ministry
of international trade and industry, argues that the proposed shift from
multi-seat constituencies to single seats will worsen, rather than lessen,
the corruption which has discredited the political system.
'It's just going to accelerate hidden competition. Small boroughs are all
very well when each party has different policies. But the policies of the
LDP age have been carried over exactly by the the new government, so people
will find it very hard to differentiate between parties,' he says. This will
intensify what he euphemistically calls 'service competition'.
Instead, he would prefer the present multi-seat constituency system to
remain intact. Reform should, for the moment, be limited to a bill to curb
corruption, he believes. 'After all, it took Britain 400 years to bring
about political reform.'
The outlook for the opposition LDP is bleak, Mr Yosano admits. 'At least
half the party membership feels as I do, but we are being carried away by
the wave of the age ..It is too late to argue, so we will not argue any
more,' he says gloomily.
He knows the LDP will be outvoted in the lower house and fears it will lose
'almost all' its urban seats in the election to be held next year, if the
coalition manages to field single candidates under the new system.
Holders of large constituencies such as his own, which has more than 500,000
inhabitants, will find it particularly hard to raise enough campaign cash to
fight an election, under tough new curbs on political funding.
'Money will be very difficult to obtain from companies. So we will have to
rely more on personal donations, which will be difficult in the current
atmosphere in Japanese society,' he says, referring to the outrage aroused
by years of political corruption.
The average candidate needs Y30m (Pounds 188,600) to run a 14-day election
campaign, and far more to finance the months of preparation required, he
estimates. However, Mr Yosano is unwilling to put a figure on his own
election expenses. 'Do you want me to confess?' he laughs.
Mr Yosano plans, at least for the time being, to stay loyal to the party and
to his LDP faction, led by Mr Michio Watanabe, the veteran former foreign
minister who opposes reform.
But in the longer term, he admits he might have to rethink his loyalties.
'If there is a big earthquake, I have to escape one way or the other,' he
says.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Bolger to form a government but says 'I got the message':
PM's party scrapes home by one seat after New Zealand's voters show their
weariness with reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL and REUTER

<TEXT>
NEW Zealand's conservative National party yesterday secured the majority -
albeit a 'wafer-thin' one - that it needs to form a government and prime
minister Jim Bolger said he could govern for a full three-year term.
But he indicated that his government would slow down its reform programme,
saying the electorate had given the party a 'pretty clear message about what
it thought of them'.
The counting of special votes from absentee electors gave the National party
the one extra seat it needed for an overall majority, ending the political
stalemate created 11 days ago when a general election delivered a hung
parliament.
The vote count lifted National to 50 seats from 49 on election night in the
99-seat parliament, with the Labour opposition dropping to 45 from 46 and
the two minor parties steady on four seats.
Mr Bolger said he was delighted the stalemate was over but understood the
message voters sent his government when they cut its majority from 34 seats.
In an interview, he said he had repeatedly pointed out during the election
campaign that the government had completed most of its reform plans during
the past three years.
Mr Bolger indicated that, because of his party's small majority, he would
try to involve the opposition in some sort of consensus on policy, although
he said it would not be possible to 'run around' and consult them on every
issue.
'There will be some topics such as employment that we'll want to discuss
with them,' he said.
Financial markets echoed Mr Bolger's delight with the result. The New
Zealand dollar rose a full cent to USDollars 0.5500 and the share market
ended almost 5 per cent up on the day.
Last week both local and international investors reacted badly to the hung
parliament and the voters' decision to change to a proportional
representation electoral system.
The huge inroads into National's majority and support for the left-leaning
Alliance and populist New Zealand First parties were seen as a rebuff to
free-market policies that both National and Labour governments have pursued
since 1984.
The slender majority is expected to make for parliamentary difficulties for
Mr Bolger as opposition parties are expected to demand that National
provides a Speaker, who does not normally vote.
This would leave National with 49 voting MPs, the same as the opposition
parties. Under recent changes the Speaker can vote with the government on
minor matters but cannot support issues that he believes parliament as a
whole would not approve.
The leader of the Alliance, Mr Jim Anderton, said last night his party,
which won two seats, would honour its promise to support the government on
motions of confidence.
Labour leader Mr Mike Moore congratulated National on its win but said his
party would keep up pressure to moderate National party legislation on such
things as trade union legislation.
Mr Bolger last night refused to say whether the finance minister Ruth
Richardson would continue in the post in the new government. Both the
Alliance and Labour have criticised her 'New Right' views, and hinted that
they would have difficulty working with her in the new 'consensus' politics.
Ms Richardson says she wants to stay and Mr Bolger will have to take into
account her popularity in the financial markets.
Mr Bolger yesterday reversed his earlier decision not to attend the meeting
of Pacific Rim leaders at this week's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation
conference in Seattle.
He said he would fly to the conference today and return next Tuesday to form
his administration. He said he would not call parliament until immediately
before Christmas.
One of the biggest problems for the government over the next three years
will be potential rebellions by its own members, three of whom are known to
disagree strongly with a number of its policies.
Yesterday, in a hint of what may be to come, one of National's most
outspoken MPs, Michael Laws, threatened to resign if the government allowed
an apple exporting company, Applefields, to break the Apple and Pear Board's
monopoly on selling fruit overseas.
In what appeared to be a turnaround, the minister of agriculture John
Falloon said that a break in the monopoly would be against the interests of
apple exporters.

FT  18 NOV 93 / PLO financial crisis puts peace process in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE financial crisis in the Palestine Liberation Organisation could
jeopardise the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala),
the PLO economics chief, warned yesterday.
Mr Qurie said the PLO had been unable to meet its operating expenses for the
past five months, adding that the crisis has been absorbing the time of the
PLO leadership at the expense of work on implementing the peace process.
The strike at the PLO's Paris office during Mr Qurie's visit to the capital
illustrates the organisation's financial paralysis. All inquiries about the
visiting Palestinians were dealt with by the Israeli embassy.
'We are completely unable to face our commitments and obligations to our
embassies, departments and the institutions like universities, trade unions
and chambers of commerce which form the backbone of Palestinian social
life,' Mr Qurie said. 'And the crisis comes as we are facing the challenge
of creating new institutions for the peace. (Yassir) Arafat is finding its
difficult to lead the peace process in a courageous way when he cannot even
pay his bodyguards standing in the front of his office.'
Mr Qurie said the minimum annual operating budget of the PLO before the
peace agreement was Dollars 120m, but that the organisation was now
virtually bankrupt. Donors had made promises but had not yet delivered aid
for operating costs.
Mr Qurie, 56, an Arafat loyalist who was the key Palestinian negotiator in
the Oslo talks which produced the peace accord, said the PLO was determined
to lay the embryonic economic framework for an independent Palestinian
state.
'All the economic institutions will be the institutions of a sovereign state
but we will be realistic about what is possible today, tomorrow or the day
after tomorrow but the decisions of when to create the institutions will be
ours and will be made on financial and economic grounds,' he said.
Mr Qurie said the greatest challenge in the economic talks with Israel would
be a trade agreement which respected the Palestinian integration in the Arab
and Islamic world and particularly the PLO's intention to sign a free trade
agreement and open borders with Jordan.
Mr Qurie confirmed reports of a serious internal debate within the PLO over
the shape of the institutions that will handle the transition to
self-government in the occupied territories. The rift reportedly pits Mr
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the man who signed the peace accord in
Washington, and Mr Qurie against Mr Arafat who is reluctant to release his
absolute control over all PLO institutions or admit new professional people
who do not have a political background.
'Palestinians are now looking for clean institutions, more democracy,' he
said. 'We are coming to a new stage with new responsibilities and it is
normal that there will be different points of view. But it will be resolved
in a democratic way within the PLO.'
Mr Qurie is looking forward to returning to his home in Abu Dise, near East
Jerusalem, which he last visited in 1968. But like many PLO exiles who have
devoted most of their life to the bureaucratic work of the liberation
movement he admits little personal feelings. 'I am like all Palestinians in
exile who hope to go back to their land and live in peace, stability and
democracy.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Dawn of the new South Africa: Last-minute climbdown by De
Klerk seals deal on constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS BEEN one of the most extraordinary revolutions of modern times: a
negotiated revolution, which was sealed last night when South African
politicians put the final touches to a constitution to end 350 years of
minority government and replace it with majority rule.
After a dramatic last-minute capitulation, the ruling National party
accepted a provision of the constitution which effectively strips the white
minority of almost all entrenched powers in the proposed government of
national unity.
President F W de Klerk, who has promised since the day he took office that
he would never allow majority domination to replace minority rule, clearly
decided sometime on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning that voluntary
power-sharing was the way to achieve this - not the kind of entrenched
co-rule which his supporters have long been promised.
National party ministers will serve in the new cabinet, in proportion to
their share of the national vote in the April 27 elections; they may well
control pivotal ministries such as finance.
But when it comes to decision-making in cabinet, the president (likely to be
Mr Nelson Mandela of the ANC) will ultimately decide. He will try first to
seek consensus on his decisions 'in the spirit of national unity'; but when
the chips are down, his will shall prevail, and the National Party will be
powerless to stop him.
Until late on Tuesday night, Mr de Klerk had been insisting that this would
not be so: where consensus could not be reached in cabinet, a 2/3 vote would
be required to pass certain important decisions (this might have allowed the
National Party, with allies, blocking power). But in a late night meeting,
Mr Mandela apparently insisted that the ANC would accept only a 50 per cent
majority to break deadlocks - a figure they are almost certain to command -
and Mr de Klerk decided instead to drop percentage voting altogether, in
exchange for a commitment from Mr Mandela to a 'consensus-seeking spirit'.
National Party negotiators defended this deal, which was struck by exhausted
negotiators after weeks of almost sleepless nights. They acknowledge that
their role in cabinet will depend on the goodwill of Mr Mandela, and
repeatedly stress their reliance on the 'spirit of reconciliation' which has
developed, especially over the past year, between politicians from opposing
sides.
They believe the National Party does not need entrenched constitutional
provisions to play a powerful role in restraining the ANC: the ANC has
assured Mr de Klerk that it does not wish to govern alone (and does not
believe it could do so effectively); and he has accepted those assurances,
bolstered by his party's substantial power base in the civil service and
military, and in the electorate at large.
It is a gamble, but one which is probably inevitable: as a minority
government whose power diminishes by the day, negotiators clearly calculated
that a deal done now would be preferable to that available next month or
next year.
Only time will tell whether they are right to prefer a voluntary arrangement
to entrenchment of some powers for minorities; but precedents from the rest
of Africa suggest that powerful ruling parties tend to abuse their power,
unless forcefully prevented from so doing.
Mr de Klerk promised last week that 'only the National Party can stand fast
against the lust for power of the ANC'; that claim is substantially
undermined by last night's agreement, which could further strain National
Party support which stands at only 11 to 13 per cent in recent polls.
One political commentator assessed the deal in this way: 'If the ANC
believes the National Party are gatekeepers to white confidence, they'll
stick to the deal. If not, they won't. At the end of the day it will depend
on politics, not the rules.'
Negotiators argued last night that this much weakened form of power-sharing
is part of a larger package which provides other safeguards against the
abuse of power: a bill of rights, a second chamber in the legislature which
provides for regional representation, a guarantee that the government of
national unity will remain in force for five years, and agreement that a
final constitution (to replace the document now being finalised) must be
passed by at least a 60 per cent majority.
But overall, the National Party has settled well below its bottom line on
checks and balances. The party's 1991 constitutional proposals called for
political power to be divided between three tiers of government - central,
regional and local - with each tier to have 'original and entrenched
authority with which other tiers of government may not interfere'.
In fact, central government retains wide powers to 'interfere' with regional
governments: though the regions (to be called provinces) are to be granted
primary responsibility for areas such as primary and secondary education,
housing, health, policing, etc, central government reserves the right to
intervene in these areas to impose uniform national standards, to ensure
proper regulation, to protect the national economy or national security, and
where there are implications for national economic policy; in short, the
constitution authorises central government to intervene in terms so vague as
seriously to undermine regional autonomy. And with regions barred from
imposing taxes without central government approval, it is hard to accept Mr
de Klerk's claim that the new state will be 'federal'.
In the end, democracy in South Africa may well only be viable if the stakes
attached to winning or losing an election are reduced, and that can only
happen if losers continue to have a powerful say in government.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Pact ushers in government of national unity: New
constitution at a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER-SHARING
There will be a government of national unity, with a cabinet composed of all
parties winning more than 5 per cent of the national vote, allocated seats
proportionately. The president will be elected by the national assembly. The
first deputy president, who will act as prime minister, will come from the
majority party; there will be a second deputy president from the second
largest party (probably the National Party). Cabinet decisions will be by
consensus but where impossible, the president's view will prevail. The
principle of a government of national unity cannot be changed until 1999.
REGIONAL POWERS
The constitution provides for significant devolution of power to provincial
governments in areas such as education, health, welfare, policing, etc, but
central government reserves powers to intervene to impose uniform national
standards, to regulate provincial activities and where national economic
policy or security is affected. Provincial governments can impose no taxes
without national assembly approval though they will be guaranteed a share of
national revenue.
PARLIAMENT
Parliament will write a new constitution to replace yesterday's interim
constitution, and act simultaneously as the first non-racial legislature.
There will be two houses: a 400-member national assembly elected by
proportional representation from a party list, with half the representatives
from a national list and half from regional lists. In addition, there will
be a senate composed of 10 members from each of the 9 provinces, elected by
members of the provincial legislatures. When acting as a constituent
assembly, parliament will take decisions by two thirds majority and will be
constrained by constitutional principles set out in the interim
constitution. If the constituent assembly cannot agree by two thirds
majority within two years, there will be a referendum requiring a 60 per
cent vote. If this is not achieved the constituent assembly will continue
seeking agreement for a further three years with a 60 per cent majority
required. When acting as a legislature, a simple majority suffices though
constitutional amendments and bills affecting the powers of provincial
governments must pass by a two thirds majority of both houses.
PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES
Elections will be held simultaneously for provincial assemblies of 30-100
members elected by proportional representation from a party list. Provincial
assemblies may write a constitution for each province.
BILL OF RIGHTS
Fundamental human rights will be protected under an interim bill of rights
which permits, though it does not enforce, affirmative action and promises
'just and equitable' compensation in the event of expropriation of property.
Compensation disputes will be settled by the courts, taking into account
market value of property, its use and the history of its acquisition.
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES
Enshrine basic principles under which the new constitution must be written:
these include independence of the judiciary, devolution of power to
provincincial government, and basic human rights.
LANGUAGE
South Africa is to have 11 official languages, but in practice English is
likely to be the language of government.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government will be transformed more slowly than national government.
Local negotiating forums or 'councils of local unity' will oversee the
two-year transition to local government elections, with the rights of
property owners even after elections protected by a formula which ensures
that whites will have disproportionate representation.
CIVIL SERVICE
Pensions of civil servants will be protected in exchange for a deal to bring
blacks into the top echelons.

FT  18 NOV 93 / UN to end hunt for Aideed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UN Security Council voted unanimously early yesterday to call off the
hunt for General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali warlord whose followers
were blamed for attacks on international peacekeepers. The decision was in
response to an abrupt shift in US policy after 17 American soldiers were
killed on October 3 in a clash with Gen Aideed's forces.
Adml Jonathan Howe, UN special representative in Somalia, had offered a
Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 16,778) reward for capture of the warlord. Without
naming Gen Aideed, the resolution sought suspension of 'arrest actions
against those who might be implicated,' pending a report that will determine
responsibility for repeated attacks on UN troops.
Mrs Madeleine Albright, the US delegate, said the goal now must be to foster
a political dialogue leading to national reconciliation. Gen Aideed had
refused to co-operate in peace-making efforts while a wanted man and the
council now hopes he will change his mind.
Seven Nigerians and 34 Pakistanis serving with the force have also been
killed in attacks by Somalis.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERIM government of Nigeria yesterday moved its talks with the unions
from Lagos to Abuja, in a bid to end a general strike over higher fuel
prices. The military-appointed government is expected to offer public-sector
workers a rise in transport allowances to offset higher living costs.
Last week it imposed a 600 per cent increase in fuel prices, which it says
is necessary to wipe out public-sector deficits and restore the state-owned
refineries to working order.
The Nigeria Labour Congress' strike call has been largely ignored in the
north, where fuel prices have been high for over a year.
The main impact of the strike has been on public transport, domestic
airlines, manufacturing industry, the port at Lagos and the big banks. Banks
and shops were closed in many states yesterday and traffic remained light.
There has been no disruption to oil production. 'My union will strike when
the time is right,' said Mr Frank Kokori, head of Nupeng, the oil workers'
union.' The fuel price is a sideshow, the real issue is Nigeria's political
instability.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United States warned yesterday that it would recommend United Nations
action against North Korea if Pyongyang refused to allow its nuclear
facilities to be inspected and to resume dialogue on nuclear issues with
South Korea.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said in a speech at the
University of Washington in Seattle: 'We are prepared to recommend that the
UN security council consider options other than negotiation.'
He urged North Korea to 'join the community of responsible nations'.
Describing North Korea as 'caught in a time warp', he said: 'It is the most
isolated country in the world, unmoved by the winds of change that have
swept across the region.'
However, he said the US remained committed to a diplomatic solution and that
UN action could be avoided if Pyongyang fulfilled its commitments under the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and under its denuclearisation agreement
with Seoul.
Mr Christopher, who is host at the ministerial meeting of the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation grouping which got under way last night, highlighted
North Korea as the most serious security risk in Asia.
However, he noted that 'while the tensions of the cold war have subsided,
many Asian nations harbour apprehensions about their closest neighbours'.
The US was committed to remaining engaged in Asia in order to limit such
concerns, he said. 'It remains in our unambiguous national interest to deter
regional aggression and to sustain Asia-Pacific economic growth.'
The US, he said, would 'maintain our forward military presence throughout
the Pacific.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Housing market recovers strongly: US figures reflect fall in
mortgage rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A STRONG recovery is under way in the US housing market following reductions
in mortgage rates this year to the lowest level in two decades, figures
indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department said housing starts rose by 2.7 per cent last month
and by 14 per cent in the year to October. Officials revised up already
strong figures for starts in August and September. Building permits also
rose, pointing to continued strength of starts.
Most analysts expected only a marginal increase in starts last month given
big increases earlier this autumn. Starts are now running at an annual rate
of 1.4m, the highest level since February 1990, when the previous business
cycle was approaching its peak.
Most of the strength was concentrated in 'single family' homes, which rose
5.8 per cent from September. Construction of apartments remains subdued,
reflecting overbuilding in the 1980s and fewer young people seeking first
homes.
The increase in starts was strongest in the Midwest, where rebuilding after
flooding contributed to a 13.3 per cent increase from September. Starts rose
only modestly in the west, because the Californian economy remains
depressed, and fell in the northeast. The starts figures are the latest in a
series of economic statistics indicating that the pace of US economic growth
is accelerating after a weak first half.
Starting in the new year, changes in the way the US Labour Department
estimates unemployment will increase the official jobless rate
significantly. On the new definition, the jobless rate averaged 7.6 per cent
in the year to August, compared with the published figure of 7.1 per cent.
Officials said the female jobless rate had been seriously under-estimated
because many women seeking work had been wrongly classified as 'homemakers'.
Using the revised series, the female jobless rate was 6.8 per cent in the
year to August, not 6 per cent as previously reported.
The new unemployment series is likely to increase concern on Capitol Hill
about lack of job opportunities and harden opposition to any early move by
the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
The new series will come into effect with the release on February 4 of
unemployment figures for January and could increase the January jobless rate
by anything from 0.1 to 1 percentage point.

BOLIVIA'S government and unions have defused a conflict over the firing of
state workers and agreed to resume talks on how to sort out the country's
problems, officials said, Reuters reports from La Paz.
The agreement came after eight weeks of growing labour unrest which peaked
in a national strike on Monday.
The deal was signed on Tuesday just hours after Bolivia's trades union
federation, the COB, voted to suspend their indefinite strike which began at
midnight on Sunday.
The new centrist government, which had said it would not negotiate while the
strike was on, agreed in return to reinstate 1,100 out of 10,000 workers
sacked as part of plans to modernise the economy.

</HEADLINE>

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STABILITY and economic growth in Latin America is changing the way the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US political risk insurer, does
business in the continent, according to Mrs Ruth Harkin, Opic president.
The organisation, 40 per cent of whose activity is in Latin America, plans
to shift from insurance towards loans, raising the amount available for loan
guarantees from Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m) for each project to Dollars 200m.
This will enable it to become involved in large projects such as the planned
Argentina-Chile gas pipeline.
Compared with much of the group's portfolio, such as the former Soviet Union
and Gaza Strip, 'this region begins to look stable,' Mrs Harkin said. 'There
is going to be less demand for insurance coverage but more for loan
guarantees.'
The organisation expects to offer at least Dollars 1.7bn in insurance, loan
guarantees and equity to support US private investment projects in Latin
America this fiscal year, against Dollars 1.4bn in 1992-93. The figure could
be 'significantly higher,' Opic said.
'In Latin America our relationship has matured and we feel comfortable about
expanding and changing our role,' added Mrs Harkin, who is leading an Opic
mission to Brazil, Argentina and Chile focusing on environmentally-related
business.
The Opic delegation, sponsored by 20 US companies including Chase Manhattan
Bank, is the first to focus specifically on the environment, a sector
growing by 25 per cent a year.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Mexico's intellectuals win back tax breaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S intellectuals have won a remarkable victory over the hardline
technocrats in the finance ministry by gaining exemption from taxes on their
artistic work.
President Carlos Salinas ruled in favour of the intellectuals on the eve of
the US congressional vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement,
doubtless hoping that Mexico's cultural elite would support him in his
continuing quest to integrate Mexico with the US.
Since the 1910 revolution, Mexico's writers and artists have had a strong
hold on the country's political conscience. But their tax break was
abolished in 1990 by Mr Pedro Aspe, the orthodox finance minister, and a
fervent opponent of tax advantages for special interest groups.
Ever since, intellectuals from right and left have fought for restoration of
the exemption, which they believe is their historic right.
The tax break will help 'artistic creation in Mexico, and that strengthens
Mexican culture and national identity', a presidential spokesman said. 'It
is important for a country to stick to its identity and be close to its
roots, especially in times of transformation.'
The measure was backed by Nobel prize-winner Octavio Paz and the novelist
Carlos Fuentes, who agree on little else but their right to be exempt from
taxes.
The writers objected not just to paying the government money, but to filling
in long and complicated tax forms. 'It will help my mental stability,' said
Mr Carlos Monsivais, a leading left-wing essayist. 'I live in fear of the
tax collectors. I spent one year trying to understand my forms and could
not. I could not sleep.'
A presidential aide sympathised, and said Mexican writers were not meant to
understand tax forms. 'This will put them in a better mood and unleash their
creative energies,' he said.
'The creators and authors have to steal time from nowhere to produce a poem,
a work of history, a novel,' said Mr Enrique Krauze, the conservative
historian who usually supports free market economics.
'As an editor, or if I give a conference, I pay taxes. But if my work sells
a book, I will not pay taxes, as has historically and traditionally occurred
in Mexico.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / Nicaragua breaks aid logjam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAVID SCANLAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MANAGUA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nicaraguan government has agreed under pressure from the International
Monetary Fund to take measures to raise tax revenues or cut spending,
breaking a logjam which had been holding up flows of official finance to the
country.
This initial agreement with the fund immediately paves the way for finance
from the Inter-American Development Bank and Taiwan totalling about Dollars
55m (Pounds 36.9m). It also clears the way for the arrival next week of a
team from the IMF, to negotiate Dollars 25m in concessional funding, and the
World Bank.
The IMF has been seeking government savings, either spending cuts or revenue
increases, equal to 4 per cent of GDP. Earlier disagreements with the World
Bank and IADB, which both saw this as too tight a policy for a war-damaged
economy with single-digit inflation, seem to have been resolved.
If the IMF agrees to provide finance, under an Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility used mainly by poor countries in Africa, it will clear
the way for funds from the World Bank totalling some Dollars 60m, some
possible US finance, and some tied aid.
Nicaragua's foreign exchange reserves had fallen close to zero, with imports
of around Dollars 800m a year running at four times the level of exports.
Inflows of official finance are essential to replenish reserves, since
private investment is almost non-existent, because of the impossibility of
enforcing property rights.
Despite the advances in the negotiations, questions remain about the ability
of President Violeta Chamorro's government to deliver on its promises. An
earlier attempt to levy a vehicle tax was reversed this year after
widespread protests.
The government has been seeking, so far unsuccessfully, to include
representatives of the left-wing Sandinistas, the former guerrillas defeated
in a 1990 election, in the negotiations with the IMF and World Bank.
Mrs Chamorro's government has been paralysed by the collapse of the
conservative UNO coalition which swept her to power in 1990. The US
suspended aid to Nicaragua last summer because of the continued heavy
involvement in government of the Sandinistas, described by one US official
as running a 'state within a state'.
More recently, the Sandinistas have attacked government plans to privatise
several public utilities and Mrs Chamorro's insistence that Mr Humberto
Ortega, brother of former Sandinista president Mr Daniel Ortega, step down
next year as head of the military.
The Sandinistas are also unlikely to find the IMF proposals acceptable. They
have been seeking a relaxation of credit constraints which would
particularly affect agriculture, and benefit, not coincidentally, many
Sandinistas.
The Chamorro government has had startling success against inflation,
bringing it down to single digits from an annual 33,600 per cent in 1988 and
13,500 per cent in 1990. But with unemployment as high as 60 per cent and
poverty worse than anywhere in the Americas except Haiti, austerity is
unpopular. 'We have just emerged from a decade of war. This policy ignores
that,' said Mr Oscar Rene Vargas, an economist in Managua.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Apec nations at odds over stance on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and ALEX NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE and foreign ministers from the Pacific region gathered in Seattle
yesterday for their annual Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting still
divided over how far to go in their efforts to kickstart the Uruguay Round
of global trade negotiations.
Apec officials said they had still not resolved whether the ministers should
simply issue a statement calling for a successful agreement to liberalise
rules on trading and investment within the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, or should show their commitment to breaking the logjam at the Gatt
talks in Geneva more forcibly by offering further tariff cuts.
'The clearest demonstration would be the collective willingness to go the
extra mile and put additional tariff reduction offers on the table in
Geneva,' said Mr Tony Miller, Hong Kong's director-general of trade.
Mr Richard Nottage, New Zealand's secretary of foreign affairs and trade,
said that it would be difficult to get any hard-edged commitments into an
Apec declaration, but that member countries might give private indications
to each other about where their negotiators would be willing to move in
Geneva.
Mr Peter Cook, the Australian minister for trade negotiations, said he would
like to be able to include specific offers to give a significant push to the
Gatt negotiations, but acknowledged that it 'may not be possible to get a
completely itemised statement'.
Senior officials from the Apec countries have been holding talks in Seattle
since the weekend to prepare the ground for the meeting, but had not been
able to resolve this issue before their ministers arrived for an opening
dinner last night and the start of serious discussions this morning.
The Apec meeting is taking place at a critical moment for world trading
negotiations, coming immediately after last night's vote in the US Congress
on the North American Free Trade Agreement and less than a month before
President Bill Clinton's fast-track negotiating authority for the Uruguay
Round expires on December 15.
At the least, officials said they expected the ministerial meeting to issue
a declaration urging more progress on the Gatt talks.
Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, said: 'It is the
view of Apec senior officials that substantial impetus needs to be given to
the Round in order for it to be concluded by the deadline of December 15. 'I
expect a declaration on the Uruguay Round. I would hope and expect that that
declaration would be extremely strong.'
Nevertheless, some officials acknowledged that anything Apec might say or do
would be largely peripheral to the main issues that are still holding up
conclusion of the Round, many of which lie between the US and the European
Union.
Some countries left out of Apec have questioned whether Mr Clinton's new
emphasis on building trading ties to the Asia Pacific region represented an
effort to build a fortress-like trading bloc incompatible with Gatt's
multilateral approach.
But US officials say a strengthened Apec would be 'a building block, not a
trading bloc'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Investment and trade co-operation boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS from 15 Pacific countries yesterday agreed on a new trade and
investment framework which will mark a modest step towards closer
co-operation without setting the stage for creation of an Asian trade bloc.
A declaration expected to be approved by trade and foreign ministers of the
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group, who began their annual meeting
last night, will establish a permanent committee on trade and investment.
Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, said the new
framework 'will take Apec beyond its current role as a facilitation and
co-operation forum to a policy-making role, to be expanded through
consultation and consensus by its members'. The committee, she said, would
be charged with finding 'ways to expand trade, create a more attractive
investment climate and facilitate the flow of goods, capital and technology
across the region'.
Mr Kim Chulsu, South Korea's trade minister, said: 'This is a mandate for a
more active approach to advancing regional co-operation.'
However, according to participants, the discussions on the new framework
revealed vigorous disagreement about Apec's future role, some members
favouring creation of formal, bureaucratic structures in which to discuss
trade liberalisation and others - apparently a majority - preferring to
maintain a more liberal, informal approach.
The resulting declaration will represent only a mild institutionalisation of
Apec. Mr Tony Miller, Hong Kong's director-general of trade, said it 'binds
nobody but sets out a collective view.' One of Apec's advantages over other
bodies, he said, was its informal atmosphere.
An Australian official said the new committee was 'a step of considerable
significance' although he conceded that 'to an outsider it might not seem to
amount to much'. He said the idea had been too sensitive to raise when Apec
was founded only four years ago. The committee's work would include
harmonisation of customs procedures, a database of regional tariffs, and a
study of investment regulations.
Differences of view over Apec's future role were also evident in the
officials' discussions on a report by an eminent persons group headed by Mr
Fred Bergsten, a US economist. The report, to be submitted to the
ministerial meeting, sets out a series of steps towards creation of a
Pacific economic community.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Kantor expects Gatt progress
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Seattle summit of the 15-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum
will produce 'concrete' offers for the bargaining table in Geneva which will
help the Uruguay Round towards a successful conclusion by December 15, Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said yesterday.
In high spirits and confident of approval by the House of Representatives of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr Kantor said an administration
victory on Nafta would provide President Bill Clinton with 'the moral and
political authority to go to the Apec and work with his counterparts - and
they will respond'.
He said he expected further momentum to come from his meetings with Sir Leon
Brittan, the European Union's chief trade negotiator, in Washington next
week. 'We will get a Uruguay Round (deal),' he said.
Mr Kantor said the US was taking the leadership on trade 'to grow the world
economy' and would continue to do so. Vital to this was Mr Clinton's belief
in the link between US economic and national security and between both of
those and trade.
Mr Kantor was optimistic about US relations with France, which are vitally
important to final agreement. He said one 'big mistake' the previous
administration had made was in not directly engaging with the French. He,
himself, has twice met French officials in the past month.
'They have their own interests,' he said. 'We cannot question their
motivations. We may disagree with their conclusions, but we don't
personalise this.'
In Geneva it has been presumed that the Clinton administration has been
distracted by the Nafta battle. Mr Kantor, however, insisted that US
officials have been 'busily engaged' in Geneva.
Other US officials say the numerous side deals which gave dozens of
congressmen the political cover to support Nafta are not likely to impede
progress in Gatt. For example, President Clinton was pressed to seek a
15-year phase-out of textile quotas rather than the 10-year period contained
in the negotiating text.
In a letter to textile interests, the president ultimately promised to
'achieve the longest possible phase-out' and to ask Mr Kantor to explore the
prospect of a 15-year phase-out with nations believed to favour it.
Mr Clinton promised to ensure that the impact of the Uruguay Round was eased
as far as possible, 'including specifically addressing the question of
gradual and even staging of tariff reductions and quota integration'.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: US waves sanctions stick at the Chinese -
Clinton and Jiang to meet at Apec talks

<TEXT>
US officials insist they are ready to impose trade penalties on China even
though President Bill Clinton has adopted a new policy of closer engagement
with Beijing.
Mr Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, listed three areas
of trade negotiations in which the US expected China to take action in the
near future: market access, textiles, and intellectual property rights.
These issues and China's growing trade surplus with the US were due to be
raised yesterday by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, with Mr
Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, as part of a series of bilateral
meetings taking place during the annual ministerial meeting in Seattle of
the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping.
Trade issues, as well as human rights and nuclear non-proliferation, are
also likely to be raised tomorrow when Mr Clinton meets President Jiang
Zemin in Seattle.
A senior administration official said, however, that the Seattle meetings
would not be negotiations but an opportunity to explain Mr Clinton's new
two-pronged approach to China: that the US recognised China's importance and
did not wish it to be isolated, but that serious points of disagreement
needed to be addressed.
The official said: 'We can either stand outside and lob our concerns over
the wall, or we can engage face to face with the Chinese leadership and make
clear that we recognise that China is a great country with enormous
potential, but that for our relationship to continue to progress there has
to be sensitivity on their part to the concerns that we have.'
Mr Christopher, in a speech last night at the University of Washington, said
the US was willing to negotiate conditions under which it would lift
sanctions imposed over China's sale of missile components to Pakistan.
This was part of the new US policy of deeper engagement with China, of which
the goal was 'to build a comprehensive relationship that permits the
resolution of our differences'. However, unless there was significant
progress on human rights, Mr Clinton would not be able to renew China's
most-favoured nation trading status next year. He hoped that a recent
Chinese offer to open its prisons to the International Red Cross was 'a
harbinger of sustained progress'.
Ms Barshefsky said that on market access, China had agreed last year to
reduce import restrictions but its 'offers. . . . have been inadequate'. The
US would take action after December 31 if its requirements were not met.
On renewal of a bilateral textile accord which also expires December 31, she
said recent discussions had been more productive. However, agreement
required significant movement by China, and the US was prepared to take
unilateral action.
On intellectual property rights, Beijing had enacted a 'world class' series
of laws 'but there is no enforcement', Ms Barshefsky said. 'This is a very
urgent issue which requires immediate attention by the Chinese,' she said,
referring in particular to pirating of compact discs.

backfire - Other nations threaten to withdraw market-opening offers

US STRONG-ARM tactics to press other countries to open their markets to
trade in financial services are in danger of backfiring, as Uruguay Round
negotiators in Geneva threatened this week to react by entirely withdrawing
conditional market-opening offers.
'Other countries are simply going to follow the US lead and withdraw their
offers in financial services,' a senior negotiator in the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade said yesterday.
'It would be absurd for the US to throw everything aside because of problems
it has with a tiny number of developing countries whose share of financial
services business worldwide is negligible.'
US banks, brokerages, and insurance companies would be among the main
beneficiaries worldwide of more open financial services markets and so would
be main casualties if market-opening offers were withdrawn.
US officials have aroused controversy in the final stages of negotiation of
the Uruguay round talks on world trade liberalisation by demanding an
exemption in financial services from the obligation to offer most favoured
nation status to all-comers.
The US plans to restrict full MFN access to its financial services markets
to a small group of industrial countries that have similarly liberal banking
and securities regimes. Other countries will have MFN rights limited to the
rights that exist at present. Improved access would depend on progress in
liberalisation in their own market.
Observers have interpreted the move as a US effort to win improved
market-opening offers from countries like Japan, Korea, India, Singapore,
Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.
'The US wants its cake, and wants to eat it too,' said one Asian negotiator
said: 'It wants other countries to accept multilateral obligations to open
their financial services markets, but wants to reserve its power to exert
bilateral pressure. If it does not change its mind, we would have no choice
but to do the same.'
A senior Indian diplomat noted: 'Just as the US is getting vastly improved
offers in financial services, it is putting everything in jeopardy with
their two-tier MFN proposal.'
Many countries see the US threats as no threat at all: they see no prospect
of seeking a presence in the US banking, securities or insurance markets,
and are offering to open their financial services sectors as a necessary
price for better access to US and EU markets for products like textiles and
farm goods. As it has become increasingly clear that the US and EU are
unlikely to improve offers in these areas, so developing countries have
become more reluctant to keep financial services offers on the table.
A spokeswoman for the US Coalition of Services Industries, which has lobbied
hard for the past six years for a big financial services package in the
Uruguay round, said yesterday that she was 'surprised and disappointed' by
responses: 'We have been very flexible, and have changed course as the world
has said it is unable to live with the proposals the US has put forward. It
is late in the day to be doing this kind of thing, and I am not sure what
pulling offers off the table will accomplish.'

ROLLS-ROYCE, the British engineering group, yesterday won a Pounds 275m
order for a power station in the Indian state of West Bengal.
It was the company's third Indian contract signed this week and brought the
total to Pounds 660m.
The contracts have been completed during a week of British business events
in Bombay attended by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. Other companies
which announced commercial agreements yesterday included British Gas, the
PowerGen generating company, and Aerospace Composite Technologies, a high
technology materials manufacturer, which won an order for replacement
windscreens for India's Russian-built MiG-21 fighter aircraft.
Rolls-Royce is to manage the construction of a 500MW coal-fired plant at
Balagarh and supply generators from the UK for the Calcutta Electric Supply
Corporation, an affiliate of the Calcutta-based R P Goenka business group.
The total turnkey contract will be carried out by Rolls-Royce Power
Generation Systems, part of Parsons Turbine Generators based in Newcastle
upon Tyne, on behalf of CESC of Calcutta.
Parsons will supply two 250MW steam generators for the three-year project,
located on an island in the Hoogli River.
Yesterday's news follows Tuesday's announcement by Rolls-Royce Industrial
Power Group of two Indian power station projects worth Pounds 385m. Under
these contracts the company will build a 200MW gas-fired combined cycle
plant at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, and participate in a new company,
Chandil Power, to build and operate a 500MW coal-fired power station at
Chandil in Bihar.
The three contracts give Parsons a total of five new turbine generators to
build, providing work into 1996 for the company's present 2,500 employees.
All three turnkey contracts will be carried out by Rolls-Royce Power
Generation Systems.
Rolls-Royce and Goenka have also established a joint venture company to
manage the refurbishment of existing power stations, many of which operate
far below capacity.
PowerGen agreed a similar venture with Aditya Birla, a diversified
industrial group led by Mr Aditya Birla, which will bid to build new plants
as well as upgrade existing ones.
British Gas signed co-operation agreements with the government's Oil and
Natural Gas Commission covering technical aspects of oil and gas development
in India and possible joint exploration overseas.
Zeneca, the chemicals company, established a joint venture with ITC, the
Indian affiliate of BAT Industries, for a seed technology company.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Greece revives project to build alumina
plant

GREECE'S new Socialist government is reviving a much-delayed project to
build a Dollars 500m alumina plant in central Greece, using Russian
technology and equipment.
The plant at Thisbe, 120km from Athens, would produce 600,000 tonnes of
alumina a year from locally-mined bauxite to supply aluminium plants in
Russia.
The industry ministry wants private investors to take a 10 per cent stake in
the project. A group of state-owned Russian companies, including several
aluminium smelters, would have a 51 per cent stake, with the remainder held
by a Greek state company.
The ministry said it was reappointing as its advisers Salomon Brothers of
the US, which worked on the project under the previous conservative
government.
The project was halted two years ago because of financing problems.
Construction of a port for the plant on the Gulf of Corinth near the site
was completed but work on the processing facility failed to start because of
financing problems.
